    "### Quick theory\n",
    "Just like the Actor-Critic method, we have two networks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Actor - It proposes an action given a state.\n",
    "* Critic - It predicts if the action is good (positive value) or bad (negative value) given a state and an action.\n",
    "\n",
    "DDPG uses two more techniques not present in the original DQN:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Uses two Target networks.\n",
    "        Why? Because it add stability to training. In short, we are learning from estimated targets and Target networks are updated slowly, hence keeping our estimated targets stable.Conceptually, this is like saying, \"I have an idea of how to play this well, I'm going to try it out for a bit until I find something better\", as opposed to saying \"I'm going to re-learn how to play this entire game after every move\". See this StackOverflow answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Uses Experience Replay.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Losses:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Critic loss** - Mean Squared Error of y - Q(s, a) where y is the expected return as seen by the Target network, and Q(s, a) is action value predicted by the Critic network. y is a moving target that the critic model tries to achieve; we make this target stable by updating the Target model slowly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Actor loss** - This is computed using the mean of the value given by the Critic network for the actions taken by the Actor network. We seek to maximize this quantity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence we update the Actor network so that it produces actions that get the maximum predicted value as seen by the Critic, for a given state.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initialization:\n",
    "The initialization for last layer of the Actor must be between -0.003 and 0.003 as this prevents us from getting 1 or -1 output values in the initial stages, which would squash our gradients to zero, as we use the tanh activation."
