156364,377880,NRG,Is NRG Energy Stock a Buy ,news,"While shares of NRG Energy  NYSE NRG  bounced around a bit last year  the stock only managed to eke out a 0 4  gain  Meanwhile  given its meager dividend  the total return wasn t much better at 0 7   The company significantly underperformed the S P 500  which generated a 31 5  total return 
With the stock delivering such poor relative performance last year  investors might be wondering whether this energy company is now an attractive buy  Here s a look at the case for an against buying shares of NRG Energy these days 

The bull case for NRG Energy
NRG Energy has spent the past few years repositioning its business  It has sold several assets  which have helped shore up its balance sheet  giving it the financial flexibility to invest in growth  It finished up its transformation last year  which sets 2020 up as an inflection point for the company  
The electric and gas company expects to allocate about 50  of its free cash flow on expansion related initiatives in the future while returning the other half to investors  It plans to significantly increase its dividend  from its previous annual rate of  0 12 per share to  1 20 per share this year  which will boost its yield from 0 3  to about 3 2   It also expects to use some of its cash flow to repurchase shares  The company s capital allocation plan  which will grow earnings while at the same time reducing its outstanding share count  should enable it to increase its reset dividend by 7  to 9  per year after 2020  
The company s growth focused investments should begin paying dividends this year  In its view  its earnings will increase by about 2 6  from the midpoint of its current forecast ranges  while free cash flow will grow by roughly 6   Given that outlook  the company currently trades at around eight times both projections  That s a low value  especially since other companies operating in the power sector trade at more than 20 times earnings after their stocks surged last year 
The bear case for NRG Energy
Electric and gas companies have traditionally offered investors high dividend yields  That s because the typical utility pays out about 70  of its earnings each year on average  They use the 30  they retain  along with additional debt and stock sales  to finance growth  NRG Energy  on the other hand  is taking a much different approach  Instead of catering to income focused investors  the company is aiming to generate higher total returns by retaining more cash to fund growth as well as returning money to investors through share repurchases instead of a bigger dividend  The concern is that the company s lower yield could turn off income seeking investors  causing its stock to perpetually trade at a discounted price 
Another thing that differentiates NRG Energy from others in the sector is its focus on the retail electric and natural gas segment  which markets energy directly to consumers  The company recently bolstered this business by acquiring Steam Energy  which has more than 600 000 customers in nine states  Retail earnings  however  can be more volatile since demand can fluctuate with the weather and prices  and customers can easily switch to new service providers  
Verdict  Not compelling enough for income seeking investors
NRG Energy isn t like most utilities  Instead of operating the poles  wires  and pipes that distribute electric and gas to consumers  it focuses on selling those commodities directly to retail customers  Therefore  its earnings could potentially be more volatile  Add that to a capital allocation program featuring a lower dividend payout  and the stock isn t overly appealing for income focused investors who favor lower risk options ",2020-01-15,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pidy0,2060128

156427,377943,NRG,NRG sheds U S  power plants to focus on retail customers,news," Reuters    U S  power company  NRG Energy Inc   N NRG  wants to boost the size of its retail business as it sheds more than half of its power plants  Chief Executive Mauricio Gutierrez told Reuters 
 NRG started as a generation company that moved into retail and some people still think of NRG in terms of  power plants    Gutierrez said 
 But when you think about NRG in the future  I invite you to think about the company in terms of the number of customers we serve   he said  NRG serves around three million homes and businesses 
In the past  NRG racked up billions of dollars of debt by diving into the renewable energy business at the same time U S  power prices sank as cheap and abundant natural gas from shale formations flooded the market 
Concern about those debts  among other things  led NRG to replace its former CEO David Crane in 2015 and to ultimately agree to sell most of its renewable portfolio  held by its stake in NRG Yield Inc  N NYLDa   to Global Infrastructure Partners in February 
That deal  along with the sale of some coal and gas plants in Louisiana and Texas and other assets will provide the company with about  3 billion in proceeds and remove around  7 billion in debt  NRG said 
In addition to the asset sales  NRG s GenOn unit is working through bankruptcy proceedings that will see the unit separated from NRG  taking with it much of the company s coal fired plants 
Gutierrez said he expects the sale of NRG Yield and separation of GenOn to occur in the fourth quarter 
Those transactions will cut NRG s generation portfolio from over 50 000 megawatts in 2015  before Gutierrez started transforming the company  to around 24 000 MW  One megawatt can power about 1 000 homes 
 When I became CEO  it was clear we were trying to be too many things to too many people   Gutierrez said in a letter to shareholders on Wednesday 
He wants to grow the retail business  especially in the Northeast where NRG still has more generation than it needs to serve customers 
Gutierrez said he wants to increase the size of the retail business through organic growth  but will consider acquisitions if the right opportunity presents itself  like its purchase of retail provider Xoom Energy earlier this year 
 Our retail business is going to inform the size of our generation business   Gutierrez said

156529,378045,NRG,Big oil  small U S  towns see new reward in old production technique,news,"By Ernest Scheyder HOBBS  New Mexico  Reuters    Amid the frenetic activity of American shale oilfields recovering from a two year recession sit a handful of oil towns that seemed impervious as many producers went into bankruptcy and the economy around them sank  Occidental Petroleum Corp  N OXY  and a few other oil producers with wells near this town on New Mexico s border with Texas steadily pumped low cost oil through the downturn  using a technique that has been heralded worldwide as a way to reduce carbon emissions and boost oil output   When everyone else in the oil industry was going down  Oxy kept working   said Joshua Grassham  vice president of Lea County State Bank and a Hobbs Chamber of Commerce board member  The city of 35 000 rests on the Permian oilfield  the largest oilfield in the United States  This way of drilling brings with it a sweetener for the oil industry to keep crude flowing  a tax credit that helps insulate these wells in a downturn  and could triple in size if Congress approves a new measure this summer   Such a move could extend by decades the producing life of hundreds more wells  increasing oil supply which would be a drag on prices  To date  the technique has been employed only at conventional oilfields  rather than on shale deposits  Some firms are studying how to put the technique to work in shale drilling  too  The drilling method harnesses the carbon dioxide produced during the extraction of oil or from power plants  and forces it back into the fields  That boosts the pressure underground and drives more oil to the surface   Their success could be replicated in oilfields across the United States if Congress approves the measure  which already enjoys broad bipartisan support  While the Trump administration has yet to say whether it supports the tax credit increase  the measure could also be a boon to the coal industry  which Trump wants to revitalize  The technique  one of several so called enhanced oil recovery  EOR  strategies used to prolong the productive lifespan of oilfields and increase output  underpins around five percent of U S  oil output  or about 450 000 barrels per day  according to energy consultancy Advanced Resources International   EOR can help firms to produce between 30 percent and 60 percent of all the oil held in a reservoir  That s far more than the 10 percent usually recovered from initial traditional drilling  according to the Department of Energy  The existing credit has provided a financial lift for Occidental   Denbury Resources Inc   N DNR  and oil producers with ready access to the gas   Exxon Mobil  Corp  N XOM  and  Chevron  Corp  N CVX  also use the technique on some of their oil fields  None detail their tax savings from the credit  but since the it was first offered in 2008  companies have collected at least  350 million in the credits  according to Internal Revenue Service figures   In Hobbs  Occidental not only kept a 200 person workforce intact during the oil price downturn   when tens of thousands of workers were laid off in the shale patch   it also invested  250 million to expand operations during that period  according to its public filings  That meant Hobbs and nearby Seminole  Texas  where  Hess Corp   N HES  has its own carbon dioxide injection facility  didn t suffer the extreme financial pain felt by shale towns  such as Williston  North Dakota  and other shale producing communities in 2015 and 2016   Oxy s investment in the carbon project was a huge economic boost to our area   Grassham said   Some of the carbon dioxide  a greenhouse gas  comes from naturally occurring reservoirs that are a low cost source for Occidental  Others get the gas piped from power plants that burn coal  Power companies hope the technique can help them avoid higher carbon emissions  The company spends about  18 to  25 per barrel to collect oil from its enhanced oil recovery operations  In contrast  its shale focused well costs are lower    16 to  19 per barrel  But because EOR wells pump consistently for decades  their value to the company over time exceeds shale wells  whose production quickly tapers off  Across Texas and New Mexico  Occidental runs one of the world s largest fleet of enhanced oil recovery projects  injecting 2 billion cubic feet of carbon dioxide each day into wells that first produced oil nearly a century ago    We had a very large  stable carbon dioxide EOR business in our portfolio during the downturn   said Jody Elliott  president of Occidental s American operations   That helped    Partly because of its carbon facilities  Occidental was able to raise its dividend during the downturn  Today  executives are using the profits from the carbon business to grow its shale business across the Permian  the largest acreage holding in the region   These two businesses play very well off of each other   Elliott said   TAX CHANGE  Congress is expected this summer to debate extending an existing tax credit that could pave way for wider use  The proposed Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage Act would boost the credit to  35 per metric ton of carbon dioxide  up from  10 per ton today  The legislation failed to move forward during last year s heated presidential campaign  but supporters say it will be reintroduced soon   We want to make sure that we show a strong commitment so we continue to develop these technologies   said North Dakota Senator Heidi Heitkamp  a Democrat and the bill s lead sponsor  Electricity generator  NRG Energy Inc   N NRG  earlier this year opened a  1 04 billion carbon capture facility at a Texas coal fired power plant  using its carbon dioxide emissions to extract crude from a 1930s era oilfield  Expanding the credit could  supporters hope  encourage more coal fired power plants to follow NRG s lead by capturing and selling carbon to oil producers  Most oilfields are not located near carbon dioxide supplies  so the tax credit also could spur the build out of carbon pipelines   Environmentalists  including the Sierra Club  like the process because it traps carbon underground  preventing it from contributing to greenhouse gas emissions   You ll put more carbon in the ground than oil that is produced   said Vello Kuuskraa  president of consultancy Advanced Resources International  which studies enhanced oil recovery and carbon storage  Oxy is considering investing another  550 million in its Hobbs operation in the next

156708,378224,NRG,Buy 5 Low Beta Stocks Ahead Of Impending Market Volatility,opinion,Wall Street suffered a setback on the first trading day of December after completing an impressive November  On Dec 2  the three major stock exchanges    the Dow  the S P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite    declined 0 9   0 8  and 1 1   respectively Uncertainty about an interim trade deal with China and renewed tariff war with Latin American and European countries pushed indexes in the negative territory  Market volatility is likely to stay in the near term and investors should be prepared for that No Abatement in U S  China Trade ConflictThe more than 18 month old trade war between the United States and China is showing no signs of ending so far  After imposing tariffs and counter tariffs in 2018  the two countries tried to reach an amicable solution from the beginning of 2019  The talks however abruptly ended in May after President Donald Trump accused China of back tracking on its earlier commitments However  trade negotiation renewed in July  On Oct 11  President Trump said that both sides will sign a phase one deal by mid November  However  nothing concrete has appeared to date  The Trump administration wants China to substantially increase agricultural imports with firm commitments on protection of U S  intellectual properties and abrogation of forced technology transfer  On the other hand  China wants U S  tariffs on Chinese goods to be removed first Investors are keenly watching trade related developments as the Dec 15 deadline is approaching  President Trump set this deadline for signing the phase one deal failing which his government will implement a fresh round of 15  tariffs on  160 billion of Chinese goods mostly used as inputs for consumer goods  Moreover  on Dec 2  U S  Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said that the U S  government may also hike tariff rate on  250 billion of Chinese goods  which are already under the 25  tax bracket Meanwhile  diplomatic relations between the two largest trading nations deteriorated on Nov 27 after President Trump signed two bills supporting Hong Kong protesters  despite China s repeated objections  Several industry watchers believe that a partial trade deal  if signed  will not materialized before late December or may be next year More Tariff WarsOn Dec 2  President Trump said that he will restore tariffs on U S  steel and aluminum imports from Brazil and Argentina effective immediately  The U S  government implemented 25  tariff on imported steel and 10  duty on imported aluminum on Mar 1  2018 According to Trump   Brazil and Argentina have been presiding over a massive devaluation of their currencies  which is not good for our farmers   Trump also insisted that the Fed should prevent countries from gaining an economic advantage by devaluing their currencies The U S  government has also decided to impose retaliatory tariffs on France since the latter imposed digital tax  which the Trump administration believes will hurt business interest of U S  tech behemoths  The U S  government has proposed levying duties of up to 100  on  2 4 billion French products  including sparkling wine  cheese  and other goods Our Top PicksU S  stock markets are likely to remain choppy in the first half of December or maybe the full month unless there are some positives on the trade war front  At this juncture  it

156713,378229,NRG,Is NRG Energy  NRG  A Suitable Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value  One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put NRG Energy  Inc    NYSE NRG   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  NRG Energy has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12 58  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 19 57  If we focus on the long term PE trend  NRG Energy s current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 15 75 over the past five years  Moreover  the current level stands well below the highs for the stock  suggesting that it can be a solid entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Utilities sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 16 83  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that NRG Energy has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 7 96  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for NRG Energy stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings  Right now  NRG Energy has a P S ratio of about 1 02  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 38x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  NRG Energy currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes NRG Energy a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too  For example  the PEG ratio for NRG Energy is just 0 2  a level that is far lower than the industry average of 3 81  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  NRG is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles  What About the Stock Overall Though NRG Energy might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of A  This gives NRG a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower  while the full year estimate has seen two up and one down in the same time period  This has had a positive impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen significantly in the past two months  while the full year estimate has increased by 24 7   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below NRG Energy  Inc  Price and Consensus   This somewhat robust trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and why we are looking for outperformance from the company in the near term  Bottom LineNRG Energy is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Further  a strong industry rank  among Top 36  of more than 250 industries  instills our confidence  However  over the past two years  the Zacks Utilities Electric Power industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick  5 Stocks Set to DoubleEach was hand picked by a Zacks expert as the  1 favorite stock to gain  100  or more in 2020  Each comes from a different sector and has unique qualities and catalysts that could fuel exceptional growth

156714,378230,NRG,Is NRG Energy  NRG  Stock Undervalued Right Now ,opinion,"Here at Zacks  our focus is on the proven Zacks Rank system  which emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find great stocks  Nevertheless  we are always paying attention to the latest value  growth  and momentum trends to underscore strong picks 
Considering these trends  value investing is clearly one of the most preferred ways to find strong stocks in any type of market  Value investors use tried and true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels

Value investors also frequently use the P S ratio  This metric is found by dividing a stock s price with the company s revenue  Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement  This means it could be a truer performance indicator  NRG has a P S ratio of 1 03  This compares to its industry s average P S of 2 15

156774,378290,NRG,NRG Yield  CWEN  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when NRG Yield  CWEN  reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on November 6  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This company created by NRG Energy  NYSE NRG  to acquire and operate natural gas  solar and wind plants is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 71 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  255  
Revenues are expected to be  328 million  up 12 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 46 67  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for NRG Yield 
For NRG Yield  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  11 97  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  5 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that NRG Yield will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that NRG Yield would post earnings of  0 40 per share when it actually produced a loss of  0 22  delivering a surprise of  155  
The company has not been able to beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
NRG Yield doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/nrg-yield-cwen-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200480326,200480326

156801,378317,NRG,Weak Retail Sales May Trigger Rate Cut This Month  5 Picks,opinion,The U S  economy suffered a setback as retail sales for the month of September declined unexpectedly for the first time in seven months  Although contraction of retail sales in one month may be a discrete phenomenon  continuation of this trend is likely to raise recessionary concerns especially since the manufacturing sector contracted in the previous two months Meanwhile  market participants and industry researchers are busy assessing whether tepid retail sales will call for another rate cut by the Fed this month  Possibility of a third rate cut in October intensified on the back of prolonged uncertainty about the U S  China trade tussle  global economic slowdown and weak U S  economic data Retail Sales Contract in September  On Oct 16  the Department of Commerce reported that retail sales in September declined 0 3  against the consensus estimate of growth of 0 3   This happened for the first time since February  August s data was revised upward from an increase of 0 4  to 0 6   U S  consumers reduced spending mainly on automobiles  building materials  and online purchases  However  year over year  retail sales increased 4 1  Core retail sales in September  excluding automobiles  gasoline  building materials and food service  declined 0 1  compared with a gain of 0 2  in August  Consensus estimate was also of a gain of 0 2   Core retail sales data is highly correlated to the consumer spending component of the U S  GDP Importance of Retail Sales ContractionU S  consumer spending constitutes 66 70  of the country s GDP  Notably  personal consumption is the primary driver of U S  economic growth in the first half of 2019  U S  GDP grew 2  in the second quarter while personal consumption increased 4 6  on an annualized rate  the highest in one and a half years The importance of consumer spending has increased significantly in third quarter since U S  manufacturing  which constitutes 12  of its GDP  contracted in the last two months  Lingering tariff war with China raised input costs for high end U S  products  resulting in slowing business investment  Moreover  labor market  which remained robust despite trade jitters also witnessed lower job growth in September Meanwhile  trade related conflict with China continues despite President Trump s assurance about substantial progress of a partial deal  The Wall Street Journal reported that China wants U S  tariffs to be rolled back before increasing imports of U S  agricultural products  Further  diplomatic relations may aggravate between the two countries owing to political unrest in Hong Kong At this juncture  reduction in consumer spending  the main driver of the economy  along with manufacturing contraction and slow job growth will have significant negative impact on the U S  economy Will Fed Opt for Third Rate Cut in October On Oct 8  Jerome Powell gave signals of a possible third rate cut this month  The FOMC is scheduled to meet on Oct 29 30  Powell cited a slowdown in the job growth rate and muted inflation along with global economic slowdown  due to the U S  China trade war  as the primary reasons for a likely third rate cut this year Notably  the central bank has already reduced the benchmark lending interest rate by 50 basis points in two equal tranches in July and September  The Fed lowered the benchmark interest rate for the first time in more than 11 years Moreover  disappointing retail sales data for September increased the vulnerability of the largest component of the U S  GDP  These negatives are likely to compel the central bank for a third rate cut this month in order to honor its pledge to do the needful to sustain U S  economic expansion  President Trump is also a vocal supporter of further reduction in interest rate in order to realize the full effect of fiscal measures taken by his administration Notably  as of Oct 17  the CME FedWatch assigned more

156863,378379,NRG,5 Top Domestic Stocks To Buy Amid Trade Jitters   Weak Data,opinion,Wall Street has been facing volatility in the second half of September owing to several economic and political factors  Uncertainty over the U S  China trade deal  global economic slowdown  the initiation of an impeachment proceeding against President Donald Trump and some recently released weak economic data are near term concerns At this juncture  investors are concerned that intensifying trade conflict will hurt sales of U S  multinational companies as their products will be vulnerable in international markets  Domestic business oriented companies are mostly immune to external shocks since the United States is the lone market for their products  This will help them to outperform the broader market defying extreme volatility U S  China Trade Tension HeightensOn Sep 27  Bloomberg reported that the U S  government is considering limiting U S  investment in Chinese companies  As part of this broad based measure  the Trump administration is likely to delist Chinese corporates from U S  stock exchanges Later CNBC also confirmed the news citing a source familiar with the development  However  the source pointed out that no decision has been taken so far and no deadline has been set to meet the target   Surprisingly  this development has taken place when a high level trade delegation of China is about to meet its U S  counterpart in Washington during Oct 10 11  Per the unnamed source  restriction on financial investment in Chinese companies will protect U S  corporates from excessive risks they are currently exposed to from lack of financial transparency and regulatory supervision of the Chinese government At present  Chinese entities  which are listed on U S  stock markets  are not complying with the U S  PCAOB  Public Company Accounting Oversight Board  process  resulting in huge risks to U S  investors Chinese companies have a large presence in U S  capital markets  A total of 156 Chinese companies were listed in the United States  Per the latest data as of February 2019  Chinese corporates command a market capitalization of around  1 2 trillion in several U S  stock exchanges  Consequently  if President Trump finally takes this decision ongoing trade conflict between the two largest trading countries of the world will certainly be escalated Weak Economic DataThe Department of Commerce reported that overall orders for U S  factory made durable goods increased 0 2  in August compared with an impressive 2   revised from 2 1  reported earlier  in July  However  orders for core capital goods  non defense capital goods excluding aircraft  declined 0 2  in August primarily due to weak demand for household machineries  Notably  this metric is a closely watched proxy for business spending plans U S  consumer spending edged up 0 1  in August after surging 0 5   revised from 0 6  reported earlier  in July  The data indicates that the lingering tariff war with China has started taking a toll on consumer spending aside from a considerable decline in business spending  Notably  consumer spending is the main driver accounting for nearly 70  of the U S  GDP PCE  personal consumption expenditure  price index rose 0 1  in August compared with 0 3  in July  Year over year  PCE inflation grew 1 4   Core PCE inflation  excluding the volatile food and energy

safe bet during times of market turmoil  as they are relatively stable due to the essential nature of the products they offer  Consequently  it will be prudent to invest in utility stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank to secure gains in this erratic market Impressive Performance by Utilities Sector in 2019The utilities sector was the best performer of the 11 broad sectors within the benchmark S P 500 Index in 2018 as a result of the Wall Street mayhem  Utilities gained 4 9  compared with a 6 2  loss of the S P 500 Index  However  Wall Street recovered impressively in the beginning of 2019  notching the best performing first quarter in three decades Meanwhile  market volatility started spoiling the Wall Street party intermittently in the second quarter of 2019  Thereafter  uncertainty over the U S  China trade deal  global economic slowdown  inversion of government bond yield curve in August  and geopolitical disturbances like Brexit cropped up as the primary reasons for market fluctuation  And now  the initiation of an impeachment proceeding against President Donald Trump could be an added concern So far in the third quarter of 2019  S P 500 s Utilities Select Sector SPDR has gained 9 5  while the benchmark index itself rose just 2 2   During the past six months  the utilities sector once again advanced most with a gain of 10 1  while the broad market index advanced a

far in 2019   Utilities Immune to Vagaries of Economic Cycle    The Utilities sector is mature and fundamentally strong as demand for such services is generally immune to the changes in the economic cycle  It s because these companies provide basic services like electricity  gas  water and telecommunications  which can never go out of demand Consequently  adding stocks from the utility basket usually lends more stability to a portfolio in an uncertain market condition  Moreover  the sector is known for stability and visibility of its earnings and cash flows   Stable earnings enable utilities to pay out consistent dividends that make them more attractive to income oriented investors Utility companies enjoy a reputation for being safe given the regulated nature of their business  which lend their revenues a high level of certainty  These companies also benefit from the domestic orientation of their business  which shields them from foreign currency translation issues that are lately plaguing the other industries Our Top PicksStock markets are likely to remain volatile in near future due to trade concerns  global growth woes and political issues  Consequently  investment in

financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  NRG Energy Inc    NYSE NRG    Consolidated Communications Holdings Inc    NASDAQ CNSL    Exantas Capital Corp    NYSE XAN    Boot Barn Holdings Inc    NYSE BOOT   and Industrial Logistics Properties Trust   NASDAQ ILPT   Here are highlights from Monday s Analyst Blog  5 Top Domestic Stocks to Buy Amid Trade Jitters  Weak DataWall Street has been facing volatility in the second half of September owing to several economic and political factors  Uncertainty over the U S  China trade deal  global economic slowdown  the initiation of an impeachment proceeding against President Donald Trump and some recently released weak economic data are near term concerns At this juncture  investors are concerned that intensifying trade conflict will hurt sales of U S  multinational companies as their products will be vulnerable in international markets  Domestic business oriented companies are mostly immune to external shocks since the United States is the lone market for their products  This will help them to outperform the broader market defying extreme volatility U S  China Trade Tension HeightensOn Sep 27  Bloomberg reported that the U S  government is considering limiting U S  investment in Chinese companies  As part of this broad based measure  the Trump administration is likely to delist Chinese corporates from U S  stock exchanges Later CNBC also confirmed the news citing a source familiar with the development  However  the source pointed out that no decision has been taken so far and no deadline has been set to meet the target   Surprisingly  this development has taken place when a high level trade delegation of China is about to meet its U S  counterpart in Washington during Oct 10 11  Per the unnamed source  restriction on financial investment in Chinese companies will protect U S  corporates from excessive risks they are currently exposed to from lack of financial transparency and regulatory supervision of the Chinese government At present  Chinese entities  which are listed on U S  stock markets  are not complying with the U S  PCAOB  Public Company Accounting Oversight Board  process  resulting in huge risks to U S  investors Chinese companies have a large presence in U S  capital markets  A total of 156 Chinese companies were listed in the United States  Per the latest data as of February 2019  Chinese corporates command a market capitalization of around  1 2 trillion in several U S  stock exchanges  Consequently  if President Trump finally takes this decision ongoing trade conflict between the two largest trading countries of the world will certainly be escalated Weak Economic DataThe Department of Commerce reported that overall orders for U S  factory made durable goods increased 0 2  in August compared with an impressive 2   revised from 2 1  reported earlier  in July  However  orders for core capital goods  non defense capital goods excluding aircraft  declined 0 2  in August primarily due to weak demand for household machineries  Notably  this metric is a closely watched proxy for business spending plans U S  consumer spending edged up 0 1  in August after surging 0 5   revised from 0 6  reported earlier  in July  The data indicates that the lingering tariff war with China has started taking a toll on consumer spending aside from a considerable decline in business spending  Notably  consumer spending is the main driver accounting for nearly 70  of the U S  GDP PCE  personal consumption expenditure  price index rose 0 1  in August compared with 0 3  in July  Year over year  PCE inflation grew 1 4   Core PCE inflation  excluding the volatile food and energy components  edged up 0 1  in August compared with 0 2  in July  Year over year  core PCE inflation increased 1 8   still below the Fed s target rate of 2  Our Top PicksAt this juncture  investment in domestic business focused stocks with strong growth potential

156917,378433,NRG,Solid Relative Price Strength Make These 4 Stocks Attractive,opinion,Investors generally gauge a stock s potential returns by examining earnings growth and valuation multiples  At the same time  it s important to measure the performance of such a stock relative to its industry or peers  or the appropriate benchmark If you see that a stock is underperforming on fundamental factors  then it would be prudent to move on and find a better alternative  However  those outperforming their respective sectors in terms of price should be selected because they stand a better chance to provide considerable returns Then again  it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength  Stocks delivering better than the S P 500 over a period of 1 to 3 months at the least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth and are the best ways to go about this strategy Finally  it is important to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings results of these companies  In order to do this  we have added positive estimate revisions for

156946,378462,NRG,Drone Attacks Spike Oil Prices And Snap Dow s 8 Day Run ,opinion,"It took an international event to derail the Dow s 8 session winning streak  and we re not even talking about China  
	The problem was with Saudi Arabia  where a series of drone attacks this weekend on that country s oil production facilities disrupted the world s oil output and sent prices soaring on Monday 
	Investors are concerned that such developments will put additional pressures on a global economy that already seems to be slowing down  
	Fortunately  the U S  has dramatically increased its oil production over the past several years  so this type of event doesn t pack the same punch as it would have a few years ago  But it did have enough of an impact to start this week on a sour note  The Dow dipped 0 52   or nearly 143 points  on Monday to 27 076 82  putting an end to 8 consecutive sessions in the green stemming from encouraging news on the trade front with China  
	Meanwhile  the S P closed below 3000 again with a dip of 0 31  to 2997 96  while the NASDAQ was off 0 28   or about 23 points  to 8153 54  
	These indices have put together three straight positive weeks and they still have a good chance of making it four in a row  Even with all of today s troubles  the Dow and S P remain approximately 1  away from new highs despite today s pullback  
	It looks like Iran was behind the attacks  but President Trump doesn t plan to be hasty in responding  
	Despite this Middle Eastern drama  the big story this week continues to be the Fed meeting  which starts tomorrow 
	Investors aren t going to let a drone attack divert their attention from the Committee s rate decision on Wednesday  Of course  they are counting on another cut of at least a quarter point  
	Stocks did not react as sharply to the oil disruption as energy prices did  which means there s still a good chance that we could see new highs in the coming days  
	Let s just hope there are no more surprises  Today s Portfolio Highlights  Blockchain Innovators  The peer to peer lending space is fertile ground for blockchain  since the technology can help streamline the business by weeding out inefficiencies  That was the basis for today s addition of LendingClub  LC   a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  online financial services company that is expected to grow revenue 12 3  this year and another 13  next year  Read the full write up for more on this new addition Technology Innovators  The portfolio is getting back into the security space with the addition of Radware  RDWR   a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  provider of a broad range of Internet traffic management solutions  The company has an impressive record of easily beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate with an average earnings surprise of more than 90  over the past four quarters  Most recently  it beat by more than 83   The stock had a rough August  but Brian believes its poised to head higher  Therefore  he added RDWR on Monday at a great entry price and still has a couple open positions for other opportunities  Read the complete commentary for more

highlights from Tuesday s Analyst Blog 5 Top S P 500 Stocks Soaring Despite Worst August in 4 YearsWall Street just completed a disappointing August  which historically remains weak in stock market performance  However  this August dented investors  confidence a little bit more with heightened trade conflict between United States and China  global economic slowdown and various geopolitical unrests However  despite the presence of severe volatility  a few stocks  within the broad market S P 500 Index  climbed in August Major Indexes Plummet in AugustAll three major stock indexes      the S P 500  the Dow and the Nasdaq Composite      finished in negative territory in August  So far in 2019  August was the second month after May  when all three major stock indexes closed in the red Notably  the S P 500  the Dow and the Nasdaq Composite lost 1 8   1 7  and 2 6  in August  marking the worst ever performance in August since 2015 for all the three indexes  These indexes posted four successive weekly losses starting from the last week of July to the third week of August  It was only in the fourth week of August that these indexes rallied on hopes of renewed trade talks between the United States and China Volatility Mars Stock PerformanceAfter two consecutive months of bull run  volatility resurfaced on Wall Street from the beginning of August owing to a less than expected dovish monetary stance adopted by the Fed and President Trump s tweet expressing desire to impose a 10  tariff on a new set of Chinese goods worth  300 billion Moreover  China started manipulating its currency by setting its mid point to below 7 a U S  dollar  a key psychological barrier  for the first time in more than a decade  Meanwhile  Eurozone continued to suffer from manufacturing wooed and several major emerging market central banks reduced the benchmark interest rate to steady their economies in order to combat a global economic slowdown Meanwhile  the tariff war between the two largest trading nations of the world heightened on Aug 23 after China announced that it will impose 5  to 10  tariff on another  75 billion of U S  goods in two tranches  on Sep 1 and Dec 15  Additionally  a 25  tariff on U S  auto products and auto parts will be imposed effective Dec 15 In retaliation  President Donald Trump decided to raise tariff to 30  from the existing 25  on  250 billion Chinese goods  Moreover  he also raised the tariff from 10  to 15   which is to be levied on an additional  300 billion of Chinese exports effective Sep 1 Additionally  several geopolitical crises such as the possibility of a no deal Brexit in Britain  political turmoil in Italy  political unrest for democracy in Hong Kong and the ongoing oil conflict between the United States and China also jeopardized investors  confidence Treasury Yield Curve InversionAll these negatives resulted in inversion of yields on 2 year and 10 year U S  Treasury Notes on Aug 14  for the first time since December 2005  Thereafter  on Aug 28  yield on the 10 year Note plummeted below the psychological barrier of 1 5  to 1 45  and below the 2 year Note s yield of 1 5   The spread registered its lowest level since 2007  Similarly  the yield on 30 year U S  Treasury Note fell below its psychological barrier of 2  to as low as 1 907  Meanwhile  the yield on short term 3 month Treasury Bill stayed at 1 992   reflecting inversion with the yields of mid term 2 year  benchmark 10 year and long term 30 year Notes  Several economists and financial experts consider this bond market phenomenon as a clear indication of an impending recession 5 S P 500 Stocks Surge in AugustThe recent concerns about a U S  China trade deal and consequently global economic slowdown have not stalled the entire market  We

list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  NRG Energy  Inc    NYSE NRG    Unitil Corp    NYSE UTL    General Mills  Inc    NYSE GIS    The Boston Beer Company  Inc    NYSE SAM   and Penn National Gaming  Inc    NASDAQ PENN   Here are highlights from Tuesday s Analyst Blog 5 Rock Solid Stocks to Buy as September Looks ToughSummer is unofficially over and traders are back in business after an extended Labor Day break  But  September is historically the worst month for the stock market  And this September  particularly  can be a tough one as it follows a volatile August Trade related uncertainties and economic slowdown are primarily responsible for the market s volatile streak  Given such bearishness  investors should pick stocks that have a steady stream of customers  irrespective of market conditions September  Typically Rocky for StocksStocks tend to wobble in September  According to Dow Jones Market Data  since 1937  both the S P 500 and the Dow averaged a loss of 1   The Nasdaq Composite  as incepted in 1971  averaged a loss of 0 5   CFRA added that the broader S P 500 has averaged a 1  decline  particularly  in September since 1946 What s more  September is gloomier after a downbeat August  It was a wild month for the stock market  with the S P 500  the Dow and the Nasdaq registering a loss of 1 8   1 7  and 2 6   respectively  By the way  this marked the worst August performance for the bourses since 2015 And whenever S P 500 has lost more than 1 5  in August  the Dow declined an average 1 1  in September  while the Nasdaq has saw an average drop of 0 8   The S P 500  itself  continued its losing run  falling 0 9  What Happened in August Escalating trade tensions and signs of a recession dealt a heavy blow to stocks during August  The S P 500 declined at least 2 6  three times during August  while the Cboe Volatility Index  VIX   better known as fear gauge index  traded as high as 24 81 before pulling back to around 18 The U S  China trade tussle intensified last month after President Trump urged American firms to start looking for an  alternative to China   Trouble began after China announced plans of imposing tariffs of 5  and 10  on nearly  75 billion of U S  products Beijing clarified that the move was due to the Trump administration s intention to impose 10  tariffs on  300 billion of Chinese imports  Trump  in the meantime  reacted to China s decision by saying that the United States will increase tariffs on  250 billion of Chinese goods to 30  from an earlier 25   And tariffs on additional  300 billion imports from China would go up to 15  from 10  Meanwhile  the benchmark 10 year Treasury yield s fall below the 2 year Treasury yield added to the bearish sentiments  With the 10 year rate below the 2 year note  fixed income traders are expecting a slowdown in the near term  Lest we forget  the 2 year yield has always surpassed the 10 year note in every slowdown over the past 50 years So  what led to the inverted yield curve  Thanks to the ever changing China trade narrative  the stock market continues to gyrate  compelling investors to pull money out of equities and opt for safe haven government bonds  eventually leading to a decline in the 10 year Treasury yield  After all  bond yields tend to move opposite to prices Things Not Rosy This SeptemberU S  China trade war  in fact  shows no signs of cooling down this month  Tariffs of 15  on  112 billion of Chinese goods have been put into effect on Sep 1  as did retaliatory Chinese tariffs on U S  commodities  including crude oil imports Now  nearly two thirds of the consumer goods that the United States imports from China will face higher taxes  Americans have to pay more for items like shoes  clothes and sporting goods  Trump s higher tariffs will now impact consumer spending  which has been one of the driving factors for the economy  Needless to say  business houses have lowered spending and exports have slowed down in the face of weak global growth Both Washington and Beijing are struggling to de escalate the trade war  with the United States accusing China of stealing trade secrets and unfairly subsidizing its own companies to make headway into high tech fields such as AI and electric cars 5 Best Stocks to Buy in SeptemberWith things not looking up on the trade front and yield curve remaining inverted  choppy trading sessions are expected to persist this September  However  contrary to popular belief  there are stocks that do well during market gyrations Prominent among them are defensive stocks  These stocks are generally non cyclical  or companies whose business performance and sales are not highly correlated with activities in the larger market  Their products are in constant demand  irrespective of market volatility  and such names include companies from the utilities and consumer staples sectors The idea of investing in  vice  stocks can also be considered  After all  products or services in this space are relatively inelastic  and business is slowdown proof  The very nature of their business ensures a stable stream of consumers  irrespective of market conditions  which eventually leads to higher margins and solid profits  Noteworthy vice stocks include beer and gaming companies We have  thus  selected five solid stocks from the aforesaid areas that flaunt a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  NRG Energy  Inc

156981,378497,NRG,5 Rock Solid Stocks To Buy As September Looks Tough,opinion,Summer is unofficially over and traders are back in business after an extended Labor Day break  But  September is historically the worst month for the stock market  And this September  particularly  can be a tough one as it follows a volatile August Trade related uncertainties and economic slowdown are primarily responsible for the market s volatile streak  Given such bearishness  investors should pick stocks that have a steady stream of customers  irrespective of market conditions September  Typically Rocky for StocksStocks tend to wobble in September  According to Dow Jones Market Data  since 1937  both the S P 500 and the Dow averaged a loss of 1   The Nasdaq Composite  as incepted in 1971  averaged a loss of 0 5   CFRA added that the broader S P 500 has averaged a 1  decline  particularly  in September since 1946 What s more  September is gloomier after a downbeat August  It was a wild month for the stock market  with the S P 500  the Dow and the Nasdaq registering a loss of 1 8   1 7  and 2 6   respectively  By the way  this marked the worst August performance for the bourses since 2015 And whenever S P 500 has lost more than 1 5  in August  the Dow declined an average 1 1  in September  while the Nasdaq has saw an average drop of 0 8   The S P 500  itself  continued its losing run  falling 0 9  What Happened in August Escalating trade tensions and signs of a recession dealt a heavy blow to stocks during August  The S P 500 declined at least 2 6  three times during August  while the Cboe Volatility Index  VIX   better known as fear gauge index  traded as high as 24 81 before pulling back to around 18 The U S  China trade tussle intensified last month after President Trump urged American firms to start looking for an  alternative to China   Trouble began after China announced plans of imposing tariffs of 5  and 10  on nearly  75 billion of U S  products Beijing clarified that the move was due to the Trump administration s intention to impose 10  tariffs on  300 billion of Chinese imports  Trump  in the meantime  reacted to China s decision by saying that the United States will increase tariffs on  250 billion of Chinese goods to 30  from an earlier 25   And tariffs on additional  300 billion imports from China would go up to 15  from 10  Meanwhile  the benchmark 10 year Treasury yield s fall below the 2 year Treasury yield added to the bearish sentiments  With the 10 year rate below the 2 year note  fixed income traders are expecting a slowdown in the near term  Lest we forget  the 2 year yield has always surpassed the 10 year note in every slowdown over the past 50 years So  what led to the inverted yield curve  Thanks to the ever changing China trade narrative  the stock market continues to gyrate  compelling investors to pull money out of equities and opt for safe haven government bonds  eventually leading to a decline in the 10 year Treasury yield  After all  bond yields tend to move opposite to prices Things Not Rosy This SeptemberU S  China trade war  in fact  shows no signs of cooling down this month  Tariffs of 15  on  112 billion of Chinese goods have been put into effect on Sep 1  as did retaliatory Chinese tariffs on U S  commodities  including crude oil imports Now  nearly two thirds of the consumer goods that the United States imports from China will face higher taxes  Americans have to pay more for items like shoes  clothes and sporting goods  Trump s higher tariffs will now impact consumer spending  which has been one of the driving factors for the economy  Needless to say  business houses have lowered spending and exports have slowed down in the face of weak global growth Both Washington and Beijing are struggling to de escalate the trade war  with the United States accusing China of stealing trade secrets and unfairly subsidizing its own companies to make headway into high tech fields such as AI and electric cars 5 Best Stocks to Buy in SeptemberWith things not looking up on the trade front and yield curve remaining inverted  choppy trading sessions are expected to persist this September  However  contrary to popular belief  there are stocks that do well during market gyrations Prominent among them are defensive stocks  These stocks are generally non cyclical  or companies whose business performance and sales are not highly correlated with activities in the larger market  Their products are in constant demand  irrespective of market volatility  and such names include companies from the utilities and consumer staples sectors The idea of investing in  vice  stocks can also be considered  After all  products or services in this space are relatively inelastic  and business is slowdown proof  The very nature of their business ensures a stable stream of consumers  irrespective of market conditions  which eventually leads to higher margins and solid profits  Noteworthy vice stocks include beer and gaming companies We have  thus  selected five solid stocks from the aforesaid areas that flaunt a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  NRG Energy  Inc    NYSE

157004,378520,NRG,6 Great Stocks To Gain From A Patient Fed ,opinion,"According to minutes of the Fed meeting held earlier this month  policymakers of the central bank will continue to adopt a  patient  approach on rates  The Fed expressed greater confidence in the U S  economy  stressing that the impact of headwinds to the global economy has declined considerably 
The central bank expects rates to remain stable for quite  some time  to come  In fact  some members are apprehensive about sluggish inflation and stopped short of calling for a rate cut 
Rate sensitive stocks are likely to gain from such a dovish monetary stance  This is why it makes sense to invest in real estate investment trusts  REITs  and utility stocks 
Fed At Ease With Current Stance  Optimistic About Economy
At the end of the Fed meeting on May 1  the central bank kept rates unchanged within the 2 25  2 5  band  Minutes of the meeting reveal that the central bank is at ease with its patient approach  a stance which could remain unchanged in the near future  Dallas Fed President said he was  agnostic  about whether the central bank s next move will be a rate hike or cut  
The minutes also revealed that the central bank s policymakers  outlook for the full year economic growth has improved  Meanwhile  concerns about an economic slowdown have abated  Over the past few meetings  the Fed had expressed concerns about global growth  the impasse over Brexit and trade tensions 
With the central bank adopting a more upbeat tone  these concerns seem to have abated  At the same time  the Fed thinks that such fears remain in the background  This is perhaps why members of the central bank believe it needs to be patient when determining the future course of the federal funds target rate 
I
Is a Rate Cut Around the Corner 
Until last year  the Fed was expected to raise rates at least twice in 2019  Then early this year  the central bank adopted a markedly softer approach  Currently  policymakers are divided over the long term course of the target rate 
While  many  agree with the Fed Chair s assessment that sluggish inflation is  transient    several  others are worried about this factor  They believe that the current level of inflation is inconsistent with the current employment rate  which hovers around a near 50 year low 
However  they have stopped short of calling for a rate cut  But market watchers still think at least one rate cut is likely before the end of 2019  President Trump thinks a 1  rate cut is in order and has repeatedly called on the Fed to lower rates  Of course  some economists think that a near term change in rates remains unlikely 
Our Choices
While freshly released Fed minutes clearly indicate that a near term change in rates is highly unlikely  market watchers expect at least one rate cut before the end of this year  Currently  policymakers of the central bank remain divided about the near term course of rates  This depends on whether they agree with the Fed Chair on the  transient  nature of sluggish inflation 
Rate sensitive investments like utilities and REITs are useful additions to your portfolio under such circumstances  However  picking winning stocks may prove to be difficult  We have narrowed our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and other relevant metrics

157009,378525,NRG,NRG Yield  CWEN  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  What To Know Ahead Of Q2 Release,opinion,"The market expects NRG Yield  CWEN  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on August 6  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower

Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for NRG Yield

So  this combination indicates that NRG Yield will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that NRG Yield would post earnings of  0 02 per share when it actually produced a loss of  0 18  delivering a surprise of  1 000

Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP

So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that NRG Yield will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number

Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2 44  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for NRG 
For NRG  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that NRG will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that NRG would post earnings of  1 12 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 94  delivering a surprise of  16 07  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
NRG doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-02-20,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-nrg-energy-nrg-q4-earnings-expected-to-decline-200390899,200390899
157066,378582,NRG,Rate Hike Freeze In 2019 Increasingly Likely  5 Picks ,opinion,A Commerce Department report released on Friday provided fresh evidence that economic growth is slowing in the United States  Meanwhile  inflation remains sluggish  which explains the dovishness of Federal Reserve officials last week  Fed Chair Jerome Powell went as far as to say that a spike in productivity has provided a route for wages to rise without boosting inflation significantly A large number of market watchers now think that rate hikes will remain on hold this year  In fact  the central bank might even consider a rate cut in the near future  It is clear now that rate sensitive stocks are likely to gain from such a move  This is why it makes sense to invest in real estate and utility stocks Fed s Preferred Inflation Gauge Declines Personal income declined 1  in January  according to data from the Department of Commerce released on Mar 1  This was the first drop recorded in three years  Additionally  consumer spending  which makes up nearly two third of U S  GDP  declined 0 5  in December This is the largest decline recorded since September 2009  Together  the direction of the gauges indicates that an economic slowdown is in progress  These are hardly ideal conditions for additional rate increases Meanwhile  inflation remained sluggish in December  The core PCE price index increased 0 2  during this month  As a result  the Fed s preferred inflation metric remained flat at 1 9  on a yearly basis in December Michael Pierce an economist with Capital Economic thinks the drop in December expenditure indicates that  the economy entered 2019 with much less momentum   Sluggish inflation and under par growth led him to think that rate hikes are unlikely next year  The Fed s next step could even be to lower rates Powell Indicates Further Rate Hikes UnlikelySpeaking to the Citizens Budget Commission in New York on Feb 28  Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that last year s jump in productivity offers space for wage growth without concurrent increase in inflation  This provides another reason for the central bank to stave off additional rate hikes Other key central bank officials also mimicked the Fed Chair s dovish stance  On Feb 28  Vice Chair Richard Clarida said the Fed should set aside projections of an upcoming inflation surge and depend instead on actual data  Speaking in Texas  Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan said the Federal Reserve should hold off further decisions about rates till June Our ChoicesKey economic data released on Mar 1 indicate that the U S  economy is slowing even as inflation remains sluggish  Meanwhile  key central bank officials have indicated that further rate hikes may not be forthcoming this year  Some economists are even forecasting a rate cut in the near future Rate sensitive investments like utilities and real estate stocks are useful additions to your portfolio under such circumstances  However  picking winning

157104,378620,NRG,Twitter  TWTR  Stock Surges To Become S P 500 s Top Monthly Gainer,opinion,"At one point during Wednesday trading hours  shares of Twitter   NYSE TWTR   were up more than 6   bringing the social media company s month to date gains up to 17  and giving it the strongest December rally of any stock in the S P 500 
With no obvious news to cite for today s surge  investors were pointing to favorable technical patterns to explain why Twitter was in the green once again  Regardless  the stock has clearly returned to favor in recent weeks  despite lingering uncertainty in broader markets 
The story of Twitter s latest bout of momentum starts back in July  The stock had become one of 2018 s top momentum picks  tallying gains of about 90  en route to a 52 week high of  47 79 per share  But shares moved sharply lower after Twitter warned of a drop in users amid its purging of fake accounts and efforts to prevent malicious content 
While Twitter still has a long way to go if it wants to see those mid summer levels again  it s recent run has been impressive  Shares found a bottom in October as the rest of the market was sputtering and the internet company managed to rally more than 20  in what was a brutal month for most major indexes  At today s high of  37 14  Twitter shares were nearly 39  above that October low and on track to carry some serious momentum into the New Year 
The next best December performer in the S P 500 is NRG Energy   NYSE NRG    which had gained almost 11  on the month through late afternoon trading hours Wednesday  The index itself is down more than 2 5  so far this month  as investors worried about trade disputes and global economic conditions have not quite found their  Santa Claus Rally  
Twitter is currently sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   This is because earnings estimate revisions have been largely positive as of late  In fact  the company has witnessed 13 upward revisions against just two downward revisions to its fiscal 2018 earnings estimates within the last 60 days  Twitter is now expected to finish the year with EPS growth in excess of 84

157238,378754,NRG,Junk Bond ETFs Plunge To Seven Month Low,opinion,"Junk bond ETFs have been suffering lately  This is because junk rated companies withdrew their bond sales and credit spreads widen 
What s Driving the ETFs 
On Nov 10  coal producer  Canyon Consolidated Resources  pulled a proposed bond sale as a result of the growing uncertainty clouding the credit markets  Moreover  just a day before this  NRG Energy  NYSE NRG  pulled its junk bond due to widening spreads in the asset class 
Uncertainty is mounting on the timely passing of the U S  tax reform  After the Democrats emerging victorious in Virginia and New Jersey  house speaker Paul Ryan stated that there is now an increased pressure on his party to pass the promised reforms  However  he indicated that  if required  the tax reform will be delayed  owing to Congressional Budget Office s forecast cost of  1 7 trillion over a decade  Per Washington Post reports  Senate Republican leaders are weighing the impact of a one year delay in reforms 
Markets believe that uncertainty over the tax reform has increased the appeal of curve flattening trades  Moreover  increasing uncertainty over whether the government will introduce bonds having a maturity of more than 30 years also contributed to the growing appeal of such trades  This has in turn weighed on the high yield space 
Huge cash outflows in the junk bond space have also been driving these ETFs lower  Per a Reuters article citing Lipper data  investors withdrew  621 9 million from the high yield space last week and  1 2 billion in the prior week 
Moreover  markets anticipate an interest rate hike in the December meeting of the Fed  Per the  Fed Watch tool  markets price in a 96 7  chance of a rate hike in December  This might lead to a further flattening of the yield curve 
Below we discuss a few ETFs that seek to provide exposure to the high yield space  see

Fed Chair Yellen sparks dovish takeaway
Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen began her two day semi annual Congressional monetary policy testimony in front of the House Financial Services Committee  Yellen noted that she expects the balance sheet to shrink this year  while appearing to foster a dovish reaction in regard to the trajectory of further rate hikes as the Fed strives for policy normalization  She said  the fed funds rate remains somewhat below its neutral level and  because the neutral rate is currently quite low by historical standards  the federal funds rate would not have to rise all that much further to get to a neutral policy stance   Yellen added that because they also anticipate that the factors that are currently holding down the neutral rate will diminish somewhat over time  additional gradual rate hikes are likely to be appropriate over the next few years to sustain the economic expansion and return inflation to its goal 
The Fed Chief said a few unusual reductions in certain categories of prices have limited inflation and is being closely monitored  Yellen pointed out that continued strength in the labor market should support wage gains and consumer spending  while global economic growth  favorable financial conditions  the ongoing recovery in drilling activity should support business investment   These developments should increase resource utilization somewhat further  thereby fostering a stronger pace of wage and price increases   she added 
The Federal Reserve s Beige Book  a look at business activity across the nation used as a preparation tool for the Fed s next two day monetary policy meeting set to conclude on July 26th  was released in afternoon action  The report showed that the U S  economy expanded across all twelve Districts in June  with the pace of growth ranging from slight to moderate 
The report also indicated that employment maintained a  modest to moderate pace of expansion   across most Districts  though the Atlanta and St  Louis Districts reported flat employment levels  Meanwhile  the report indicated that  prices continued to rise modestly in the majority of Districts  and a few Districts noted that price pressures had eased slightly

157304,378820,NRG,CNX Coal  CNXC  To Report Q1 Earnings  What s In Store ,opinion,"CNX Coal Resources LP   NYSE CNXC   will report first quarter 2017 financial results before the market opens on May 1  In the last four quarters  this coal producer delivered negative earnings surprises   Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement 
Factors to Consider
The coal industry faced immense regulatory pressure due to stringent emission regulations passed by the previous U S  administration  Additionally  cheap natural gas gradually became a preferred choice for utility operators to produce electricity  adversely impacting the demand for coal  However  President Trump has started working on his pre election promises  which will provide the much needed impetus to the coal industry   
Per the U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA   total U S  coal consumption will increase from 731 5 million short tons  MMst  in 2016 to 744 4 MMst in 2017 and 750 3 MMst in 2018  Additionally  the usage of coal in U S  Electric Power sector will increase by nearly 2  to 691 2 MMst in 2017 and improve another 0 6  in 2018  This will definitely help most of the coal companies 
The company witnessed strong demand in the key markets  especially for domestic thermal coal and export metallurgical coal for full year 2016 and expects the same to continue in 2017 as a result of positive regulatory development Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that CNX Coal Resources is likely to beat estimates this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  But that is not the case here  as you will see below You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks ESP  CNX Coal Resources  Earnings ESP is 0 00  as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 56 cents NRG Energy  NYSE NRG   Inc  Price and EPS Surprise

    
Zacks Rank  CNX Coal Resources  Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of ESP  However  a 0 00  ESP makes surprise prediction difficult We caution against stocks with a Zack Rank  4 or  5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions Stocks to ConsiderHere is a company you may want to consider as our model shows that it has the right combination of elements to beat on earnings beat this quarter 
Alliance Resource Partners  L P    NASDAQ ARLP   has an Earnings ESP of  9 21  and a Zacks Rank  3  It is slated to report first quarter earnings on May 1

157313,378829,NRG,Should Value Investors Consider NRG Energy  NRG  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put NRG Energy  Inc    NYSE NRG   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  NRG Energy has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 9 35  as you can see in the chart below This level is significantly favorable with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 20 05  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts NRG Energy s current PE ratio way below its midpoint  which is 32 03  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Utility   Electric Power industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 13 97  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that NRG Energy has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 30 14  so it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  NRG Energy has a P S ratio of about 0 40  This is significantly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 11 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is much below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  NRG Energy currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  A   putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes NRG a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 2 80  which is much better than the industry average of 7 22  Clearly  NRG is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though NRG Energy might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  C  and a Momentum score of  F   This gives NRG a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  B    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days and one lower  while the full year estimate has seen one downward and no upward revisions in the same time period This has had a mixed impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has plunged about 32 4  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has risen by about 11 1   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below NRG Energy  Inc  Price and Consensus    This mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineNRG Energy is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  bottom 37  out of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past one year  the Zacks Utility   Electric Power sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates  analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happen  this stock could be a compelling pick Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as the  1 stock to buy according to Zacks research It s not

157314,378830,NRG,NRG Energy Continues Cost Savings  Compliance Cost A Woe,opinion,"NRG Energy   NYSE NRG   will continue with its cost savings initiative in 2017  which actually resulted in cost savings in excess of  500 million in 2016  However  to meet government regulations in its coal fired generation units  the company will have to incur additional expenditures The cost saving initiatives  serving a wide variety of customers  expansion of renewable portfolio and strategic asset drop down program are going to drive performance The company is expected to enjoy the same benefit from cost savings in the current year as in the previous year  NRG Energy provides electricity to a wide variety of customers  none of whom accounted for more than 10  of its revenues in 2016  Since the company does not depend on a single customer to generate revenues  migration of consumers to other operators is not going to have a significant impact on its earnings During the first quarter of 2017  the company dropped down a few assets to NRG Yield  which generated cash of  130 million  The company decided to drop down its remaining 25  interest in a large portfolio of wind assets from the ROFO pipeline to NRG Yield as well  NRG Energy is gaining from its asset drop down program that is in sync with its long term growth strategy Despite implementing several pollution control measures at its power generating facilities  the company has to invest nearly  134 million during the 2017 2021 time period to meet government regulations in its coal fired generation units Intense competition in the wholesale power markets may hurt NRG Energy s margins  In addition  a number of its  merchant  facilities function without long term power sales agreements and are influenced by market price fluctuations  Since there is no guarantee that the power generated from these units will be sold at commercially attractive rates  profitability from the merchant business is uncertain Price MovementShares of NRG Energy gained 43 1  in the last six months compared with the  industry s gain of 12 5  We believe that the company s cost saving initiatives  providing service to a wide variety of customers  expansion of renewable portfolio and strategic asset drop down program will boost its performance Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderNRG Energy currently has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Some better ranked stocks in the utility space are Brookfield Infrastructure Partners LP   NYSE BIP    Unitil Corporation   NYSE UTL   and Avangrid  Inc    NYSE AGR    All of them currently carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see

157441,378957,NRG,The New Era Of Oil Renaissance ,opinion,Where Nuclear Failed  Oil SucceededIn a continuation of our series on the state of the oil industry we look at some of the other ramifications of what we are labeling the Oil Renaissance in the US  and around the world for that matter  This phrase was first proposed regarding the potential Nuclear turnaround here in the US  where companies like NRG Energy  NRG   Toshiba  TOSBF  and many more players all along the supply chain were positioning themselves for the Nuclear Renaissance of cheap  and abundant Nuclear energy for the next 50 years Well  the natural disaster in Japan changed that movement in the span of a week of just untenable radioactivity readings coming out of Japan  An already uphill battle for changing public sentiment towards the dangers of nuclear energy became an impractical fight from an investment standpoint that relied upon large DOE loan guarantees to attract private investment It is ironic  but all these companies spent a lot of time and effort from lobbying to developing strategic partnerships with each other  and in the end  most of that 7 year effort had to be written off by firms  It really shows how firms have to get the industry right  Oil was so much the smarter play  Higher margins  better technology  much easier safety hurdles  and even the environmental fight is much more manageable Not to mention the number of jobs created is far more with an Oil Renaissance as opposed to a Nuclear Renaissance  even with a complete buildup of the entire nuclear supply chain  Nuclear projects are just not scalable like oil projects are from a numbers standpoint due to the regulation  lead times for components  inspection  build times  and many more constraints No DOE Loan Guarantees  The Free Market at WorkWe are going to have a Renaissance in this country  it just happened under everyone s nose  The free market of high oil prices for the last 10 years made it happen all on its own without government subsidies  and part of the reason that things are going to get real tough for the alternative energy folks over the next 5 years as those government subsidies wind down  They will not make sense from an economic standpoint once oil prices come down considerably  and from a budgetary perspective we can no longer afford this propping up industries that cannot sustain themselves on their own merit in the free market  A 16 trillion dollar debt and climbing means the environmentalists will now be facing an uphill fight on Capitol Hill to have their cause funded by the American taxpayer  Technology Changes  Heart Surgery Meets the Oil PatchThe technology changes alone in the oil industry are amazing  just watch a horizontal drilling or fracking video and it is like all the advances made by the medical community for endoscopic procedures and advanced heart surgical techniques have been applied to the oil industry  And the cost is far more manageable than the medical field with all the added insurance costs  out of control bureaucracy  and government intervention all but eliminating any sense of free market principles Sure these constraints exist in the oil industry  but the healthcare industry is on a planet of its own and worse from a cost efficiency standpoint by a factor of at least a 100  There is not an ounce of free market in the healthcare industry We haven t seen anything yet as this new technology being refined and implemented here in the US will then be fully scalable around the globe  and the amount of new projects that will come online globally with this new technology over the next ten years has yet to be priced into any market intelligence models Natural Gas Industry as the ModelThe natural gas industry is much smaller than the oil industry  and because of the new technology firms were actually continuing production with  2 natural gas because of much lower overall project costs relative to the size of the gas exploitable and other derivative products made along the way enabling these projects to be profitable The oil industry is much more scalable from a cost standpoint  and once these upfront costs have been committed  the size of the industry and scalability means that projects can continue and be highly profitable even with much lower oil prices I previously have thought that this technology would suffer as prices drop  but I am rethinking this assumption with natural gas as my guide in a much less scalable industry  So I now believe that this technology and these projects will continue and be cost effective even with oil dropping to  45 a barrel for both Brent and WTI  It won t happen overnight  but under one scenario prices will just steadily trend down like natural gas prices  and before we realize it we have the equivalent of  2 natural gas prices for the oil industry The China Factor  Use less Commodities for Next DecadeMy assumption about the trajectory of oil prices also relies on the China factor that many analysts have been toying with for the last couple of years  but the IMF and others have done some nice research on and applied some hard numbers to the conceptual idea that China has overinvested for the last decade by a large degree  and most of the previous forecasts for China s growth trajectory from an infrastructure standpoint for the next 10 years are far too optimistic My conclusion is that China will use far less commodities than they did the past decade going forward for the next decade  They are coming into the constraints of large numbers where you have built for the sake of building  and you can no longer build another large new city every year because the demand just isn t there  Basically  the easy  low hanging fruit has been eaten  Most of the new project benefits will not justify the cost based upon infrastructure constraints  logistical incongruities  and actual demand and societal need for said projects  The societal costs outweigh the societal benefits and the projects evaluated in total become a net drag on growth and GDP in the overall calculus  China can go ahead with these projects but the law of diminishing returns  means the country will pay a heavy price to do so  China will continue to grow  but they will grow in a more sophisticated way from a social perspective from within  i e  in a metaphorical Maslow s   Hierarchy of Needs manner  and less of a brute  infrastructure driven manner Ergo  the lower utilization for commodities by China is another factor that will put downward pressure on Oil and other commodities over the next 5 to 10 years More Storage Capacity Needed GloballyMake no mistake these oil and commodity projects are going to go full stream regardless of price due to sunk costs  more efficient operations  job creation  and overall profitability One of the takeaways out of this analysis is that storage facilities will have to be upgraded and new ones coming online for all commodities  For example in Oil  my analysis concludes that Cushing will need to upgrade capacity to over 100 million in the next couple of years  and over 150 million by 5 years  time My new analysis determines the need for even more pipelines being built out of Cushing as well  There will need to be at least 5 million barrels per day outflow from Cushing to refineries by five years  time  can anyone say job creation opportunities here The next substantial upgrade besides the paltry 300 000 per day upgrade this year will not come online until mid 2014 and only improve capacity to 850 000 barrels per day outflow from Cushing which is not going to be enough to counter an exponential measure of domestic production coming into the Cushing energy hub by 2014 But I am forecasting that not only will Cushing be above 100 million in storage in three years  time  but the US will need capacity to store over 600 million barrels by four years  time  and China who is building storage currently  will need to meet their own need for storage due to a massive oversupply in their country China was building storage initially for strategic purposes  but my analysis concludes that because of an oversupply issue similar to copper today in China  they are going to need this additional storage for excess supply issues  Therefore  if you re in the storage facility business  times will be good for the next five years  plenty of business for these firms  As I think storage facilities will have to be built all around the world from Iraq  Saudi Arabia  Africa  and the Scandinavian countries A New Price Model for OilSo how low can prices go  Let s just say that the Renaissance in oil is going to be good for the global economy  just back in 2003 gasoline prices were  1 60 a gallon in the US and oil was trading around  30 a barrel It is not unreasonable to think if the Oil Renaissance takes the path that it is capable of that Oil globally trades all the way down to the  45 area What Price do the Saudi s Really Need  Need and Want ConfusedAnd those that think that OPEC would need  75 to keep up production  remember that OPEC still kept pumping oil only four years ago with  33 oil in 2008  Furthermore  OPEC countries still need the overall revenue not the price per say Accordingly  you could very easily have a scenario where prices go lower and they pump more  violate reduction quotas because they all want the revenue net of volume and price  not just less volume but slightly higher prices I think the world will be surprised how the talking your book rhetoric of  we need  75 oil to justify production  is replaced with the actual   we need the money and our real cost is so much lower than you could ever imagine  reality on the ground This is their one asset in these countries  some revenue stream is better than no revenue stream  and with global production picking up OPEC  s relevance  power  and influence on prices is diminishing by the day Great OPEC you can reduce production  your global competitors will love that  less competition for them  The only problem is that these countries need the money  every country needs the money these days  and that s the market place you take what you can get on the market  The market goes in cycles  just as the housing market re priced itself  so will the oil market The ironic point here is that often the lower prices go  the more oil that is produced trying to make up in volume for the lower price to get as much revenue as possible   45 Oil and  2 Gasoline  Consumers Love this New EraIn conclusion  we are entering a new Renaissance in the oil market  not just in the US  but globally as well New technology  slower growth in the emerging markets over the next decade  and an era where a decade of high prices will finally bear some fruit with market dynamics working as their supposed to leading to more supply  and an eventual reduction in prices Expect this new era to manifest itself in giving the entire world a tax break  and small businesses and consumers worldwide will have more disposable income  and sectors such as retail  entertainment  transportation  and global travel will benefit as a result of this sea change in the oil industry I could even envision the manufacturing industry in the US getting a large piggyback effect as the US will have some of the cheapest energy costs of anywhere in the world for starting a business with an abundance of natural gas  oil and petroleum products for the next decade at a low and stable price How does  45 a barrel oil and  2 a gallon gas sound  Something the peak oil folks thought was an outright impossibility just 5 years ago But a lot of things can change real fast  once technology gets involved  impossible things become possible  Just look at smartphones versus 4 years ago  and the fact that I can deposit a check into my checking account via my smartphone  actually surf the net  get usable navigation directions  and watch Netflix movies on my smartphone The world history of scientific innovation being applied to markets is remarkable to say the least looking back  it s now time for the oil market to have its second renaissance  Expect  45 oil in the future of this renaissance ,2012-12-31,EconMatters,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-new-era-of-oil-renaissance-149126,149126

157443,378959,NRG,Utilities Rise As Natural Gas Wobbles,opinion,"When we last wrote about natural gas in early August  we observed that a possible bottoming formation was in play  given the short term price action following the summer s steep decline in the commodity s value Over a month later  natural gas prices  as reflected by the United States Natural Gas Fund ETF  ARCA UNG   continue to wrestle with overhead resistance while refusing to give up support below The bulls and bears have maintained a tug of war that has left many traders out of this market until it decidedly follows through with a push in one direction or the other  Interestingly  utility stocks  which took a hit when natural gas prices declined over the summer  have recently been displaying some signs of strength In this analysis  we present an example of one such utility stock  NRG Energy Inc   NYSE NRG  and question whether its recent rise is foreshadowing a near term upside tick in natural gas prices as well 
NRG vs  UNG  Weekly Chart Comparison
 
Per Google Finance  NRG Energy Inc  is an integrated wholesale power generation and retail electricity company in the United States  headquartered in Princeton  NJ and employing over 7 000 people In comparing the weekly performance of NRG versus UNG  it s evident that both securities took a significant haircut in value beginning in June and extending into early August  as noted by the red arrow on the chart below 

Earlier in the year  the steep rise in natural gas prices that accelerated in March served as a catalyst for utility stocks such as NRG to push higher  Notably  NRG did not price in the rise in UNG immediately  it took several months of consistently higher natural gas prices to sustain a rally in the stock What s surprising then is how quickly the fall in UNG had a negative impact on NRG shares  It s clear from the chart   investors wanted nothing to do with the stock as soon as they saw natural gas tanking  NRG fell from a high of over  38 in June to a low of  29 03 by early August Now we re seeing an evident disconnect in the price action of NRG versus UNG  While UNG is pretty much flat lined  wobbling between the  20 50 support and  22 resistance levels  NRG has been steadily rising over the past several weeks NRG found support at  29 in August and decisively reclaimed the  30 level by early September  It has not closed below  30 on the weekly time frame since then  and finished out last week s trading at  31 25 a share It was reported in early September that NRG s CEO  David Crane  purchased 5 000 shares of the stock on the open market at an average price of  30 49 a share  This disclosure likely supported bullish conviction 
Conclusion
 
The next resistance level for NRG appears to be the  32 level on the chart  The  30 level is a key support area that should ideally be held by bulls on any pullback in price Whether the price action in utilities such as NRG is reflective of an expected rise in natural gas prices remains to be seen  For UNG  bulls would have to ideally push for a close through  22 on the weekly chart and maintain a continued hold above that level to reflect a sentiment shift to the upside in the intermediate term  So far  the  20 50 area has held as downside support It s important to keep in mind that the natural gas market is susceptible to being influenced by geopolitics  The existing tension between the Ukraine and Russia is a looming example  Russia supplies much of Europe with natural gas and could potentially use this as leverage as the conflict plays out  Any extended disruption in supply would most certainly support a rise in the commodity s price ",2014-09-21,Syncubate,https://www.investing.com/analysis/utilities-rise-as-natural-gas-wobbles-226505,226505
157465,378981,NRG,The End Of Growth  Defensive Sectors Looking Attractive Again,opinion,Over the last few days  a few blogs have been talking about a radical interpretation of the recent economic slowdown  What if stagnating advanced country growth is not merely a result of the recent credit crisis  What if global weakness reflects society s stagnation in technology and innovation  And perhaps more interestingly  does this mean that investors are about to start shifting away from sexy growth industries towards more defensive industries  From Kenneth Rogoff at   Recently  a few writers  including internet entrepreneur Peter Thiel and political activist and former world chess champion Garry Kasparov  have espoused a fairly radical interpretation of the slowdown  In a forthcoming book  they argue that the collapse of advanced country growth is not merely a result of the financial crisis  at its root  they argue  these countries  weakness reflects secular stagnation in technology and innovation  As such  they are unlikely to see any sustained pickup in productivity growth without radical changes in innovation policy  Economist Robert Gordon takes this idea even further  He argues that the period of rapid technological progress that followed the Industrial Revolution may prove to be a 250 year exception to the rule of stagnation in human history  Indeed  he suggests that today s technological innovations pale in significance compared to earlier advances like electricity  running water  the internal combustion engine  and other breakthroughs that are now more than a century old  Don t Underestimate Human Innovation Of course  this isn t the first time someone has called for the end  or at least a slowdown  in technological innovation   One of my favorite examples is Lord Kelvin  speaking to the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1900  saying that there is nothing new to be discovered in physics  History has shown us that it s never a good idea to underestimate human innovation  I  for one  tend to believe that recent advances in nanotechnology  stem cell research and synthetic life can dramatically improve our society on a scale that is comparable to past breakthroughs like electricity and running water  But what do you think  Is this the end of  true innovation   or will another technological breakthrough keep economic growth pushing forward  A Switch Back to Defensive Sectors  Whether we re seeing a long term decline in innovation or not  it is interesting to note that our system of trading indicators have all turned positive on defensive sectors like healthcare and utilities  and turned negative on growth sectors like technology  To date  we ve built and backtested 40 proprietary indicators to predict the direction of the Health Care SPDR  XLV   Over recent sessions we ve seen a significant increase in the number of  Up  signals for the ETF  suggesting near term upside towards the end of the year  At present  our indicators are signaling a high likelihood that XLV will be trading above 40 24 by the 12 26 12 close   Backtests can be downloaded  We ve also noticed a significant increase in bullish indicators for the Utilities SPDR  XLU   Based on data from the December 4 close  36 out of our 40 indicators are signaling that the ETF will be trading above 34 92 by the 12 26 12 close   Backtests can be accessed   Investing Ideas  Institutional Favorites in the Utilities Sector We suggest going long on the XLU and XLV exchange traded funds into the year end  But if you re looking for specific stocks  here is a screen on utility stocks that have seen significant institutional buying during the most recent quarter  data sourced from SEC filings  Use this list as a starting point for your own research  1  Atlas Energy  L P  ATLS   Engages in the gathering and processing of natural gas in the Mid Continent and Appalachia regions  Market cap at  1 74B  Net institutional purchases in the current quarter at 4 8M shares  which represents about 10 25  of the company s float of 46 83M shares  2  NRG Energy  Inc   NRG   Operates as a wholesale power generation company  Market cap at  4 84B  Net institutional purchases in the current quarter at 15 8M shares  which represents about 6 96  of the company s float of 227 12M shares  3  Suburban Propane Partners LP  SPH   Engages in the retail marketing and distribution of propane  fuel oil  and refined fuels  and the marketing of natural gas and electricity in the United States  Market cap at  1 37B  Net institutional purchases in the current quarter at 7 7M shares  which represents about 21 89  of the company s float of 35 17M shares ,2012-12-06,Contextuall,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-end-of-growth:-defensive-sectors-looking-attractive-again-146401,146401
