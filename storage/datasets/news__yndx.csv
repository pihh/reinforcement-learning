178828,400344,YNDX,Russia s Sberbank to buy stake in Mail ru to expand in digital economy,news,"By Alexander Marrow and Nadezhda Tsydenova
MOSCOW  Reuters    Sberbank  MM SBER  has agreed to buy Gazprombank s  holding stake in internet company Mail ru  L MAILRq  as Russia s largest lender continues its transformation under Chief Executive German Gref into a banking to online services company 
Under the deal Sberbank will buy a 35  stake in MF Technologies  which owns 58 9  of Mail ru s voting rights  from Gazprombank  a state owned financial group 
MF Technologies was set up by Megafon  MM MFON   Gazprombank  Rostec and USM holdings in 2018 and holds a 5 2  stake in Mail ru Group  L MAILRq   while controlling a majority of its voting rights 
Gazprombank did not respond to Reuters  request for comment 
Mail ru s chief executive  Boris Dobrodeyev  said that the company welcomed the change to deepen ties with Sberbank  adding that he saw scope for wider cooperation 
The move would expand Sberbank s investments in the internet space and may put pressure on Yandex  MM YNDX   Russia s largest internet company and Mail ru rival 
But with investments in Yandex projects Yandex Dengi  Yandex Money and e commerce venture Yandex Market  Sberbank could find itself caught between the two industry leaders 
Sberbank is one of several Russian banks  including VTB Bank  MM VTBR  and TCS Group  L TCSq   to have invested in internet and telecom services as corporate demand for their traditional services slows 
Ownership structure in Mail ru   
Voting rights in Mail ru   
The deal would give Sberbank 1 82  ownership of Mail ru and 20 3  of the voting rights  according to Reuters calculations 
In 2018  USM holdings and Megafon transferred control of their 54  voting stake in MF Technologies to Mail ru s management  giving CEO Boris Dobrodeyev and his team a 31 8  voting share 
In July  Mail ru and Sberbank announced that they would invest up to 64 million roubles   1 million  in a new joint venture for taxi services and food  providing competition for Yandex  whose Yandex Taxi service dominates Russia s ride hailing market 
Alfa Bank said it expected Mail ru to benefit from the deal  saying its cooperation with Sberbank on digital projects and close ties at the ownership level would help to attract ambitious investment 
 Sberbank as a long term strategic partner will provide access to significant amounts of funding for new projects at the venture stage of development   said Alfa Bank in a note 
For Yandex  however  the move could prove to have negative consequences  according to Alfa Bank  with Sberbank cooperation in its Yandex Market joint venture now looking more vulnerable 
Mail ru operates email services  as well as Russian social media websites VKontakte and Odnoklassniki  In 2016  it purchased food delivery service Delivery Club  which is now co owned by Sberbank as part of the companies  joint venture 
The group s shares were up 1 9  on the day  rising for the eighth consecutive session 
A draft law that proposed limiting foreign shareholding in Russian internet firms at 20   later revised to 50   hit Mail ru s share price this month  with the company s stock falling to its lowest since January 2017 on Oct  18 
The share price has rebounded more than 20  since reaching that mark ",2019-10-29,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/russias-sberbank-to-buy-stake-in-mailru-to-expand-in-digital-economy-2006624,2006624
178829,400345,YNDX,Exclusive  Russia s Sberbank to remain Yandex partner  may adjust some projects   CEO Gref,news,"By Tatiana Voronova and Katya Golubkova
MOSCOW  Reuters    Russia s Sberbank  MM SBER  plans to continue its partnership with  Yandex   O YNDX  even though it has transferred its  golden share  in the country s leading internet company to another entity  Sberbank s Chief Executive German Gref told Reuters 
To assuage Kremlin fears about potential foreign influence  Yandex this month approved changes to its corporate structure to establish a  public interest foundation  which would receive Sberbank s golden share and a number of other rights 
Sberbank  Russia s top bank  has also agreed to buy a stake in internet company Mail Ru  L MAILRq   as Gref continues to transform the lender into a banking to online services company 
The Mail Ru deal and the transfer of the Yandex golden share have raised questions about the future of Sberbank s partnership with Yandex  which includes joint ventures Yandex Market and Yandex Money 
 Partnership  with Yandex  will remain   Gref told Reuters  adding there could be some changes in a number of the companies  joint projects 
He said Sberbank may consider ending a non compete agreement with Yandex on banking services  allowing Yandex to request a banking license for Yandex Money so it can develop payment services 
 There is no threat to Yandex Money  they are growing  they are developing but to achieve the next high quality jump we need to decide on its future destiny   Gref said 
He added that Sberbank and Yandex had agreed to deepen cooperation in educational projects  without giving further details 
Sberbank  via its stake in Mail Ru  is an indirect shareholder in AliExpress Russia  a joint venture between China s largest e commerce firm   Alibaba   N BABA   the Russian Direct Investment Fund  mobile operator Megafon and Mail Ru 
Gref said he saw no violation of a non compete agreement which limits Sberbank s development of e commerce projects to within Yandex Market  calling the indirect stake in AliExpress Russia  insignificant   However  he said that Sberbank plans to discuss with Mail Ru whether the bank would take a direct role in the AliExpress joint venture 
SHAREHOLDING CHANGE
Two sources familiar with the situation told Reuters on Wednesday that the government was in talks with the central bank to buy the latter s 50  plus one share stake in Sberbank  potentially using National Wealth Fund cash 
Gref said that Sberbank was not involved in the talks but stood ready to work with the finance ministry if it became its new majority shareholder 
 I do not see any problems here  There could be some issues related to the transition period  As far as I know  there is no final decision taken yet   Gref said ",2019-12-25,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/exclusive-russias-sberbank-to-remain-yandex-partner-may-adjust-some-projects--ceo-gref-2048192,2048192
178830,400346,YNDX,Yandex Just Gained a Powerful Political Ally,news,"Shares of Yandex  NASDAQ YNDX   the second largest search engine in Russia  recently rallied after Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin  who was appointed to the post in mid January  voiced his support for the company 
President Vladmir Putin nominated Mishustin  who previously led Russia s Federal Tax Service  for the position after the resignation of Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and his entire cabinet on Jan  15  Those resignations reportedly cleared the way for Putin s upcoming constitutional reforms ahead of his planned retirement in 2024 

Mishustin is expected to continue modernizing Russia s economy  reducing its dependence on oil and gas  and nurturing the growth of promising domestic companies  He s also firmly opposed to the nationalization of businesses 
Russia s state backed news agency RIA Novosti recently reported that Mishustin admired Yandex  and that his government would support the company s continued development  Those statements indicate that bright days are ahead for Yandex    so let s see how the Prime Minister s embrace could impact the company s future 
Understanding Yandex s business
Yandex controls 44  of Russia s online search market  according to StatCounter  Alphabet s  NASDAQ GOOG   NASDAQ GOOGL  Google controls 52  of the market 
Yandex generated 71  of its revenues from online ads in the first nine months of 2019  An additional 21  came from Yandex Taxi  the ride hailing business that merged with Uber s  NYSE UBER  business across Russia and several other markets in 2017  The joint venture also bought Vezyot  Russia s biggest taxi company  last year  The rest of Yandex s revenue comes from its online classifieds  streaming media services  and  other bets and experiments  like cloud services  virtual assistants  and smart speakers 
Yandex s core search and portal business is its most profitable segment  Yandex Taxi and its classified business generated positive adjusted EBITDA last quarter  but its media and  other bets  businesses remain unprofitable 
Yet Yandex s strengths consistently outweigh its weaknesses  Analysts expect its revenue and earnings to grow 30  and 45   respectively  next year    which are impressive growth rates for a stock that trades at 24 times forward earnings 
Yandex s relationship with the government
Like China  Russia tightened its internet censorship rules over the past few years  In 2018  the Russian censorship board threatened to block Yandex over allegations of hosting pirated content  That same year  the Russian government passed a law that required search engines to be linked to the federal state information system  FGIS  to enable the Kremlin to filter search results 

Yandex complied with that law  but Google refused  Russian regulators only slapped Google with minor fines  but warned that they could eventually ban Google from Russia if they didn t comply with the Kremlin s censorship requests 
In late 2019  Russia tested out RuNet  a national internet system that could survive without any connections to other countries  The system was clearly inspired by China s  Great Firewall   and could lead to the expulsion of American tech companies like Google  its subsidiary YouTube  and Facebook 
The expulsion of Google and YouTube would clear the way for Yandex to conquer the Russian market  just as Baidu  NASDAQ BIDU  took over mainland China s search market after Google s exit in 2010 
Russia s government clearly views Yandex as a key ally  so it s been fairly receptive to its needs  In 2017  Russia forced Google to stop pre loading its search engine on Android phones after a complaint from Yandex  Last October  Russia softened its proposed foreign investment limits on strategically important companies after the news dented shares of Yandex and other Russian stocks 
How could Mishustin shape Yandex s future 
Mishustin s recent comments about Yandex  along with the Russian government s previous moves  suggest that three things could happen soon  First  Russia could ban Google and clear the path for Yandex to become the country s top search engine  Second  Russia will likely keep allowing foreign investors to buy shares of Yandex  but not establishing majority stakes  to bolster its stock price 
Finally  Russia could tighten its grip on Yandex and force it to tightly monitor and censor its content  just as the Chinese government did to Baidu and its peers  But with Mishustin in charge  it s highly unlikely that Russia will ever nationalize Yandex    which was listed as a key risk factor in the company s previous SEC filings 
In short  Mishustin s appointment is good news for Yandex but bad news for Google  Investors should note that Baidu s stock more than doubled after Google s exit from China    and Yandex might experience similar gains if Mishustin s government ramps up its hostilities against Google ",2020-01-22,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/plbx-,2064838

178872,400388,YNDX,StockBeat   The Safe Haven That Is   Russia,news,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing com    As global growth slows and the world economy teeters on the verge of a new trade led Cold War  it s only natural for investors to think about safe havens  They may be surprised to find that the safest haven in European stock markets this year has been Russia 
The RTS index is up 17 8  for the year to date  the best performing major index in Europe  ahead of the German DAX with 14 7  and the Swiss SMI with 14 0   the RTS is dollar denominated index  so it s not as if those gains have been achieved by ruble devalation   Even more surprising is that it s also the best perfomer on a three year view  having risen 41   the Euro Stoxx 600 is up 12  over the same period  
The RTS even managed to stay in the green on Monday  a day when stocks from Shanghai to Wall Street all tumbled more or less in sync at the prospect of the world s two largest economies descending into an all out trade war 
As a result  it s underperforming Tuesday   as havens often do on up days   rising only 0 2  by mid morning in Europe  compared to a 0 3  rise for the Euro Soxx 600 and a 0 5  rise for the FTSE  Germany s Dax was up 0 6  
There is a simple explanation for this  and   unfortunately for investors   it s one that suggests that outperformance may be hard to sustain  Russia s stock market  like its economy in general  is driven by the oil price  despite endless promises over 19 years by President Vladimir Putin to diversify the economy  Past experience suggests that it will struggle to stay elevated if a trade war slows the global economy and crushes demand for oil 
Oil and gas groups  such as Gazprom  MCX GAZP   Rosneft  MCX ROSN  and Lukoil  MCX LKOH   dominate the index  and as long as they can avoid egregious acts of value destruction  such as throttling Ukraine s gas supplies to make a political point  or buying favored oligarchs out of companies such as TNK BP    they can hardly help but make money  Lukoil  the best run of the three  raised net profit 48  last year to over  9 billion 
As long as high oil prices support the ruble  that also raises the value of companies whose income streams are in rubles   most notably Sberbank  MCX SBER   Europe s largest bank  and internet company  Yandex   NASDAQ YNDX  
Oil prices are riding high at the moment because Russia is   notionally   keeping production off the market in coordination with Saudi Arabia and OPEC to keep the market balanced  The risk of conflict between the U S  and Iran is also helping 
However  Russia is visibly less committed to the deal than Saudi Arabia   its Energy Minister Alexander Novak distanced himself at the weekend from the Saudi position that there was a consensus in favor of extending the deal when it expires in June  Igor Sechin  the Rosneft CEO widely seen as the most powerful man in Russia after President Vladimir Putin  has argued that the whole strategy plays into U S  hands by giving it a bigger share of the global oil market 
Those who have stuck with Russian stocks throughout the lean years since the annexation of Crimea have earned this moment in the sun  Extending it will still require a supreme balancing act from those who control the country s oil and gas taps ",2019-05-21,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/stockbeat--the-safe-haven-that-isrussia-1874190,1874190

179102,400618,YNDX,Crumbling U S  Empire Drives Russia And China To Move Into Gold ,opinion,"Central bankers have been on a massive gold buying spree led by Russia and China  One must remember that not only is Putin ex KGB  but he is also an economist and holds a black belt in judo  Judo teaches you to use your opponent s momentum to defeat him or her  and that appears to what Putin is doing  He has this administration running circles  by the time they figure out what he is up to  it is too late to do anything  Putin and China can see that the writing is on the wall that the days of U S holding the top spot are numbered  Our economy is in shambles and only appears to look strong because of the hot money that is holding it up  Regarding illusions  it is a perfect illusion and for now  the masses have bought it  but Russia and China have not 
Putin is also aware that the average life span of a super power is 250 years  and the U S has been in this position for 240 years  so it is running out of time  Hence  he is using the strong dollar to buy up cheap  valuable gold  Russians are advanced chess players they plan several moves ahead  that is why the West has had such a hard time figuring out what Putin s next move will be  When the western media states that Russia s reserves are falling  they forget to mention that the reserves are in dollars and what Russia and China are doing are getting rid of their worthless dollars and replacing them with gold 
IMF data  International Monetary Fund  shows that the Russia and China have been among the biggest net buyers of gold for eight years in a row  Last year countries purchases close to 590 tons of gold accounting for 14  of annual global gold bullion demand  Smart nations like Russia and China are using these low prices to load up on gold and divest from the dollar  They understand that this economic illusion can last for only so long before reality strikes 
The chart below illustrates how Russia s reserves of gold have soared over the years  Putin is planning for a day when the U S is not the dominant power anymore  When the dollar is finally dethroned  the end will not be pretty 

The number of bilateral deals bypassing the dollar continues to soar  The opening of the AIB  Asian infrastructure bank  and with the Yuan being accepted into the world reserve currency club  the path for the dollar is definitely downhill 
Game Plan
Both China and Russia make for great long term investments  In Russia Yandex NV  MCX YNDX  and VimpelCom  NASDAQ VIP  are examples of two good companies investors can open positions in  in China  we have Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd  NYSE BABA   China Mobile Ltd  NYSE CHL   Huaneng Power International Inc  NYSE HNP   etc  Most importantly  it would be prudent to hold a position in gold bullion  You can use declines to open new positions  We would not aggressively jump into gold bullion unless you have a lot of extra cash lying around that is not being used  Gold is still not fully out of the woods yet as the trend has not turned positive yet  It has a solid wall of resistance to overcome at  1350  The monthly close above  1200 is a move in the right direction 
A multi polar world order is emerging  The U S can either embrace this new trend or be crushed by it  Once a trend is in motion  there is nothing that can stop it  the best you can hope to do is to slow it down  Sadly that is the current path the U S has opted for  perhaps the next administration will be wiser ",2016-03-13,Michael Gouvalaris,https://www.investing.com/analysis/crumbling-u.s-empire-drives-russia---china-to-move-into-gold-200121362,200121362

179132,400648,YNDX,Amazon Spends Big  Can It Crush The Competition ,opinion,"In November 2013  I introduced you to the  Google of Russia    internet search firm  Yandex  NASDAQ YNDX  
A few weeks ago  I wrote about the  Apple of China    mobile provider  Xiaomi 
Today  I d like you to meet the  Amazon of India  
Just as Yandex and Xiaomi are outperforming their American competitors overseas  this company is dominating Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  in the rapidly growing Indian e commerce market 
Needless to say  a global superpower like Amazon hates this situation 
Especially since two of its former employees are the entrepreneurial geniuses behind this thriving Indian company 
Indeed  Amazon has retaliated by throwing gobs of cash into the Indian market to establish a dominant position of its own 
Here s why its mission is doomed   and how you can turn a profit 
From Mud Hut to Metropolis
As humble  rags to riches  stories go  it doesn t get much more transformative than this 
Folklore has it that the Indian city of Bangalore was founded in 1537 when its ruler  Kempe Gowda  built a mud fort on the land 
Today  that humble hut has morphed into a thriving metropolis  making Bangalore the third largest city in India 
But Bangalore has one other accolade that most people don t know about 
It s a huge technology hub 
In fact  Bangalore is known as the  Silicon Valley of India    home to some of the country s biggest companies 
One of them is e commerce giant  Flipkart 
Like Bangalore itself  Flipkart had very humble beginnings  While companies like Amazon were ballooning into multi billion dollar behemoths  firing packages all over the world  Flipkart Co Founders  Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal  no relation   were hand delivering packages to their customers 
Yes  you read that right 
Flipkart s volumes were so low  its couriers would often refuse to provide service  So Sachin and Binny would hop on motorbikes and deliver packages themselves 
Imagine Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos showing up at your doorstep with the latest season of  Game of Thrones  on DVD 
Not gonna happen 
Today  however  Flipkart has reached a tipping point 
Venture Capital Throws in Another  1 Billion
In its latest round of funding last Tuesday  Flipkart raked in  1 billion from eight separate investors 
Some heavyweight investors  too   including the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation  GIC  and Morgan Stanley Expansion Capital 
In doing so  Flipkart has not only increased its funding and the number of investors involved  it s also become one of the world s most valuable venture backed startups 
Pretty impressive  considering the two Co Founders were often told to quit their venture and find real jobs 
Today  Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal are India s entrepreneurial poster boys  And these two pioneers are helping to revolutionize the emerging Indian e commerce market 
India s Booming E Commerce Market
For a start  consider that as mobile technology expands across India  the number of internet users is projected to hit 300 million by the end of this year   year over year growth of 35  
And as more players jump online  India s  internet economy  is growing faster than any other nation 
In 2009  for example  India s e commerce market was worth roughly  2 5 billion  In 2011  that number jumped to  6 3 billion  And in 2012  it more than doubled to  14 billion 
Aside from the jump in web usage  there are other key drivers behind India s e commerce growth 
Rising living standards and a flourishing middle class with larger disposable incomes 
The evolution of the online marketplace  led by sites like eBay  NASDAQ EBAY   These outlets also offer lower prices compared to brick and mortar retail stores 
Busier lifestyles and a growing population  which has resulted in more traffic congestion   and driving consumers to do more shopping online 
Increased broadband connectivity and 3G penetration 
More usage of online second hand selling sites 
Breaking it down further  about 75  of India s e commerce revenue is travel related   airline and train tickets  hotel bookings  car rentals  etc 
The rest is online retail   an area growing at an estimated compound annual growth rate  CAGR  of 30   That smashes the average global growth rate of between 8  and 10  
No wonder  then  that India s e commerce market is projected to be worth  24 billion by 2015 
And Flipkart s business is surging with it 
Want Growth  You Got It 
In 2013  Flipkart racked up  11 million in sales  But the growth rate is staggering 
Just seven months into 2014  the company is on pace to notch  100 million in revenue 
And in 2015  sales are forecast to surge 10 fold  hitting the  1 billion mark  led by its thriving HoN book product line  which accounts for 60  of annual revenue 
But danger lurks 
Watching India s exponential e commerce growth   and the roaring success of its two ex employees   from the cozy confines of its Seattle headquarters is Amazon 
And needless to say  it wants a large slice of this growing pie 
Amazon Opens Its Check Book
Last week  Jeff Bezos announced that the company will dip into its  8 billion cash hoard by investing  2 billion to expand its presence in India s wild e commerce market 
 At current scale and growth rates  India is on track to be our fastest country ever to  1 billion in gross sales  We ve never seen anything like this   Bezos declared 
Amazon does have a division in India called Junglee com  which enables customers to find products from third party retailers in India  But as it stands  Indian regulations prohibit the company from selling goods directly to Indian consumers  As a result  Amazon will be adding five additional fulfillment centers to help develop its  same day  delivery services 
The news comes on the heels of Flipkart s  1 billion investment into expanding its mobile operations 
You see what s brewing here 
Call it Bezos  capitalist spirit  or Amazon s competitive instincts if you want  but in the end  this is a good  old fashioned game of Family Feud 
As former Amazon software engineers  Flipkart s Founders knew exactly what they were doing when they targeted the Indian market   and exactly how to do it 
And the crucial advantage is that they started their Amazon like clone before Amazon got there 
In the tech word  we call that  first mover advantage  
As such  they re way ahead of Amazon already 
Amazon s reply is typical of a deep pocketed juggernaut  wanting to crush the competition and maximize shareholder value  Bezos is trying to slap his runaway children by doubling their investment 
But Amazon is well behind the curve here  And it smacks of a scatter gun approach to appease shareholders  following the failure of the recent Amazon Fire phone  which has seen shares tumble over the last few weeks 
Its high turnover  low margin business has many investors questioning its valuation   and I agree  Amazon is highly overvalued 
In fact  I ran the company through the  Cash  metric in my C H A O S  screener   and it points to a  head for the hills  verdict 
Amazon s presence in India won t do much for its eroding bottom line  either  Especially given the Indian regulations I mentioned earlier  plus the fact that it doesn t have a well developed  cash on delivery  model that caters to Indian society s reluctance to use credit cards 
By contrast  Flipkart s  home field advantage  means it does incorporate this aspect  The company knows its country s culture and the needs of its consumers  India has a vibrant cash economy  and 80  of its e commerce today is cash on delivery 
So while Amazon certainly poses competition for Flipkart  it won t impact the company s emergence as India s e commerce leader 
If you want to play Amazon s current share price woes  take a look at the September 2014  280 put options  Open interest on the contracts jumped by 4 185 on Friday

BSQUARE Corp   O BSQR  had an interesting day on Monday  up 21 cents to 10 45  or 2   It had a swing trade put on it  then it broke out  and went from 8 00 to 11 00 just since we talked about it  It is at the upper end of the target  The first target was 10  and then 11 3 4 12  It reached 10 previously  and then on Monday  it reached a high of 11 05 near the top of the channel  If it gets additional thrust up toward 12  maybe it will go higher  It looks like it will have to come into a consolidation mode  and eventually reach 14  or better 
Hawaiian Holdings Inc   O HA  airlines has been phenomenally strong  up another 75 cents to 35 59  or 2   on 1 8 million shares on Monday  It moved from 23 85 to 35 75  about 12 points in just 2 1 2 weeks straight up  It s a little long in the tooth  to say the least  According to the long term chart  it s headed to 45  So watch to see if it gets a pullback consolidation in that zone at 30 1 2 32  or maybe it will get a set up for the high 30s  low 40s 
PayPal Holdings  Inc   O PYPL  jumped another 1 45 to 36 44  or 4   on 11 5 million shares on Monday  After the IPO run up  and then a pullback in a 5 wave decline that was a retest of the lows  it moved up to resistance  backed off and retested  and then ran through it  There is some resistance  so expect a test of 37 short term  maybe Tuesday  but the target is 40 
Twitter  Inc   N TWTR  ran 61 cents to 30 89  or 2   on 16 8 million shares  on Monday  The set up is a right handed extended V  It pulled back to multiple session lows  broke out above the moving averages  and now the consolidation above the moving averages is a bullish one in my opinion  At this point  I am looking for a pull up through to 31 60  Once it does that  then the targets are 33 1 4  and 36 1 2

179299,400815,YNDX,Investors starting to show interest in Russia again  Credit Suisse,news,"By Polina Devitt and Katya Golubkova MOSCOW  Reuters    Investors are starting to look at Russia again after cutting off exposure amid geopolitical tensions two years ago  the head of Credit Suisse s  60 million Russian Equity Fund said  There are no big inflows yet but a rebound in Russian stock markets in the past few months as the oil price and the rouble have picked up is encouraging interest  Anna Vaananen told Reuters   The same people  I am seeing for the first time in two years  are now asking for an update on what is going on with the Russian market   Vaananen said   I think it is actually a real change    The top holdings in the Swiss bank s Russian Equity Fund include the country s largest lender Sberbank  MM SBER   retailers Magnit  MM MGNT  and X5  L PJPq   oil producer Lukoil  MM LKOH   the biggest search engine  Yandex   O YNDX  and the top mobile phone operator MTS  MM MTSS   As of the end of March  the fund had made a gross return of 7 4 percent since the start of this year but was down 9 9 percent over the past three years  Like other emerging markets  Russian equities have improved after a volatile start to the year  The Moscow stock exchange s dollar denominated RTS index  IRTS  is up 45 percent since its January lows on the back of higher oil prices and a strengthening of the rouble  The rouble based MICEX  MCX  is up 19 percent from January lows  While economic sanctions imposed on Russia and a weak economy kept investors away over the past two years  the price of oil  the country s chief export  has stabilized in the past few weeks while some Western investors say they hope sanctions will be softened in the coming months  Vaananen sees Russia s economy bottoming out during the second quarter and then starting to gradually recover  driven by declining inflation  falling interest rates and improving consumer confidence  Despite the economic slowdown  the state is still spending in areas that will drive consumption and so create opportunities for minority investors  she said  advocating consumer related stocks   If we look at the budget expenditure  it actually gives us an opportunity because the major part of the budget expenditure goes into pensions  public sector salaries  and     the military where there are a lot of salaries as well     and that money goes into consumption   she said  She expects consolidation to gain pace in sectors such as food retail  IT  Internet  transport and home building  as companies win market share from their weaker rivals  damaged by the lack of capital in the last two years  Shares of privately owned exporters  mainly in the metals and mining sector  which are not paying high taxes  may also start to look attractive to retail investors  Vaananen said  She also sees a chance that state run exporters  like Bashneft  MM BANE  and Alrosa  MM ALRS   would increase their dividend payments at some point to support regions where their main assets are based  She is more cautious about the oil and gas sector  which is the main source of state spending  paying 30 percent of its revenue in taxes  That limits the sector s own dividend potential for minority investors  she said  
 That s why I think one needs to be very realistic in the oil and gas sector   Vaananen said   They are more tactical investments sometimes  rather than fundamental investments for minority shareholders  ",2016-04-11,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/investors-starting-to-show-interest-in-russia-again:-credit-suisse-394632,394632
