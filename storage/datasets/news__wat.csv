12620,234135,WAT,Scientific Instruments Industry Outlook  Prospects Look Bright,opinion,The Zacks  industry comprises companies offering scientific instruments  analytical tools  diagnostic solutions  precision instruments   services  and test   sensor solutions The primary end markets served by the industry participants are life science research in academia  medical schools and government  pharmaceuticals and biotechnology  microbiology and diagnostics  nanotechnology and materials science research  A few companies also serve the food and nutritional safety  biochemical  and industrial space Most of the industry participants are under stringent regulatory scrutiny worldwide  They have to adhere to the U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA  norms as well as rules set by other global regulatory bodies for serving the highly regulated end markets like life sciences and pharma Here are the three major themes in the industry The industry is benefiting from strong end market demand  particularly from life science  pharmaceutical and academic markets  Increasing demand for generic drugs and biosimilars is driving growth for the scientific tool and apparatus providers  Additionally  pharma companies are focusing on rapidly growing areas like proteomics and phenomics  biopharma and applied  microbiology and diagnostics  and neuroscience and cell microscopy  which present significant growth opportunity for the instruments provided by industry participants  Socioeconomic factors like an aging demography and increasing environmental regulations are driving demand for scientific measurement solutions  Moreover  robust worldwide healthcare spending is a major growth driver  The  2 billion increase in the National Institute of Health  NIH  budget for fiscal 2019 also bodes well for this industry  Though most unlikely  the 12  cut in NIH budget for fiscal year 2020 proposed by President Donald Trump is a concern  Further  the industry is gaining from increasing exposure to developing economies like China and India  Prospects in China are huge as regulators are attempting to raise the country s biopharma industry to global standards  Moreover  efforts to improve the drug development process and production quality in the country are noteworthy  These factors are resulting in strong demand for instruments  Further  an anticipated near term solution to the trade war between the United States and China bodes well for some of the industry participants Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Solid ProspectsThe Zacks Instruments   Scientific industry is housed within the broader Zacks  sector  It carries a Zacks Industry Rank  57  which places it at the top 22  of more than 250 Zacks industries The group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank

12622,234137,WAT,Waters  WAT  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Waters  WAT  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 23  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of products used in drug discovery and development is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 73 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  8 8  
Revenues are expected to be  545 48 million  up 2 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Waters 
For Waters  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 23  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Waters will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Waters would post earnings of  2 65 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 87  delivering a surprise of  8 30  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Waters appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/waters-wat-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200407206,200407206

surprises  which the company broke just once as it reported in line earnings once last year  In fourth quarter 2017  Waters Corp  continued its impressive trend  as the company s adjusted earnings of  2 51 per share trumped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 44 by 2 9  The bottom line figure fared even better in year over year comparison  reflecting striking growth of 13 6  from the prior year quarter tally of  2 21  Remarkable broad based top line expansion  along with spectacular growth in Europe  aided the earnings beat Solid operational execution  backed by the company s efficient business model  also lent strength to the results  Further  a decline in interest expenses aided quarterly profits On a GAAP basis  Waters Corp  reported a loss of  4 44 per share compared with earnings of  2 15 in fourth quarter 2016  The company s GAAP profitability was adversely affected by a huge  one time expense of income tax of about  550 million For the full year  the company reported adjusted earnings of  7 49 per share  reflecting impressive growth of 14  over the previous year Inside the HeadlinesIn the reported quarter  Waters Corp  s net sales grew 9  year over year to  687 million and also came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  671 million  For the full year  revenues grew 7  year over year to  2 3 billion The upside in the quarter s top line came on the back of robust performance in the bio pharmaceutical end markets  up 11  year over year   and the government and academic market  up 17  year over year   The momentum was further backed by 3  growth in the industrial end markets Also  impressive contribution from sale of key products across major geographies supplemented quarterly sales growth  In addition  Water Corp  s recurring revenues and instrument system sales climbed 12  and 7   respectively  driving top line growth In terms of geographies  Waters Corp  witnessed strong sales in Europe  United States and Asia  which posted 16   9  and 7  growth  respectively  Overall sales in the Americas rebounded from the earlier weakness  and rose 6  year over year Total selling and administrative expenses in the quarter came in at  148 8 million  up from  130 2 million incurred in fourth quarter 2016  Research and development outlay for the quarter was  35 1 million compared with  32 8 million incurred a year ago Despite the rise in

from  2 4 billion as on Dec 31  2016 Our TakeWaters Corp  s leading position in the high performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry markets is its key strength that has acted as a sturdy revenue driver for the past few quarters  The company s bright pharmaceutical business ended 2017 on a healthy note and looks set to continue its momentum into 2018 as well  It is also seeing encouraging trends in its industrial businesses  The governmental and academic markets have also turned its performance around and look poised to maintain the growth trend  in the coming quarters Waters Corp  s exposure in the pharma biotech industry is primarily in regulated commercial lab environments  where demand is non discretionary and not prone to cyclicality  This helps the company mitigate uncertain client spending stemming from macroeconomic volatility  Additionally  given the fact that liquid chromatography is used in a huge variety of applications  Waters Corp  is well poised to benefit significantly from this business in the near future Zacks Rank   Key PicksWaters Corp  currently holds a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  Some better ranked stocks in the broader sector include

Further  Toyota plans to sell 5 5 million of electrified vehicles by 2030 for which it is collaborating with many companies to develop batteries  Additionally  by 2025  it has planned to sell vehicles either with a dedicated electrified model or an electrified option  The company is also focusing on the reuse and recycling of batteries for which it is promoting the usage of plug in vehicle charging and hydrogen refueling stations

Shares of United Parcel Service have underperformed the Zacks Air Freight and Cargo industry as well as rival FedEx  NYSE FDX  in the last one year  While the stock has gained  1 4   the industry has advanced  11 9   Shares of FedEx have gained  28 6  in the period  
Despite this unimpressive price performance  the Zacks analyst thinks the rapid improvement in e commerce is aiding UPS significantly  The new tax law  which reduces corporate tax rate significantly  is also a positive for the company  
In February 2018  UPS announced its decision to increase quarterly dividends by 10   A further uptick in such shareholder friendly activities cannot be ruled out  in the light of the savings induced by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act  The company s efforts to expand globally also raise optimism in the stock  However  high costs continue to limit bottom line growth  UPS  forecast for 2018 capex  which is higher than 2017 levels  is expected to push up costs further

Nevertheless  the Zacks analyst thinks the company s growing cloud market share will continue to drive top line growth in the long haul  Further  partnerships with the likes of Accenture are helping the company rapidly expand its cloud base clientele  
Moreover  this has helped in improving the company s competitive position against the likes of salesforce com and Workday  Anticipated strong demand for the next generation autonomous database supported by machine learning will boost competitive position against AWS  However  higher investments on IaaS platform will affect gross margin expansion in the near term

Moreover  Vale s aggregate iron ore  pellets  coal  cobalt and gold output levels improved on a year over year basis in fourth quarter 2017  In addition  the Zacks analyst thinks steady improvement in operational efficacy on the back of greater cost discipline and higher mining productivity will likely work in the company s favor  Vale is even deleveraging its balance sheet with its ongoing liability management program

12712,234227,WAT,5 Technology Stocks Still Worth Buying At Fresh Highs ,opinion,As the Q2 earnings cycle draws to a close  Technology has emerged as one of the best performing sectors  Based on the  total market cap in the index that have been declared as of Aug 12  the industry has outperformed rather remarkably Total earnings for these companies have dipped 0 8  on 3 1  higher revenues  Despite the bleak year over year comparisons  a whopping 82  beat earnings estimates  while 72  exceeded top line expectations  thanks to the better than expected results of sector giants like Facebook   NASDAQ FB    Google s parent Alphabet   NASDAQ GOOGL    Apple   NASDAQ AAPL    Microsoft   NASDAQ MSFT   and Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   The sector s strong quarterly performance wooed investors  resulting in the Technology Sector SPDR  peaking to a 16 year high recently  Several market watchers believe that the sector may surge even higher backed by strong fundamentals  impressive earnings from the behemoths and prospects of a weaker dollar Naturally  investing in the tech space makes perfect sense at this point  However  making the right choices is a tough task No matter how disciplined and systematic an investor you are  equity market volatility will always be a concern  Only a few lucky ones would rake in the moolah  while others fall victim to ad hoc strategies So  wouldn t it be a safer bet to invest in stocks that are winning currently and have the potential to gain further Here  we will discuss one tried and tested technique   picking stocks near their 52 week highs Why 52 Week Highs can be a Good IndicatorInvesting in stocks that are trading near their 52 week highs bears the risk of falling fast as the market might consider them overvalued  But there is more on the positive side  There may be a broad set of factors including impressive sales  robust profitability and bullish earnings prospects driving the stocks up  Recent major developments may also send these stocks soaring So  investing in stocks near their 52 week high is akin to following the momentum strategy  which is based on the understanding that once a trend is established  it is likely to continue Notably  momentum investors strongly believe in  the trend is your friend   which means stocks that are growing will continue to grow  They make short term choices among stocks that are scaling up and sell them at the first sign of a downtrend  The basic idea is that once a trend is recognized  it is likely to retain that direction and will not move against the flow Thus  gambling on these stocks might help investors earn higher returns in the short term  However  this is only a speculative strategy and not meant for the faint hearted Where to Put Your Money Blended with strong

12721,234236,WAT,Water Corp  s Momentum Intact On Solid Biopharma Prospects,opinion,On Nov 21  we issued an updated research report on Milford  MA based Waters Corporation   NYSE WAT    an analytical instrument manufacturer which specializes in innovating practical and sustainable products for laboratory dependent organizations  The company currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  Last month  Waters Corp  reported in line earnings in the third quarter of 2016  However  the company fared much better with respect to year over year comparisons  reflecting growth of 10 6  from the prior year quarter tally Continued top line growth and disciplined expense management proved conducive to the bottom line performance  Also  improved operational execution  backed by the company s efficient business model  supplemented earnings growth However  the company s top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Post the earnings report  the Zacks Consensus Estimate trended south over the last 30 days  falling 0 3  to  6 55 for 2016 and 0 4  to  7 13 for 2017 The company s key growth drivers remain strong momentum across pharmaceutical end markets  along with striking growth in recurring revenue products  During third quarter 2016  the company s global pharmaceuticals business sales grew 13  on a year over year basis  spread across all significant pharmaceutical workflows and major geographic regions  Particularly  the company is seeing remarkable growth in core small molecule QA QC workflows  as well as in large molecule R D oriented applications The industrial sector  however  has lagged in recent times  as global weakness in the chemical industry translated into slower growth in both the TA Instruments and Waters product lines  Further  Waters Corp  has been grappling with challenging governmental and academic demand  with pronounced softness in Japan  Europe and the U S  In the third quarter of 2016  the segment saw a 15  year over year decline Waters Corp  s exposure in the pharma biotech industry is primarily in regulated commercial lab environments  where demand is non discretionary and not prone to cyclicality  This helps the company mitigate uncertain client spending stemming from macroeconomic volatility  Also  given the fact that liquid chromatography is used in a variety of applications including drug discovery  development  quality control of drug products  therapeutic drug monitoring  proteomics  metabolomics  environmental analysis and food analysis  Waters Corp  stands to benefit significantly from this business going forward Waters Corp  s leading position in the high performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry markets remains a major strength that has driven revenues substantially over the past few quarters  Further  we believe that the company s recently completed acquisitions will supplement its core businesses For instance  Waters Corp  s TA division has been benefitting significantly from the previous buyouts  The company s recently acquired ElectroForce Group   which specializes in manufacturing mechanical testing systems based on a proprietary electromagnetic motor technology   will continue to supplement growth  Also  the inclusion of Rapid Evaporative Ionization Mass Spectrometry technology in business bodes well for the company as it will reduce its dependence on pharmaceuticals and higher end academic research orders The company expects the trend to continue and drive 6  sales growth in 2016  Moreover  it has a rich pipeline comprising innovative new products that are slated for launch in the quarters ahead Waters Corp  s liquidity position has been improving  with cash  cash equivalents and investments increasing to around  2 7 billion at the end of third quarter 2016 from  2 4 billion as on Dec 31  2015  Also  the company is dedicated toward improving its shareholders  value through steady dividend payouts and share repurchases Yet  Waters Corp  remains vulnerable to stiff competition from several instrument manufacturers  Also  escalating debt levels and R D costs could put pressure on margins  Further  inconsistent spending in the governmental and academic markets raises concerns WATERS CORP Price and Consensus    Stocks to ConsiderSome better ranked stocks in the broader computer   technology sector include Adobe Systems Incorporated   NASDAQ ADBE    Aspen Technology  Inc    NASDAQ AZPN   and Guidance Software  Inc    NASDAQ GUID    each carrying a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  Adobe Systems is a leading player in the computer software space  The company has a striking earnings surprise history for the trailing four quarters  having beaten estimates all through  for an average of 5 6  Aspen Technology deals in process optimization software and services  It boasts a remarkable average surprise of 23 6  in the trailing four quarters  having surpassed estimates strongly in each of them Guidance Software  an industry leader in digital investigative solutions  also has an impressive earnings history  having beaten estimates in all four trailing quarters  for an average of 18 6  Zacks  Best Private Investment Ideas In addition to the

12733,234248,WAT,Water  The World s Most Important Commodity,opinion,"It s quite the strange duality when you think about it  Undoubtedly  water is the single most important thing on earth 
Ok  so maybe it s the second most important thing  sorry  oxygen    but you get the idea 
If I go to the store and there s no bread  I would be shocked  and certainly annoyed  and that d be about it  But  if I turn on my faucet and nothing comes out  I m about 15 hours away from turning into Mad Max   and so are you So  why is water so underappreciated  Why  when I live in a state that s experiencing a  that could become economically catastrophic in a heartbeat  can my home water bill be just 75 bucks a month  It s because water doesn t act like crude oil  or any other commodity for that matter  It s heavily regulated at the municipal  state  and federal level  It explains why projects like the Carlsbad Desalinization Plant  which will soon be the  in the western hemisphere  don t have 100  slam dunk economics in their favor from day one No  we re far from the day when an Elon Musk type comes in with a massive private effort to supply water and reinvigorate the industry  the costs are just too great to get started  the time to get approvals too long  the current  too poor  and the potential profits too murky to justify the capital outlay So What s the Answer I won t bury the lead here I don t know what the answers are  I don t know what the technological answers are  I don t know where the money is supposed to come from  and I would never be so masochistic as to try to understand the local politics involved 
But  I know that we need fresh water for quenching the thirst and irrigating the crops for an ever growing population  and since less than 1  of our planet s water is fresh water  desalinization sure seems like a no brainer  Yes  it s horribly energy inefficient right now  but if history is any guide at all  we can innovate that imbalance away  My cell phone today has 10 times the RAM that my desktop had 18 years ago  All we need is the will and we can figure out most anything  So far  the will hasn t been there  but I m convinced we ll see it soon  either by choice or necessity  Unfortunately  it will probably be the latter 
ETF Plays in the Water SpaceAll the murkiness in the future of water makes it ideal to approach with ETFs rather than trying to pick individual stocks  There are four main ETFs that focus on water utilities  infrastructure suppliers  and related services I want to find the best single name in this group of four ETFs  so I ve loaded up a custom peer group in Capital Cube to review their most important metrics side by side  As a basis for comparison  I ve also loaded up the largest sector ETFs for utilities and industrial stocks  XLU and XLI   as well as the SPY to represent the broad market 

The NYSE Arca PowerShares Water Resource Port  NYSE PHO  is the largest of the bunch  with just under  1 billion in assets under management  It s a rather focused ETF  having only 29 holdings in companies that  create products designed to  for homes  businesses  and industries   The underlying index is focused on U S  based companies  as we can see from the Capital Cube breakdown 

There is a also a first cousin fund to the PHO in the PowerShares Global Water  ARCA PIO   a  284 million AUM fund that contains 38 holdings and is free to invest via non U S  stock exchanges  As a result  only 47  of the assets are in U S    domiciled companies  although many of the same top 10 holdings show up in both funds  specifically  picks   shovels  plays like Flowserve Corporation  NYSE FLS  and Waters Corporation  NYSE WAT  Rounding out the four is the FFirstTrust ISE Water  NYSE FIW  and the Guggenheim S P Global Water  NYSE CGW   The FIW is a bit illiquid for my taste  at just  190 million in assets  but it has notably outperformed its peers over the past three and five years  Both the FIW and the Guggenheim offering are heavily invested in the water utility companies  parking over 25  of assets there  And it makes me wary of choosing either fund Not Keen on the Water Utilities AngleI try to always find the big  secular trends first  then go find the companies poised to benefit the most  In the case of water  I m not sure that the utilities   the folks that actually deliver the water to your tap   are poised to benefit  They are very restricted in the prices they can charge  and the water utility industry is highly fragmented  so the few publicly traded stocks that we do have are pitifully small  the top 5 amount to less than  14 billion in combined market cap   And lest we forget   these utilities operate within a crumbling infrastructure that will require actual movement in state   federal legislatures  in other words  I m not holding my breath for change 
Investor Takeaways
Invest in the  picks and shovels  companies that supply water treatment solutions  and infrastructure equipment   specifically in the area of water distribution  storage  and transport  This is where we have the biggest need for an upgrade  Whether the money comes from the government or the private sector  we can confidently assume that these companies will be winning the bulk of new construction and service contracts 
If you re as bullish as I am on the future prospects for water based industries  consider swapping in some PHO or PIO for your existing equity exposure  I d lean towards PHO for the extra liquidity and the U S  focus 
If you decide that you want some exposure to the water utilities  go with the CGW over the FIW  the Guggenheim ETF is more diversified  has twice the assets under management  and a lower annual volatility 
All of these ETFs are reconstituted annually  so if a new company invents something marvelous that adds economic benefit to the water industries  chances are these ETFs will add the stock to the fold in due time  Utilize the benefits of ETFs and outsource some of your research when it comes to water stocks

12735,234250,WAT,Market Overview Of The German DAX And EUR JPY,opinion,"Let s take a look at the German shares index  FDAX  first  Since yesterday was a holiday  which could also observed in the DAX   there was not so much movement  In the big picture we have various trend sizes  as well as in the daily chart where we are actually in a valid upwards trend 

The market has turned back around and gone into its correction zone  but as long as it does not fall under the large low point at 8350 it s simply a large correction  The small medium trend is pointing downwards in the daily chart  as is the small trend  Embedded in here is another inferior trend  running up to the beginning of the correction zone  Here we have the first potential for recovery  we will see how strong this correction is and whether it can form a bottom 

We have an upwards trend with this opening candle in the futures markets and a new correction zone 9245 and 9188  As long as the zone remains intact  the market can keep moving up  However  if the zone is the probability rises that the gap will be closed  It may not look like there is much buying pressure upwards  but the chances are there 
In the one hour chart of the EUR JPY the trend corrected into correction zone with more then 50   there is no signal in the superior trend  I would need a closing price below  and would be careful here 

I want to come out of deeper corrections in all trends  For example  in the 1 Min chart you can see how deep out of the correction zone we are coming 

The end of day screening shows signals in Agilent Technologies  N A   Here we have a nice young trend has gone nicely into the correction with some space  the superior trend is already in there  and the small trend in the day is also in a correction zone  It is a valid trend that we can work with 
In the 1 hour chart of the Sociedad Qu mica y Minera  N SQM   we definitely have a valid signal with space on lower side  There are also nice support points down below 
Waters Corporation  N WAT  has a small trend which looks very nice  not too mature  has also corrected quite deeply  giving a bigger chance of getting to the profit zone faster  The superior trend has also corrected far  There is still space for this trend to carry on downwards 
There is a long signal in the Dupont Fabros Technology  N DFT   It has a correction to the first point two  then broke off the first phase but it is a young trend and corrected back into the correction zone  There is a support point at 3834  the last big point two  This is a value where there are more positive points than negative points  and a definite possibility

12736,234251,WAT,Can Waters Corp   WAT  Keep the Earnings Streak Alive ,opinion,"We expect Waters Corporation   NYSE WAT   to beat earnings expectations when it reports first quarter 2016 results  before the opening bell  on Apr 26 
In the last reported quarter  Waters Corp  posted a positive earnings surprise of 0 5   The company boasts a solid earnings track record lately  with the company beating earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters  The average earnings surprise over the last four quarters is 6 3   

We expect the company to continue its upbeat performance in the to be reported quarter 
Why a Likely Positive Surprise 
Our proven model shows that Waters Corp  is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients 
Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  stands at  1 63   This is a very meaningful and leading indicator of a likely earnings surprise 
Zacks Rank  Waters Corp  carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy    2  Buy  or  3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates  Meanwhile  Sell rated stocks   4 and  5  should never be considered going into an earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
The combination of Waters Corp  s Zacks Rank  2 and ESP of  1 63  makes us confident of an earnings beat in the upcoming report 
Growth Factors This Past Quarter
Waters Corp  s leading position in the high performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry markets is its key strength that has acted as a strong revenue driver over the past few quarters  The company expects its pharmaceutical business to generate healthy profits for the quarter under review as well  As liquid chromatography is used in a variety of applications including drug discovery  development  quality control of drug products  therapeutic drug monitoring  proteomics  metabolomics  environmental analysis  and food analysis  Waters Corp  stands to benefit significantly from this business 
As a matter of fact  Waters Corp  s exposure in the pharma biotech industry is primarily in regulated commercial lab environments  where demand is non discretionary and not prone to cyclicality  This cushions the company from the vagaries of client spending thereby favoring financial performance  Moreover  the company has also been constantly expanding its technological and business portfolio through its acquisition strategy 
In this regard  we believe previously acquired businesses like ElectroForce Group  which specializes in manufacturing mechanical testing systems based on a proprietary electromagnetic motor technology  are expected to be conducive to first quarter 2016 results 
In addition  innovative product launches has always been Waters Corp  s strong suite that has fuelled top line performance  Steady traction of some of the previously launched products by the company including CORTECS C8 and CORTECS Phenyl  Waters ProteinWorks Digest Kits  Oasis PRiME HLB  Discovery DSC 2500  DSC 250 and DSC 25 are expected to drive the first quarter results 
Also  the recently upgraded REIMS research system and revamped portfolio of CORTECS Solid Core LC Columns are expected to widen the customer base of the company going forward  Despite these positives  exchange rate volatility and escalating debt levels and interest expenses may thwart the growth momentum at the company to some extent 
Stocks That Warrant a Look
Here are some companies that you may want to consider  as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter

12840,234355,WAT,Scientific Instruments Industry Outlook  Prospects Look Good,opinion,The Zacks  industry comprises companies offering scientific instruments  analytical tools  diagnostic solutions  precision instruments   services  and test   sensor solutions The primary end markets served by the industry participants are life science research in academia  medical schools and government  pharmaceuticals and biotechnology  microbiology and diagnostics  nanotechnology  and materials science research  A few companies also serve the food and nutritional safety  biochemical  and industrial space Most of the industry participants are under stringent regulatory scrutiny worldwide  They have to adhere to the U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA  norms as well as rules set by other global regulatory bodies for serving highly regulated end markets like life sciences and pharma Here are the three major themes in the industry The industry is benefiting from strong end market demand  particularly from life science  pharmaceutical and academic markets  Increasing demand for generic drugs and biosimilars is driving growth for scientific tool and apparatus providers  Additionally  pharma companies are focusing on rapidly growing areas like proteomics and phenomics  biopharma and applied  microbiology and diagnostics  and neuroscience and cell microscopy  which creates significant demand for the instruments provided by industry participants  Socioeconomic factors like an aging demography and increasing environmental regulations are driving demand for scientific measurement solutions  Moreover  robust worldwide healthcare spending is a major growth driver  The  2 billion increase in the National Institute of Health  NIH  budget for fiscal 2019 also bodes well for this industry  Additionally  a spending panel at the U S  House of Representatives has proposed a  2 billion raise in the NIH budget to  41 1 billion for fiscal 2020  beginning October 2019  The proposal contradicts President Donald Trump s 12  cut in NIH budget for fiscal 2020  Further  the industry is gaining from increasing exposure to developing economies like China and India  Prospects in China are huge as regulators are attempting to raise the country s biopharma industry to global standards  Moreover  efforts to improve the drug development process and production quality in the country are noteworthy  These factors are resulting in strong demand for instruments  However  the ongoing trade war between the United States and China doesn t bode well for some of the industry participants Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Solid ProspectsThe Zacks Instruments   Scientific industry is housed within the broader Zacks  sector  It carries a Zacks Industry Rank  110  which places it at the top 43  of more than 250 Zacks industries The group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates solid near term prospects  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 The industry s positioning in the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries is a result of positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio  let s take a look at the industry s recent stock market
