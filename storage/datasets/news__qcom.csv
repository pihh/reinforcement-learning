106706,328221,QCOM,Telecom Stock Earnings  Predictions For VZ  GLW And QRVO,opinion,The Technology sector  of which Telecom is an essential part  is likely to be a drag on overall fourth quarter earnings  The sector is expected to have taken a beating from the on again off again trade war skirmishes that sent confusing signals to the market  Sector revenues  particularly within the chip industry  are expected to have declined significantly as the market bore the brunt of tariffs and counter tariffs  awaiting the trade deal Various trade restrictions on grounds of national security concerns hampered the supply chain mechanism of the companies and eroded sector margins  In addition  higher infrastructure investments are expected to have escalated operating costs as 5G deployments picked up pace across the United States Upfront investment in capital and wireless spectrum for 5G has proven to be substantially higher than prior generations of wireless deployments due to network density requirements  potentially hurting return of capital metrics  The potential for meaningful revenues to lag 5G buildouts poses significant credit risks for providers pursing aggressive deployments Technological advances have changed the way consumers communicate  resulting in higher data consumption and video streaming  But intense competition and commoditization of services have limited the chance to benefit from these trends    As we know  Technology and Finance are the two biggest earnings contributors to the S P 500 and they are pulling the index s growth picture in

106711,328226,QCOM,Telecom Stock Roundup  AT T  Corning Trump Q4 Earnings Estimates   More,opinion,In the past five trading days  telecom stocks mirrored the broader S P 500 Index and trended down amid fears of coronavirus outbreak hurting the global economy  With the U S  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reporting the first case of the contagious disease in the country  the markets remained apprehensive about possible repercussions  However  as the onus shifted to the corporate earnings season  markets gradually scripted a turnaround at the later stages of the week  driven by healthy sector earnings China has been one of the most important markets for U S  telecom firms  Despite quarantines and other safety measures  coronavirus  which originated in Wuhan  China  reportedly spread across continents  disrupting normal business operations and supply chain mechanisms of various companies  Widespread fears of a similar pandemic led by the SARS outbreak in the country in 2003 fueled uncertainty within the rank and files in the industry  leading to a downtrend  Most companies preferred to exercise caution and held their delivery schedules to and from the communist nation until the health risks were neutralized    The U S  Department of Justice has sought temporary restraining orders on five domestic companies for fostering the robocall menace  The federal authorities are actively trying to eliminate the spurious calls that threaten to con unsuspecting customers and have asked the telecom firms to step up efforts in this regard Meanwhile  defying President Trump s advisories  the U K  government has allowed China based telecom equipment manufacturer Huawei to play a limited role in the 5G mobile network rollout across the country  Although Huawei s participation has been mostly restricted to non core areas that do not involve  sensitive functions   it is likely to encourage other EU countries to follow suit and allow the company to gain a sizeable share in European markets  This  in turn  is likely to sow seeds of disharmony among the United States and its allies and compound problems for the industry in the future  The battle lines for 5G dominance is likely to be redrawn as Huawei CFO is fighting the U S  extradition case in Canada  with a probable escalation in other prohibitory orders   Regarding company

204205,425721,QCOM,SoftBank owned Arm to launch new AI chip for small devices,news," Reuters    Arm Ltd  a semiconductor technology firm owned by SoftBank Group  unveiled a chip technology aimed at putting artificial intelligence functions on tiny devices such as sensors designed to detect patterns in human speech or other streams of data 
Arm  which provides chip technology to mobile phone semiconductor suppliers like Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  and end device makers like Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   has been diversifying its customer base in recent years to markets such as self driving cars 
It has also expanded to target areas like the  internet of things    in which many everyday devices such as traffic lights or agricultural irrigation systems will be fitted with internet connected sensors and automated 
Arm on Monday released the new Cortex M55 processor paired with what it calls its Ethos U55  neural processing unit  
Chips with the technology will hit the market in 2021 and aim to carry out the special kinds of math needed by artificial intelligence  AI  software that can detect vibrations or pick out spoken keywords from a user 
The chips are designed to function with very low amounts of electricity  That allows devices such as sensors to last for years at a time on a small battery and to only connect to the internet when needed 
Minimizing internet connections can help protect privacy by processing data locally and sending only what is needed to remote servers while discarding the rest  Arm executives said 
Many fields such as health care will require data to be processed locally  with little or none of the results sent back to remote servers  Dipti Vachani  senior vice president and general manager of Arm s automotive and internet of things line of business  told Reuters 
 You may not want that data to move around   Vachani said 
The new technology  is going to give you low power processing  to process data where it is best suited  where you want to keep that data  ",2020-02-10,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/softbankowned-arm-to-launch-new-ai-chip-for-small-devices-2080574,2080574
204206,425722,QCOM,Did Investors Overreact to Qualcomm s Covid 19 Warning ,news,"Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  recently posted first quarter numbers that beat Wall Street s expectations  The chipmaker s revenue rose 5  annually to  5 08 billion  topping estimates by  250 million  Its non GAAP earnings fell 18  to  0 99 per share  but still cleared expectations by  0 14 
Qualcomm expects its second quarter revenue to rise 2  19  annually  and for its non GAAP EPS to decline 21  33   The midpoint of those estimates surpassed analysts  expectations for 6  revenue growth and a 29  decline in earnings 
However  Qualcomm also widened the range of its EPS guidance to account for the Covid 19 outbreak in China  Instead of a typical  0 10 range for its guidance  Qualcomm widened the lower end of its second quarter guidance by a nickel  from  0 85  0 95 to  0 80  0 95 
That adjustment was minor  but management s comments regarding Covid 19  which is also referred to as the coronavirus  during the conference call raised red flags and triggered a sell off  Let s look back at those comments and see if investors overreacted to the chipmaker s warnings 

What did Qualcomm say about Covid 19 
CEO Steve Mollenkopf called the Covid 19 outbreak an  unprecedented situation  during the call  and CFO Akash Palkhiwala warned of  significant uncertainty  regarding the new virus s impact on the smartphone supply chain and consumer demand 
Palkhiwala stated that the  0 05 reduction to the bottom end of the company s second quarter guidance reflected the information Qualcomm had  at this point   and that it would  continue to monitor  the situation 
In the accompanying 10 Q filing  Qualcomm warned that the Covid 19 outbreak could throttle the production capabilities of its suppliers with quarantines and closures  reduce consumer demand  and  negatively impact  its business and operations 
Another headache in China
Qualcomm already faces major challenges in China  Its QCT  chipmaking  business  which generates most of its revenue  faces competition from first party chipmakers like Huawei 

Its QTL  licensing  business  which generates most of its profits with high margin licensing fees  is also struggling to strike a new licensing deal with Huawei  Huawei  which claims that Qualcomm s fees are too high  stopped paying per device licensing fees last year  and only agreed to interim payments of  150 million per quarter 
Qualcomm also warned that its licensing agreements with other Chinese OEMs  which were signed over the past five years  are only effective for a  specified term     which suggests that other handset makers could eventually join Huawei s rebellion 
The trade war between the U S  and China also forced major OEMs like Huawei to develop new smartphones that don t use any American components  Huawei s Mate 30  for example  uses a mobile SoC and baseband modem from its own subsidiary HiSilicon instead of Qualcomm  The Chinese government is also actively sponsoring the development of domestic chips  which could eventually threaten Qualcomm s sales of mobile chipsets and baseband modems 
Qualcomm s total revenue from China plunged 23  annually to  11 6 billion in 2019  but still accounted for 48  of its top line  In short  the chipmaker already faces significant challenges in the country  and Covid 19 could exacerbate that pain by disrupting its supply chain and throttling handset sales across the country 
Did investors overreact to Qualcomm s warning 
Qualcomm s stock rallied nearly 80  over the past 12 months  so it wasn t surprising to see some investors take profits as storm clouds gathered  Qualcomm s guidance adjustment was minor  but its comments about Covid 19 suggest that uglier reductions could be right around the corner 
As a result  it s tough to tell if analysts  forecasts for 16  revenue growth and 20  earnings growth this year are still valid  If they are  Qualcomm s stock still looks cheap at 14 times forward earnings 
I don t think Qualcomm s investors should panic and sell their shares yet  However  investors should closely monitor the Covid 19 epidemic and Qualcomm s shifting challenges in China  If those headwinds wane  it could signal a good time to accumulate Qualcomm s shares at a discount to its earnings growth ",2020-02-12,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/ptw0n,2082088

Mauricio Lopez Hodoyan    Vice President of Investor Relations
Thank you and good afternoon everyone  Today s call will include prepared remarks by Steve Mollenkopf and Akash Palkhiwala  In addition  Cristiano Amon  Alex Rogers and Don Rosenberg will join the question and answer session  You can access our earnings release and the slide presentation that accompany this call on our Investor Relations website  In addition  this call is being webcast on qualcomm com and a replay will be available on our website later today 
During the call today  we will use non GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G and you can find the related reconciliations to GAAP on our website  We will also make forward looking statements including projections and estimates of future events  business or industry trends or business or financial results  Actual events or results could differ materially from those projected in our forward looking statements  Please refer to our SEC filings  including our most recent 10 K which contain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements  And now to comments from Qualcomm s Chief Executive Officer  Steve Mollenkopf 
Steve Mollenkopf    Chief Executive Officer
Thank you  Mauricio  and good afternoon everyone  We are pleased to report strong results in the first fiscal quarter with non GAAP earnings of  0 99 per share  above the high end of our guidance range  led by strength in our chip business  We are also pleased to see strong year over year revenue growth in our licensing business  As you can see from our strong results  our business reached a key inflection point exiting fiscal Q1  demonstrating the positive financial impact of our 5G strategy to grow our addressable dollar content per device with higher performing core chipsets and new RF front end content 
Virtually all of our 5G Snapdragon design wins are using our RF front end solutions for 5G sub 6 and or millimeter wave  including design wins based on our second generation solutions  As we continue to execute on our RF front end strategy  we are pleased to see our RF design win pipeline contribute to the strength of our quarterly results and our outlook  We are in a strong position with leading technology and intellectual property and the best products in the Company s history  Our 5G roadmap extends beyond Release 17  placing us on the cusp of a multi decade mobile transformation as 5G increasingly becomes the foundation for the digital transformation of industries beyond smartphones 
Turning to QTL  we have now signed over 80 5G license agreements  up from 75 license agreements last November  Most recently we signed extensions with two key Chinese OEMs through the end of March as we work to complete long term 5G license agreements  Let me now spend some time updating you on 5G traction globally  As we start the year  there are over 345 operators in nearly 120 countries investing in 5G including 45 operators in over 20 countries that have launched commercial 5G services  spanning both sub 6 and millimeter wave spectrum  Looking forward  we continue to expect millimeter wave to be deployed in all regions 
Additionally  more than 45 OEMs have launched or announced commercial 5G devices  many of which are using our Snapdragon 5G platforms  On the product side  we recently introduced our flagship Snapdragon 865 mobile platform that we expect will power many premium tier Android smartphones this year  We also introduced the Snapdragon 765 and 765 gaming mobile platforms with an integrated 5G modem  With over 275 5G devices announced or in development spanning multiple price tiers  our product offerings will help make 5G more accessible to consumers 
We also expanded our 4G lineup with new mobile platforms that enable our partners to offer sophisticated solutions that meet global 4G demand  particularly in emerging economies across multiple tiers and price segments  Turning to Korea  last December all three Korean operators combined reported approximately 4 7 million 5G subscribers and are forecasting continued growth throughout calendar year 2020  We see Korea as a leading indicator for the pace of 5G adoption  Of note  the expected 5G subscriber growth is not just isolated to the sub 6 frequency bands  Carriers are planning millimeter wave service in 2020 
Turning to China  5G device sell in increased through December  The China Academy of Telecommunication Research reported selling of 13 million 5G handsets in calendar Q4 2019  Importantly  5G handset sell in penetration reached 19  in December 2019  We are already seeing devices priced as low as RMB2 000 or approximately  285  At this point  5G can address approximately 40  of domestic China smartphone sales 
In the US  the 5G network build out is progressing well at the top four carriers across sub 6 and millimeter wave spectrum  Verizon is leading the deployment of enhanced mobile broadband with millimeter wave service in 31 cities and is expanding their device roadmap to approximately 20 new 5G products this year  T Mobile s 5G network now covers more than 200 million people and more than 1 million square miles across the United States  AT T expects to have nationwide 5G coverage by calendar Q2 and Sprint expanded their 5G network coverage to nine metropolitan areas 
I would also like to highlight two recent developments on spectrum in the United States that will help drive even greater momentum for 5G  First  the FCC gave final approval for commercial use of the CBRS band  taking advantage of spectrum sharing techniques that we and others in the industry began working on years ago  The CBRS band is well suited for enterprise  smart city and industrial IoT deployments  And second  the FCC s latest millimeter wave auction  which includes the largest amount of millimeter wave spectrum ever up for bid in an auction is ongoing and will bring up to 3 4 gigahertz of additional millimeter wave spectrum to the US market 
Turning to automotive  as a measure of our continued automotive success  our design win pipeline is now over  7 billion  up from  5 5 billion a year ago  which does not include any impact from our recently launched autonomous driving platform  Snapdragon Ride  We continue to benefit from our systems level expertise  expanding our automotive solutions to include an autonomous driving platform  Snapdragon Ride  With a long history of automotive innovation  we have now become a trusted advisor to many of the world s leading automakers  Over 125 million vehicles use our broad range of automotive solutions  including telematics  in car connectivity and infotainment platforms 
Our Snapdragon Ride ADAS platform represents a significant expansion of our addressable market  We look forward to seeing our Snapdragon Ride ADAS and autonomous solutions on the road in 2023  We are very pleased with the FCC s unanimous vote in December to move forward with allocating spectrum in the 5 9 gigahertz band for cellular vehicle to everything technology  Since that vote we are seeing traction for cellular V2X in the 5 9 gigahertz band across regions 
Looking forward  we continue to remain optimistic about our growth opportunities in IoT  always connected PCs and cloud AI  Lastly  as the coronavirus situation continues to unfold  our thoughts are with the many Qualcomm employees in China  our customers and suppliers  their families  as well as those who are impacted by this unprecedented situation  As Akash will share with you  we have considered the impact of the Corona virus in our forward guidance based on the limited information we have at this time  I would now like to turn the call over to Akash 
Akash Palkhiwala    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thank you  Steve  and good afternoon everyone  I will begin with a discussion of first fiscal quarter earnings  Our results demonstrated strong execution with revenues of  5 1 billion at the high end of our guidance range and non GAAP earnings per share of  0 99   0 14 above the midpoint of our guidance  The outperformance in the quarter was driven by strength in QCT across 5G  RF front end and adjacent platforms with revenues of  3 6 billion and EBT margin of 13   which was above the high end of our guidance range 
MSM shipments of 155 million units were consistent with the midpoint of our guidance  QTL delivered revenues of  1 4 billion  a 38  increase year over year and EBT margins of 72   reflecting the benefit of a seasonally high quarter  We returned approximately  1 5 billion to stockholders during the quarter  consisting of  710 million in dividends and  762 million in stock repurchases  With that I d like to turn to our global 3G  4G 5G device forecast 
We continue to expect approximately 1 75 billion devices for calendar 2019  Our forecast for calendar 2020 remains unchanged at 1 75 billion to 1 85 billion devices  including 175 million to 225 million 5G devices  This forecast continues to reflect flat handsets and low double digit growth in non handsets  Now let me walk you through our financial guidance  For our second fiscal quarter guidance  we are estimating revenues to be in the range of  4 9 billion to  5 7 billion and non GAAP earnings per share of  0 80 to  0 95  There is significant uncertainty around the impact from the coronavirus on handset demand and supply chain  Based on the information we have at this time  we are widening and reducing the low end of our guidance range  We remain in active contact with our employees  customers and suppliers as we continue to monitor the situation 
In QCT  we expect second fiscal quarter revenues of  3 9 billion to  4 5 billion and EBT margin of 15  to 17   The midpoint of our revenue guidance represents approximately 16  growth sequentially  We estimate MSM shipments of 125 million to 145 million units  a 13  sequential decline at the midpoint  This trend is consistent with historical seasonality and reflects the latest demand signals from our customers  Sequentially  we expect revenue per MSM to be meaningfully higher  reflecting increased content with 5G device launches  in addition to normal seasonal mix shift towards higher tier chipsets  Our guidance includes a greater than 50  increase in RF front end revenues in the second fiscal quarter on both a year over year and sequential basis 
For QTL  we estimate second fiscal quarter revenues to be in the range of  1 billion to  1 2 billion with EBT margins of 61  to 65   We anticipate second fiscal quarter non GAAP combined R D and SG A expenses to be up 5  to 7  sequentially due to normal seasonality 
Looking forward  we continue to see two inflection points in fiscal 2020  The strength in the first half of the fiscal year reflect the first inflection point on the acceleration of 5G demand  We expect our third fiscal quarter performance to be in line with our second fiscal quarter  consistent with historical trends in our QCT business  We expect the next inflection point with the launch of additional 5G flagship handsets to be in the fourth quarter and extend into fiscal 2021 
In conclusion  we remain confident in the long term growth opportunities we outlined at our Analyst Day  including 5G adoption  RF front end content capture and expansion of our technology into adjacent platforms  Thank you and I will now turn the call back to Mauricio

Questions and Answers 
Operator
Thank you   Operator Instructions  Our first question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JP Morgan  Please proceed 
Samik Chatterjee    JP Morgan    Analyst
Hi  thanks for taking the question  So if I can just start off on the guidance itself and you mentioned kind of the seasonal decline in some unit shipments  So just wondering if you can walk us through the kind of sequential move from the 155 million unit shipments you had this quarter to the new range of 125 million to 145 million  How much of that is seasonality and what you really factoring in  in terms of the kind of budgeting for the virus impact and what are you hearing from OEMs in terms of delays that might be impacting that range that you re guiding to 
Akash Palkhiwala    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Hi  Samik  this is Akash  So if you take the midpoint of our guidance range and look at the sequential decline  it s approximately a 13  decline  And if you consider the seasonality in previous years  we ve seen a decline of 16  to 22   So it s largely consistent with the sequential decline we have seen in the past  So that s kind of your question on seasonality  Our forecast also reflects the demand that we currently have from our OEM partners  And so that s    it s also consistent with the demand we are seeing at this point 
Samik Chatterjee    JP Morgan    Analyst
Okay  And then if I can just follow up on the ASP ramp here  so if we take the guidance that you have  the average ASP seems to ramp up sequentially from  23 on the MSM unit to  31  I m just wondering if you    that s already a 33  sequential increase if you re doing the math right  I m just wondering if you can share your thoughts about what that ASP ramp looks like because it sounded like you re expecting more RF content to come through later half of the year 
Akash Palkhiwala    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah  so you re doing the math right  that s consistent with our view  Really there are three drivers to the ASP increase  First is our normal sequential increase because of the benefit of the mix improved  What happens is we launch our new premium tier and high tier chip during this timeframe and new devices are launched with it  And so you see a mix shift to premium and high tiers which benefits us  So that s the first driver  The second driver is with 5G coming in  the transition from 4G to 5G  it gives us an opportunity to increase the content in the core chipset before RF front end  And so you have incremental monetization from that 
And then finally  RF front end also impacting that because we have    as we ve talked about  we have a very strong design win pipeline  not just on the core chipset but on RF front end as well  And now that is being reflected in our guidance  I d also note that in my script I went through    I provided a data point on our RF front end revenue growth  So we are seeing 50     greater than 50  revenue growth in RF front end both on a sequential basis  so first quarter to second quarter and a year over year basis  So it s our design win pipeline showing up in the revenue and the forecast now

Thank you  Our next question comes from Mike Walkley with Canaccord Genuity  Please proceed with your question 
Mike Walkley    Canaccord Genuity    Analyst
Great  thank you  Yes  Just building on some of those questions  I guess first maybe for Cristiano  can you update us on the competitive environment for 5G particularly on the Android side  how do you see as 5G ramps potential Qualcomm share improving over the course of the year and with the X55 coming  how should that also maybe impact share and ASP trends 
Cristiano R  Amon    President
Hi  Mike  thanks for the question  So there is a lot there  Let me just talk a little bit about the ramp and the impact on the new chipset  So we said in our script that the number of designs in 5G are now 275  Two thirds of that design pipeline now is on our second generation chipset  So we continue to see traction  especially as we go from our first 5G product to our second product that is increasing  And in that traction we continue to see the trend of high RF front end attach on Snapdragon 
Competition  we expect to have competition since the very beginning on    this is a very competitive market  However  we re not seeing anything on competition different than what we expected in our planning assumptions  So we expect QCT share to remain strong  We had made assumptions on throughout the year that it is consistent to what we haven t seen in the market and there is nothing new there 
Mike Walkley    Canaccord Genuity    Analyst
Okay  And just a follow up for clarification  With the ramp laid out in the guidance on Q4  is that also an ASP ramp coming again on better 5G mix or is it more towards unit ramp  obviously new customer  Apple coming back into the model and just more seasonal trends  can you just help us think about what kind of ramp on those two metrics  that would be great  Thank you very much 
Akash Palkhiwala    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah  so on the ASP side  the way we think about ASP is a factor of    a combination of a couple of factors  One is just as we go from 4G to 5G  we have talked about how we expect the revenue opportunity for us to expand by 1 5 times between the core chipset and the RF front end  but then also as we go across the tiers  down the tiers  starting with the premium and high tier  but then eventually going into mid tier later in the year as well with 5G  the combination of those factors will inform the average revenue per MSM 
And then for later flagship launches that happen in the fall timeframe  again  it will kind of the same 1 5 time rule should apply as we go from 4G to 5G and it s really a question of how the mix plays out across the tiers and the OEMs that drives the weighted average ASP

Thank you  Our next question comes from Chris Caso with Raymond James  Please proceed 
Chris Caso    Raymond James    Analyst
Hi  thank you  Just first question is just a clarification of what you guided to for the third fiscal quarter and you said the performance to be in line with the second fiscal quarter  Just give some more color around that  is that with regard to QCT  QTL together  Is that simply referring to revenue  is that a margin assumption as well 
Akash Palkhiwala    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah  so the way we think about the year  Chris  it s kind of playing out largely as we had expected  In the last call we outlined that we saw a couple of inflection points through the year kind of both in the first half of the year and then in the fourth quarter  And our view kind of hasn t changed  We have seen a little bit of an acceleration in 5G deployment  which shows up in our results for the quarter and the guidance  And beyond that as you go from second quarter to third quarter  it just plays to the normal seasonality of our businesses 
Chris Caso    Raymond James    Analyst
All right  thank you  And with regard to QCT now  just a couple of questions there  With regard to the MSM guidance for the March quarter of 135 million midpoint units  how many of those are 5G now  if you give us some sense of how  I guess  the 5G penetration into the product line right now  And then following from that  with the big jump that you ve had in ASPs for all the reasons that you mentioned  is that something we should expect to be sustainable through the year  perhaps does it get better as 5G attach rates increase  is there perhaps some natural ASP declines as products mature  Could you give us some sense of how that progresses through the year 
Akash Palkhiwala    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah  So  Chris  this is Akash  We are not breaking down our 5G units at this point as a percent of our total MSM units  But the way to think about that number is really look at new handset launches  that launches that will happen in the quarter and over the next six months and those we expect primarily to be at the premium and the high tier mostly be 5G launches  And so the volume driven by those launches would be 5G 
Cristiano R  Amon    President
Hi  Chris  This is Cristiano  Just some data point  maybe it will help you get to the answer  If you look markets such as United States  I think the device requirements where they move on some of the flagships and the high tier products  they are 5G products today  But the China one is interesting one we said in the script  which is 5G sell in penetration reached 19  in the month of December and some of the price points already can address about 40  of the total China market based on the price point we re seeing in the market  So all of this good indicator about the 5G transition

Thank you  Our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research  Please proceed 
Stacy Rasgon    Bernstein Research    Analyst
Hi guys  thanks for taking my questions  I was wondering if    I want to ask the coronavirus question a little more explicitly  What would your QCT  MSM guide be for Q2 if you weren t baking in any coronavirus 
Akash Palkhiwala    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
So Stacy  what we are factoring into our guidance is really looking at the demand that we have from the customers and the information we have from them when you look at    on the MSM side  When you look at the overall EPS guidance  as you re aware  we typically guide a  0 10 range  And what we did to include the impact of the virus is to reduce the bottom end of the range by  0 05 to reflect the information we have at this point  But it s really something that we re going to continue to monitor as we go forward 
Stacy Rasgon    Bernstein Research    Analyst
Got it  Thank you  So my follow up  I want to ask about QCT pricing and margins into Q2  So you re guiding revenue per MSM up 33  give or take sequentially and I get that  Why are you guiding chipset margins only up a few points  like 3 points  like what are the gross margins of these 5G parts look like  Is there like a headwind there or is something else going on with the remainder of like 4G pricing as that flushes out  I guess I would have expected more margin upside given that sheer magnitude of ASP upside  what s going on there 
Akash Palkhiwala    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yes  Stacy  it s Akash again  I think the numbers we gave out are actually very consistent with what we had outlined at previous earnings release  We had indicated a mid teens growth in revenue and a mid teens margin profile and we are guiding 15  to 17   I mean  as you know  well  it s a combination of just total units  the pricing environment and then the profitability around it and it s very consistent with our expectations

Thank you  Our next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank  Please proceed 
Ross Seymore    Deutsche Bank    Analyst
Hi guys  thanks for letting me ask a question  I wanted to stick on the theme of the revenue per MSM side but maybe take a slightly different spin to it  You guys always do a great job of explaining in detail what the revenue per MSM assumptions are and then you tie it together to the EBT margins  But I wanted to see just conceptually going forward if the ASP side or the revenue per MSM is the most powerful driver of the business  Is that accretive to the gross margin side  And I guess somewhat similar to Stacy s question  is there something detrimental to the gross margin side that s capping how much of the operating margin would otherwise go up because I would think the ASPs or the content going up that much would be a very accretive outcome for you 
Akash Palkhiwala    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Hi  Ross  So it s a combination of couple of things  I think as we see more percent of our devices move over to 5G  we re going to see a benefit not just on the revenue per MSM but also in the operating margin  The second is  we are going across tiers  And so as we go across tiers and we have the second inflection point  that will further expand the scale of the 5G opportunity for us  As we outlined at Analyst Day  we definitely expect to realize the operating leverage from the investment in 5G  And so as we go forward  we will continue to see as we hit    especially as we hit the second inflection point later in the year expansion in our operating margins 
Ross Seymore    Deutsche Bank    Analyst
Thanks for the details on that  I guess as my one follow up moving over to the QTL side of things  I think Steve said earlier that you had 10 new licensees or 85 versus the 75 before  Does that do anything to change things in the QTL revenue outlook to some sort of above seasonal trends  whether it d be in the March quarter or beyond as you re getting more people to pay for you with those    the new 5G licenses 
Akash Palkhiwala    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yes  The way we think about the    we plan QTL from a 5G perspective is we have assumed that the market kind of stays at its current structure and any 5G benefit that comes either from higher replacement rates and more devices as a result of that  or it comes through an improved ASP at especially at the mid and the low tiers  that would be incremental to our forecast  I mean clearly as we go and sign the remaining licensees on 5G and go through our entire licensing base to convert that to 5G licenses  that s something that s very important to us and critical to us as the transition to 5G happens

Thank you  Our next question comes from Matt Ramsay with Cowen  Please proceed 
Matt Ramsay    Cowen    Analyst
Yes  Thank you very much  I guess I wanted to ask a little bit about  I know Akash in the commentary in the guidance you talked about the normal seasonality from December to March of 13  on units  But if you look back on a year over year basis in both of those quarters  the total numbers are down fairly substantially and with 5G ramping I wonder if the team could give a little bit of update on the 4G business that you have and the market share shifts that may or may not be happening or is this just all a market volume story  Thank you 
Akash Palkhiwala    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah  hi Matt  it s a combination of a couple of things  In these quarters last year  a year ago  we had a higher volume at Apple since we were in the previous models and still shipping volume to them  which is one reason for the decline  And then second as Huawei  While in the scheme of things  they re a small customer for us  they were a small customer for us  we still had material volume with them  And so when you adjust for those  the delta to what you would expect is extremely small and it just reflects the general market environment 
Matt Ramsay    Cowen    Analyst
Got it  thank you for that  And as my follow up  I don t know if this is for Cristiano or Steve  it s sort of an interesting juxtaposition that one of the big drivers of growth your Company is 5G RF content  At the same time  one of the big players in RF is deeming that business as non core  Maybe you could just share your reactions to that news if do you think it s a result of your business or a future opportunity for your business  And just how you ve seen the customer base react  That would be really helpful  Thank you 
Steve Mollenkopf    Chief Executive Officer
Sure  This is Steve  I would say  obviously  it s not a surprise to us  We ve been building this for some time and working really to get this opportunity into the business  The growth of opportunity on the RF side for us due to 5G  I think  is a good story  a good continuing story  We re happy to see it grow across tiers  I think there s still an opportunity for other players  There s obviously an opportunity on the 4G side 
In terms of competitive dynamic or what we re seeing from the customers  we re definitely seeing the customers resonate with the system solution  There are some features that we can add  that we ve been investing in  that I think people are finding valuable  But we re happy to see it flow into our business  We ve been talking about it for some time  and it s great to see it actually in the results and in the guide 
Cristiano R  Amon    President
Hey  Matt  this is Cristiano  I ll just add one thing real quick  Look  for us  the way to think about it  this is going to become part of our core business  And that s what you see reflected in the revenue per MSM  We expect that uplift that we ve seen on 5G and RF to continue going forward  especially as we go down the tiers

Thank you  Our next question comes from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs  Please proceed 
Rod Hall    Goldman Sachs    Analyst
Yeah  Hi guys  thanks for the question  I wanted to start with channel inventory  And kind of    I know you don t generally like to comment on it  But as we exit March  given what s going on with demand in China  do you have an expectation that handset channel inventory there will be higher than normal as we exit March  And just kind of what you think the flow of inventory might look like over the course of a couple of quarters here 
And then I also wanted to kind of come back to the competitive environment on 5G and ask you  how important share is to you in that environment  And maybe  Steve  you could comment on what you would see as advantages to having higher market share  Obviously  there are cost advantages and so on  But there are other strategic advantages we might not be thinking about that are important to you  Thanks 
Akash Palkhiwala    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Rod  from a channel inventory perspective  I mean  obviously  given how we are closely following the situation in China  but this is something that we need to continue to monitor  The key driver for us is 5G and 5G launches  And so in terms of inventory on 5G  we re really at the front end  And we have increasing demand from our OEM base  And really  the challenge for us is how do we keep up with increasing demand  because it s an incredible opportunity for us to grow 
Steve Mollenkopf    Chief Executive Officer
Yes  I think on share  I think    this is Steve  I think on share  we re not seeing anything that we didn t anticipate  We benefit  I think  a bit from a bit more geographical capability  We sell into handsets that sell into larger  more markets  They tend to be better units for us and they give us not only scale kind of from the normal scale perspective  but also  I would say  feature and diversity scale from things  If we have an issue  a supply chain issue in the    or demand issue in China  we tend to have the ability to have other regions to back it up 
So we tend to look at the business in terms of our planning  We want to make sure that we maintain that strength across different markets  And I think that s going to serve us well

C J  Muse    Evercore    Analyst
Yeah  Good afternoon  Thank you for taking the question  Just a follow up question on the corona  earlier question to Akash  just trying to get this right  have you tempered the midpoint of your guide either on royalties or chipsets or you re just reflecting a wider EPS range 
Akash Palkhiwala    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yes  C J   you should think of it as a wider EPS range  I mean  it s clearly something that we wanted to factor in our guidance  So what we did is we kind of held our normal guide but moved the lower end by  0 05 
Cristiano R  Amon    President
Okay  helpful  As my follow up  you re guiding revenues up roughly 5   OpEx up 5  to 7   So I guess  can you walk through what s driving the greater spending on the OpEx side  And how we should think about operating leverage as we proceed through calendar  20 and beyond 
Akash Palkhiwala    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yes  So maybe two points to it  First is on the OpEx side  the increase is being driven by normal calendar year resets for employee expenses  And so it s really    that s the primary driver 
As you think about the full year  we are    we have given guidance before where we expect it to be    expect to be at the exit rate for  19 plus some small incremental on top of it  And so we re still sticking with it  I think if we execute to that and we have the growth on the revenue side  it will allow us to expand our margins and realize operating leverage

Thank you  Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with UBS  Please proceed 
Timothy Arcuri    UBS    Analyst
Thanks a lot  There s a lot of questions on MSM ASPs  But obviously  RF front end really is the big piece of the story  But I guess  we don t really have any benchmarks in terms of what your revenue is there  And I guess  in early 2018  I think you said that you thought that fiscal  19 revenue would be roughly  2 billion to  3 billion for RF front end 
And it sounds like  in prior calls  you sort of hinted that you didn t get there  But I guess  just because it s such a big piece of the story  Can you sort of anchor it for us  where are you right now  How much revenue maybe in fiscal  19  did you do for RF front end  If you re doing so well  I would think you want to give us some numbers there  Thanks 
Akash Palkhiwala    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yes  Tim  this is Akash  At this point  we re not giving a breakdown of our RF front end revenue base  I mean  you have data points from a while ago  And kind of the market has changed since then  And we ve kind of grown our business through the RF 360 transaction and just the incredible opportunity to grow RF front end on top of 5G  So we re excited about where it takes us  and we ll look for opportunities as we go forward to provide more data to you  But at this point  we re not providing any additional information 
Timothy Arcuri    UBS    Analyst
Okay  I guess then  I had a question on expenses in QTL  And it looks like they bottomed in the mid  300 million range back in September  But based on the guidance  they re sort of ramping back up by about  40 million per quarter  Is all of that legal expense related to the appeal  And sort of how do you think about the trajectory of margins in QTL and particularly the OpEx ramp through the year in that business  Thanks 
Akash Palkhiwala    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yes  So for QTL  if the way to think about the OpEx and the business going forward is really look at the first quarter actuals and use that as the basis for the expense going forward  I mean  it s    at this point  we re not necessarily looking to scale expenses and litigate we see it as largely steady state  You will see some normal increases and declines  But it s really kind of flat OpEx  And then based on how the revenue shape changes through the year  that will    that is how the margin will get impacted

Thank you  Our next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri with SMBC Nikko Securities  Please proceed with your question 
Srini Pajjuri    SMBC Nikko Securities    Analyst
Thank you  A couple of questions  Akash  on the gross margin  obviously  a lot of questions there  My question is  my model  I think I m getting close to flattish gross margin with almost 40  ASP increase here  My question is  I know you re ramping 5G and I m suspecting most of the 5G initially is high tier  As we go through the year and as you ramp more mid and low tier  is there a risk that gross margins could actually decline  Or are you comfortable saying that gross margins can at least remain at these levels 
Akash Palkhiwala    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yes  Srini  we re not giving guidance on gross margins  But really  from an operating margin perspective  the way we think about leverage is really as we transition from 4G to 5G  we should be able to hold or improve our structure  And then with OpEx guidance that we ve previously provided  the combination of those factors should allow us to meet our long term operating margin guidance 
Srini Pajjuri    SMBC Nikko Securities    Analyst
Got it  And then maybe for Cristiano  Cristiano  on the RF  you said vast majority of the modem design wins are using your RF solutions  Any way to give us an idea as to what percent of the mix is using millimeter wave  And where do you see that going by the end of the year 
Cristiano R  Amon    President
Thanks for the question  Right now  we see millimeter wave as a requirement for at least the majority of the United States operators  In this year  we are working toward the millimeter wave launch of Japan and Korea  So we expect that to start to be a requirement on devices as well  And we have an optimistic view that by 2021 we re going to start to see that going into other geographies such as China and Europe  So 2020 is a United States  Japan and Korea story

204269,425785,QCOM,Why Qualcomm s Stock Rose 55  in 2019,news,"What happened
Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  and its investors had an interesting year in 2019  The semiconductor giant s share prices were headed for the moon in April  only to lose most of that jump the next month  The stock still held onto a significant edge after all that  then closed out the year with a bang  According to data from S P Global Market Intelligence  Qualcomm ended the year with a total gain of 55  

So what
In April  Qualcomm finally settled its intellectual property differences with Apple  scoring a one time payment of at least  5 billion and a six year cross licensing agreement between the two technology titans  The settlement drove Qualcomm s stock 23  higher in a single day and 56  higher over the next two weeks 
The courtroom triggered Qualcomm s big drop in May  All legal complaints between Apple and Qualcomm may have been settled  but the Federal Trade Commission also ruled against Qualcomm in January  The other shoe dropped in May as U S  District Judge Lucy Koh issued a 233 page final verdict  barring the company from using some of its most effective sales tactics  The main issue sits with Qualcomm s habit of requiring large scale chip buyers to also sign a licensing agreement to use Qualcomm s technologies 
 In combination  Qualcomm s licensing practices have strangled competition in the CDMA and premium LTE modem chip markets for years  and harmed rivals  OEMs  and end consumers in the process   Judge Koh wrote 
This decision is now on appeal and its enforcement has been put on ice for the time being  but Qualcomm could lose its best weapons in the fight to win big chip supplier deals 
Finally  Qualcomm delivered a clean beat and raise fourth quarter report in November  The muscular report lifted Qualcomm s share prices by 11  over the two days following its release 
Now what
5G wireless chips will sit at the center of Qualcomm s business for the next few years  The company was an early supplier of 5G chips for high end flagship devices and has already moved the 5G technology stack into its latest set of midrange phone chips  5G was the central theme in Qualcomm s fourth quarter earnings call  mentioned 115 times 
 As we continue to expand our 5G product portfolio  our design wins are also increasing   CEO Steve Mollenkopf said on that call   We continue to expect a positive inflection point as 5G ramps beginning in our fiscal second quarter  With the conclusion of our cost plan and significant share repurchases over the last year  we are poised to deliver margin expansion  an outsized growth in earnings  and earnings per share as revenue growth accelerates

SHANGHAI  Reuters    China s  Xiaomi  Corp  HK 1810  has taken a stake of roughly 6  in compatriot chip designer VeriSilicon Holdings Co Ltd  as the smartphone maker revamps its years long pursuit of success in semiconductors which it sees as central to driving innovation 
The investment comes as the government identifies chips as one of several sectors in which it wants the country to become more self reliant under its  Made in China 2025  initiative 
In a filing to the China Securities Regulatory Commission  CSRC  published online on Thursday  VeriSilicon revealed a fund run by Xiaomi became its second largest external shareholder in June 
Xiaomi Corp confirmed the investment to Reuters  None of the companies disclosed its monetary value 
VeriSilicon s biggest external shareholder is the China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund  a centralized  national level fund for the domestic semiconductor industry  popularly known as  The Big Fund  
The firm is headquartered in Shanghai and has research and development centers at home and in the United States  It typically works as a contractor to other chip companies  helping them complete additional parts of semiconductor design 
CHIPS AWAY
Xiaomi grew rapidly since releasing its first smartphone at the beginning of the decade  becoming the fourth biggest seller worldwide in the first quarter of this year  showed latest data from researcher IDC  However  it has had less success in chips 
The company launched a semiconductor division in 2014 and three years later announced its first system on a chip  the Surge S1  The chip featured in Xiaomi s Mi 5 smartphone but was not rolled out more widely 
After that  there were no major chip announcements until April when an internal memo stated that Xiaomi would spin off part of its chip division into a subsidiary called Big Fish focused on making chips for internet of things devices 
Xiaomi is not alone in its chip ambitions  Huawei s chip making HiSilicon subsidiary makes Kirin processors for its own smartphones  which experts said are roughly competitive with top of the line chips from U S  leader  Qualcomm Inc   O QCOM  
In the broader tech sphere  e commerce major  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd  N BABA  last year bought Chinese chipmaker C Sky  Its chief technology officer later said the firm will unveil its first artificial intelligence chip in the second half of 2019

204370,425886,QCOM,Qualcomm asks appeals court to pause antitrust ruling s impact,news,"By Stephen Nellis
 Reuters    Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  Inc on Monday asked a U S  appeals court to pause an antitrust ruling that could drastically alter its business model while it tries to overturn the ruling 
The filing with the 9th U S  Circuit Court of Appeals came after U S  District Judge Lucy Koh last week declined to put on hold her own ruling in a case brought by the U S  Federal Trade Commission against the San Diego company  which is the largest supplier of modem chips that connect smartphones to wireless data networks 
Koh ruled that Qualcomm had engaged in anticompetitive patent licensing practices to keep a monopoly on the mobile chip market  Koh ordered Qualcomm to license its technology to rival chipmakers  which include firms like Taiwan s MediaTek Inc  Qualcomm has been fighting to have the ruling put on hold while it pursues an appeal  which could take more than year 
The San Diego  California company has argued that letting the ruling stand could upend its talks with phone makers over chips for 5G  the next generation of wireless data networks 
 Qualcomm will be unable to revert back to its current license agreements  undo this web of new agreements  reverse any exhaustion of its patent rights  or recover all the revenue lost or transaction costs incurred  if it ultimately wins its appeal but the judgment remains in force during the process  the company wrote 
Qualcomm also challenged Koh s ruling that Qualcomm s patent fees are a  surcharge  on other chip suppliers  effectively raising their prices and making them less able to compete with Qualcomm  Qualcomm charges phone makers the patent fees whether or not they buy Qualcomm chips because the patents cover fundamental aspects of cellular technology that go beyond its own modems 
Koh ruled that phone makers likely take into account the total cost of the bundle of license fees plus the chips  which makes Qualcomm s overall package less expensive than its rivals  violating competition laws  Qualcomm rejected that theory in its filing Monday 
 There is  moreover  no reason that  smartphone  OEMs would regard the royalties they pay Qualcomm as attributable to the prices the OEMs pay for rivals  chips   any more than they are attributable to the price the OEMs pay for other components such as batteries or screens   the company wrote in its filing ",2019-07-09,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/qualcomm-asks-appeals-court-to-pause-antitrust-rulings-impact-1918114,1918114

204388,425904,QCOM,China chip industry insiders voice caution on catch up efforts,news,"By Josh Horwitz and Sijia Jiang SHANGHAI HONG KONG  Reuters    Since the U S  government put Huawei Technologies Co Ltd on a trade blacklist  effectively banning American firms from doing business with it  China s leaders have spoken boldly about achieving self sufficiency in the critical semiconductor business  But industry insiders are less optimistic that Chinese chip makers can quickly meet the challenge of supplying all the needs of Huawei and other domestic technology firms  The prospectuses of Chinese chip companies preparing to list on a new tech focused stock exchange are blunt  characterizing the domestic industry as  relatively backward   lacking in talent and requiring  a long time to catch up   Chinese chip engineers tell tales of local manufacturing that just is not up to snuff  while analysts point out the many areas where China remains reliant on technology from the United States  Taiwan  South Korea  Japan and Europe  with some questioning whether government policies are in the right place   Compared to the constraints of equipment  materials  or talent  I think what China lacks more is understanding of the industry   says Gu Wenjun  chief analyst at Shanghai based consultancy ICWise  He called some of the government subsidies for the industry  counter productive   because too many well funded ventures end up chasing the same talent  Government appeals to patriotism also go only so far  A former top engineer the Chinese chip design firm Unisoc  a unit of Tsinghua Unigroup told Reuters the company was often encouraged to use a sister company s memory chips  But that firm  called Guoxin  could not offer technology that was advanced enough    The internal speeches that were given were always  Please look at Guoxin because we do want to support the Chinese supply chain    said the engineer   But we never got anything we could use   The companies did not respond to requests for comment    graphic   TECH USA CHIP CATCHUP 010092PK3JW index html   BETTER TECHNOLOGY Chip industry officials outside China caution that the country is making good progress in some areas and should not be under estimated  For a key type of memory chip known as NAND  for example  Chinese firms are closing the gap    Money is not an issue for the Chinese government   says one executive at a South Korean memory chip maker who declined to be named  acknowledging China s progress in NAND  or flash chips  which provide long term data storage   We cannot stop the Chinese companies  it is a free competition  but we believe we have better technology and a better product   One of China s biggest challenges  however  is in chip manufacturing  an exacting process that requires both highly specialized tools and many years of experience to master   A May report from China s Everbright Securities identified one aspect of the problem   The manufacturing process relies on equipment  and U S  firms such as AMAT  LAM  KLA and Teradyne have very high market share in many niche markets   Everbright wrote   There is no production line in China that uses only equipment made in China  so it is very difficult to make any chipsets without U S  equipment   Even when Chinese chip makers do have gear from the top chip equipment firms in the United States  Japan and Europe  they cannot always take full advantage  One former engineer at Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp   SMIC   China s leading chip production firm  said the equipment vendors often had non disclosure agreements  NDAs  with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp   TSMC   the world leader in chip making  The manufacturing process for advanced chips requires a lot of fine tuning  and the NDAs covered the crucial tips and tricks on how to best use the machinery and achieve the necessary levels of  yield   or the number of working chips in each batch    Equipment vendors are all under NDA with TSMC   says the engineer   If SMIC asks a vendor for instructions  the vendor will only disclose very basic information about the instructions  just to show good faith   he says  A TSMC spokeswoman said   TSMC has always been diligent in protecting our trade secrets  including signing NDAs with our counterparts    Industry experts say SMIC is consistently about two generations behind TSMC  even with up to date equipment  While TSMC was launching chips with circuit widths of just 7 nanometers in 2018  SMIC is only now readying production of 14 nanometer chips   which was state of the art in 2014  Huawei uses TSMC for most of its advanced chipset manufacturing demand and SMIC for low end products  A former Huawei employee said the company chose TSMC to make its server chips over SMIC because HiSilicon  its semiconductor arm  designed the chip with 7 nanometer technology  Re designing for SMIC s capabilities was possible  but would result in an inferior chip  SMIC said it was committed to meeting customer needs   Our 14nm technology will start risk production by 2019  12nm process development is completed and under customer verification   a spokesman said  Huawei did not respond to requests for comment  TALENT GAP The talent shortage comes up repeatedly  with some analysts noting that it took Japanese  South Korean and Taiwanese firms decades to develop their expertise  China has sought to recruit top overseas talent  especially from Taiwan and South Korea  with lucrative contracts  but has not always succeeded  China s CXMT  a maker of DRAM memory chips  tried to recruit a former top Samsung Electronics  KS 005930  chip engineer last year  but the South Korean firm obtained a court injunction to block the move this January   The Suwon District Court in South Korea accepted Samsung s request to prevent Kim Chi wook  who headed DRAM design  from joining the Chinese firm and ordered him not to work for the company until November this year   Chinese semiconductor companies are estimated to be three years to 10 years behind in technology gap regarding DRAM designing technique   the court wrote  adding that Kim s hiring would help CXMT close the gap and thus hurt Samsung  Samsung and CXMT declined to comment  Kim could not be reached  For microprocessors  the most complex chips  Huawei has developed cutting edge designs for use in its Kirin chips  which power many of its high end phones  But still relies on overseas firms for key intellectual property and production  Meanwhile Unisoc  the leading Chinese microprocessor company  primarily works with low end  white label phones in the  100 range  Rockchip and Allwinner  two other Chinese system on a chip companies  primarily supply white label tablet computers and smart home devices  Those segments use chips with less demanding technology than high end phones  Rockchip and Allwinner did not respond to requests for comment  Eric Yang  who invests in Chinese chip

Investing com   It s an ill wind that blows nobody any good  so they say  and it s no surprise to see who s profiting from the U S  s decision to effectively ban Huawei from its market 
Shares in Europe s two leading makers of telecoms network equipment are both higher after early trade  with Ericsson  BS ERICAs  rising 0 9  and Nokia  HE NOKIA  up 1 4   They re among very few companies gaining on a day when fear of an all out trade war between the world s two largest economies is dominating sentiment 
As of 4 AM ET  0800 GMT   the benchmark Euro Stoxx 600 index was down 0 1  at 377 5 while Germany s DAX was down 0 5  and the U K  FTSE 100 down 0 2 
Ominously  automotive stocks have struggled to build on the late gains they made on Wednesday after the U S  administration decided to hold fire on levying tariffs on car imports for six months  The big auto names are all down by 1  or more  as are many of their biggest suppliers 
The Commerce Department s order Wednesday not only bans Huawei from taking part in tenders to build 5G networks in the U S   it also makes companies like Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  require licenses to sell Huawei the chips it needs to make its equipment  As such  it could hobble Huawei s efforts to build out 5G in Europe and elsewhere too 
Less competition from Huawei means greater pricing power for the Scandinavian companies  who have lost market share consistently to the Chinese giant in recent years  Nokia last month reported a loss in the first quarter due in large measure to the intensity of competition  Investors may now allow themselves to be a little more confident in the company s prediction of profitability over the full year 
All other things being equal  the loss of Huawei means that telecoms companies  such as Verizon  NYSE VZ  and AT T  NYSE T  will have to pay more for what is already promising to be a fearsomely expensive network upgrade  And of course it s also bad news for their customers  who will end up footing the bill  Given that the administration s issues with Huawei were already well known  much of that may already be priced in 
Likewise  some of Europe s biggest operators such as  Vodafone   LON VOD  and the Netherlands  KPN have already signalled they won t use Huawei in the  core  of their new 5G networks  although that still leaves them able to buy other  less sensitive  equipment  How badly the new licensing requirement will hit Huawei s ability to compete in that area remains to be seen ",2019-05-16,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/stockbeat-us-huawei-ban-lifts-nokia-ericsson-1870013,1870013

204520,426036,QCOM,Here s How 2019 Unfolded For The Telecommunications Sector,opinion,Charting record highs  2019 has been an outstanding year for the U S  equity markets with a year end rally propelling the indices to historic levels and within touching distance of being the best year in more than two decades  As the curtains roll down on an eventful 2019  let us delve a little deep into the overall performance of the telecom sector in the outgoing year 2019  The Year in PerspectiveTariff WarThe telecom stocks witnessed a roller coaster ride in 2019 as President Trump flip flopped on the trade war  The industry faced a gamut of trade restrictions and tariffs that affected its supply chain mechanism and dented profitability  The Sino U S  tariff war virtually led to intense technology warfare between the two superpowers of the global economy  forcing the industry to get polarized into two distinct halves  bringing an element of uncertainty within the rank and files of the telecom sector  After maintaining his usual tirade against the unfair trade practices by the China  Trump appeared intent to strike a deal on numerous occasions  only to backtrack  The on again off again trade war skirmishes sent confusing signals to the market that bore the brunt of the geopolitical crisis as bilateral trade suffered  The Trump administration fired a double barrel gun as the government extended the deadline for a sweeping ban on trade with Chinese telecom equipment manufacturer Huawei by another 90 days in November  allowing domestic firms and rural carriers to utilize the window to purchase replacement parts and software  This marked the third such instance when the reprieve was extended since the U S  Commerce Department added Huawei to the  Entity List  in May  citing national security concerns  The FCC also formalized a key proposal issued last year and prohibited the use of federal subsidies by small and rural carriers to buy equipment from Huawei and ZTE  HK 0763   At the same time  the government reportedly approved a quarter of nearly 300 license applications by U S  firms to trade with the beleaguered telecom firm  allowing trade only on those items that were deemed to be safe and do not deal with data intensive applications like cellular tower hardware  routers and switches 5G RaceThe bone of contention stemmed from an innate desire to claim dominance in cutting edge technologies and the next generation of wireless services as the industry remained on the cusp of 5G boom  Although both the United States and China were on equal footing for 5G readiness by mid 2019  the communist nation seemed to be inching ahead in the later stages of the year with large scale deployment and commercialization  The FCC has started the third round of 5G spectrum auction on Dec 10 to make more spectrum available for super fast 5G connectivity  The latest auction will be the largest with 3 400 megahertz spectrum up for grabs in three different spectrum bands   37 GHz  39 GHz  and 47 GHz  The step seems to be the call of the hour as steady investments are required to upgrade the networks with state of the art technology for faster 5G deployment Several U S  firms are gradually picking up pace as 5G race intensifies  Reportedly offering the fastest network in the United States in terms of both download and upload speeds  T Mobile US  NASDAQ TMUS   Inc    NYSE S   has become the first telecom carrier to activate nationwide 5G network  covering nearly 200 million Americans in more than 5 000 cities and towns  Its rival carrier Verizon Communications Inc    NYSE VZ   has already deployed 5G Ultra Wideband mobility service in more than 30 cities for high speed  low latency and expanded coverage  AT T Inc    NYSE T   has introduced 5G networks built on its low band 850MHz spectrum technology in 19 cities and is planning to add few more in the near future Industry ConsolidationA historic approval for industry consolidation further reshaped the sector dynamics in 2019  with the U S  Department of Justice finally giving green signal to the merger of T Mobile with Sprint Corp    NYSE S     the third and the fourth largest wireless companies in the country  Allaying antitrust concerns  the authorities observed that the merger would create an entity that would thwart the dominance of China in the 5G market and benefit the larger community with superior rural broadband coverage  In addition  a  5 billion deal with Dish Network for divesting Sprint s prepaid wireless businesses  including Boost Mobile  and some of its spectrum cleared the decks for the formation of a new entity  The agreement established Dish as a disruptive force in the wireless industry  redefining the broader industry metrics Sweeping ReformsIn a landmark decision  the FCC voted unanimously in favor of splitting the spectrum block earmarked for auto safety for use by wireless devices to meet the exponential growth of bandwidth due to increased 5G deployment  The FCC plan seeks to allocate 45 MHz for Wi Fi use and set aside the remaining 30 MHz for auto safety  The allocation is based on the perceived importance of Wi Fi  which is likely to double by 2023 to more than  1 trillion  according to FCC Chairman Ajit Pai  Out of the 30 MHz spectrum band assigned for auto safety  20 MHz will be allotted for a newer version of vehicle to everything communications or V2X technology  known as cellular vehicle to everything or C V2X  and the remainder for the legacy DSRC safety system  A lot of pioneering work is being done on this front and the industry is betting big on Qualcomm Incorporated s   NASDAQ QCOM   9150 C V2X Chipset  which empowers automakers and roadside infrastructure providers with improved V2X capabilities for safety and autonomous driving The Senate passed the anti robocall bill  paving the way for the President to formally sign it into a law  Dubbed the TRACED Act  for Telephone Robocall Abuse Criminal Enforcement and Deterrence  the bill mandates telecom firms to offer free call blocking apps to thwart spam calls  The Senate also passed the Broadband Deployment Accuracy and Technological Availability  DATA  Act that enables the FCC to collect more precise data from wired  fixed wireless  and satellite broadband providers to get a better understanding of the nationwide broadband coverage  This is likely to bridge the urban rural digital divide and foster the development of high speed Internet connectivity across the country The EndgameThe telecom stocks scripted a remarkable turnaround and witnessed an upward trajectory toward the end of the year  courtesy the last minute  Phase One  trade deal between the United States and China  Although the two sides are yet to sign the agreement  which is likely to take place in January 2020   the partial trade accord represents a major breakthrough in the 21 month standoff between the world s two largest economies  The trade agreement offered a much needed respite to the beleaguered industry just before the holiday season  weeding off sector uncertainty and probable tariffs on popular consumer goods and telecom equipment  The trade truce buoyed investor sentiments and propelled the industry to mirror broader equity market performance All s Well That Ends Well  Maybe  maybe not  While the jury is out to deliberate on it  let us hope that the telecom sector maintains the healthy growth momentum next year as well Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2020In addition to the stocks discussed above  would you like to

204564,426080,QCOM,3 Telecom Stocks That More Than Doubled The S P 500 In 2019,opinion,In 2019  fifth generation  5G  wireless technologies virtually dominated the headlines in the telecommunications industry  Unsurprisingly  the year presented several opportunities to telecom companies to bolster their revenue streams despite the nagging trade restrictions  5G wireless has broadened the addressable market for carriers and embedded them further into varied digital ecosystems That said  use cases of 5G have not yet proved to be the likely solution for solid revenue growth in developed markets  In an effort to achieve significant market traction  communications service providers have rapidly deployed the latest 4G LTE Advanced technologies for customers  At the same time  they are expanding fiber optics networks to drive 4G LTE and 5G wireless standards   high speed  low latency Moving into 2020  analysts expect product innovation and increase in M A to facilitate further growth of the industry  Technological advances have changed the way consumers communicate  resulting in higher data consumption and video streaming  But intense competition and commoditization of services have limited the chance to benefit from these trends    In wireline business  traditional landline phone service is increasingly being ditched in favor of wireless  In cable  consumers are increasingly cutting the video cord for over the top online streaming alternatives  In wireless  more data traffic on the network has necessitated capital investments to increase capacity while monetizing demand  Most of these prospects have stemmed from changing market conditions and evolving consumer preferences 5G Holds the KeyUpfront investment in capital and wireless spectrum for 5G has proven to be substantially higher than prior generations of wireless deployments due to network density requirements  potentially hurting return of capital metrics  The potential for meaningful revenues to lag 5G buildouts poses significant credit risks for providers pursing aggressive deployments The next generation of wireless technology is likely to propel the industry to greater heights throughout 2020  However  the success of this technology hinges on substantial investments to upgrade infrastructure in the core fiber backhaul network to support growth in data services  With operators moving toward converged or multi use network structures  combining voice  video and data communications into a single network  the industry is developing solutions to support wireline and wireless network convergence Vying for first mover advantage  leading operators have launched 5G wireless residential broadband services in multiple U S  markets this year  while a full phased 5G

204599,426115,QCOM,Telecom Stock Roundup  Sprint s Omni Launch  Verizon 5G Trial Run   More,opinion,In the past five trading days  telecom stocks steadily went uphill as the  Phase One  trade deal between the United States and China reportedly inched closer to conclusion  The partial trade accord is widely anticipated to ease the bilateral tensions created by the prolonged trade war  and optimism about a probable signing of an agreement between President Trump and his Chinese counterpart seemed to propel the industry  However  U S  legislations backing Hong Kong protesters seemed to be a latent threat  although both the countries appeared intent to not let such stray incidents derail the trade talks   To fast track the negotiation process  China extended an olive branch by unveiling new guidelines to protect IP rights  Although the announcement lacked clarity  it proposed plans to study the necessity and feasibility of drawing up a basic law for safeguarding IP rights  The government also revealed that it would significantly increase the penalties for IP infringement and use stringent technological barriers to thwart such attempts  Acknowledging the positive steps  President Trump observed that the trade accord was nearing conclusion  further buoying the industry s growth Meanwhile  the Federal Communications Commission   FCC   has formalized a key proposal issued last year  With a unanimous 5 0 verdict  the telecom regulatory authority has prohibited the use of federal subsidies by small and rural carriers to buy equipment from Chinese telecom goods manufacturer Huawei and ZTE  HK 0763  on national security grounds  Huawei has vehemently opposed the unilateral steps by the U S  authorities  The Trump administration has also signed two bills in an act of solidarity with Hong Kong protesters  While one authorizes the U S  government to impose sanctions for human rights abuses  the other bans the sale of American made tear gas  rubber bullets or other crowd control equipment to the Hong Kong authorities  Although both the incidents have initiated strong response from the communist nation  they are not likely to affect the trade discussions as both countries remain committed to an early resolution of the trade disputes on domestic compulsions In another notable incident  the FCC has proposed to utilize the less used block of spectrum that is reserved for auto safety by splitting it for use by wireless devices to meet the exponential growth of bandwidth due to increased 5G deployment  The telecom regulatory authority intends to offer only one half of the existing spectrum to the auto industry for testing and development of auto safety communications system  while freeing up the other for wireless carriers  The plan has been strongly protested by the U S  Transportation Department  which maintains that the entire band is necessary for the future of auto safety technology s development and expansion Regarding company

204625,426141,QCOM,Telecom Stock Roundup  Qualcomm   CenturyLink Revenues Decline   More,opinion,In the past five trading days  telecom stocks went downhill as optimism about the  Phase One  deal between the United States and China withered on disagreement on various contentious issues  The partial trade accord is anticipated to ease the bilateral tensions created by the prolonged trade war  However  reported demand by the communist nation to roll back the existing U S  tariffs raised speculations about a probable signing of an agreement between President Trump and his Chinese counterpart  In addition  various roadblocks related to forced technology transfer and IP protection along with lack of clarity on the quantum of U S  farm products purchase on a monthly or yearly basis clouded the negotiation process  To add to the woes  lower than expected quarterly earnings and relatively soft outlook from bulk of the sector firms weighed on the beleaguered sector   Although both the United States and China had agreed in principle on the partial trade accord  various disagreements arose as high level officials from both sides deliberated to finetune the nitty gritties of the deal  President Trump upped the ante by discarding speculations about a likely rollback of the existing U S  tariffs to seal the deal  However  industry observers widely believe that tariffs scheduled on Dec 15 on consumer items such as smartphones and toys are not likely to come into effect as part of the initial deal The United States is also reportedly seeking definite commitment from China for IP protections and prohibition of the practice of forced technology transfer in exchange for rolling back some of the tariffs  Moreover  according to persons familiar with the proceedings  China s officials have been asked to spell out the quantum of quarterly and monthly purchase of agricultural products per their promise to buy  50 billion worth of U S  farm goods  However  China is apparently reluctant to commit a specific amount in the text of the potential deal Although the sudden irritants are not expected to derail the trade negotiations  both the countries have been unable to reach a consensus regarding the various sticking points  While both sides remain intent to reach an agreement at the earliest on domestic compulsions  it appears that the trade war has been rather a  two steps forward  three steps backward  affair  This  in turn  has largely dragged the sector down Regarding company specific news  quarterly earnings primarily took the center stage over the past

204635,426151,QCOM,China s OnePlus  backed by Qualcomm and T Mobile  launches smartphone in U S,news,"By Sijia Jiang and Sheila Dang HONG KONG NEW YORK  Reuters    A Chinese smartphone company whose high end products are little known outside a tech savvy niche entered the U S  market on Monday with the backing of two key local allies   chipmaking giant Qualcomm  O QCOM  and mobile operator T Mobile US Inc  O TMUS    and no questions from U S  regulators  The foray by 5 year old Shenzhen based OnePlus comes after U S  mobile carriers AT T  N T  and Verizon  N VZ  this year backed away from plans to work with China s Huawei on high end phones in face of pressure from the U S  government  which considers Huawei a security risk  The United States also briefly banned companies from selling goods to ZTE  SZ 000063    which was caught shipping U S  technology to Iran and North Korea  violating U S  sanctions   Given the involvement of the Chinese government with other Chinese telecommunications companies  we should always take a close look any time a new Chinese telecommunications supplier tries to enter the domestic market   said U S  Senator Mark Warner  in an emailed response to a Reuters question   There can be real security concerns here  as we saw with Huawei and ZTE   But the OnePlus alliance  announced at an event on Monday in New York  shows how many U S  China business relationships  including those involving the most advanced technologies  are marching ahead despite the escalating U S  China trade war   T Mobile said the OnePlus 6T smart phone would launch exclusively at the carrier s stores on Nov  1 with a starting price of  549  the first time a OnePlus handset has been sold through a U S  wireless provider   and a deal that the firm s larger rivals such as Huawei could not pull off   While some OnePlus models have been on sale in the United States through e commerce websites  carrier relationships like the one with T Mobile are critical because most U S  consumers still purchase phones through their carriers   I don t know if it is a good time for anybody else   Carl Pei  the 29 year old founder of OnePlus  said of the prospect of entering the U S  carrier bundled phone market during an interview with Reuters at an event in Hong Kong last week   It is a good time for us   In an interview on Monday  Jon Freier  T mobile s executive vice president of U S  retail  said the U S  China trade battle played no role in this deal and the carrier has not heard from U S  regulators   OnePlus has a sterling reputation  and we ve researched the device and vetted it thoroughly   Freier said  Xiaomi  a Chinese rival that also focuses on feature packed phones at bargain prices  has said it plans to launch in the United States next year but did not respond to a request for comment on whether those plans are still in place   OnePlus is unusual among Chinese tech companies  which typically focus on mass market products for domestic customers  OnePlus  by contrast  only sells premium phones that cost  400 or more and almost exclusively online except in India  It derives two thirds of its revenue from outside China and is the top seller of premium smartphones in India  OnePlus is affiliated with OPPO  a Chinese smartphone maker and a major force in mid end phones  which are sold globally and cost about  300  The relationship helps OnePlus keep its costs low  said Canalys analyst Mo Jia  According to Chinese company registration records  the two companies have common shareholders  Pei shrugged off any concerns that U S  consumer sentiment would be affected by the China US trade conflict   At the end of the day  all you can control is your own  product    Pei  who was born in China and raised in Sweden  said the brand is cross cultural and international   When we started  we saw that through social media  you can talk to everyone around the world  as long as you can speak their language

204637,426153,QCOM,Earnings Preview  Qualcomm  QCOM  Q4 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Qualcomm  QCOM  reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on November 6  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This chipmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 71 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  21 1  
Revenues are expected to be  4 72 billion  down 18 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Qualcomm 
For Qualcomm  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Qualcomm will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Qualcomm would post earnings of  0 76 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 80  delivering a surprise of  5 26  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Qualcomm doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-qualcomm-qcom-q4-earnings-expected-to-decline-200480292,200480292

	The fourth quarter of 2019 did not make a good first impression on Tuesday as the major indices each plunged more than 1  due to soft manufacturing data   
	The ISM manufacturing index for September came in at 47 8   which was the lowest level in over a decade and marked the second straight month of contraction  Needless to say  it also fell below expectations    
	The Dow understandably had the worst performance on Tuesday because of this data  dropping 1 28   or around 340 points  to 26 573 04  Meanwhile  the S P slipped 1 23  to 2940 25 and the NASDAQ was off 1 13   or about 90 points  to 7908 68 
	The major indices each started the day solidly in the green before the number was released  They are also coming off of positive results for the usually difficult month of September   
	The report immediately had already skittish investors worried about recession  despite manufacturing making up a much smaller piece of the economy than services  This is the first time we have seen back to back contraction reading since the end of 2015 where there were 4 straight months of sub 50 readings   said Brian Bolan in Stocks Under  10  Did a recession come from that weakness  Not at all  in fact  the ISM Manufacturing number ran over the course of the next two years to highs over 60  So take these numbers with a grain of salt  
	The Government Employment Situation report on Friday will now be even more important  Last month was a little below expectations  though the unemployment rate held steady while wages and the participation rate rose

204667,426183,QCOM,Telecom Stock Roundup  Sprint Boosts Video Analytics  AT T s Content Deal   More,opinion,In the past five trading days  telecom stocks initially witnessed a healthy uptrend followed by a relatively flat trajectory as the fresh round of Sino U S  tariffs became effective Sep 1  Tense geopolitical scenarios and challenging global macroeconomic environment partially dented the momentum  although news of a  face to face  meeting between the negotiators of the two sides in October aimed to defuse some of the undercurrents and propelled the stocks higher at the later stages of the past week The Trump administration went ahead with its proposed set of tariffs beginning this month and imposed 15  tariffs on  100 billion worth of imports from China  The latest import basket included mostly consumer goods like food  apparel  footwear and consumer electronics  Notably  the U S  government had earlier decided to impose 10  tariff  which was later increased to 15   on  300 billion of Chinese imports from September before Trump opted to delay taxing about 60  of the items from the list until Dec 15  These included cellphones  video game consoles  computer monitors  some clothing and footwear items  The strategic decision was aimed to offer some respite to the retailers and enable them to stockpile things for the back to school and holiday season  The short term reprieve also offered U S  telecom firms an opportunity to re draw their supply chain mechanism and reduce dependency on Huawei to avert a possible future backlash In response  China imposed 5 10  retaliatory tariffs only on one third of the proposed 5 000 U S  items worth  75 billion  leaving the door ajar for negotiations  Subsequent communications across various diplomatic channels bore fruit and the two countries have agreed to hold meeting in October  before creating a conducive atmosphere for favorable trade discussions  However  in a visible shift from his earlier stance  the U S  President has made it clear that the talks would not focus on the blacklisting of Huawei as it was deemed to be an issue of national security  The Trump administration is also supposedly sitting on about 130 applications received by the Commerce Department for issue of licenses for the trade of U S  goods with Huawei  With no progress yet made to break the trade embargo on Huawei  the bonhomie is likely to be put to test once the two sides sit across the negotiation table Meanwhile  market uncertainty regarding the geopolitical turmoil in the United Kingdom related to Brexit  soft manufacturing spending in Japan and tepid GDP growth in China triggered by low factory output and high unemployment has led to intense market volatility across the globe  The U S  manufacturing activity also contracted for the first time since early 2016 and together with a low second quarter GDP growth estimate of 2   following 3 1  growth in the first quarter  rendered a relatively grim picture for the future  Consequently  the stakes are relatively high for both the countries to arrive at an agreeable solution   the sooner  the better      Regarding company specific news  product

Trump flip flopped on the trade war  After maintaining his usual tirade against the unfair trade practices by the China  Trump suddenly appeared intent to strike a deal  following reportedly similar interests from the communist nation  The on again off again trade war skirmishes sent confusing signals to the market that bore the brunt of the geopolitical crisis and its cascading effect on bilateral trade The U S  government had earlier allowed domestic firms to continue trade with Chinese telecom equipment manufacturer Huawei for 90 days  The strategic move harbored hopes of a progress in bilateral trade negotiations that went on a tailspin due to proposed tariffs and counter tariffs  The short term reprieve also offered U S  telecom firms an opportunity to re draw their supply chain mechanism and reduce dependency on Huawei to avert a possible future backlash  Although both the countries have pledged to continue their trade talks  no date has yet been finalized for the September meeting  The Trump administration has further remained non committal about the proposed tariffs that are likely to be effective Sep 1 Despite the visible camaraderie  U S  officials are reportedly blocking an initiative to connect Los Angeles with Hong Kong via undersea cables on national security grounds  The multi agency review panel known as Team Telecom  headed by the Justice Department  has refused to grant permission for the nearly 8 000 mile long Pacific Light Cable Network over concerns related to its Chinese investor  In addition  political unrest due to purported plans to integrate the autonomous nation with China has put the project in jeopardy  The Trump administration is also supposedly sitting on about 130 applications received by the Commerce Department for issue of licenses for the trade of U S  goods with Huawei  With no progress yet being made to break the trade embargo on Huawei  the bonhomie is likely to be put to test once the two sides sit across the negotiation table       Meanwhile  leading domestic telecom carriers have joined forces to clamp down on robocalls or unwanted phone calls  and have struck an agreement with attorney generals of all the states and the District of Columbia  The deal is aimed to shield consumers from this growing menace and eliminate the root cause by empowering law enforcement agencies to investigate and prosecute the perpetrators  In particular  the agreement calls for the launch of free call blocking technology and making other free anti robocall devices and apps available to subscribers to curb the exponential growth of robocalls  Regarding company specific news  legal stay  5G launch and strategic collaborations primarily took the center stage over the past five trading

204723,426239,QCOM,Trump Weighs Easing ZTE Penalty to Help Xi  as Lawmakers Resist,news," Bloomberg     President Donald Trump said the U S  is reconsidering penalties against Chinese telecommunications maker ZTE Corp  HK 0763   as a favor to the country s president  Xi Jinping  prompting members of Congress to warn him against softening the punishment 
 The president asked me to look into that and I am doing it   Trump told reporters at the White House on Tuesday  Asked about the company  he said there is no deal yet with China    but it was not clear whether he was speaking specifically about ZTE or about broader trade disputes 
 You are really hurting American companies also  by shutting down ZTE and the review is  a favor  to Xi  Trump said  He said he would  envision  a revised penalty for the company  over sanctions violations  including a requirement that it appoint a new board of directors and a  very large fine  of perhaps  1 3 billion 
 When I looked at it I said  you know  they could pay a big price without necessarily damaging all of these American companies  which they are because you know you re talking about tremendous amounts of money and jobs   Trump said   By shutting them down  we re hurting a lot of American companies  really good American companies  
Trump faces intensifying opposition in Congress to any retreat from the ZTE penalties  Fourteen Republican senators including the party s second ranking leader  John Cornyn of Texas joined 13 Democratic and independent senators and wrote a public letter to Trump on Tuesday urging him not to soften the company s punishment for  serial and pre meditated  violations of U S  sanctions against Iran and North Korea 
 Export control and sanctions laws should not be negotiable  because fidelity to the rule of law is a key part of what distinguishes the U S  from a country like China that is ruled by a Communist dictatorship   the senators wrote  The signers of the letter spanned the ideological spectrum of the Senate from Republican Tom Cotton of Arkansas to Kamala Harris of California 
Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross called the company s behavior  egregious  when he announced the action April 16  Several amendments concerning ZTE have been proposed to a Defense Department bill in the House and may be granted votes this week 
In addition  the House version of a fiscal 2019 spending bill for the Commerce Department contains language that would prohibit the administration from enacting policies in  contravention of the ZTE suspension order  
Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer on Tuesday castigated the Trump administration s plan to review penalties on ZTE  saying on the Senate floor that the action signals to China that  they can roll over us on issue after issue   He added that on Friday he spoke directly to Trump for half an hour about the matter  and also to other administration officials 
 The president and Secretary Mnuchin  what they are doing sends a dangerous signal to businesses around the world that the United States is willing to forgive sanction violations or reduce penalties   Schumer said   It emboldens foreign companies to play fast and loose with U S  sanctions when we should be putting the fear of God into these companies  especially one that was as brazen as ZTE  
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said earlier Tuesday that the U S  didn t mean to  put ZTE out of business  by penalizing the company for violating U S  sanctions against North Korea and Iran 
Security Threats
The U S  Commerce Department s review of penalties against ZTE Corp  for the violations will bear in mind any threats to American security  Mnuchin said Tuesday during a hearing before a Senate Appropriations subcommittee in Washington 
 Anything that they consider will take into account the very important national security issues  and those will be addressed   he said 
The U S  ban on ZTE for breaching terms of a settlement over sanction breaking sales to Iran and North Korea has become entangled in the trade dispute between the U S  and China  The countries announced at least a temporary trade truce and dropped their tariff threats on Saturday after setting up a framework for addressing trade imbalances 
The Shenzhen  China based company depends on U S  components  such as chips from Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  Inc   to build its smartphones and networking gear  ZTE suspended all major operations because of the ban and is relying on its cash reserves for daily expenses  including salaries of its 75 000 employees 
 I envision a new management  a new board  and very  very strict security rules   Trump said   And I also envision that they will have to buy a big percentage of their equipment and parts from American companies  
Trump said May 13 on Twitter that he would seek to get ZTE back into business after discussing the issue with Xi  The president said  too many jobs in China  had been lost  marking an about face in his criticism of China s trade practices 
Larry Kudlow  Trump s top economic adviser  said on Sunday that management changes at ZTE would be among remedies needed before the U S  would consider a reprieve 
Export Controls
The Trump administration isn t willing to loosen exports controls on sensitive technology  Mnuchin said on Tuesday 
China has frequently argued that the trade imbalance can be fixed by the U S  lifting strict export curbs on high technology goods  One of China s trade demands in talks with the U S  this month included removing a ban on selling integrated circuits to the Asian nation 
 Export control items are absolutely not on the table for discussions   said Mnuchin   We would in no way look to loosen that  
To the contrary  the U S  is  aggressively  examining ways to protect American technology through an inter agency panel that reviews foreign acquisitions in the U S   known as Cfius  Mnuchin said  The Trump administration proposed legislation to expand that panel s powers  known as the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act  or Firrma 
 I can assure you this president is very focused on protecting American technology   Mnuchin said ",2018-05-22,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/trump-weighs-easing-zte-penalty-to-help-xi-as-lawmakers-resist-1458477,1458477

 Export control items are absolutely not on the table for discussions   said Mnuchin   We would in no way look to loosen that  
To the contrary  the U S  is  aggressively  examining ways to protect U S  technology through an inter agency panel that reviews foreign acquisitions in the U S   known as Cfius  Mnuchin said  The Trump administration proposed legislation to expand that panel s powers  known as the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act  or Firrma 
 I can assure you this president is very focused on protecting American technology   said Mnuchin ",2018-05-22,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/trump-says-us-reconsidering-zte-penalties-as-favor-to-xi-1457835,1457835
204736,426252,QCOM, How Sirin Labs  Blockchain Phone Stacks Up to The Samsung Galaxy S9 ,news,"Sirin Labs just recently announced the specs on  a mobile device that s mostly powered by the blockchain the company created in its ICO 
Aside from the injection of blockchain based software into its Sirin OS a souped up version of Android 8 1 that runs decentralized apps it also features a cold storage cryptocurrency wallet that supports all major coins plus Sirin s token  SRN 
The specifications announced in 2017 were promising  but the company ultimately decided to take the overkill down a notch and release a phone that could go toe to toe with most of the flagships available right now  To provide a bit of perspective on what these specs look like  let s compare the blockchain phone to Samsung s top of the line the Galaxy S9 and S9  
Storage   Memory
Most mobile users don t like having to buy a microSD card to store stuff on their phones  There s also the fact that some app data cannot be transferred to SD unless one makes risky modifications to the device 
For this reason  adequate storage space is probably one of the biggest priorities for people who want a future proof phone capable of withstanding the way that developers bloat their apps these days 
The Finney gives its users a generous 128 GB of storage out of the box  offering twice as much as Samsung s 64 GB on both its S9 and S9   If anyone wants to extend that storage  there s no word on whether the Finney has a microSD slot  The newest Galaxy phones will be extendable to 400GB 
And of course  if you want to run several apps you store on your phone simultaneously  you ll need a healthy dose of RAM  The Finney offers 6 GB of RAM  which is matched by the Samsung  KS 005930  Galaxy S9   The S9 offers only 4 GB 
Camera   Display
For selfie aficionados  nothing could be more important than the quality of the lens on a phone 
The Finney presents itself with an 8 MP front facing camera  a measure that is equaled by both the Samsung S9 and S9   As for the rear camera  the blockchain phone offers a 12 MP piece  which is also matched up by the S9 and S9  
When it comes to its display  however  the Finney is slightly underwhelming  It packs a 6 2 inch display with an FHD  1080p resolution on an 18 9 aspect ratio  Samsung s Galaxy S9 might not be as large  5 8 inches   but it sports a 1440p resolution on an aspect ratio of 18 9 
The S9 plus takes this a bit further by pushing the screen size to 6 2 inches  matching the Finney while surpassing its image quality 
It s easy to argue that the difference between 1080p and 1440p isn t that striking in small devices  but at a premium price of around  999 for the Finney  buyers looking for a mainstream phone might not want the compromise in quality  Then again  Sirin Labs is targeting an audience of cybersecurity  cryptocurrency  and blockchain enthusiasts who have a different set of priorities 
Chipset   Battery
The chip powering a phone is its central nervous system  If it underperforms at all  you ll see apps freezing and opening slowly  Horsepower is everything here  and the CPU is the centerpiece of the show 
The Finney  as well as both Samsung Galaxy S9 versions  include a Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  845 chipset  which boasts a Kryo 385 octa core CPU with 2 8 GHz of clock speed per core  Its LTE modem can download at 1 2 Gbps  and all of the other specifications are just what you d expect from an SoC announced a few months ago 
And what kind of battery can we expect to see powering these behemoths 
Here  again  the Finney s results match up with the Samsung Galaxy S9  with a 3000 mAh battery  However  the Galaxy S9  adds another 500 mAh on top of that  owing to its larger screen and its snappier specs 
Because the screen is one of the biggest drains on a phone s battery  we should be comparing the Finney to the S9   both of which have the same size screen  However  we re not going to do that  since the S9  has a much higher pixel density  making it drain its battery far more than the Finney 
Conclusion
While the Finney comes out slightly under the S9 in terms of raw numbers  its generous storage and highly secure and reputable operating system put it in the same weight class as all the heavy hitters released thus far  The people targeted by Sirin Labs aren t impressed by selfie cameras anyway  and even in this department  the Finney packs a punch worthy of sharing the throne with the S9 
Its pricing at  999 comes just around what you d expect an S9  for  and both phones fail to disappoint at this particular range ",2018-05-11,Cryptovest,https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/how-sirin-labs-blockchain-phone-stacks-up-to-the-samsung-galaxy-s9-1443856,1443856
204737,426253,QCOM,Telecom Stock Roundup  Qualcomm Seeks Legal Stay  InterDigital s Guidance   More,opinion,In the past five trading days  the initial rally of the telecom stocks saw a reversal as global supply chains were disrupted due to the trade war  Despite the Trump administration temporarily easing some trade restrictions on Huawei  several European firms followed suit and have either suspended their deals or cancelled pre orders with the Chinese smartphone manufacturer  As the tariff war virtually leads to intense technology warfare between the two superpowers of the global economy  the industry is likely to get polarized into two distinct halves  bringing an element of uncertainty within the rank and files of the telecom sector The U S  President continued to put pressure on the communist nation with his usual rhetoric and hinted that additional tariffs were just around the corner  He further added that the government was in no hurry to reach a bilateral trade settlement with China as the United States was reportedly filling up its coffers in huge quantity with the tariff bill  In reply  the Chinese officials refuted Trump s assertions that China was desperate to reach a consensus trade deal and maintained that an agreement would only materialize with mutual respect  trust and benefit Meanwhile  conflicting signals have emerged about whether the trade war has backfired on the U S  interests as several rural telecom carriers have publicly criticized the trade restrictions on cheap Huawei equipment  The ban has effectively forced various small and independently owned telecom operators to replace the existing equipment with other relatively expensive alternatives  thereby increasing their operating expenses  or risk withdrawal of support services from Huawei  This  in turn  might jeopardize the sustainability of various firms and put thousands of jobs at risk  The U S  lawmakers have already introduced a bill to provide up to  700 million to the telecom carriers  particularly in rural areas  to avert such crisis    On the other hand  Huawei has ramped up its legal fight against the U S  government sanctions and have filed a motion to step up its earlier lawsuit filed in a federal court in Texas  The recent filing  which in legal parlance is known as a  motion for summary judgment   is aimed to expedite the case without requiring it to have a full blown trial and avoiding handling of sensitive corporate information  Whether the court will indeed accept such a request from Huawei or heed the government s words remains to be seen  With Huawei facing probable roadblocks beyond the 90 day window for accessing Google s android platform along with hardware  software and key technical services from various U S  and European technology firms  the battle for survival appears murkier Regarding company specific news  legal recourse for stay in anti trust ruling  revenue guidance  5G deployment  earnings and

violated anti trust regulations through monopolistic trade practices  In order to encourage fair competition  the ruling ordered Qualcomm to renegotiate licensing contracts with customers to ensure that both buyers and other chip makers are not forced to pay exorbitant licensing fees on its patents  It also directed the company to end any exclusive agreement with customers  which prevented other

While Qualcomm has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Qualcomm was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  0 80 on  5 16 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  3 78 on  20 46 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Wireless Equipment is currently in the top 29  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2019-05-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/qualcomm-qcom-tops-q2-earnings-and-revenue-estimates-200415094,200415094

204778,426294,QCOM,Qualcomm  QCOM  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Qualcomm  QCOM  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on May 1  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This chipmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 70 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  12 5  
Revenues are expected to be  4 80 billion  down 8 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 6 96  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Qualcomm 
For Qualcomm  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 95  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Qualcomm will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Qualcomm would post earnings of  1 08 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 20  delivering a surprise of  11 11  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Qualcomm appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/qualcomm-qcom-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-should-you-buy-200410219,200410219

204792,426308,QCOM,Telecom Stock Roundup  AT T Averts Viacom Blackout  T Mobile s Broadband   More,opinion,In the past five trading days  telecom stocks witnessed a downtrend as uncertainty regarding trade negotiations lingered amid fears of a potential U S  recession  Although key issues relating to forced technology transfer and subsidies of state owned enterprises by China apparently remained unresolved  the latest hurdle seems to be a unilateral U S  insistence to re impose tariffs if the deal is abrogated  To add to the woes  falling U S  Treasury bond yields suggest difficult economic times ahead As the United States and China seem eager to walk the extra mile to reach a consensus decision that honors domestic obligations as well as international commitments  negotiations continue to iron out the differences  The U S  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer are scheduled to travel to Beijing later this week to meet a Chinese delegation led by Vice Premier Liu He for further discussions  In addition to some sticking points on subsidies  cyber theft  public sector enterprises  IP rights and so called forcible technology transfers  the biggest stumbling block appears to be a firm U S  stance to re impose tariffs unilaterally if China revokes on the trade agreement  Although China has reportedly agreed to periodic meetings at the levels of office director  vice minister and minister to keep a tab on its deal commitments  it is resisting to univocal U S  powers and its inability to retaliate with its own punitive measures As the industry awaits further clarity on policy issues and its aftereffect with no official statement release  there remains an element of uncertainty in the domestic market  Meanwhile  the yield on the 10 year Treasury bond was lower than the three month Treasury bill  a condition known as an inverted yield curve  speculating fears of a recession  Although a healthy American labor market with rising wages allayed the alarm bells  concern regarding a possible market correction remained a latent threat Among other developments  the bill introduced by the Democratic lawmakers in the House and Senate to reinstate the net neutrality rules that the Federal Communications Commission had repealed in 2017  passed through a subcommittee markup  paving the way for a full vote in the House of Representatives in April  Titled  Save the Internet Act   the bill aims to discourage blocking or throttling content and consider Internet access as a  utility  under Title II of the Communications Act  Although it is expected to pass the House  stiff resistance is apprehended in the Senate where Republicans hold the majority  Moreover  the bill is likely to be vetoed by Trump as he had been vocally skeptical of net neutrality in the past In the meantime  leading domestic telecom players have joined forces to clamp down on robocalls or unwanted phone calls by aiming to set up updated technology by the end of the year  These include free spam detection and blocking app to the introduction of new tool for the identification of spoofed calls  Such strategic moves seem to be the call

204819,426335,QCOM,Qualcomm  QCOM  Is A Top Dividend Stock Right Now  Should You Buy ,opinion,"All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio  whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  However  when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments  income investors hone in on dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
Qualcomm in Focus
Headquartered in San Diego  Qualcomm  QCOM  is a Computer and Technology stock that has seen a price change of  10 68  so far this year  Currently paying a dividend of  1 24 per share  the company has a dividend yield of 4 88   In comparison  the Wireless Equipment industry s yield is 0 4   while the S P 500 s yield is 1 95  
Taking a look at the company s dividend growth  its current annualized dividend of  2 48 is up 4 2  from last year  Over the last 5 years  Qualcomm has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 10 83   Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company s payout ratio  a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Qualcomm s current payout ratio is 73   This means it paid out 73  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Earnings growth looks solid for QCOM for this fiscal year  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  3 87 per share  which represents a year over year growth rate of 4 88  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for many reasons  they greatly improve stock investing profits  decrease overall portfolio risk  and carry tax advantages  among others  It s important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout 
Big  established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  but it s fairly uncommon to see high growth businesses or tech start ups offer their stockholders a dividend  Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  QCOM is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-02-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/qualcomm-qcom-is-a-top-dividend-stock-right-now-should-you-buy-200386802,200386802

204824,426340,QCOM,Qualcomm  QCOM  Surpasses Q1 Earnings Estimates,opinion,"Qualcomm  QCOM  came out with quarterly earnings of  1 20 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 08 per share  This compares to earnings of  0 98 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 11 11   A quarter ago  it was expected that this chipmaker would post earnings of  0 83 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 90  delivering a surprise of 8 43  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
Qualcomm  which belongs to the Zacks Wireless Equipment industry  posted revenues of  4 84 billion for the quarter ended December 2018  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 87   This compares to year ago revenues of  6 07 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Qualcomm shares have lost about 13 2  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 5 3  
What s Next for Qualcomm 
While Qualcomm has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Qualcomm was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  0 76 on  4 78 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  3 79 on  20 47 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

Wall Street will be looking for positivity from QCOM as it approaches its next earnings report date  This is expected to be January 30  2019  On that day  QCOM is projected to report earnings of  1 08 per share  which would represent year over year growth of 10 2   Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of  4 88 billion  down 19 5  from the year ago period 
For the full year  our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of  3 83 per share and revenue of  20 41 billion  which would represent changes of  3 79  and  10 2   respectively  from the prior year 
Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for QCOM  These revisions typically reflect the latest short term business trends  which can change frequently  As such  positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company s business and profitability 
Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near term stock prices  We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon  Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear  actionable rating model

Looking at its valuation  QCOM is holding a Forward P E ratio of 14 57  This represents a discount compared to its industry s average Forward P E of 17 66 
Also  we should mention that QCOM has a PEG ratio of 1 57  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  QCOM s industry had an average PEG ratio of 1 69 as of yesterday s close

204833,426349,QCOM,Qualcomm  QCOM  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Qualcomm  QCOM  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 30  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This chipmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 08 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  10 2  
Revenues are expected to be  4 88 billion  down 19 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Qualcomm 
For Qualcomm  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 33  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Qualcomm will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Qualcomm would post earnings of  0 83 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 90  delivering a surprise of  8 43  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Qualcomm appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/qualcomm-qcom-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200378416,200378416

204854,426370,QCOM,Will Qualcomm  QCOM  Beat Estimates Again In Its Next Earnings Report ,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Qualcomm  QCOM   which belongs to the Zacks Wireless Equipment industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This chipmaker has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 25 34  
For the most recent quarter  Qualcomm was expected to post earnings of  0 83 per share  but it reported  0 90 per share instead  representing a surprise of 8 43   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  0 71 per share  while it actually produced  1 01 per share  a surprise of 42 25  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Qualcomm  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Qualcomm currently has an Earnings ESP of  2 45   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on January 30  2019 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2018-12-31,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-qualcomm-qcom-beat-estimates-again-in-its-next-earnings-report-200372129,200372129

204899,426415,QCOM,Qualcomm  QCOM  Beats Q4 Earnings And Revenue Estimates,opinion,"Qualcomm  QCOM  came out with quarterly earnings of  0 90 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 83 per share  This compares to earnings of  0 92 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 8 43   A quarter ago  it was expected that this chipmaker would post earnings of  0 71 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 01  delivering a surprise of 42 25  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
Qualcomm  which belongs to the Zacks Wireless Equipment industry  posted revenues of  5 80 billion for the quarter ended September 2018  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 85   This compares to year ago revenues of  5 91 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Qualcomm shares have lost about 0 6  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 3 1  
What s Next for Qualcomm 
While Qualcomm has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Qualcomm was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

The earnings report  which is expected to be released on November 7  2018  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This chipmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 82 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  10 9  
Revenues are expected to be  5 53 billion  down 6 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Qualcomm 
For Qualcomm  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Qualcomm will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Qualcomm would post earnings of  0 71 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 01  delivering a surprise of  42 25  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Qualcomm doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2018-10-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-qualcomm-qcom-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200352388,200352388

Any recent changes to analyst estimates for QCOM should also be noted by investors  Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near term business trends  With this in mind  we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company s business outlook 
Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near term stock prices  To benefit from this  we have developed the Zacks Rank  a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system 
The Zacks Rank system ranges from  1  Strong Buy  to  5  Strong Sell   It has a remarkable  outside audited track record of success  with  1 stocks delivering an average annual return of  25  since 1988  Over the past month  the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant  QCOM is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold

When looking at the last two reports  this chipmaker has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 28 27   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the most recent quarter  Qualcomm was expected to post earnings of  0 71 per share  but it reported  1 01 per share instead  representing a surprise of 42 25   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  0 70 per share  while it actually produced  0 80 per share  a surprise of 14 29  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Qualcomm lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Qualcomm has an Earnings ESP of  0 61  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on November 7  2018 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate

Qualcomm Incorporated  NASDAQ QCOM  has continued its recent run higher  earlier hitting its highest point since Feb  28  with the shares last quoted at  66 10  In fact  QCOM s 14 day Relative Strength Index  RSI  is now in overbought territory  last seen at 72  All the while  the tech giant has been in the cross hairs of options traders and analysts alike 
For instance  Qualcomm showed up on Schaeffer s Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White s list of 20 stocks that have attracted the highest weekly options volume during the past 10 trading days  Names highlighted in yellow  such as QCOM  are new to the list since last week  As you can see  weekly Qualcomm traders have taken a strong interest in puts over calls 

This trend is extending to today s action  where put volume is at four times the expected pace  In fact  the nearly 66 000 puts that have crossed so far is pacing for the 99th annual percentile for volume  Near term options seem fairly priced  too  considering the equity s 30 day at the money implied volatility of 22 9  ranks in the bottom quartile of its annual range 
As for the analyst attention alluded to earlier  Rosenblatt Securities this morning upgraded QCOM stock to  buy  from  neutral  and lifted its price target to  70 from  56  The bull note was based on the belief that the telecom technology provider will benefit from the shift to 5G in the years to come 
Rosenblatt s price target represents territory not seen since late 2016 for the security  The shares came close to this round number level back in November and then again in January  Meanwhile  the average 12 month price target for Qualcomm comes in at  68 71 ",2018-08-20,Schaeffer's Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/options-traders-analysts-take-sides-on-rallying-qualcomm-200339608,200339608

204946,426462,QCOM,U S  Dollar Slips In Quiet Turnover,opinion,"The US dollar is sporting a softer profile against most of the major and emerging market currencies to start the new week  It already seemed to be tiring in the second half of last week  With today s mild losses  Dollar Index is off for a fourth consecutive session  the longest losing streak in over a month 
The US and China appear to have taken measure to diffuse the trade tensions between the world s two largest economies  The US is reversing itself on sanctions imposed on China s ZTE  HK 0763  that had appeared to threaten its future  China indicated it will launch a review of Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  s application to acquire NXP Semiconductor  This is ahead of the Chinese trade delegation coming to Washington for talks starting tomorrow 
Malaysian markets re opened for the first time since last week s election surprise  The NDFs had sold off  but when the onshore market resumed business  the ringgit recovered and managed to close fractionally higher  The stock market rose 0 2   recovering fully from the slide suggested by offshore ETF trading  It benefited from the regional advance  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose nearly 0 5   its third consecutive gain and five of the past six sessions  The index of H shares that trade in Hong Kong led the regional advance with a 1 6  gain  followed by the Hang Seng itself  1 35    The Nikkei matched the regional index performance and reached its best level since early February  Separately  note that the MSCI Emerging Markets Index is up 0 25  to extend its advance for a sixth session  It is the longest streak since the 11 day run in January 
European shares are trading a little heavier  The Dow Jones Stoxx 600 is off nearly 0 2   After a sharp run up since the end of March  the index hit a fall last week just above 390 00  It has been trading in a narrow range a little above there  Today is the fourth such session  As the market appears to have largely shrugged off the outcome of the Malaysian election  so too it is the market largely ignoring the likelihood of a new Italian government composed of the Five Star Movement and the League 
Italian shares are off slightly  though the bourse s 10 4  gain this year is easily the best in the G7  Italian bond yields are higher today but in line with the increase in yields throughout the region  The yield of Italy s 10 year benchmark has risen five basis points to poke above 1 90   Spain s benchmark yield is up a bit more ant 1 31   while German and French 10 year benchmark yields are up about four basis points 
The broad strokes of the new government s agenda have been indicated in the press to include a flat tax of 15   though 20  for incomes above some 80k euros   basic income that seems like unemployment insurance  and unwinding pensions from 2011 that increased the retirement age  The program is likely to clash with the EU  but that is for another day  Ideas that both the Five Star Movement and the League have softened their direct confrontation over the euro or membership in EMU appears to be offering some consolation presently  Meanwhile  the two parties apparently are still debating over who to support for the next Prime Minister 
Over the weekend  the German construction sector settled the wage negotiations  Following earlier deals among metal workers and public sector employees  the 800k strong construction union agreed on a six percent pay raise  retroactive from the start of the month  While the tight fisted budget is a source of frustration for many of Germany s partners  the high wage settlements is a helpful offset 
The euro is the strongest of the majors today  rising to almost  1 20 in late morning turnover in Europe  There is a 563 mln euro option struck at  1 20 that expires today  The  1 2020 area corresponds to the 200 day moving average  and the 38 2  retracement of the decline since the April 17 high    1 2415  is near  1 2050  We note that in the futures market  speculators have added to the gross long euro position for the past two weeks and for four of the past five weeks  There has been no capitulation 
The yen and the New Zealand dollar are the only majors not gaining on the dollar today  The kiwi continues to lag following the central bank s dovish posture  The dollar has tried pushing through the JPY110 twice in the past fortnight  The near term range is clear JPY108 65 JPY110 00  There is a large  1 3 bln dollar option struck at JPY110 that expires today  The  1 1 bln struck at JPY108 65 expiring today seems less relevant  The  395 mln struck at JPY109 25 also may more interesting 
Sterling is rising for the second consecutive session  It has not had back to back gains since the middle of April  It continues to chop around its trough  It has not closed above  1 36 since breaking below there on May 1  It must get above  and ideally close above  1 3620 to lift the technical tone and signal potential toward  1 3775  1 3800 
The Australian dollar is consolidating the recent gains that lifted it from almost  0 7400 on May 9 to  0 7565 at the end of last week  There are sizeable options that expire at  0 7500 today and the next couple of sessions  Today  there are A 1 9 bln and tomorrow another A 1 7 bln and Wednesday an option for A 1 2 bln expires  The technical indicators are constructive  A move above  0 7565  0 7575 could signal scope for another cent advance  The US dollar s bounce after mixed Canadian jobs data before the weekend ran out of steam near CAD1 2800  The technical indicators seem to favor Canada and initial support for the US dollar is seen near CAD1 2730 ",2018-05-14,Marc Chandler,https://www.investing.com/analysis/us-dollar-slips-in-quiet-turnover-200315918,200315918

204966,426482,QCOM,Business Cycle Weaker As Trade Tensions Continue  ,opinion,"Global business cycle weakening 
We see clear signs that the global business cycle has peaked in early 2018 in line with our expectations outlined in   3 January 2018  Our MacroScope models point to a further deceleration over the coming quarters  The recent uncertainty over a potential trade war is likely to reinforce this picture  Monetary tightening  higher yields  lower real wage growth  more uncertainty   and in the case of the euro area a stronger currency   are all factors pushing production growth a notch lower for the rest of 2018  in our view  see   19 April 2018 
While the cycle is softening  we still expect growth levels to stay above potential growth in 2018 and 2019  US fiscal easing will temper any deceleration in 2019  Nevertheless  declining PMI levels across regions tends to cause some anxiety about the strength of the recovery  giving less support to risk assets and putting a cap on bond yields 
Trade tensions continue 
The trade spat between the US and China has changed arena the past week as another battle is being fought in the tech area   On Monday  the US banned US sales to the Chinese telecommunications equipment maker ZTE for seven years  saying it had broken a settlement agreement  ZTE is one of the leading tech companies in China within telecoms equipment and gets 15  of its supplies from US companies  The move from the US could quickly backfire though  China has not yet approved a takeover deal by the big US tech company Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  of Dutch semiconductor company NXP  China is going through an antitrust review and said this week it had found issues hard to resolve regarding the deal  An equally big problem for US tech companies could be that Chinese consumers are now posting patriotic statements on social media in China and continued obstacles for Chinese companies in the US would risk triggering a form of consumer boycott in China  see

205026,426542,QCOM,BlackBerry climbs on hopes for growth in security  autos,news,"By Alastair Sharp
TORONTO  Reuters    BlackBerry Ltd shares  TO BB   O BBRY  surged to a four year high in Toronto on Tuesday  extending a two month rally spurred on by expectations for strong growth in the fast expanding cyber security and automotive software markets 
The Canadian shares climbed as much as 9 4 percent to C 15 34  As of early afternoon  volume was at about 3 million shares  nearly triple the full day three month average 
The rally followed an announcement by  Ford Motor Co   N F  on Friday that the automaker planned to start updating software on its vehicles using a wireless system to enhance security based on BlackBerry technology 
BlackBerry s U S  listed shares gained more than 9 percent on Monday  when Canada s stock market was closed for a holiday 
Ford s Sync 3 interactive system for cars runs on BlackBerry s QNX operating system  which is capable of delivering software updates  over the air  
Some investors believe that Friday s announcement from Ford is a sign that QNX will be more broadly adopted in the auto industry as other automakers start updating their cars using the relatively new over the air approach  analysts said 
 BlackBerry is well positioned at the epicenter of this transformation   CCS Insight analyst Nicholas McQuire told Reuters 
McQuire and other analysts also cited this month s global  ransomware  attack  dubbed WannaCry  with helping to raise BlackBerry s profile 
BlackBerry shares have climbed more than 60 percent since they reported stronger than expected earnings on March 31  which reinforced expectations that the company is succeeding in re inventing itself after the collapse of a smartphone business that was once the market leader 
The rally gained steam in mid April on news that BlackBerry had won a binding arbitration forcing chipmaker  Qualcomm Inc   O QCOM  to pay it back almost  1 billion 
 This chunk of change from Qualcomm has really changed investor sentiment on BlackBerry   said Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Walkley 
Investors are betting that Chief Executive John Chen will use those funds to build up the company s cyber security and automotive software efforts and possibly make acquisitions related to its relatively new Radar tracking business  Walkley said 
Last week  an equity analyst with Macquarie reported that BlackBerry was working with two luxury automakers to develop a security service that would remotely scan vehicles for computer viruses 

The company does not break out cyber security revenue  though Walkley said it accounts for only a small percentage of its business  which remains focused on managing secure connections to mobile devices ",2017-05-23,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/blackberry-climbs-on-hopes-for-growth-in-security,-autos-487595",487595

industry has lately emerged as an intensely contested space where success thrives largely on technical superiority  quality of services and scalability  Thus  in order to stay ahead of competitors  existing players need to be constantly on their toes to introduce innovative products According to a recent report by research firm International Data Corp   IDC   worldwide spending on IoT is slated

205094,426610,QCOM,After cyber attacks  Internet of Things wrestles with making smart devices safer,news,"By Jeremy Wagstaff and J R  Wu SINGAPORE TAIPEI  Reuters    Recent cyber attacks harnessing everyday devices such as cameras  video recorders  printers  routers and speakers are a wake up call to the hidden dangers of the Internet of Things  The problem for the device makers  though  is that few are well equipped to tackle the unfamiliar task of foiling hackers  For a sense of that challenge  take AV Tech Corp  a once proud giant among CCTV camera makers whose 1990s building in a Taipei suburb hints at the gap it must overcome between hardware factories of a decade ago and those of today  AV Tech  which made the 2008 Forbes list of companies to watch  has seen competition from China shrink its profits to about a tenth of what they were then  Like its peers  AV Tech has moved its products online  connecting its cameras and the digital video recorders that store the footage on to the Internet so users can access them remotely   But such companies are not well schooled in cyber security  leaving these devices wide open to hackers   The harsh reality is that cyber security is not even on the radar of many manufacturers   said Trent Telford  CEO of Covata  AX CVT   an internet security firm   Security will eventually become more of a priority  but it may well be too late for this generation of IoT users   Up to 30 billion devices are expected to be connected to the Internet by 2020   all potentially vulnerable  The danger was highlighted when hundreds of thousands of consumer devices were harnessed recently into so called botnets  launching attacks on target websites  including PayPal  O PYPL   Spotify and Twitter  N TWTR   Cyber security experts say this is just the beginning  They have since found new versions of the malware designed to find and infect poorly secured devices  Botnets could also be used in advertising fraud and blackmail  according to Daniel Miessler of IOActive  an internet security consultancy  Flashpoint  a cyber security consultancy  said parts of the botnet used in last month s mass attack were used this week to launch denial of service attacks on the campaign websites of both U S  presidential candidates  though neither site appeared to have been knocked offline  VULNERABLE While researchers have not found any AV Tech devices in a botnet  they have pointed to lapses that make them vulnerable  In a blog post  confirmed by his company  Gergely Eberhardt of Hungarian security firm Search Lab said he spent a year trying to alert AV Tech to 14 security holes in its products  He got no response  and last month released his findings  That  and news of other botnet distributed denial of services attacks  was a wake up call for the Taiwanese firm   To be honest  in the past  hacking and discovering such matters was not an issue for AV Tech   said Dick Lee  special assistant in the company president s office   This experience has significantly raised our alert level internally  This is something that those in the surveillance equipment business must face seriously   That s happening  but slowly   and sometimes reluctantly  Chinese camera maker Hangzhou Xiongmai Technology Co recalled thousands of its devices after researchers said they may have formed part of the botnet that took down Twitter and other websites  but it also threatened legal action against those defaming the company  SECURITY FOCUS Chipmaker Qualcomm  O QCOM  said it was looking into new technologies  including those based on machine intelligence  to make IoT devices safer    We can build into the hardware certain fundamental things that will watch to see  is the device doing something it wasn t expected to do  Is it talking to somewhere it wasn t expected to talk to  Is it accessing memory differently   executive chairman Paul Jacobs told Reuters on the sidelines of an event in Taipei on Monday   It s very important for IoT to make sure you have a way of securing and updating devices   AV Tech said it was talking to Search Lab and other security firms about long term cooperation  and also plans to release updated firmware   software that upgrades the inner workings of its devices to make them more secure  It s not just the more established consumer electronics firms which are battling this   Lani Refiti  cyber security lead for Cisco Systems Inc  O CSCO   said he has been working with Australian hardware start ups to make their devices more secure  One firm making sensors to allow treadmill users to share their workouts  he said  faced a three month delay if it rewrote software to properly encrypt data  The cheaper solution was to obscure the data  and make any hacker work harder to crack it  A handful of industry groups are emerging to focus exclusively on security   Refiti set up IoTSec Australia this year to work with entrepreneurs  while UK based IoT Security Foundation has chipmaker ARM  Huawei  HWT UL  and Philips  AS PHG  among its members  Its main goal  says founder John Moor  is to simplify guidance so engineers actually read it  The foundation is releasing its first best practice manual  condensing a 300 400 page industry document to just 30 pages   The challenge is more than the technical challenge  for these companies  said Moor   You can put in security features  but do you have the right processes in place  are you doing the right things   For AV Tech  improved security may prove to be a way to differentiate its products from Chinese competition  
 This is a good opportunity  For these surveillance products  the demand on their security is the most important   said Lee  adding the inevitable higher cost  is not expected to be huge  ",2016-11-09,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/after-cyber-attacks,-internet-of-things-wrestles-with-making-smart-devices-safer-438644",438644

205111,426627,QCOM,U S  FCC to vote on spectrum for 5G wireless networks,news,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON  Reuters    The U S  Federal Communications Commission will vote July 14 on new rules to identify and open spectrum for next generation high speed 5G wireless applications  the panel s chairman said on Monday 
FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler said if the FCC  approves my proposal next month  the United States will be the first country in the world to open up high band spectrum for 5G networks and applications  
He said the FCC also will seek comments on opening other high frequency spectrum bands 
Policymakers and mobile phone companies say the next generation of wireless signals needs to be 10 to 100 times faster and be far more responsive to allow advanced technologies like virtual surgery or controlling machines remotely 
Wheeler  in a speech at the National Press Club  said  unlike some countries  we do not believe we should spend the next couple of years studying what 5G should be  how it should operate and how to allocate spectrum  based on those assumptions  
The FCC will make spectrum available and rely on a process led by the private sector for producing technical standards 
 Verizon Communications  Inc  NYSE VZ  and AT T Inc  NYSE T  have said they will begin deploying 5G trials in 2017  and Wheeler said the first commercial deployments at scale are expected in 2020 
Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  Inc strongly backs the effort  the company said on Monday 
Meredith Attwell Baker  CEO of CTIA  the wireless trade group  said 5G rules must  strike a reasonable balance for licensed and unlicensed use while promoting investment with clear service and licensing rules   The FCC and states must streamline rules for adding wireless infrastructure 
FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel said in a speech earlier this month that there is a worldwide race to adopt 5G  South Korea and Japan plan to deploy 5G service by the time they host the Olympics  in 2018 and 2020  respectively  The European Commission  South Korea  China and Japan are all working on 5G research efforts 
 The race is on  It s one we want to win   Rosenworcel said 
Wheeler said 5G will help more Americans get access to high speed internet   Millions of Americans can t access high speed connectivity because it s too costly to run fiber to the home   he said 
The technology will boost many technologies  he said   Autonomous vehicles will be controlled in the cloud  Smart city energy grids  transportation networks and water systems will be controlled in the cloud  Immersive education and entertainment will come from the cloud  ",2016-06-20,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/u.s.-fcc-to-vote-on-spectrum-for-5g-wireless-networks-409476,409476

205116,426632,QCOM,China antitrust proposals trigger foreign business fears over IP protection,news,"By Michael Martina BEIJING  Reuters    Foreign companies with dominant market positions could be increasingly forced to license technology to competitors or face sanctions under China s latest draft antitrust policy guidelines  according to foreign business groups and attorneys  The proposals include a so called  essential facilities  doctrine  a legal concept that assumes some core infrastructure and technology is so important  or the barrier to entry so high  that refusal to share constitutes monopolistic behavior  If interpreted broadly  companies could be forced to license their intellectual property  IP  to Chinese competitors or lower licensing costs to benefit local firms  at a time when China is seeking to promote domestic champions  Draft guidelines for implementing the country s 2008 Anti Monopoly Law put forward by two of the country s antitrust regulators go beyond global standards  experts and lawyers say  Telecommunications  pharmaceuticals and renewable energy industries  all priority areas for Beijing  are likely to be the most vulnerable   China is still fundamentally looking at this as though it is an IP taker rather than an IP creator   said Lester Ross  a partner at law firm Wilmer Hale s Beijing office  China s antitrust policies are worrying its trading partners  including the United States  which issued a joint statement with China during President Xi Jinping s state visit to Washington last September that both countries would  avoid the enforcement of competition law to pursue industrial policy goals   On March 9  U S  Assistant Attorney General William Baer  who heads the Justice Department s antitrust division  testified before the Senate Judiciary antitrust subcommittee about the risk of China using its competition laws to further industrial policy and technology transfers   This administration worries about it a lot   Baer said at the hearing  The issue is likely to be discussed in April when officials from the State Administration for Industry and Commerce  SAIC  and the National and Development and Reform Commission  NDRC   two antitrust regulators to have put forward the proposals in recent months  are expected in Washington for talks  according to a source familiar with the situation   INDUSTRIAL POLICY DE JURE   The concerns of business groups about the draft IP guidelines are well founded   said Yee Wah Chin  a New York based antitrust lawyer at law firm Ingram  Yuzek  Gainen  Carroll and Bertolotti  The U S  Chamber of Commerce and the American Chamber of Commerce in China  as well as the American Bar Association  have urged the NDRC and the SAIC to revise the guidelines before they are implemented  In comments delivered to regulators in February  the two chambers said they were concerned about the effort to change market determined licensing terms  into a right to receive whatever payment the government deems appropriate given its industrial policy de jure   Jeremie Waterman  executive director for Greater China with the U S  Chamber  told Reuters the approach would deter innovation and fuel trade tensions   No other competition law jurisdiction in the world would have such a broad  unbalanced essential facilities doctrine   Waterman said  The SAIC and the NDRC did not respond to a Reuters request for comment  Chinese antitrust officials have long said their policies do not unfairly target foreign business  Premier Li Keqiang told a U S  congressional delegation on Thursday that China  will ramp up efforts to nurture a fairer environment for market competition and will bolster intellectual property rights protection to attract more foreign investment   Chinese state media reported  While the doctrine is used at times by other countries  Western antitrust law has long held that restrictions on access to IP are crucial for rewarding innovation  and that consumer  not corporate  welfare is most important when determining violations  The drafting of the guidelines coincides with the Chinese government s new five year plan plotting the country s economic goals for 2016 2020 and its emphasis on its so called Internet Plus and Made in China 2025 strategies  which aim to make Chinese companies world technology leaders  For example  the Made in China 2025 plan calls for a progressive increase in domestic components used in priority sectors such as advanced information technology and robotics to 70 percent by 2025 from a target of 40 percent by 2020   In recent years  China s antitrust regulators have been criticized for using aggressive tactics in investigations and weak adherence to due process as they have stepped up enforcement   Xu Kunlin  the controversial NDRC official who led a probe of Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  Inc  which yielded a record fine of nearly  1 billion from the chip maker last year  was promoted in March to deputy secretary general of the commission   Experts in the foreign business and legal community fear the guidelines will push Chinese officials to pursue protectionist policies

Through its investigation  the SEC determined that the San Diego based semiconductor company also provided gifts  travel and other forms of entertainment as a way of influencing officials at a host of state owned Chinese telecommunications companies  The SEC also charged that Qualcomm had faulty internal controls in place which failed to discover improper payments  while misrepresenting financial records by asserting that the offerings to the officials were legitimate business expenses 
Among the charges  Qualcomm provided full time employment and paid internships to family members of Chinese officials  known as  must place  hires in an effort to secure business in the country  In one instance  the company provided a  75 000 research grant to a university in the U S  on behalf of the son of a foreign official  In exchange  the son retained his position with the school s Ph  D program and was allowed to renew his visa  the SEC said 
Qualcomm later hired the son on a permanent basis  even after he received a poor evaluation in an initial interview when company representatives concluded that he would be a  drain on the teams he would join   Additionally  a Qualcomm executive also extended the official s son with a  70 000 loan to purchase a home  according to the SEC 
 Companies must effectively design and implement internal controls across all business operations to prevent FCPA violations  including its hiring practices   said Michele Wein Layne  Director of the SEC s Los Angeles Regional Office   For more than a decade  Qualcomm went to extraordinary lengths to gain a business advantage with foreign officials deciding between Qualcomm s technology and its competitors  
In a press release issued on Tuesday  Qualcomm noted that each of the charges documented in the case occurred as recently as four years ago 
 Qualcomm is pleased to have put this matter behind us   Don Rosenberg  executive vice president and general counsel  said in a statement   We remain committed to ethical conduct and compliance with all laws and regulations  and will continue to be vigilant about FCPA compliance

financial crisis bit deep into their reserves  So they are turning to fixed income investments  More than buying bonds directly  they are investing in private equity and hedge funds  which use borrowed money to increase returns on debt while also chasing higher risk  higher return investments such as junk bonds  Egli s retirement fund  the Iowa Public Employees  Retirement System  or IPERS  is among the many pension funds that have emerged as major investors in these alternative investments  The demand from pension funds is helping to finance record levels of corporate debt  The low interest rates that have crimped returns on investments also make it dirt cheap for companies to borrow  and many of them are doing just that  often to buy back their own shares  FUEL FOR THE STOCK MARKET As reported in earlier installments in this series  corporate America is pouring unprecedented amounts into buybacks  Using debt to finance buybacks can produce tax or accounting benefits  The buybacks provide an alternative to capital investment or research spending when business conditions don t justify making long term bets  Instead  buybacks return profits to shareholders   and often enhance executive pay   even when a company hits lean times and is laying off workers  In fact  buybacks have become the fuel powering the more than twofold increase in the stock market since the depths of the financial crisis in 2009  Together  U S  non financial companies have spent  2 24 trillion on buybacks since 2009  while borrowing an extra  1 9 trillion to help finance those purchases  according to a Reuters review of Federal Reserve data  During the same period  mutual and exchange traded funds have bought less stock  at  1 24 trillion  Pension funds  meanwhile  have been net sellers to the tune of  1 05 trillion since 2009  while households and hedge funds have dumped an additional  558 billion   We are in a massive bull market that is being generated by credit led financial engineering   said Brian Reynolds  chief market strategist at brokerage firm New Albion Partners  who analyzes pension fund allocations for signals of stock market values  Since 2008  Deere s total debt has risen by  2 72 billion to  4 93 billion   and those figures don t include regular bond issues by the company s financing arm to help underwrite customer purchases  During the same period  Deere has repurchased  12 33 billion of its shares  Deere said that money for the buybacks came from strong cash flow  not borrowing  and that the company gives priority to spending on research and development over buybacks  The company increased debt in fiscal 2012 as a protective measure  Chief Financial Officer Rajesh Kalathur said  in case the impasse in Washington over raising the nation s debt ceiling roiled markets  After that threat faded  he said  it would have been  unreasonable  to hold excess cash  Many other companies have been borrowing heavily to help pay for buybacks  St  Louis  Missouri based agrochemical giant  Monsanto   N MON  Co  for example  is caught in the same commodities downturn as Deere  It said in October that it would slash 2 600 jobs as commodity prices slump  But it has increased debt by  7 billion since 2013  helping to fund  8 billion in share buybacks in the same time frame   San Diego based chip maker Qualcomm  O QCOM  Inc said in July that it would cut 4 500 full time staff  or 15 percent of its workforce  as foreign competition pinches sales  The company raised  11 billion in debt this year  helping to finance  11 25 billion in buybacks for the year   And Atlanta based beverage maker Coca Cola Co said in January that it would cut at least 1 600 white collar jobs as it faced sluggish soda sales  It has added  9 billion in debt since the end of 2013 and bought back  6 13 billion of its shares in that time    Basically what you re seeing in the stock market is a slow motion leveraged buyout of the entire market   said Ed Yardeni  founder of Yardeni Research  GLOBAL HEADWINDS Deere for a decade was riding high on a global surge in commodities  Farmers from India to Iowa eagerly snapped up Deere s machines   many of which can sell for  250 000 or more   as they rushed to meet the world s growing demand for corn and soybeans  The company also makes construction and forestry equipment  But that boom has gone bust as growth in China and other emerging economies cooled over the past several years  Deere said in January that it would cut more than 900 workers in Iowa and Illinois  including 565 in Waterloo  as it rushes to curb output  The layoffs came on top of 1 100 job cuts last year  In Waterloo  the layoffs hit like a tornado  Deere operates four factories in this city of 68 000 people and is by far the largest private employer around  The company s roots here reach back to the early part of the last century  when the company started by an Illinois blacksmith named John Deere  who had invented a plow that worked well in the Midwest s dense soil  decided to diversify into a new device called a  tractor   Rather than develop its own machine  Deere bought the company that made the Waterloo Boy tractor  establishing this city s role as a production hub  Before the farm crisis of the 1980s  Deere employed 16 000 in Waterloo  Those numbers were down to about 4 000 before the most recent wave of cuts   We re about as close as America still has to a one company town   said Dave Nagle  a local attorney who represented the area in Congress as a Democrat in the late 1980s and early 1990s  Deere has outsourced much of the work once done in its Waterloo plants  he noted  including to some smaller operations in the area that pay much lower wages   So the wage bracket of the whole community has taken a significant hit   he said   We really never came back from the farm crisis   Deere s Waterloo workers are unionized   and proud of their American roots  A sign outside the United Autoworkers local union hall warns visitors to park foreign built cars out of sight at the back of the lot  Union president Tom Ralston said Deere offered laid off workers generous support   as well as the opportunity to get retrained or go back to college for up to two years through a federal grant that covers all costs  including commuting in some cases   But at the end of the day   he said   it s hard to be laid off and out of work   Happel agrees  He came to Deere after he got laid off from a local printing company during the depths of the last recession  Deere was one of the few places hiring at the time  and he thought he landed well  He figured he might eventually retire from there  like many of members of his extended family  But the stress of that previous layoff still haunts him  He was having troubles in his marriage at the time  he said  and the  financial pressures of that definitely added to them   The couple divorced in 2010  He initially ruled out going back to school after Deere cut him  he said  because he knew it would mean at least two years of financial hardship   and he worried what that would do to his current relationship  he s now engaged to be married  and his children  His fianc e s daughter lives with them  and his own three teenagers split their time between his home and their mother s  All he could see were mounting bills  His oldest daughter heads to college in the fall  he said  and they have no savings set aside for that   We re meeting with a financial adviser this week on that   he said  after settling into a booth at a diner across the street from the University of Northern Iowa s starkly modern campus  just a few miles up the road from Deere s transmission plant  CAREER CHANGE Happel is now studying at the University of Northern Iowa to become an actuary   someone who helps insurance companies and others measure and manage risk and uncertainty  He still worries  His fianc e is an information technology specialist for an insurance company  A few days earlier  he said  she was called in for a meeting where the company announced cutbacks  Her job is safe  he said   but it s a scary thing   He paused for a moment  and then asked   We re not supposed to be in a recession now  are we   Many laid off Deere workers end up across town  at the Displaced Worker Transition Center   a glass walled building on the edge of Waterloo s community college campus   where counselors help Deere workers pilot their retraining or college options  Longtime Deere workers said it can be hard to jump into other factory jobs  Other local employers know that the workers   who can be recalled to their old jobs for a period equal to however long they worked there   are unlikely to stick with lower paying jobs if Deere beckons them back  For that reason  some employers refuse to even consider Deere workers for job openings  Robbie Hadaway  who was laid off in April  now works as a counsellor at the displaced worker center   I just think they could have impacted fewer people s lives   if they d done a better job of projecting sales   he said  Deere said the last six years have seen the most rapid fluctuation in demand for its products in the company s history   Recently  there have been layoffs as Deere balances the size of its manufacturing workforce with market demand for products   said Ken Golden  a Deere spokesman   Even so  Deere employs several thousand more people today than in 2009   When local employers slash jobs  the hardships of people like Happel and Hadaway reverberate through the entire community  Michelle Weidner  Waterloo s chief financial officer  said the town never fully recovered from the massive 1980s downturn in the U S  farm economy  The town gets most of its income from property taxes  which tank when there are big layoffs and a sudden rush of people trying to sell houses at the same time  The latest cuts at Deere have yet to hit their budget  she said   but we know it is coming   The town has shed a few fire and police personnel as it absorbs the impact of new tax rules mandated by the state  which limit how much they can collect on property taxes from businesses  The library has maintained hours  Weidner said  but it s  become a very heated budget conversation every year   The library now gets by with the help of donations and bequests to help preserve services  The town contributes to teacher pensions  as well as those for about half of the town s employees through the Iowa Public Employees  Retirement System  or IPERS  which manages retirement funds for public employees throughout the state  IPERS owns two bonds sold by Deere s financing arm in 2012  part of the  28 billion fund s allocation to lower risk fixed income investments  The fund also invests 11 percent of its portfolio in private equity and debt  and 5 percent in higher yield  high risk credit such as junk bonds  It has reduced the weighting of publicly traded stocks to 41 percent from 48 percent in 2005  PENSION FUNDS PINCHED That pattern has been repeated at many pension funds  A study this year by consultants Towers Watson found that pensions accounted for 33 percent  or  1 14 trillion  of total assets of the world s 100 largest alternative asset managers   Pension funds are the single most important investor base   said Oliver Wriedt  co president of CIFC Asset Management  which has  14 2 billion under management and specializes in corporate loans  Cities and states across the country have been cutting jobs and services as they devote more money to pension plans  Illinois  which is more than  100 billion behind on its obligations  is in the worst shape with a funding ratio of assets to liabilities of only 39 percent  It is followed by Kentucky  Connecticut and Alaska  Mr  Reynolds  the market strategist at New Albion Partners  said   There is a cash call on cities and towns  Instead of hiring cops or teachers  more money gets diverted to the pensions from the city   The hunt for higher returns can make a pension fund more vulnerable to losses if markets seize up  Their recent emphasis on leveraged investments   those made with borrowed money to boost potential returns    can create contagion across markets because fund managers often need to sell assets to meet margin and redemption calls  Illiquid debt can also pose dangers when fund managers face a wave of redemptions  Just this month  a Third Avenue Management LLC fund that invested in risky and illiquid loans collapsed  leading to losses across the junk bond market as investors fretted over whether the damage would spread  Based on similar concerns  some pensions have switched out of higher risk strategies  That s what the San Diego County pension fund did this year  only a year after boosting leverage and investing in less liquid assets   We ve gone from a levered position to an unlevered position   said Stephen Sexauer  chief investment officer at the fund  who was hired in May to reallocate the pension s resources  Egli said she is not worried about the durability of IPERS  She taught and still lives in Waverly  Iowa  about 21 miles north of Waterloo  and she said her town weathered both the recession and a natural disaster that made life tough for everyone  In 2008  a flood inundated the area   damaging 700 homes and 100 businesses  Wage increases were meager to nonexistent for nearly five years  said the 56 year old  and teachers had to pay more for their insurance  There were also changes to the retirement plan that meant slightly smaller checks for retirees like her  One change  The pension switched from calculating retirement pay based on the average of her three highest earning years to the five highest  which nudged down the number   But my sense is that IPERS has done a really good job   she said   They took a little bit more from us to be sure they could cover it   She s right  The IPERS pension is 84 percent funded   up from a low of 80 percent in 2011  though it remains below the 89 percent level it was at a decade ago  Egli is secure  Her husband  a self employed attorney  is still working and she now substitute teaches about half of the school days each month  Her cousin is having a tough time making ends meet  Happel will collect unemployment insurance as long as he is enrolled in classes  but the  400 a week he receives is only a fraction of what he earned at Deere  The family has cut out extras  no movies  no dinners out  He dipped into his 401 k  retirement savings account to pay off credit cards  but notes ruefully that those card balances are now drifting back up as he scrambles to cover expenses  Being part of a big family eases the strain  His family still owns the 1 200 acre farm that was homesteaded by his great grandfather and is now operated by his father and brother   I go over there when they need a hand   he said   That extra money helps  but it doesn t get us caught up by any means

In fact  this company is the world s first to launch 4G in 600 MHz band  Its first deployment sites are Cheyenne and Wyoming 
Going forward  T Mobile US is planning to complete the roll out of the spectrum within six months  Also  the company has agreed to invest in broadcast equipment manufacturing capacity  installation resources  help for low power TV stations and support for TV translator licenses to finish the deployment as soon as possible

Upcoming 5G Wireless Technology 
According to a study commissioned by Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM   fifth generation  5G  wireless technology could result in real global economic growth by  3 trillion cumulatively from 2020 to 2035  Several industry researchers hold that 5G network will provide a download speed of 1 Gbps  gigabit per second   which is 200 times the throughput of the currently available standard 4G LTE network  The latency period of data delivery will be in single milliseconds  Further  5G technology is designed to be more power efficient than any other standard wireless network available at the moment  Naturally  5G enabled mobile devices are likely to last much longer than their 3G or 4G counterparts 
In Jul 2016  in a landmark voting  the FCC unanimously decided to make available high frequency radio spectrums  above 24 GHz  for the use of the upcoming 5G wireless network  With this  the U S  becomes the first country in the world to identify and open up a significant amount of spectrum suitable for the ultra fast 5G mobile standard  At present  all four major national wireless operators  namely  Verizon Communications Inc  NYSE VZ    VZ   AT T Inc  NYSE T    T   Sprint Corp   S  and T Mobile US Inc   TMUS  are conducting trial runs for 5G wireless standards  Except AT T  each stock currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  You can see

DOCSIS 3 1  Cable MSOs Answer to High Speed Network 
DOCSIS  Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification  is a communications protocol that allows cable MSOs  multi service operators  to provide high speed broadband connections  This technology was specifically designed to be the cable TV industry s answer to high speed wireless and fiber based wireline networks of telecom operators  The old generation DOCSIS 3 0 technology has helped cable TV operators compete in the race for the fastest internet speed available in the market 
The next generation DOCSIS 3 1 standard is an improved formulation of the existing DOCSIS 3 0  Theoretically  while DOCSIS 3 0 supports 152 Mbps download and 108 Mbps upload speeds  DOCSIS 3 1 offers as high as 10 Gbps downstream and up to 1 Gbps upstream network capabilities  Additionally  DOCSIS 3 1 comes with several operational benefits 
The technology is also backward compatible  allowing the present hybrid fiber coaxial cable lines to allow such high internet speed by simply switching to a DOCSIS 3 1 compatible modem  Although FTTH has the advantage of providing unlimited bandwidth  backward compatibility is a major advantage of DOCSIS 3 1  This allows cable MSOs to provide high speed Gigabit broadband to customers  without having to incur additional digging or other cable laying costs  unlike FTTH providers  This is sure to boost margins of cable MSOs 
OpportunitiesThe telecommunications industry as a whole offers a number of positives that are difficult to disregard from the standpoint of investors          Immune to External Disturbances  A major characteristic of the telecommunications industry is that it is immune to any international geo political disturbance even when it leads to economic fluctuations  Thus  the ongoing sovereign debt crisis in Europe  the slowdown in China or other non U S  economic volatility may not have any immediate impact on the industry            Barrier to Entry  Lack of public airwaves  spectrum  in the telecommunications industry creates a high barrier to entry  The U S  telecom market is controlled by just four national players  as regional low cost operators are not eligible to compete with large carriers  Furthermore  it is not easy for a new telecom carrier to establish itself in the market as it requires government approval to transmit voice  data  and video on public airwaves  Spectrum licenses are limited and therefore quite expensive  Moreover  the deployment of network infrastructure requires significant capital expenditure  which very few entities can afford  Thus  this barrier protects the profits of incumbents in the telecom space          Strong Demand  A recovering economy drives demand for real time voice  data and video manifold  This escalation in demand has encouraged telecom service providers to undertake large network extensions while upgrading plans  Moreover  the FCC projects 25   50 folds mobile data demand growths over the next five years

205159,426675,QCOM,Opening Bell  Bonds Rally  Dollar Falls  Stocks Hit New Records,opinion,"by Pinchas Cohen
Key Events

Bonds rally on weak inflation and reduced probability of Trump reflation
US stocks hit record  despite weak inflation and low chance of Trump reflation
Dollar closes at its lowest since September 3
NASDAQ Composite  yen and gold pass top  suggesting bullish consolidation
API reports surprise build  EIA expected to follow suit

Global Affairs

Equities in Asia and futures in the US  UK and Europe advanced following both the S P 500 and NASDAQ Composite closing at record levels  with the latter also achieving a record high  This came even as hopes for a Trump reflation took yet another step backward after the GOP healthcare bill was scrapped and its savings which would have been used for tax reform and weak inflation data 
The low CPI  compounded by the Fed s slower path to raising rates  caused top failures for the yen and gold  turning them into bullish consolidation patterns with an upside target equivalent to the size of the patterns 

On one hand  the ever rising concern about both US President Donald Trump s ability to enact fiscal stimulus  as well as weak global inflation data most recently in the UK  where it dropped to an unexpected 2 6 low on lower gas prices sent Treasuries  bunds and gilts higher 

At the same time the dollar closed at its lowest level since September 8 
On the other hand  US stocks achieved fresh records  The apparently never ending US equity rallies are challenged only by the apparently continuous Trump scandals and agenda failures  The new highs  despite yet another failure to move Trump s pro business agenda forward  may suggest investors are no longer counting on him for growth 
However  if that s the case  why would equities rally even after weak inflation and the Fed plan for a slower path to interest rates hikes  In fact  equity investors responded to the Fed s dire and somewhat embarrassing announcement that it was lowering its economic outlook by buying yet more equity  Investors believe stocks will continue to rise on a worsening economy and the use of cheap money to prop up equity valuations 
Therefore  even if one would argue that inflation is weak because of Trump s failure to kickstart the economy per his platform  the latest record highs prove that investors are not only over Trump but also over growth 
Unlike equity investors  bond and dollar traders don t benefit from a slower path to rising rates propping up high equity valuations  Hence  they are buying bonds now  and selling the dollar  The only potential benefit to bonds would be a breaking point in these lofty stock prices and a sell off leading to higher Treasury prices 
Bond traders and  old fashioned  equity traders who still buy on a growing economy are waiting on earnings results to see  1  whether they will be strong enough to warrant record share prices and  2  to determine if the global economy is able to handle higher interest rates  The focus will be on central bank meetings in Japan and Europe this week alongside earnings reports released today by companies such as Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS  and Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  
Traders have reduced their bets regarding an additional hike this year from the July 7 high of 60 percent to the current 40 percent  based on the current effective Fed funds rate and forward overnight index swap levels 
Upcoming Events

Building permits released at 8 30 EDT are estimated to have risen from 1 168M in May to 1 200M in June  Even if estimates are met  or if permits stay under 1 228M  they will still be in a downtrend since their January 1 300M peak  If they are reached  the dollar could react positively on some or any good news  Alternatively  it ignore this modicum of good news as it has been ignoring any good news this year  instead reacting to just the bad news 



Crude Oil Inventories will be released at 10 30 EDT  Yesterday  the API unexpectedly reported a 1 628 million barrel buildup  while the EIA is expected to forecast crude oil inventories have been reduced by 3 214 million barrels  after the previous 7 564 million barrel draw  The trend over the last 15 weeks  from both the API and EIA  is down  Inventories have decreased an average of 2 88 million barrels a week according to the EIA and 2 435 million barrels a week according to the API  Technically  Monday s bearish sentiment is holding  suggesting an end to the corrective rally 



The Bank of Japan meets for an interest rate decision late tonight  which is expected to remain unchanged at a negative 0 10 percent  The bank will also release its monetary policy statement and outlook report  Technically  the USD JPY completed a H S top on July 7  but the top failed when it fell back into the pattern on July 14  Generally  price moves reverse on failures  suggesting that the yen will continue to strengthen  compounded by the ever receding Trump and Fed reflations 
The ECB meets Thursday for an interest rate decision at 7 45 EDT with a press conference at 8 30 EDT  Bloomberg Intelligence forecasts interest rates will remain at 0 00 percent  Reuters reported that unidentified officials said the bank will keep asset purchases open ended

205169,426685,QCOM,Blow Off Top  Could It Happen  ,opinion,"Every time we pick up some article on the stock market of late  all we read is the stock market is on the verge of a devastating wipeout  or that the next collapse is just around the corner  One of the best headlines we saw recently was from a famed market guru with a headline of  2017 Is Going to Be Worse than the Great Depression   It is enough to make you run home  pour a long hot bath  slit your wrists  and climb in to the tub 
Okay  maybe that is extreme  Naturally  there are many reasons writers give to back up their case  Those range from the election of Donald Trump  Brexit  rising interest rates in the US  and of course the best one that the bull market is now into its ninth year from the major low of March 2009 without a correction exceeding 20  and is in the mother of all bubbles  All of that is true  But none of that makes for a final top just because the stock market has been rising for eight years plus 
One market often compared to today is the  Roaring Twenties  market that got underway in August 1921 and topped in September 1929  That bull market lasted 97 months  Today s market has already surpassed 97 months in April 2017  We are now in the 99th month  The  Roaring Twenties  market wasn t even the longest  The 1990s  market got underway in October 1990 and lasted until January 2000 or 112 months  Who knows  Maybe we have another year to go on this one too  For the record  the one significant correction in the 1990s only lasted a month and a half  but it did shave 19 3  off the Dow Jones Industrials  DJI  
It is not unusual for bull markets to end in a blow off  These are the points in time when the market just keeps going up and nothing makes any sense  It may be a correct assessment but the shorts can go bankrupt during these periods  Blow offs always occurs at the end of the cycle and usually come after a long period of time when the market has been moving inexorably higher 
There are numerous examples in the past  The best ones are  the  Roaring Twenties  1921 1929 that really got underway in late 1926  culminating in the blow off top into September 1929  the gold market of the 1970s  1971 1980  that ended in a blow off that started in April 1979 and ended in January 1980  the Tokyo Nikkei Dow of the 1980s  1982 1990  that ended in a blow off into January 1990  the 1990s High Tech Internet market  1990 2000 and subsequent blow off known as the Dot com bubble that started in October 1999 and ended for the Dow Jones Industrials  DJI  in January 2000  and  for the NASDAQ and the S P 500 in March 2000 

The bull market of the  Roaring Twenties  was one of the greatest bull markets in stock market history  From August 1921 to the top in September 1929  the DJI gained 497   There was only one correction of significance during that period  In 1923  the DJI corrected back 18 6  and then chopped around into May 1924  After that  things really heated up  But it was the final liftoff that was most impressive  From June 1928 to the top in September 1929  the DJI gained 80   Like all blow offs and all massive bull markets it ended in tears  Over the next three years until July 1932 the DJI collapsed 89  and the US and the world was gripped in the  Great Depression  It wasn t until 1954 that the DJI finally passed the September 1929 high 
The Tokyo Nikkei Dow  TKN  was an equally spectacular bull market  The TKN bull had its start in October 1982 and over the next eight years gained 470   The October 1987 stock market crash saw the TKN shed 21   That was the only correction of significance during the entire period  From the low in November 1987 to the final top in January 1990  the TKN soared 85   As with the DJI of the  Roaring Twenties   it ended in tears  Twenty seven years later the TKN still has not regained the highs of January 1990 as it is still down 48   At its lowest in October 2008  the TKN was down 82   Since that spectacular bull market  Japan has been going through what has been termed Japan s long recession  twenty seven years of sluggish growth and or recessionary conditions  No matter what they do  they cannot seem to pull themselves out of it 

Long bull markets that end with blow offs always seem to end in tears  And none was more spectacular than the gold bull market of the 1970s  After Richard Nixon took the world off the gold standard in August 1971 setting gold to trade freely the rise seen over the next eight and half years can only be termed as spectacular  Gold rose from its fixed price of  35 troy ounce to a peak of  873 troy ounce in January 1980 a gain of 2 395   During that period the only significant correction was from November 1974 to August 1976 when gold fell roughly 50   The spectacular part of the up move got underway in April 1979 and saw gold gain over 300  in just nine months  As to the tears  well  the bear market for gold lasted until February 2001  a period of 21 years  Gold lost 70  in all during that period but the good news was it was still up over 600  from August 1971  It took until 2008 for gold to surpass its 1980 high  Today  gold remains 43  above that 1980 high and gold has been the best performing asset since 2000 despite a five plus year bear market that is still not officially over  And some still call gold a barbarous relic  But remember  unlike paper assets  stocks and bonds  gold lasts forever 

In terms of length  the 1990s High Tech Internet bull has thus far been the granddaddy of all bull markets  The bull got underway in October 1990 although some may argue that the bull really got underway following the 1987 stock market crash  The 1990 correction saw the DJI lose 21 2  barely qualifying it as a bear market  It only lasted three months and much of it was triggered by Iraq s invasion of Kuwait  However  a recession did follow so  while short and shallow it still qualifies given it exceeded a 20  drop in the markets 
The 1990s  bull lasted until January 2000 for the DJI while the NASDAQ and the S P 500 didn t top out until March 2000  Along the way was the 1998 scare triggered by the Russian default and the near collapse of Long Term Capital Management  LTCM  a hedge fund that employed  mind boggling  leverage  The LTCM collapse was so bad it almost brought down the financial system  Well almost  as the Fed stepped in and effectively bailed out the system with a massive cut in interest rates and they poured billions in liquidity into the market propping up the major financial institutions to prevent an outright collapse  That in turn steadied the stock markets and the DJI only fell 19 3  missing the 20  mark for an official bear market 
All in all the 1990s  bull saw the DJI gain 396  leaving it short of the gains of both the DJI of the  Roaring Twenties  and the Japanese market of the 1980s  But in terms of length it might not ever be seen again  Unless the current bull has even more life 
As to it ending in tears  well  the 2000 2002 High Tech Internet crash shed about 38  from the DJI but the real carnage was over at the NASDAQ  
The High Tech Internet crash of 2000 2002 left a lot in tears and a lot of companies that simply disappeared  The collapse was also known as the Dot com bubble and bust  We are sure people remember names like Pets com  Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM   Nortel Networks  WorldCom and Enron  During the bubble period  valuations and price earnings  PE  reached insane levels  Most of the companies didn t make any money  spent lavishly  and the buzzword phrase was growth over profits  The NASDAQ was where most of these companies were listed and as a result the NASDAQ soared from 323 in October 1990 to 5 132 by March 2000 a gain of 1 489   As to the tears well the NASDAQ fell 78  in the Dot com bust and as noted many companies simply disappeared 
One of the interesting aspects of the NASDAQ bubble was a steady rise punctuated by sharp ups and downs occurring from January 1999 to September 1999  It was during that period that the calling became shrill that the NASDAQ was going to crash  Except it didn t and the final bubble rise took place as the NASDAQ gained 88  from the final low in September 1999 to the March 2000 top  By May 2000 the NASDAQ had already shed just over 2 000 points with a lot more shedding to come  It wasn t until 2016 that the NASDAQ finally surpassed its 2000 top 

That brings us to today s market  The stock markets have been rising for 98 months and counting  The DJI has gained 231   which is actually not that spectacular when one compares it to the  Roaring Twenties  market  the Nikkei Dow market of the 1980s or even the 1990s  High Tech Internet bubble  The market has followed a lengthy period of up and down action from roughly May 2015 until the market broke out to new highs in November 2016 following the election  Since then the market has continued to work its way higher despite numerous negatives in the background 

We have read numerous reports about how this market is overvalued  how a crash is coming that could wipe out up to 70  of its value  how a devastating worldwide recession is about to hit  and that the market is a bubble waiting to burst  They call this bubble the  everything  bubble  It is the third bubble since 2000 following the Dot com bubble and the housing bubble  But if this one is to be a true bubble then we need to hit the point where the market is going up almost every day and everyone is talking about it and telling us how it is never going to end  We haven t hit that point  yet 
The market keeps rising  That is despite  
  the Fed hiking interest rates
  the ongoing political machinations in Washington with a President under siege and investigation
  the ongoing wars in the Mid East  a war taking a potentially more dangerous turn following the shooting down of a Syrian warplane by the US and Russia effectively saying they will impose a no fly zone over Syria
  a global economy that continues with sluggish growth
  a rise in violent clashes in the US between citizens and police and leftist and rightist groups and 
  overvaluations in the market 
The market keeps moving higher despite the numerous reasons as to why it should fail  But probably the biggest reason the market keeps moving higher is because of the immense expansion of credit over the past eight years  Debt  globally  has been growing faster than economic growth especially in China  As long as debt keeps on expanding and can be serviced markets could keep on rising  Debt collapse brought on the 2008 financial crash and history is replete with debt related collapses sparking panics  recessions  depressions  civil wars  and wars 
Is there any reason to suspect  this time it will be different   Probably not  The question is when  not if  Long bull markets have historically had a tendency not to end with a whimper but with a bang a blow off followed by a crash and tears  These are good reasons to suspect that a blow off could come sooner than we suspect It will most likely be an exciting ride  The cab driver will probably be giving you the latest stock recommendations just as they did in previous blow offs  Just don t forget to get out of the cab

205176,426692,QCOM,Billions Being Poured Into IoT  Are You Invested ,opinion,"Internet of Things  IoT  is the inter networking of physical devices  vehicles  buildings and other items embedded with electronics  software  sensors and network connectivity that enable the objects to collect and exchange data  In other words  IoT enables any physical electronic device with a valid IP address to transfer data seamlessly over a wireless network 
According to a recent report by market intelligence firm  International Data Corporation  IDC   total expenditure on hardware  software  services and connectivity to back IoT is expected to increase 16 7  year over year in 2017 all over the world  making this an  800 billion market  By 2021  IDC predicts global IoT spending to be almost  1 4 trillion 
Now let s take a look at how IoT spending will shoot up in different regions and sectors over the years 
Asia Pacific excluding Japan  APeJ  will be the IoT investment leader with spending expected to reach  455 billion in 2021  followed closely by the U S    421 billion in 2021  and Western Europe   274 billion   Manufacturing will lead in terms of IoT investments in all three regions  followed by utilities and transportation in APeJ and Western Europe  and transportation and consumer in the US  Cross Industry IoT spending will also be among the leading categories in these regions 
The regions that are likely to witness the fastest growth in IoT spending are Latin America  21 7  CAGR   the Middle East and Africa  21 6  CAGR  and Central and Eastern Europe  21 2  CAGR  
The areas zones that are expected to lure the largest investments in 2017 are manufacturing operations   105 billion   freight monitoring   50 billion  and production asset management   45 billion   Smart grid technologies for electricity  gas and water and smart building technologies are also expected to be injected with  56 billion and  40 billion investments  respectively  this year 
We believe these will remain the largest areas of IoT spending in 2021  with smart home technologies forecast to witness 19 8  CAGR over five years  Fastest spending growth will be seen by airport facilities automation  33 4  CAGR   electric vehicle charging  21 1  CAGR  and in store contextual marketing  20 2  CAGR  
Industry Specific IoT Investments
As per IDC  the industries making the largest IoT investments in 2017 are manufacturing   183 billion   transportation   85 billion  and utilities   66 billion   Cross industry IoT investments  which are common to most markets such as connected vehicles and smart buildings  will likely be  86 billion in 2017 and stand out as the top segments in the five year forecast 
Consumer IoT purchases is expected to be the fourth largest market segment in 2017 at  62 billion and move up to the third position in 2021  Meanwhile  industries that will see the fastest spending growth are insurance  20 2  CAGR   consumer  19 4   and cross industry  17 6   
Winding Up
The IoT market is the latest in the line of service and business models  and is quickly gaining market traction   Using IoT to gather data points  helps businesses run more effectively and efficiently  thereby boosting their bottom line  Moreover  IoT hardware and software being less expensive is encouraging the companies to invest heavily  We believe that this is what led to generous IoT investments in the last few months 
Research firm Gartner recently predicted that 21 billion IoT devices will be used globally by 2020  outnumbering laptops  smartphone and tablets  This is because IoT devices do not usually require a lot of computing power  Instead  IoT collects data at the edge  pooling information to drive analytic insights 
From the technology perspective  hardware  especially modules and sensors that connect end points to networks  will be the largest IoT spending category for the first few years  while the services category will come into picture in later years 
The fastest growing areas of technology spending are in the software category  where horizontal software and analytics software will witness five year CAGRs of 29 0  and 20 5   respectively  Security hardware and software will also see investments at 15 1  and 16 6  CAGRs  respectively 
U S  telecom behemoths like Verizon Communications Inc    NYSE VZ   and AT T Inc    NYSE T    and U S  national wireless carrier T Mobile US Inc    NYSE T   continue to strengthen their footprint in the IoT space by inking deals  Qualcomm Inc    NASDAQ QCOM    the leading manufacturer of wireless chipsets based on baseband technology is also well poised to benefit from the IoT boom

ZTE s efforts to collect patent royalties   months ahead of Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM O  Inc s China antitrust settlement this week  according to people with knowledge of the matter   shows how that deal has already changed the way China s booming smartphone industry does business

BEIJING  Reuters    Last summer  lawyers from Chinese telecoms gear maker ZTE Corp began writing to half a dozen local handset makers it believed used its patents  Its message was simple  it s time to pay up 
ZTE s efforts to collect patent royalties   months ahead of Qualcomm Inc s China antitrust settlement this week  according to people with knowledge of the matter   shows how that deal has already changed the way China s booming smartphone industry does business

 Wireless charging has the potential to radically improve the electric vehicle driver experience and Formula E provides the perfect platform in which to develop  test and showcase this exciting new technology   Alejandro Agag  CEO of Formula E  said 
Wireless car charging allows electric vehicles  EVs  to draw electricity into their battery packs through so called resonant magnetic induction between a ground level charging pad connected to an electric outlet and a receiver in an EV s undercarriage  While it doesn t provide much additional convenience as a private EV charging outlet  wireless car charging would be useful at designated municipal and public parking locations

205230,426746,QCOM,Qualcomm struggles to collect royalties in China  stock falls,news,"By Noel Randewich SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters    Qualcomm Inc s outlook for the September quarter was below Wall Street s expectations and its shares fell on Wednesday after the leading mobile chipmaker said it was having trouble collecting royalties in China 
A new high speed 4G network in China is driving fresh demand for smartphones with leading edge technology  but Qualcomm has also faced legal and regulatory problems there  including an ongoing investigation by the country s antitrust regulator 
Now Qualcomm is struggling to collect licensing revenue from some device makers in China  including a growing number of local manufacturers the U S  chipmaker has done little or no business with in the past 
 There was some impact in the quarter that we just reported in Q3 and we expect the impact will be larger in the next quarter and potentially for a number of quarters until we can get these things resolved   Qualcomm President Derek Aberle said in an interview 
While most of Qualcomm s revenue comes from selling chips that enable phones to communicate with carrier networks  most of its profit comes from licensing patents for its widespread CDMA cellphone technology 
Qualcomm has had royalty disputes in the past in China and the recent proliferation of local companies making low cost gadgets for Chinese consumers is complicating the picture 
 There s a lot of new guys ramping up new 4G phones and tablets over there   said Evercore analyst Mark McKechnie   They have a lot of licensees there already that are paying them  but this is going to be a pretty big challenge for the company in the coming years  
With smartphone shipments tapering off in wealthy markets like the United States  China has become a key market for Qualcomm 
The ongoing investigation by China s anti monopoly regulator could lead to fines of more than  1 billion  It concerns Qualcomm s licensing business as well as interactions between its licensing business and its chipset business  Aberle later told analysts on a conference call 
The investigation is making it harder to negotiate new 4G licenses with manufacturers in China  he said 
The chipmaker reported third quarter revenue of  6 81 billion  up 9 percent from the year ago period  It said revenue in the fourth quarter  which ends in September  would be between  6 5 billion and  7 4 billion  with a midpoint of about  6 95 billion 

Analysts on average had expected third quarter revenue of  6 52 billion and fourth quarter revenue of  7 15 billion  according to Thomson Reuters I B E S 
Third quarter net income was  2 24 billion  up 42 percent  GAAP diluted earnings per share were  1 31  Its non GAAP earnings per share were  1 44  well above the midpoint of its previous forecast of between  1 15 and  1 25 
Qualcomm shares were down 4 72 percent in extended trading after closing up 0 09 percent at  81 60 on Nasdaq

205242,426758,QCOM,UPDATE 2 S Korea fines Qualcomm  208 mln in anti trust case,news,"  Qualcomm told to end discriminatory licensing practices
   Qualcomm regrets ruling  Korea head says may appeal
   KFTC says firm abused position in CDMA phone chip market
  Updates with Qualcomm comments 
 SEOUL  July 23  Reuters    South Korea s anti trust agency
on Thursday imposed a  208 million fine on Qualcomm Inc and
ordered the U S  wireless chip and technology company to stop
discriminating against companies using competitor s products 
 The Korean Fair Trade Commission  KFTC  ruling deals a blow
to Qualcomm  which counts Korean mobile phone makers Samsung
Electronics Co Ltd and LG Electronics Inc    the world s No 2
and No 3 respectively    as its major clients 
 Qualcomm said it deeply regretted the decision and warned
that the decision could hurt the competitiveness of Korean
mobile phone makers 
  There has been no illegal activity   Qualcomm Korea head
Cha Young koo told reporters  adding that Qualcomm planned to
appeal if the final statement  to be published in the next few
months  maintained the fine 
 The KFTC  which had been investigating the case for more
than three years  said in a statement that Qualcomm abused its
dominant position in the local market for code division
multiple access  CDMA  mobile phone chips 
 Qualcomm held a 99 4 percent share of that market in 2008 
  When licensing its CDMA mobile technology  Qualcomm levied
higher royalties on companies that used modem chips supplied by
rival companies   the commission said 
 Qualcomm also provided clients with rebates for using its
own chips  it said  adding that anti competitive business
practices helped the U S  company maintain its near monopoly
for more than 10 years in South Korea 
 Qualcomm  which competes with Texas Instruments Inc and
others in the market for cellphone chips  has also been under
investigation by the European Commission in Brussels for
anti competitive behaviour 
 Qualcomm said the difference in royalties and other types
of incentives were part of marketing and based on agreements
with Korean clients 
 The fine of 260 billion won   208 million  is the largest
the KFTC has issued against a single company 
 South Korean media reports estimated Qualcomm s annual
revenue from Korean makers at 2 5 trillion to 3 trillion won 
Qualcomm said on Wednesday it expected fiscal year 2009 revenue
at  10 25 billion to  10 45 billion 
 Analysts said the regulator s ruling was unlikely to have
an immediate impact as handset makers usually have long term
contracts with Qualcomm 
 They said there was no viable alternative to Qualcomm for
companies such as Samsung and LG  who rely heavily on
Qualcomm s technology for key mobile phone standards such as
CDMA 2000 and W CDMA

205248,426764,QCOM,China s NPC Ends With New Initiatives,opinion,"The market s immediate focus is on today s FOMC meeting and Dutch elections  However  China s annual legislative session  National People s Congress  ended earlier today  and Premier Li unveiled a new initiative  Late this year  China will allow overseas funds to buy onshore bonds in Hong Kong 
Details on the mechanics  including implementation timeframe  were not immediately available  but the general thrust is consistent with other measures to boost market accessibility and encourage inflows  The State Administration of Foreign Exchange  SAFE  announced at the end of last month that foreign institutions that invest in interbank debt market could trade a range of financial products  including forwards  swaps  and options mainland counterparties 
The Shanghai and Shenzhen links to Hong Kong allow accounts in the Special Administrative Region to have access to mainland shares  Trying to convince MSCI to include mainland shares in the emerging market indices  China eased access  to the A shares   However  increasing access to the mainland bond market is also important  and arguably  increasingly so now that the yuan is part of the SDR  Both Hong Kong and China are developing a bond trading platform 
When the yuan was trending higher and capital inflows  Chinese officials liberalized outflows  Now  in a different part of the cycle  China is seeking to liberalize inflows  It is working with the market to guide it  Foreign investment in China s onshore bond market estimated around  100 bln  Some bond market indices  which are used by some asset managers as a benchmark  have recently begun including onshore bonds  According to Moody s sovereign bonds and policy  bank bonds account together for about 37  of the China s  9 5 trillion interbank bond market  The rating agency expects the inclusion of China s onshore bonds in the benchmark indices will encourage additional passive inflows 
In addition to the opening up of the onshore bonds market  China is arguably on the verge of another important step  China is often criticized by some high income countries for violations of intellectual property rights  We have argued that this is more a function of the level of development than moral shortcomings  In the 19th century  for example  a rising developing country and revisionist power  the United States often treated European intellectual property rights in a similar fashion  As China developed its own portfolio of patents and intellectual property  we anticipate China to be more respectful of others  intellectual property 
The World Intellectual Property Organization  UN  reported that China s international patent applications rose 45  last year  By the end of the decade  China can surpass the U S  and Japan to be the largest user of the international patent system  Two Chinese companies topped the 2016 league table for international patent applications  Zte  telecoms  and Huawei  electronics   The U S  Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  was in the third place  and Japan s Mitsubishi Electric was in fourth place  Asia accounted for nearly half of the international patent applications in 2016 and the U S  and Europe almost evenly divided the other half 
This weekend  while the G20 are meeting in Germany  U S  Secretary of State Tillerson is expected to meet China President Xi and Premier Li  The meeting should pave the path that will lead to the first summit between Trump and Xi in early April  As we have noted  Trump has walked back from some of the more antagonizing rhetoric  like the threat to abandon the one China policy or to cite China as a currency manipulator  While there are several Trump Administration officials and advisers that are particularly antagonistic to China  However  as we have noted  there are others who accept the general framework the global liberal world order the U S  has helped facilitate  Chinese officials  being politically savvy  are likely to encourage the latter  Although some of Trump s supporters may not like it  don t be surprised if China is not cited as a manipulator in next month s Treasury report ",2017-03-16,Marc Chandler,https://www.investing.com/analysis/china-39;s-npc-ends-with-new-initiatives-200179069,200179069

 By Chuck Mikolajczak
 NEW YORK  June 17  Reuters    U S  stock index futures
pointed to a flat to lower open on Wednesday as key data for
May tempered inflation concerns but was offset by a
disappointing earnings outlook from package delivery company
FedEx Corp 
 The May Consumer Price Index rose 0 1 percent
month over month after being flat in April  below the median
forecast of a Reuters poll of 68 economists for a 0 3 percent
increase  Excluding the more volatile food and energy prices 
the index rose in line with analyst expectation of a 0 1
percent increase 
 The recent surge in commodity prices and oil s brief run up
above  73 a barrel last week had led to investors concerns that
inflation pressures may have been seeping into the broader
economy 
  Certainly  it s  a disinflation or even a deflation
environment currently   said Tim Ghriskey  chief investment
officer of Solaris Asset Management in Bedford Hills  New
York 
  So the worries that everyone has about inflation  it s
something that may occur    it s not going to definitely occur 
and it s certainly not an imminent threat to the economy  
 Economic bellwether FedEx  slid 3 percent to  49 90 in
premarket trade after reporting fourth quarter earnings that
topped Wall Street estimates but cautioned the operating
environment for the next two quarters are expected to be
extremely difficult 
 S P 500 futures slipped 2 8 points and were slightly below
fair value  a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into
account interest rates  dividends and time to expiration on the
contract  Dow Jones industrial average futures dipped 29
points  while Nasdaq 100 futures added 0 5 points 
 The spotlight will also be on the details of the Obama
administration s financial regulatory reform package  due to be
announced later on Wednesday  President Barack Obama will
present his proposals at 12 50 p m   1650 GMT  
 Qualcomm Inc shares rose 1 9 percent to  44 27 in premarket

Securities Merill Lynch to  buy  from  underperform  
 In the past two days  the benchmark S P 500 has dropped
more than 3 percent amid concerns that the economic recovery
might prove weak and provide very little impetus for earnings
growth 
  The focus simply is with the lightness of volume  the lack
of significant trading occurring   added Ghriskey   Are there
simply no more buyers out there currently to step up and keep
the rally going  
 The S P 500  however  is still up 34 8 percent from its
12 year low of March 9  and even with Tuesday s selloff it
managed to extend its hold above the 200 day moving average

205280,426796,QCOM,Ultra Clean  Rent A Center  Facebook  Qualcomm And Whole Foods Mhighlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,"For Immediate Release

Chicago  IL   November 03  2016    highlights Ultra Clean Holdings  NASDAQ      as the Bull of the Day and Rent A Center Inc   NASDAQ     as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Facebook  NASDAQ    Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM   NASDAQ    and Whole Foods Market  NASDAQ WFM   NASDAQ     

Here is a synopsis of all the five stocks  



  

Investors tend to be weary of companies that experience the combined impacts of an abrupt departure by a key member of the management team  and a shift in the company s overall focus  But there are times when that is just what the company needed  This is the case of the Zacks Bull of the Day Ultra Clean Holdings  NASDAQ     who in July saw their CFO leave the company during a time when management began to refocus on growing their market share and new semicap opportunities 
	This Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  company is a developer and supplier of critical subsystems for the semiconductor capital equipment  flat panel  solar and medical device industries  Ultra Clean offers its customers an integrated outsourced solution for gas delivery systems and other subassemblies  improved design to delivery cycle times  component neutral design and manufacturing and component testing capabilities  Ultra Clean s customers are primarily original equipment manufacturers for the semiconductor capital equipment  flat panel  solar and medical device industries  Ultra Clean is headquartered in Menlo Park  California Recent Earnings Data
	Management announced Q3 earnings on October 26th where they easily beat both the Zacks consensus earnings and revenue estimates  Specifically  on a year over year basis  the company saw gains in Total revenues  19   Semiconductor revenues  14 6   Total revenues outside the U S   66 1   Net income  52 9   Gross margins  0 7   and Net cash increased by  3 2 million Management s Take
	According to Jim Scholhamer  President and CEO   Strong momentum led to record revenues and significant improvement on the bottom line this quarter  As a result of our strategic focus on the semiconductor capital equipment market  we are expanding our capabilities to cost effectively meet customers  dynamic needs  As the market continues its upward trajectory  our solid customer relationships and growing market position are enabling us to outpace the broader industry  

  



In the modern world  having a system outage for a single day can wreak havoc on any company  But when you combine weeks of system issues with a double digit decline in same store sales  a company s top and bottom line are bound to be negatively impacted  These are some of the issues facing our Zacks Bear of the Day  Rent A Center Inc   NASDAQ     
	This Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  company operates company owned rent to own stores which offer high quality  durable goods such as consumer electronics  appliances  furniture and accessories to consumers under flexible rental purchase arrangements that allow the customer to obtain ownership of the merchandise at the conclusion of an agreed upon rental period Recent Earnings Report
	On October 26  RCII posted Q3 earnings where they beat the Zacks consensus earnings estimate but came up short against the Zacks consensus revenue estimate  On a year over year basis the company saw declines in Diluted earnings per share  76 6   Total revenues  12 3   Core U S  revenues  16 3   Same store sales  12 0   and EBITDA fell by 370 basis points Management s Take
	According to Robert D  Davis  CEO     As previously announced  our third quarter operating results were negatively impacted by unexpected capacity related system outages following the full implementation of our new store information management system within our Core U S  stores  Consequently  I am terribly disappointed in the results for the quarter  both top and bottom line  Toward the end of the third quarter we had seen significant improvement in system availability and a reduction in the frequency of system outages  However  over the past two weeks on a couple of instances we have experienced system slowness and outages similar to but less impactful than what we saw earlier in the third quarter  Despite these recent challenges  over the past 6 weeks  past due percentages have been lower than they were a year ago

In stage 2  the FCC reduced the event clearing spectrum size to 114 MHz instead of 126 MHz fixed earlier  Consequently  the auction clearing target price has also been lowered substantially to  54 6 billion from the initial target price of  86 4 billion  The FCC has received as many as 62 applications for the second part of the Incentive Auction  All the bidders have made upfront payments 
Meanwhile  the Federal Trade Commission  FTC  recently filed an appeal in the U S  Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco  to review the previous ruling regarding a data throttling charge issued by the FTC against the U S  telecom behemoth AT T Inc    NYSE T    Data throttling basically means data traffic blocking and slowing any data traffic once customers hit certain usage thresholds in a month 
In a separate development  AT T initiated direct roaming mobile interconnection services in Cubastarting Oct 18 AT T s customers will now be able to connect through talk  text and data while in Cuba at price rates of  3 per minute on the phone  50 cents per SMS text   1 30 per MMS text and  2 05 per MB of data 
U S  telecom giant Verizon Communications Inc    NYSE VZ   plans to close seven call centers across five states that may lead to job loss of 3200 employees  The company deems the decision as a difficult but necessary one  Verizon intends to realign its real estate assets and customer service operations to make the optimum use of its call centers in other locations  Verizon currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see

Recap of the Week s Most Important Stories
1     The FCC was initially hopeful of completing the Incentive Auction by the end of the third quarter of 2016  However  industry watchers are now anticipating it to be more prolonged and it is likely to continue till early 2017  Some industry watchers have also predicted that telecom operators might need around 70 MHz to 80 MHz of spectrums in the 600 MHz bands instead of the total freed up 126 MHz airwaves  In such a scenario  the FCC might have to conduct another round of reverse auction for a reduced volume of spectrum at lower prices     read more

Leveraging on Orange s network and Ericsson s profound 5G knowledge  the collaboration is aimed at enabling 5G technology building blocks  proof of concepts  and commence pilot programs in Europe from 2017  The use cases and services will include wireless multi gigabits internet access in remote areas  development of a robust  Internet of Things  infrastructure  huge mobile coverage solutions and making connected cars 
Ericsson and Orange will also work on other critical areas  such as Software Defined Network  SDN   Network Function Virtualization  NFV  and development of technology  These are needed to upgrade existing 4G networks to 5G  Orange believes that this partnership will empower its customers to achieve greater data speed and access specialized services  thus boosting their satisfaction 
Paving Way for the 5G Commercialization
Industry players expect 5G standards to be finalized at the earliest  in 2019  with commercial deployments to roll out after 2020  In order to take advantage of this  Ericsson continues to aggressively drive progress in 5G technology and currently has 5G network trials scheduled with 24 operators  In addition  it is working on 5G projects and future use cases  with 12 industry partners and about 20 research institutes and universities 
Ericsson has already signed significant 5G agreements with telecom biggies  like Vodafone Group  LON VOD    NASDAQ VOD     Telefonica  MC TEF  and Qualcomm Inc    NASDAQ QCOM    to bank upon the commercialization of 5G technology  Meanwhile  the mobility report of the company  released last year  signals bright prospects for 5G network with strong demand from key end markets  including U S   China  South Korea and Japan  We believe that strategic partnerships  dominant market share and favorable industry trends will help the company benefit significantly from the impending commercialization of the networks 
Macroeconomic Headwinds Hurting Prospects
Reduced consumer telecom spending  including the delayed spectrum auction have been playing a spoilsport for Ericsson  The company s mobile broadband sales continue to take a beating from the soft macroeconomic environment and weakness in countries like Brazil  Russia and the Middle East  Moreover  the company has been facing investment headwinds in network developments in the Mediterranean  Northern Europe and Central Asia  especially Russia  regions as well as in Latin America and the Middle East ERICSSON LM ADR Price
 

   Additionally  given that the company derives a major portion of its revenues in various foreign currencies  it is prone to negative impacts from currency fluctuation  During second quarter 2016  weakening currencies across some of the major Latin America markets and floating of the Nigerian currency were major dampeners for the company  Further  stiff competition from peers  prolonged weakness in key end markets and ongoing industry consolidation among customers   major rivals are adding to this Zacks Rank  4  Sell  company s woes 
InterDigital  Inc    NASDAQ IDCC   develops and markets advanced digital wireless telecommunications systems using proprietary technologies for voice and data communications  The Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  company has an excellent earnings surprise history over the trailing four quarters  beating estimates all through with a robust average positive surprise of 82 43   You can see

The announcement of 7 October heralds the news that the capacity of the new production line will be five times the initial estimate at the start of this year at a capex cost that is only around one third higher ie  30 32m  Our current forecasts  now under review   made before the announcement of these plans to increase capacity to 5bn units  assume that THIN will achieve demand for c 2 8bn OS and ST units by 2020  but will only expand production capacity to 2 4bn units using licensing deals to satisfy additional demand from that time on  We understand that the company intends to continue with its  asset light  strategy of using licensing partners to take over production in the longer term  Nevertheless  we foresee this substantial increase in planned capacity and the resulting economies of scale as enabling a lower price higher volume strategy over the next two to three years  which should enable the quicker transition of pilot trials into volume orders  It should also give Thinfilm greater flexibility in choosing licensing partners

205323,426839,QCOM,M A Is A Sign Of Economic Health,opinion,"Last year was a record year for M A  but going unnoticed in 2016 is the plethora of mergers that have taken place across many sectors  Whether it is airlines  media  semiconductors or chemicals   this year has been one of the biggest on record in size and scope  Yet  one wonders why so many mergers are happening with the stock market at near all time highs just about the entire year  The worst of course occurred during the first six weeks of the year and it has been up ever since 
We have seen companies bought out at record premium  and often for straight cash  In the  old days   we would often raise an eyebrow when a company used their stock as acquisition currency  This is not at all happening today  Further  international companies have an eye for US companies too  this trend far from over  So  if the market is supposedly  expensive  on several metrics  why so much buying and possibly overpaying for acquisitions 
We can simply look at the US economy and see there is some daylight ahead  Further  we can see the market is often excited about companies teaming up  with both companies rising  a rarity  on news of a deal  Oh  we can talk endlessly about how 2  growth is the  new normal   but the fact is firms are lean  hold tons of cash  which is a great attraction  and are often targets for diversification  Earlier this year we saw some of the biggest acquisitions made for this very reason with Dreamworks  Alaska Air Group Inc  NYSE ALK   Medivation Inc  NASDAQ MDVN   LinkedIn  NYSE LNKD  and St Jude Medical Inc  NYSE STJ  
Just last week we heard Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  come out and say they were interested in paying a big premium for NXP Semiconductor  and both stocks soared on the potential news 
We have seen our fair share of busted mergers  including Allergan Pfizer and Halliburton Baker Hughes along with possibly Monsanto Company  NYSE MON  Bayer AG NA  DE BAYGN   regulatory issues   Yet  given the insatiable appetite for companies to grow and find value we could certainly see this trend continue into the end of the year as we perhaps break new records  and quite possibly kick start 2017 with a bang ",2016-10-02,Bob Lang,https://www.investing.com/analysis/m-a-is-a-sign-of-economic-health-200156583,200156583
205356,426872,QCOM,Semiconductors Are Ruling The Market  Here s How To Benefit,opinion,"The semiconductor industry is killing it right now  And if you ve been paying attention to what s happening in the broad tech market  you may be wondering why 
Indeed  just about everything with a screen is full of these tiny metalloids  Yet the PC and smartphone industries aren t doing so hot right now  They re struggling to maintain sales growth   and competition is only getting more intense 
So how are some semiconductor ETFs beating the S P by more than 15  
Two reasons   
VR and the Cloud  New Technologies  Same Old Semiconductors
First  you should know that sluggish PC sales and growth in semiconductor demand are actually related 
Lots of consumers are choosing to run  services on cheaper devices  That cuts into the demand for high end computers  But it s actually a boon for semiconductors   because they re being used in corporate infrastructure  i e   server farms that make  the cloud  possible  
Another source of fuel for the rally is  
Right now  VR is the hottest thing in tech research and development  Industry pioneers like HTC and Oculus Innovative Sciences Inc  NASDAQ OCLS  are awash in media buzz  And their VR headsets depend on advanced graphics cards   which use lots of semiconductors 
How to Profit From the Semiconductor Industry
There are a variety of ways you could cash in on this silicon surge  More scrupulous investors may be interested in individual company stocks  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing  NYSE TSM  and Qualcomm Incorporated  NASDAQ QCOM  are major players in the semiconductor market  And they re both up 25  this year 

There are plenty of ETFs  too   The benefit of an ETF is that it provides more diversification and  along with it  lower risk than individual stocks  
Two big names are iShares PHLX Semiconductor  NASDAQ SOXX  and VanEck Vectors Semiconductor  NYSE SMH   Again  both have made impressive gains this year 

This rally is no fluke  Semiconductors are in everything  And demand shouldn t wane anytime soon  Whether you re a techie or a tech novice  your portfolio should have some exposure to the companies behind today s biggest innovations ",2016-09-01,Investment U,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-the-semiconductor-industry-is-crushing-the-market...-and-how-to-inve-200151214,200151214

205388,426904,QCOM,QUALCOMM Stock Explodes On Strong Earnings,opinion,"Qualcomm Incorporated  NASDAQ QCOM 
QUALCOMM is having an incredible time in after hours trading today  and for good reason  The company released its earnings report for the third quarter  blowing away expectations  Today  we ll talk about what we saw from earnings  how the stock is reacting to the news  and what we can expect to see from QCOM moving forward  So  let s get right to it 
QCOM Reports Impressive Q3 Results
As mentioned above  QUALCOMM is having an incredible run in after hours trading today after announcing results for the third quarter  Not only did the company beat expectations with regard to earnings  it blew away revenue expectations  Here s what we saw from the report 
Earnings Per Share   When it comes to earnings per share  QCOM did incredibly well  During the third quarter  analysts expected that the company would generate earnings in the amount of  0 97 per share  However  the company reported earnings for the quarter in the amount of  1 16 per share  blowing away analyst expectations 
Revenue   QCOM didn t just impress investors with regard to earnings  revenue came in above expectations as well  During the quarter  analysts expected that the company would generate  5 8 billion in revenue  However  the company actually reported revenue in the amount of  6 billion  This represents a 4  year over year gain 
Guidance   QUALCOMM also offered compelling guidance  The company said that for the current quarter it expects to generate between  5 4 and  6 2 billion in revenue  This should leave earnings per share for the quarter between  1 05 and  1 08  This comes in on the high end of analyst expectations  For the current quarter  analysts are expecting that the company will generate  1 08 per share in earnings on  5 7 billion in revenue 
Following the release of the incredibly strong earnings report  QCOM CEO  Steve Mollenkopf had this to say in a statement 

 We are executing well on our strategic priorities  and we remain confident that our focused investments in 5G and other advanced technologies will create a strong foundation for long term earnings growth  

How The Stock Is Reacting To The News
As investors  one of the first things that we learn is that the news moves the market  When positive news is released with regard to a publicly traded company  we tend to see gains in the value of the stock associated with the news  In this particular case  the news surrounding QCOM was overwhelmingly positive  As a result  we re seeing a strong reaction in the market  In early after hours trading  the stock is up  3 78 per share or 6 77  for a total price of  59 60 per share 
What We Can Expect To See Moving Forward
Moving forward  I have an overwhelmingly bullish opinion of what we can expect to see from QUALCOMM  The reality is that the company has a proven history of creating great products and coming up with incredible sales plans  With heavy efforts on 5G  I m excited to see what is coming in the long run  However  there s also good news in the short run  With the company performing so well under incredible market pressures  investor sentiment is likely to remain bullish  As a result  I m expecting to see gains in QCOM in both the short and long run ",2016-07-21,Modest Money,https://www.investing.com/analysis/qualcomm-(qcom)-stock-explodes-on-strong-earnings-200143145,200143145

205399,426915,QCOM,Qualcomm Trades For The Holder  Speculator And Opportunist,opinion,"Qualcomm s  NASDAQ QCOM  stock went through a long downtrend before embarking on a bottoming consolidation in December  The stock lifted higher in February but then spent 3 months at the long term support resistance zone before pushing above it in May  Since then  it has moved around that range without being able to produce any meaningful separation 
Higher Range
What the stock has done  though  is remain over its 200 day SMA since May  QCOM tested it twice and reversed higher both times  perhaps creating a mini double bottom  And these two bottoms were higher lows  At least a higher range  if not an uptrend is emerging 
Momentum has held bullish for Qualcomm since the February low  The RSI has pulled back to the 40 level a few times but held and reversed  The MACD has crossed down and reset but never dropped to a negative level and without a quick reversal  Both were heading higher into earnings Wednesday evening  In total  the chart was neutral to bullish into earnings 
The options activity shows an expected price move of about  2 50 this week  or 4 5   That s slightly more than the  3 9  average move over the last 6 reports  Open interest shows the Put side strong from 52 to 55 this week  The Call side is sizeable from 55 to 57 5  but the open interest at the 55 Call is more than 2x larger than any other 

Holder
For a holder of the stock you have several options into earnings  Do nothing and don t worry about your long term position  sell the stock or protect it against a short term move  For protection  an options collar is the right trade  With the  2 50 expected move  a July 22 Expiry 55 52 5 Put Spread can protect your stock against a pullback  Buying the July 22 Expiry 55 Put and selling the 52 5 Put would pay you  2 50 on Friday if the stock falls to  52 50  This spread costs about 80 cents though  So to complete the collar  look to sell a covered call  Selling the August 57 5 Call gives a 56 cent credit  lowering your cost for protection to just 24 cents 
Speculator
For the speculator there are several options as well that offer high reward to risk ratios 

Trade Idea 1  Buy the July 22 Expiry 54 55 Call Spread and sell the 52 5 Put for 25 cents 
Trade Idea 2  Buy the July 22 Expiry 55 53 5 52 Put Butterfly for 30 cents 
Trade Idea 3  Sell the July 22 Expiry 52 5 57 5 Strangle for a  0 70 credit 
Trade Idea 4  Sell the July 22 Expiry 55 Straddle for a  2 50 credit 

 1 gives the upside short term with leverage and may put you in the stock at 52 5 Friday   2 gives the downside looking for the yellow range to be a sticky area   3 takes a 1 25  credit to risk that the options implied range holds  It is profitable between 51 8 and 58 2 at expiry   4 looks looks for the large open interest at 55 to hold the stock this week  It is profitable from 52 5 to 57 5 
Opportunist
For the opportunist looking for an entry at a better level  options can help as well  One trade I like for these situations is a 1 2 Put Spread  This is buying a higher strike Put and then selling 2 lower strike Puts  For Qualcomm  a July 22 55 53 5 1 2 Put Spread gives downside participation from the 55 53 5 Put Spread until the price hits 53 5  Below 53 5 the extra short Put may be exercised against you  putting you the stock  but with a basis of 52  This 1 2 Put Spread requires margin but gives a small credit  so there is no capital outlay  If the stock moves higher  you just keep the credit ",2016-07-20,Gregory W.

205430,426946,QCOM,FCC Opens Up High Frequency Radio Spectrum For 5G Network,opinion,"In a landmark voting  the U S  telecom regulator Federal Communications Commission  FCC  yesterday unanimously decided to make available high frequency radio spectrums  above 24 GHz  for the use of the upcoming fifth generation  5G  wireless network  With this  the U S  becomes the first country in the world to identify and open up a significant amount of spectrum suitable for the ultra fast 5G mobile standard 
The FCC will try to free up high band spectrum   technically known as the centimeter  cmWave  and millimeter wave  mmWave  bands   which are one of the building blocks of the 5G wireless standard  The regulatory body has voted to open up a total of nearly 11GHz of spectrum  Of the total  3 85GHz will be licensed spectrum and the remaining 7GHz will be unlicensed bandwidth to be used for mobile and fixed wireless 5G network 
U S  telecom giants Verizon Communications Inc    NYSE VZ   and AT T Inc    NYSE T   together with major chipset developers Qualcomm Inc    NASDAQ QCOM   and Intel Corp    NYSE T   have welcomed the FCC s decision  According to the research firm ABI Research  5G network deployment is expected to ramp up after 2020 and its market size may reach  247 billion worldwide by 2025 
Several industry researchers hold that 5G network will provide a download speed of 1 Gbps  gigabit per second  which is 200 times the throughput of the currently available standard 4G LTE network  Latency period of data delivery will be in single milliseconds  Further  5G technology is designed to be more power efficient than any other standard wireless networks available these days  Naturally  5G enabled mobile devices are likely to last much longer than their 3G or 4G counterparts 
Additionally  superfast 5G mobile networks will be of utmost importance in managing the exponential growth of Internet connected devices  popularly known as Internet of Things  IoT  and autonomous vehicles  to be controlled in the cloud   According to a report by research firm International Data Corp   IDC   worldwide spending on IoT is slated to grow at a 17  compound annual growth rate  CAGR  to nearly  1 3 trillion in 2019 from  698 6 billion in 2015 ",2016-07-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/fcc-opens-up-high-frequency-radio-spectrum-for-5g-network-200142195,200142195

205443,426959,QCOM,Top Trade Ideas For The Week June 20  2016  QCOM,opinion,"Here is your Bonus Idea with links to the full Top Ten 
Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM   peaked in mid 2014 at just under  82  From that point it trended lower  slow and steady to a bottom in February under  43  It was nearly cut in half  The chart below shows the price action over the last 12 months and there are some interesting features 
The price area between 52 50 and 53 50 has proven to be very significant for this stock over the last year  First it acted as support from August through September of 2015  Then from March 2016 through to May it acted as resistance  The break over the range in late May was short lived as it pulled back  It retested the range and held last week  rounding up and peeking over the top on Friday 
Momentum started to turn higher Friday as well  The RSI bounced off of the bottom of the bullish range  The MACD has yet to turn  but is slowing its descent as it approaches zero  The price stopped falling and started the bounce last week as it touched the lower Bollinger Band   and now the Bollinger Bands are getting tight  This is often the precursor to a big move 
There is resistance above at 55 and 56 50  with a gap to fill to 60 and then 61 and 65  Support lower comes at 52 50 and 50  Short interest is low at 1 5  and the stock is expected to report earnings next July 20th 
The June 24 Expiry options chain shows biggest open interest at the 54 Strike on the Call side with smaller open interest from 54 5 to 56 5  The Puts at this Expiry are biggest at 52 5 but spread from 51 to 53 5  There is no real edge this week  The July monthly options favor the Call side  The biggest open interest is at the 52 5 and 55 Strikes with some size at 57 5 also  The Put side is smaller but biggest at 52 5  This suggests a range from 52 5 to 55 as most likely 
The July 22 Expiry  the first after the earnings report  shows smaller size but the biggest open interest at 55 on both side  Finally  the August monthly Expiry favors the upside with large open interest at 57 5  dwarfing the size at any other strike on both sides by a factor of 10 
Qualcomm  Ticker  QCOM
Trade Idea 1  Buy the stock now  over 53 50  with a stop at 52 50 
Trade Idea 2  Buy the stock now 9over 53 50  and add a July 22 Expiry 53 50 50 Put Spread   1 17  and also sell a August 57 5 Call  60 cent credit  
Trade Idea 3  Buy the July monthly 53 5 Calls  about  1 25  
Trade Idea 4  Buy the July monthly 53 5 55 Call Spread  70 cents  and sell the July monthly 52 5 Put  79 cents  for a free Call Spread Risk Reversal 
Trade Idea 5  Buy the August 52 5 July 55 Call Diagonal   2 30  
Trade 1 is a straight stock buy while Trade 2 adds a collar for protection through the earnings event through the range projected by the options  Trade 3 offers a defined risk method to participate in a run up to earnings  Trade 4 looks for that run up with a capped and levered trade  Trade 5 looks longer term with open interest in July to hold it below 55 but open interest in August to draw it to 57 50 
After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed Friday which saw following the June FOMC meeting and Options Expiration  the market got a shock to the downside  but not deep  Now it can look forward to the Brexit vote and then summer 
Elsewhere look for Gold to consolidate with an upward bias while Crude Oil moves higher after a digestive pullback  The US Dollar Index looks to consolidate sideways at the bottom of the range while US Treasuries are biased higher  The Shanghai Composite and Emerging Markets are running in place with the Chinese market biased to lean lower and Emerging Markets higher 
Volatility looks to remain near the top of the lower range keeping the bias lower for the equity index ETF s SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   iShares Russell 2000  NYSE IWM  and PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ   mildly  Their charts suggest intermediate term consolidation with a short term downward bias for the SPY and QQQ  but the IWM looking a bit stronger  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

205444,426960,QCOM,FCC To Vote On Spectrum Rules For 5G Network On July 14,opinion,"The U S  is likely to become the first country in the world to identify and open up a significant amount of spectrum suitable for the upcoming fifth generation  5G  wireless network which will provide ultra fast data transfer speed 
Federal Communications Commission  FCC   the U S  telecom regulator  will vote on new rules to lay the groundwork for 5G network  proposed by the FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler  The vote is scheduled to take place on Jul 14  2016 
According to the research firm ABI Research  5G network deployment is expected to ramp up after 2020 and its market size may reach  247 billion worldwide by 2025  North America  Asia Pacific  and Western Europe will be the three regions that will pioneer 5G network deployment 
The FCC will try to free up high band spectrum   technically known as the centimeter  cmWave  and millimeter wave  mmWave  bands   which are one of the building blocks of the 5G wireless standard 
Several industry researchers hold that 5G network will provide a download speed of 1 Gbps  gigabit per second  which is 200 times the throughput of the currently available standard 4G LTE network  Latency period of data delivery will be in single milliseconds  Further  5G technology is designed to be more power efficient than any other standard wireless networks available these days  Naturally  5G enabled mobile devices are likely to last much longer than their 3G or 4G counterparts 
Additionally  superfast 5G mobile networks will be of utmost necessity in managing the exponential growth of Internet connected devices  popularly known as Internet of Things  IoT  and autonomous vehicles  to be controlled in the cloud   According to a report by research firm International Data Corporation  IDC   worldwide spending on IoT is slated to grow at a 17  compound annual growth rate  CAGR  to nearly  1 3 trillion in 2019 from  698 6 billion in 2015 
The U S  telecom behemoth Verizon Communications Inc    NYSE VZ   will start field trials for its upcoming 5G wireless network with its partners in 2016  The company is preparing for initial deployment of the next generation 5G wireless networks in the U S  in 2017  In Feb 2016  another U S  telecom giant AT T Inc    NYSE T   requested the FCC to grant a license to test 5G technologies on 3 5GHz  4GHz  15GHz and 28GHz frequency bands 
On Mar 2016  T Mobile US Inc    NYSE T   sought the FCC s approval for a millimeter wave radio test license using the company s 28 GHz and 39 GHz frequency bands to conduct test run of 5G wireless standards  Qualcomm Inc    NASDAQ QCOM    the largest manufacturer of wireless baseband chip set globally  is working hard to develop chipsets for the 5G mobile standard 
The U S  telecom industry has lately emerged as an intensely contested space where success thrives largely on technical superiority  quality of services and scalability  Thus  in order to stay ahead of the competition  existing players need to be constantly on their toes to introduce innovative products 
A full fledged 5G network deployment will not start until 2020  T Mobile US and AT T too are targeting the same time frame to get their 5G network ready for commercial deployment  However  Verizon is so far leading the race in this regard ",2016-06-21,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/fcc-to-vote-on-spectrum-rules-for-5g-network-on-july-14-200137362,200137362

205465,426981,QCOM,Qualcomm Inc  Resistance Breakout,opinion,Qualcomm Incorporated  NASDAQ QCOM   after nearly three months of consolidation in the 49 75 53 4 area stock finally broke out on Friday and took out its critical level of  53 04  200 day EMA   The break of this key resistance line confirms a short term trend reversal and the beginning of new momentum  which could move the stock above the  56 area  Daily technical indicators are looking bullish  The daily MACD is rising above its signal line in positive territory and the RSI is above its 50  level  This momentum could push this stock much higher from here  so keep it on the radar next week ,2016-05-23,António Costa,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/qualcomm,-inc.(nasdaq:qcom)---resistance-breakout-200131432",200131432
205474,426990,QCOM,Qualcomm Revenue Is Set For A Boost,opinion,"Qualcomm Incorporated  O QCOM  is caught in the midst of some unfavorable news in the last one year period  That has resulted in the stock taking a loss of more than 30   As a result  the stock potentially has become a mispriced one  Despite unfavorable sentiments  its quarterly numbers topped expectations convincingly  The company has also been roping in fresh clients to fill the void created by the exit of a few  While the industry associated weakness might be seen  there is also a way to buck the trend or outperform the industry to reap better gains  Unfortunately  the market s focus has been mostly on negative sentiments and failed to look at the favorable factors  but that can potentially provide better opportunity 
Tactical Review Is A Good Thing
Recently QUALCOMM s board  as well as management  conducted a review of its structure  It was decided that the existing structure would be able to make it easy to provide incentive to growth  The ultimate objective is to add more value to its shareholders  According to its plan  there would be a value addition of approximately  1 40 billion by slashing spending apart from the alignment of the Directors  compensation  which will be in line with the performance of the company  The execution of this strategy will undoubtedly enhance the efficiency level of the company  particularly in costs  Therefore  any additional value coming in  be it savings or otherwise  will optimize the wealth of the shareholders 
One of the negative factors that affected QUALCOMM was the purported poor performance of its Snapdragon 810  The product had a very negative perception in the market with issues with overheating  However  it was a fact that the chip still won a place in the majority of smartphone designs  Still  the company has advanced to the Snapdragon 820  which appears to be doing better in the market  During a recent conference call  management claimed that the chip has already won more than 100 designs  Though it would not have any impact immediately  i e  in the first quarter of the current calendar year  its material impact can be seen from the second quarter  That meant more revenues are likely to be seen from Snapdragon 820 
Asian Market Is Key
China is the biggest contributor to QUALCOMM  Aside from that  there are also emerging markets such as India  The company indicated its intention of investing in Indian startups by pushing  150 million into it  The objective is to gain from the Asia Pacific market  Also  the growth of smartphone is rapid in India though dominated by cheap models  However  that is also a favorable factor since the replacement cycle will be much quicker than the branded expensive one which will have extended life than the cheaper variety  Researchers have already indicated that India would be one among the top four nations with higher smartphone penetration levels in the coming years 
There were  at least  two reports that give prominence to the Asian markets  which would give QUALCOMM enough room to gain  For instance  Cisco Systems  O CSCO  has released a report on the mobile users trends  which will be a significant factor to fuel revenue growth  The network switch maker said that future mobile data traffic would witness a compound annual growth pace of 4 3  until the year 2019  Most important from the research was that a big part of it will come from the mobile users of Asia Pacific region  Another factor was that usage of mobile data on a per month basis would record a CAGR of 51  until it touches 2 8 GB a month during the same period  That meant replacement of chips to manage the speed would contribute to additional revenue growth  The highest growth will be experienced by Central  as well as  Eastern Europe  and the Middle East and Africa  Latin America and Asia Pacific will follow suit 
Similarly  Ericsson  O ERIC  published a report on mobility indicating that subscription growth would be 5  CAGR between the years 2014 and 2020  This should favor QUALCOMM s quest for additional revenue  Its contention was that growth in LTE subscriptions would be the driving force  The company s report also suggested that mobile data traffic at the global level would record 45  CAGR in the same period  The key factor is that China would continue its dominance in the LTE subscriptions to reach 1 1 billion by the end of the year 2020  This is one area can count upon to add revenue 
LTE Growth
One of the areas that QUALCOMM will be looking to gain is LTE market  The company depends on this market for considerable part of incremental revenue  China will be the major market for LTE subscriptions  where the company generates half of its total revenue  In 2014  LTE shipments witnessed 33 9  growth while it is predicted to witness 46 2  growth in the current calendar year  The LTE shipments are estimated to grow 45 2  next year  This will change the valuation of the company  In fact  it was for this reason that most of the analysts have a price target of above  60 
Conclusion
Most of the recent losses were due to exaggerated fears like the one time fine slapped by China regulator and economic weakness in China  The stock lost about 34  last year and that itself provides an opportunity to buy  One of the favorable factors for the company was its dependence on Asia and incidentally that is where most of the growth will come in the next few years  Therefore  if QUALCOMM could not gain  then it would be tough for others to manage without the significant presence in the Asian market  Whatever concerns expressed by a section was at an exaggerated level  Therefore  one can keep faith in the stock  Its price to earnings ratio is cheaper than the industry and the S P 500 ",2016-02-03,InvestCorrectly,https://www.investing.com/analysis/qualcomm-revenue-is-set-for-a-boost-383101,383101

	As per a report from the research firm iGR  U S  telecom operators will spend around  104 billion during 2015 25 to upgrade their existing 4G networks to 5G standards and thereafter  execute full installation of 5G wireless services  Consequently  telecom infrastructure developers will have enormous opportunity for growth 
	U S  telecom behemoth Verizon Communications Inc  NYSE VZ      is currently conducting field trials for its upcoming 5G wireless network with its partners  The company is looking at mobile hotspot and fixed wireless for initial deployment of the next generation 5G wireless networks in the U S  in 2017  In Feb 2016  another U S  telecom giant AT T Inc  NYSE T      requested the Federal Communications Commission  FCC  to grant a license to test 5G technologies  In Mar 2016  T Mobile US Inc     sought the FCC s approval for a millimeter wave radio test license to conduct test run of 5G wireless standards  Leading mobile chipset manufacturer Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  Inc     is working hard to develop chipsets for the 5G mobile standard Mobile Video Business Gaining Traction
	Internet TV is gradually gaining a strong foothold in the U S  The legacy pay TV industry in the country has been facing severe competition from online video streaming service providers  The low cost over the top video streaming service has resulted in massive cord cutting that is currently threatening the pay TV business model 
	Internet TV has emerged as a strong alternative to counter this competitive threat  At present  the web based digital media market is growing rapidly  The digital media brands are gradually gaining significant market traction especially among the young generation  With demand for smartphones and tablets on the rise  target customers are increasingly watching videos online  preferring them over costlier legacy pay TV connections New Growth Driver  Online Digital Advertisement
	Advertisement on the mobile video platform is gradually shifting from simple selling of banner ads on the mobile web to automated or programmatic ad selling  Pay TV operators are gradually adopting the data driven advertising technique that is already popular in the web based advertisement arena  To derive maximum synergies from the combined video content and video distribution platform  these companies are extensively penetrating into the advertising technology market 
	Inclusion of dynamic ad insertion  targeted audience advertising and data driven TV advertisements are steps toward the same objective  According to market research company eMarketer  the global mobile ad market value is expected to reach    133 7 billion by 2017 Key Attributes for 2016
	 1  The telecommunications industry is essentially characterized by high barriers to entry  The deployment of network infrastructure requires significant capital expenditure  which very few entities can afford  Furthermore  it is not easy for a new telecom carrier to establish itself in the market as it requires government approval to transmit voice  data  and video  Such barriers protect the profits of incumbents   

	 2  A major characteristic of the telecommunications industry is that it is immune to international geo political disturbances even when they lead to economic fluctuations  This is because the need to remain connected springs from our earliest instincts to communicate with fellow human beings  Volatility in the global economy due to a slowdown in China and its currency devaluation  along with the sovereign debt crisis in Europe and political disturbances in the Middle East has had little impact on the sector 
	 3  Wireless network strength is the key to future growth of the overall telecom industry  As wireless networks run on radio frequency  spectrums  airwaves  have naturally become the most sought after asset in the industry  Spectrum auctions conducted by the FCC from time to time will significantly boost network capacity 
	 4  Telecom companies offer one of the highest dividend yields in the U S  economy  The dividend yield  measured as dividends paid by a company in the last 12 months relative to its share price  is currently around 5  for the telecom sector compared with a mere 2   approximately  for the benchmark S P 500 index  Unlike other industries  U S  telecom operators generate their revenues predominantly in the country  This makes these stocks less susceptible to volatility in the foreign exchange rate as well as macro economic fluctuations plaguing the rest of the world  We believe the strong dividend yield momentum will continue as the U S  economy slowly returns to stability 
	 5  Mergers and acquisitions  M A  are not uncommon in the U S  telecom industry  despite strict regulations implemented by the FCC to put a check on monopolistic practices  Telecom and pay TV operators often join forces to provide better and attractive bundled products to their customers  In order to stay abreast of competition  existing players need to be constantly on their toes to introduce innovative products or merge with other companies  In the near future  the U S  telecom industry is slated to witness further mergers and acquisitions and product diversifications Major Upcoming Developments
	 1  The FCC has started the auction of 600 MHz low band spectrums on Mar 29  2016  The 600 MHz airwaves auction  popularly known as  Incentive Auction  is crucial for wireless operators as the signals can be transmitted over longer distances and through brick and mortar walls in cities  These airwaves will be freed by TV broadcasters who have no productive use for the same  The FCC had concluded an Advanced Wireless Servies 3  AWS 3  spectrum auction in Jan 2015  accumulating a record breaking  44 89 billion 
	 2  The court verdict on the FCC proposed net neutrality rules is expected in 2016  In Dec 2015  a federal appeals court in Washington D C  took up the lawsuit related to the net neutrality norms  On Feb 26  2015  in a historic decision  the FCC had approved net neutrality rules after a majority voting  The new laws classify high speed broadband  Internet  as a public utility under Title II of the 1934 Communications Act instead of section 706 of the 1996 Telecom Act  By way of this  the FCC is poised to gain stronger control over the Internet Service Providers  ISPs   Leading ISPs and several other sector participants have strongly opposed the FCC s decision Zacks Industry Rank

Qualcomm  a world leader in 3G and 4G wireless technology  is scheduled to report fiscal first quarter 2016 earnings January 27  after the markets close  Without knowing it  most consumers own a product which uses Qualcomm wireless technology  whether it s a tablet  smartphone or even a car  This past year was not particularly favorable for the chip maker which saw share prices plunge over 30   Qualcomm fell victim to a  1 billion antitrust fine  losing a key customers and currency headwinds from a strong U S  dollar which are expected to take its toll on the company s fiscal first quarter earnings  The Estimize consensus calls for EPS of  0 92 and revenue of  5 699 billion  right in line with Wall Street s estimates  Compared to FQ1 2015  this represents a projected YoY decline in EPS and revenue of 30  and 19   respectively  With the worst presumably behind Qualcomm  negative sentiment continues to weigh down investor s expectations despite the chip maker beating estimates 7 of the last 8 quarters  
Typically  the first fiscal quarter is peak season for Qualcomm  however with a declining semiconductor market muddled with its own controversy  Qualcomm should expect to report modest increases  Despite its recent blunders  Qualcomm s lead in wireless chip design and revenue generated from patent licensing should help the company bounce back in 2016  After abandoning a key partner  Samsung  OTC SSNLF  has decided to resurrect their relationship with Qualcomm and incorporate the chip in its newest Galaxy device  Qualcomm has also claimed a stake in emerging markets  specifically in China  The company intends to design and sell chips in order to compete with Intel s dominant market position  While mobile chips are Qualcomm s bread and butter  the chipmaker is looking to diversify into automotives  Internet of Things  IoT   networking and computing  As the mobile markets mature and become saturated  these adjacent markets can help drive revenue growth  While the stock tapered downwards during 2015  Qualcomm has the pieces in place to rebound in 2016 ",2016-01-26,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-watch:-can-qualcomm-spark-growth-381761,381761
205486,427002,QCOM,Markets Seek A Bottom As China Bursts The Global Asset Bubble,opinion,"Traders made a sharp U turn as the PBoC cut the RRR and the lending rate to curb the sell off in Chinese stock markets  Chinese stocks were better bid in Asia but gains remained contained as the margin requirements were increased on stock index futures in addition to restrictions to daily open positions and higher transaction fees 
The idea is to avoid short term volatilities and overheating in leveraged trades to improve financial stability  Everybody could see the excessive inflation in Shanghai s stocks since September last year  yet enhancing gains were too sweet to step out pre maturely  The new restrictions have kept the Chinese stocks safe from speculative in and outs  Shanghai s Composite lost another 1 27  and closed the session below the 3000 mark  As we certainly approach the bottom of this historical sell off   that has kicked off in June and wiped out more than 40  off the all time highs   the recovery is expected to happen in a calmer fashion

205498,427014,QCOM,Wireless Tech Giant On The Cheap,opinion,"Last week  I wrote about John Chambers  the CEO of Cisco Systems  NASDAQ CSCO   and his desire to be at the forefront of the so called  
Indeed  the coming wave of internet connected devices will change the world as we know it  while minting many fortunes along the way 
For investors  that means we need to find the companies that are best positioned to capitalize on this massive trend   and it doesn t hurt if they re paying a reasonable dividend in the meantime  either 
Lucky for us  Cisco isn t the only well positioned tech giant that s trading at a discount right now 
In fact  a second large cap technology company is looking like a solid  Buy    Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  Incorporated 
Qualcomm is an American global semiconductor company that designs and markets wireless telecommunications products and services  The company is the world s leading patent holder in advanced 3G mobile technologies 
Like Cisco  Qualcomm sports a massive market cap of over  100 billion  so it s not exactly a hidden gem  Yet even though the company is a household name  many don t realize that it s been rapidly increasing its dividend in recent years  In fact  the company s five year dividend growth is a whopping 147  
Currently  QCOM pays a  0 42 quarterly dividend  good for a yield of 2 34   That s higher than the S P 500  as well as the average for S P 500 technology companies  What s more  the company has consistently raised its dividend every four quarters   which means its next announcement  which will likely come in April  should include a dividend hike 
A Favorable Settlement
Of course  in our search for income opportunities  we want to keep our focus on cheap dividend growers  Fortunately  Qualcomm is also trading at a discount right now 
Check out the chart below  which compares Qualcomm to other S P 500 technology companies 

As you can see  Qualcomm is trading at a significant discount across the board   plus it has a higher dividend yield than its peers 
What s more  Qualcomm is trading at a discount to its 10 year average for all of these metrics  as well  as demonstrated in the chart below 

Now  there s one big reason why share prices are depressed at the moment  Qualcomm was facing an antitrust suit in China for allegedly overcharging customers for licensing agreements 
With news that the company could face a fine of  1 billion or more   plus the potential that China could limit Qualcomm s licensing business in the future   it s not surprising that investors were feeling uneasy 
Luckily  it seems that the cost of even the worst case scenario has been priced into Qualcomm s shares  which are down about 4  in the last 12 months and down about 9  since their high on July 23  2014 
Better yet  the case was just settled on February 9  and Qualcomm got off relatively easy  The company will pay  750 million to the Chinese government  which is less than the anticipated fine   and it must also forfeit a portion of royalty revenue on its 3G and 4G devices  More importantly  it won t face any sanctions that would limit its ability to grow revenue going forward 
A Sunny Outlook for Qualcomm
Ultimately  Qualcomm seems well positioned for the future 
For now  it s a cash flow giant  with  7 2 billion in free cash flow in the last 12 months  In that same period  QCOM paid  2 7 billion in dividends   which leaves plenty of room for stock buybacks or a dividend hike 
And going forward  Qualcomm is set to take advantage of the Internet of Things 
In the latest earnings report  CEO Steve Mollenkopf noted that the company has a  broad set of products and equipment  with Qualcomm solutions inside that will be used in smart homes  smart cities  mobile healthcare  and wearables 
As the trend of internet ready devices continues to grow  Qualcomm should be riding high  In the meantime  investors can buy shares at a discount and enjoy the rapidly growing dividend

205506,427022,QCOM,Qualcomm FY 4Q14 Earnings Call Notes  3G 4G Device Demand Grows,opinion,"QUALCOMM Incorporated  NASDAQ QCOM  
3G 4G device demand continues to grow  particularly in emerging markets
 We believe that global demand for 3G 4G devices continues to grow at a very healthy pace  particularly in the emerging regions at mid and low price tiers  The broad availability of compelling devices at these price tiers is driving demand for  and the migration to  3G 4G devices  
Global device shipments will hit 1 5 b in 2015
 Look forward to calendar year 2015  we estimate global 3G 4G device shipments to be approximately 1 5 billion units  up approximately 15  year over year  Turning to 3G 4G device ASPs  the ASP of devices reported to QTL during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 was  223 at the midpoint and  225 at the midpoint for the full fiscal 2014  
2015 guidance reflects 
Our fiscal 2015 guidance reflects the following  continued healthy growth of global 3G 4G devices  particularly in emerging regions  at the mid and low tiers  which impact the financial outlook for both QTL and QCT  continued QTL challenges in China  coupled with increased spending on compliance and enforcement efforts by QTL  prioritize QTC R D investments to maintain our leadership and balance our long term competitive roadmap with scale efficiencies to succeed across all price tiers  particularly the rapidly growing lower cost segments in emerging regions  a reduction and refocusing of our spend outside of QTC and QTL to a smaller number of potentially larger opportunities  focused efforts on our expanded set of adjacent growth opportunities 
Expect ASPs to fall
 We forecast that the global 3G 4G ASP will further decline by approximately 9  to 10  in fiscal 2015  Although we forecasted a modest year over year decline in the global 3G 4G device ASP at the outset of fiscal 2014  the global 3G 4G device ASP decreased more than we expected in fiscal 2014  driven by accelerated migration from GSM and TD SCDMA devices to low and midpriced 3G 4G smartphones in emerging regions  
ASPs should stabilize after 2015
 Beyond fiscal 2015  we expect further declines in the 3G 4G global ASP to moderate as the weighted impact of the factors that are driving the near term declines in ASP ease  and users in emerging regions trade up as they replace their low tier devices

205512,427028,QCOM,Qualcomm Expected To Benefit Further From The Smartphone Boom,opinion,"QUALCOMM Incorporated  NASDAQ QCOM  is set to report FQ2 2014 earnings after the market closes on Wednesday  April 23rd  QUALCOMM is an American global semiconductor company that produces and designs products and services for telecommunications devices including high end smart phones  Smartphones have been booming lately and QCOM stock is up 10  since the start of 2014 alone  which is especially impressive considering the broad sell off in tech stocks that the market has seen  This quarter the market has sky high expectations for QUALCOMM to live up to  Here s what investors are expecting from QUALCOMM on Wednesday 


The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for QUALCOMM to report  1 22 EPS and   6 496B revenue while the current Estimize com consensus from 40 Buy Side and Independent contributing analysts is  1 25 EPS and  6 575B in revenue  This quarter the buy side as represented by the Estimize com community is expecting QUALCOMM to beat the Wall Street consensus on both EPS and revenue by a considerable margin 
Over the previous 6 quarters the consensus from Estimize com has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting QUALCOMM s EPS and revenue 3 and 4 times respectively  By tapping into a wider range of contributors including hedge fund analysts  asset managers  independent research shops  students  and non professional investors Estimize has created a data set that is more accurate than Wall Street up to 69 5  of the time  but more importantly it does a better job of representing the market s actual expectations  It has been confirmed by Deutsche Bank Quant  Research and an independent academic study from Rice University that stock prices tend to react with a more strongly associated degree to the expectation benchmark from Estimize than from the Wall Street consensus 
The magnitude of the difference between the Wall Street and Estimize consensus numbers often identifies opportunities to take advantage of expectations that may not have been priced into the market  In this case we are seeing an average differential between the two groups  expectations 

The distribution of estimates published by analysts on the Estimize com platform range from  1 19 to  1 35 EPS and from  6 397B to  6 851B in revenues  This quarter we re seeing an average sized distribution of estimates on QUALCOMM 
The size of the distribution of estimates relative to previous quarters often signals whether or not the market is confident that it has priced in the expected earnings already  A wider distribution of estimates signaling less agreement in the market  which could mean greater volatility post earnings 

Over the past 4 months the Wall Street EPS forecast fell from  1 28 to  1 22 while the Estimize consensus fell from  1 28 to  1 25  Meanwhile the Wall Street revenue consensus plummeted from  6 751B to  6 496B while the Estimize consensus gradually declined from  6 696B to  6 575B  Timeliness is correlated with accuracy and downward analyst revisions going into an earnings report are often a bearish indicator 

The analyst with the highest estimate confidence rating this quarter is princebhojwani who projects  1 25 EPS and  6 550B in revenue  princebhojwani is ranked 45th overall among over 4 150 contributing analysts  Over the past 2 years princebhojwani has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting EPS and revenue 58  and 50  of the time respectively throughout 173 estimates  Estimate confidence ratings are calculated through algorithms developed by deep quantitative research which looks at correlations between analyst track records and tendencies as they relate to future accuracy  In this case princebhojwani is expecting QUALCOMM to report in line with the Estimize community on EPS but come up slightly short of the community s expectations on revenue 
This quarter the Estimize community expects QUALCOMM to beat the Wall Street expectations by 3c per share in EPS and  79 million in revenue  QUALCOMM stock has been red hot and this quarter and the bar has been set high for the semiconductor company to live up to ",2014-04-23,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/qualcomm-expected-to-benefit-further-from-the-smartphone-boom-210377,210377

as low as it has been since 1999 A further indication of valuation can be seen by examining a company s current P S ratio relative to its historical P S ratio  The current P S ratio for Qualcomm Inc is 5 06 which is historically low  Looking to the FutureExtensive research has provided a preponderance of conclusive evidence that future long term returns are a function of two critical determinants

confirm a breakdown through its critical 200 day SMA around 138  The 200 day provided support back in June after a false breakdown then  so let s see if the cavalry comes to save the day again as SPY continues to slide along the bottom of the bearish falling channel that started in mid October  It still might turn out to be a bull flag  continuation  pattern  Oscillators like RSI  MACD  and Slow Stochastic are all oversold and in a position where they could easily turn back up If price rallies from here  it faces some daunting resistance at 140  the 100  and 50 day SMAs  and the top of the falling channel  as well as prior resistance at 143  Investors definitely need a new hero to get sentiment to turn around The CBOE Market Volatility Index  VIX   a k a   fear gauge   closed Tuesday at 16 65  which is below the important 20 level  and still quite low in its historical range  theoretically reflecting a lack of investor fear Latest rankings  The table ranks each of the ten U S  industrial sector iShares  ETFs  by Sabrient s proprietary Outlook Score  which employs a forward looking  fundamentals based  quantitative algorithm to create a bottom up composite profile of the constituent stocks within the ETF  In addition  the table also shows Sabrient s proprietary Bull Score and Bear Score for each ETF High Bull score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended recently toward relative outperformance during particularly strong market periods  while a high Bear score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended to hold up relatively well during particularly weak market periods  Bull and Bear are backward looking indicators of recent sentiment trend As a group  these three scores can be quite helpful for positioning a portfolio for a given set of anticipated market conditions Observations 1  Healthcare  IYH  returns to the top spot with an Outlook score of 78  and there is now a three way tie for second place with a score of 68  shared by Technology  IYW   Financial  IYF   and Consumer Goods  IYK    Tech gets the honor of being in the top two before rounding the scores   Stocks within IYH continue to get decent support from Wall Street analysts raising earnings estimates  and they have strong return on sales  Technology  IYW  has stabilized a bit  even though the analysts continue to downgrade earnings expectations  Stocks with IYW still show some of the best long term growth rates and return ratios 2  Telecom  IYZ  stays in the cellar with an Outlook score of 25  but the new one in last place is Basic Materials  IYM   scoring 22  Wall Street continues to hammer away at future earnings expectations  and in fact the long term earnings growth rate is second worst to staid Utilities  IDU  3  Overall  I would continue to characterize the Outlook rankings as neutral  with the more aggressive and defensive sectors mixed about in the rankings  The range from the top to the bottom Outlook scores remains historically small at only 55  and there are three diverse sectors tied for second place  All of this indicates uncertainty about economic growth 4  Looking at the Bull scores  Materials  IYM  is the clear leader on strong market days  scoring 61  Telecom  IYZ  is now the weakest on strong market days  scoring 42  In other words  Materials stocks have tended to perform the best when the market is rallying  while Telecom stocks have lagged 5  Looking at the Bear scores  Utilities  IDU  is the clear investor safe haven on weak market days  scoring 60  which remains far ahead of second place Healthcare  IYH  at 51  Materials  IYM  is the weakest during market weakness  as reflected in its low Bear score of 40  followed by Technology  IYW  and Energy  IYE  at 41  In other words  Materials stocks have been selling off the most lately when the market is pulling back  while Utilities stocks have held up the best 6  Overall  Healthcare  IYH  now shows the best all weather combination of Outlook Bull Bear scores  Adding up the three scores gives a total of 182  Telecom  IYZ  is by far the worst at 116  As for Bull Bear combination  Financial  IYF  and IYH share the best at 105  while Technology  IYW  and Telecom  IYZ  share the worst at 91 These scores represent the view that the Healthcare and Technology sectors may be relatively undervalued overall  while Telecom and Materials sectors may be relatively overvalued based on our 1 3 month forward look Top ranked stocks within IYH and IYW include Regeneron Pharmaceuticals  REGN   MEDNAX Inc  MD   SolarWinds  SWI   and QUALCOMM Inc  QCOM  Disclosure  Author has no positions in stocks or ETFs mentioned About SectorCast  Rankings are based on Sabrient s SectorCast model  which builds a composite profile of each equity ETF based on bottom up aggregate scoring of the constituent stocks  The Outlook Score employs a fundamentals based multi factor approach considering forward valuation  earnings growth prospects  Wall Street analysts  consensus revisions  accounting practices  and various return ratios  It has tested to be highly predictive for identifying the best  most undervalued  and worst  most overvalued  sectors  with a 1 3 month forward look Bull Score and Bear Score are based on the price behavior of the underlying stocks on particularly strong and weak days during the prior 40 market days  They reflect investor sentiment toward the stocks  on a relative basis  as either aggressive plays or safe havens  So  a high Bull score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended recently toward relative outperformance during particularly strong market periods  while a high Bear score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended to hold up relatively well during particularly weak market periods Thus  ETFs with high Bull scores generally perform better when the market is hot  ETFs with high Bear scores generally perform better when the market is weak  and ETFs with high Outlook scores generally perform well over time in various market conditions Of course  each ETF has a unique set of constituent stocks  so the sectors represented will score differently depending upon which set of ETFs is used  For Sector Detector  I use ten iShares ETFs representing the major U S  business sectors About Trading Strategies  There are various ways to trade these rankings  First  you might run a sector rotation strategy in which you buy long the top 2 4 ETFs from SectorCast ETF  rebalancing either on a fixed schedule  e g   monthly or quarterly  or when the rankings change significantly  Another alternative is to enhance a position in the SPDR Trust exchange traded fund  SPY  depending upon your market bias  If you are bullish on the broad market  you can go long the SPY and enhance it with additional long positions in the top ranked sector ETFs  Conversely  if you are bearish and short  or buy puts on  the SPY  you could also consider shorting the two lowest ranked sector ETFs to enhance your short bias However  if you prefer not to bet on market direction  you could try a market neutral  long short trade that is  go long  or buy call options on  the top ranked ETFs and short  or buy put options on  the lowest ranked ETFs  And here s a more aggressive strategy to consider  You might trade some of the highest and lowest ranked stocks from within those top and bottom ranked ETFs ,2012-11-14,Scott Martindale,https://www.investing.com/analysis/sector-detector:-post-election-edition-143490,143490
