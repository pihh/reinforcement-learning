115676,337191,HSIC,FTC gets mixed ruling from administrative judge in dental supply fight,news,"WASHINGTON  Reuters    An administrative law judge at the Federal Trade Commission has ruled that Benco Dental Supply Co and  Patterson Companies Inc   O PDCO  violated antitrust law by refusing to compete for the business of buying groups but dismissed a complaint against a third company   Henry Schein  Inc  O HSIC   the agency said on Wednesday 
The FTC had accused the three companies  the three largest U S  full service distributors of supplies ranging from chairs to cement to gloves  of violating antitrust law in February 2018 
Judge Michael Chappell said in a decision dated Tuesday that  complaint Counsel  FTC  has shown that there was an agreement between Benco and Patterson to refuse to offer discounted prices or otherwise negotiate with buying groups  As held below  that agreement unreasonably restrained trade in the full service dental distribution market in the United States  
Henry Schein Chief Executive Stanley Bergman welcomed the judge s decision to sever them from the case  saying   Henry Schein has always been committed to doing business in an ethical manner wherever we operate  
Patterson said in a statement that it strongly disagreed with the judge s decision and was considering an appeal to the full commission 
  We  believe the facts demonstrate the company s independent decision making in a highly competitive industry   the statement said 
Benco did not immediately respond to a request for comment ",2019-10-16,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/ftc-gets-mixed-ruling-from-administrative-judge-in-dental-supply-fight-1997435,1997435
115689,337204,HSIC,Henry Schein  HSIC  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Henry Schein  NASDAQ HSIC  reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on November 5  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This health care products maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 86 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  16 5  
Revenues are expected to be  2 52 billion  down 23 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Henry Schein 
For Henry Schein  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 87  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Henry Schein will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Henry Schein would post earnings of  0 83 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 84  delivering a surprise of  1 20  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

115720,337235,HSIC,Should Value Investors Pick Henry Schein  HSIC  Stock Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Henry Schein  Inc    NASDAQ HSIC   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Henry Schein has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 16 18  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 17 85  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Henry Schein s current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 24 07 over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months  However  the current level stands below the highs for the stock  suggesting that it can be a solid entry point  However  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Medical Market sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 20 59  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Henry Schein has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 17 72  so it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near future P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Henry Schein has a P S ratio of about 0 68  This is much lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 15 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Henry Schein currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Henry Schein a solid choice for value investors For example  P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 11 08  which is marginally better than the industry average of 11 54  Clearly  HSIC is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Henry Schein might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and Momentum Score of B  This gives HSIC a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at the best  The current year has seen two upward and two downward revisions in the past sixty days  while the full year 2020 estimate has seen also seen two upward and two downward revisions in the same time period As a result  the current year consensus estimate rose 0 29  in the past two months  whereas the full year 2020 estimate declined 0 53   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Henry Schein  Inc  Price and Consensus   Owing to the bearish estimate trends  the stock carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which is why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineHenry Schein is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a Zacks Rank  3 it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the broader industry has underperformed the market at large  as you can see below  So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick It s Illegal in 42 States  But Investors Will Make Billions

The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
HSIC currently has a forward P E ratio of 20 65  while WST has a forward P E of 43 19  We also note that HSIC has a PEG ratio of 2 50  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  WST currently has a PEG ratio of 3 77 
Another notable valuation metric for HSIC is its P B ratio of 3 11  The P B ratio pits a stock s market value against its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  WST has a P B of 6 67 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to HSIC s Value grade of B and WST s Value grade of D 
HSIC stands above WST thanks to its solid earnings outlook  and based on these valuation figures  we also feel that HSIC is the superior value option right now ",2019-07-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/hsic-vs-wst-which-stock-should-value-investors-buy-now-200440294,200440294

115749,337264,HSIC,Why Henry Schein  HSIC  Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering Henry Schein  NASDAQ HSIC   which belongs to the Zacks Medical   Dental Supplies industry 
This health care products maker has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 3 08  
For the most recent quarter  Henry Schein was expected to post earnings of  0 76 per share  but it reported  0 80 per share instead  representing a surprise of 5 26   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  1 11 per share  while it actually produced  1 12 per share  a surprise of 0 90  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Henry Schein  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Henry Schein has an Earnings ESP of  2 41  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-07-18,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-henry-schein-hsic-could-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200441979,200441979
115750,337265,HSIC,Henry Schein  HSIC  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  Can The Stock Move Higher ,opinion,"Henry Schein  NASDAQ HSIC  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on August 6  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This health care products maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 83 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  20 2  
Revenues are expected to be  2 48 billion  down 25 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 21  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Henry Schein 
For Henry Schein  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  2 41  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination indicates that Henry Schein will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Henry Schein would post earnings of  0 76 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 80  delivering a surprise of  5 26  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Henry Schein appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/henry-schein-hsic-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-can-the-stock-move-higher-200447165,200447165

as well Henry Schein  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise   Notably  the company earlier stated that in March  it participated at the International Dental Show in Germany  The international dental equipment internal sales in local currency declined during the first quarter largely due to this event as dentists in Germany and the surrounding countries restrained themselves from equipment purchases until after attending the show  This typically leads to a possible rebound in sales in the second quarter Evidently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for second quarter North American dental revenues is pegged at  1 01 billion  suggesting a 9 2  rise from the sequentially reported figure  The consensus estimate for second quarter international Dental revenues stands at  711 million  implying 14 1  growth from the prior year reported number Strong Technology and Value Added Services Business  Henry Schein is steadily progressing with the array of product launches within this business  The company s second quarter performance is expected to benefit from the contribution of its joint venture  JV  with Internet Brands on dental technology that resulted in the formation of Henry Schein One  In recent times  Henry Schein One rolled out several key platform updates for patient engagement  patient financing and clinical decision support solutions  The unveiling of OmniCore  an all in one network infrastructure solution  is also projected to aid the company s top line in the quarter under review Further  all major imaging vendors have now  signed agreementswith the company s Dentrix Smart image integration solution  This apart  the company s cloud based dental practice management system  Dentrix Ascend  is deepening its focus on improving the practice and patient experience with

consistently working to boost its Medical segment  We expect to see another quarter of a strong organic uptick from the existing customer base and new patient traffic  The recent acquisition of North

115778,337293,HSIC,Analysts Estimate Henry Schein  HSIC  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"Henry Schein  NASDAQ HSIC  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on May 7  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This health care products maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 76 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  20  
Revenues are expected to be  2 34 billion  down 27 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Henry Schein 
For Henry Schein  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Henry Schein will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Henry Schein would post earnings of  1 11 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 12  delivering a surprise of  0 90  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Henry Schein doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-henry-schein-hsic-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200412989,200412989

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 5 26   A quarter ago  it was expected that this health care products maker would post earnings of  1 11 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 12  delivering a surprise of 0 90  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
Henry Schein  which belongs to the Zacks Medical   Dental Supplies industry  posted revenues of  2 36 billion for the quarter ended March 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 34   This compares to year ago revenues of  3 22 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Henry Schein shares have lost about 19 4  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 17  
What s Next for Henry Schein 
While Henry Schein has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Henry Schein was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  0 84 on  2 45 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  3 43 on  9 90 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Medical   Dental Supplies is currently in the top 37  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2019-05-07,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/henry-schein-hsic-q1-earnings-and-revenues-beat-estimates-200417946,200417946

115783,337298,HSIC,HSIC Vs  MMSI  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors interested in Medical   Dental Supplies stocks are likely familiar with Henry Schein  NASDAQ HSIC  and Merit Medical  MMSI   But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks  Let s take a closer look 
Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities  but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits 
Currently  both Henry Schein and Merit Medical are holding a Zacks Rank of   2  Buy   This means that both companies have witnessed positive earnings estimate revisions  so investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook  But this is only part of the picture for value investors 
Value investors are also interested in a number of tried and true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics  including the tried and true P E ratio  the P S ratio  earnings yield  and cash flow per share  as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use 
HSIC currently has a forward P E ratio of 20 68  while MMSI has a forward P E of 29 37  We also note that HSIC has a PEG ratio of 2 50  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  MMSI currently has a PEG ratio of 2 53 
Another notable valuation metric for HSIC is its P B ratio of 3 12  The P B ratio pits a stock s market value against its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  MMSI has a P B of 3 46 
These metrics  and several others  help HSIC earn a Value grade of B  while MMSI has been given a Value grade of C

Bottom Line

An aging population has also been a significant contributor  Higher incidence of calcium deficiency in older people leads to teeth loss  According to the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial research  more than 24  of adults aged above 74 years have lost all teeth  People on medication for chronic and metabolic disorders also reach an edentulous state

115809,337324,HSIC,Henry Schein  HSIC  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Henry Schein  NASDAQ HSIC  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 20  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This health care products maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 11 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  14 4  
Revenues are expected to be  3 47 billion  up 4 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 88  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Henry Schein 
For Henry Schein  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Henry Schein will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Henry Schein would post earnings of  1 01 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 03  delivering a surprise of  1 98  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Henry Schein doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-02-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/henry-schein-hsic-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200387510,200387510

115811,337326,HSIC,Moving Average Crossover Alert  Henry Schein,opinion,"Henry Schein  Inc    NASDAQ HSIC   could be a stock to avoid from a technical perspective  as the firm is seeing unfavorable trends on the moving average crossover front  Recently  the 50 Day Moving Average for HSIC broke out below the 200 Day Simple Moving Average  suggesting short term bearishness 
This has already started to take place  as the stock has moved lower by 21 8  in the past four weeks  And with the recent moving average crossover  investors have to think that more unfavorable trading is ahead for HSIC stock 
If that wasn t enough  HSIC isn t looking too great from an earnings estimate revision perspective either  It appears as though many analysts have been reducing their earnings expectations for the stock lately  which is usually not a good sign of things to come 
Consider that in the last 30 days  8 estimates have been reduced  while none has moved higher  Add this in to a similar move lower in the consensus estimate  and there is plenty of reason to be bearish here 
That is why we currently have a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  on this stock and are looking for it to underperform in the weeks ahead  So  either avoid this stock or consider jumping ship until the estimates and technical factors turn around for HSIC  You can see

Value investors are also interested in a number of tried and true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels

115843,337358,HSIC,Top Research Reports For Walmart  Comcast   ConocoPhillips ,opinion,"Tuesday  January 15  2018
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Walmart  NYSE WMT   Comcast  NASDAQ CMCSA  and ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Walmart s shares have performed nearly in line with the Zacks Supermarkets industry over the past six months   8 4  vs   8 1    due to its focus on strengthening e commerce and store operations  These factors helped the company retain its sturdy comps trend in third quarter fiscal 2019  wherein top and bottom lines improved year over year and the latter marked its third consecutive beat  
Notably  U S  comps rose for the 17th straight time  Further  e commerce sales surged  courtesy of strong Walmart com and online grocery performances  These factors encouraged management to raise view  The Zacks analyst likes Walmart s efforts to improve its International unit by shifting focus to profitable countries  
However  the company s investment in Flipkart is expected to dent the bottom line  Such investment costs and a compelling pricing strategy have been hurting Walmart s gross margin for a while  Nevertheless  the Flipkart deal bodes well for the long term and should help the company stand firm against Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  
 You can   
Shares of Comcast have outperformed the Zacks Cable Television industry over the past year  losing  14 5  vs   18 3   The Zacks analyst thinks Comcast is benefiting from solid growth in residential high speed Internet customers  
Advertising revenues are also expected to grow due to higher spending on political advertising  Comcast s strategy to market broadband only packages to customers is likely to drive top line growth  Further  expanding Wi Fi coverage along with innovative xFi control features is improving customer experience  
Moreover  the company s Xfinity Mobile is now used by more than one million customers  Further  the Sky acquisition expands Comcast s international reach  Sky s content portfolio strength is a major growth driver  
Additionally  NBCUniversal s upcoming streaming service is a key catalyst  However  the company continues to lose voice and video subscribers due to cord cutting and stiff competition  Additionally  high debt level is a headwind 
 You can   
ConocoPhillips  shares are up  11 5  over the past year  outperforming the Zacks U S  Integrated Oil industry  which has lost  9 2  over the same period  In terms of production and proved reserves  ConocoPhillips is the largest oil and gas exploration and production  E P  player in the world  
Notably  there are significant opportunities for the upstream energy player in the Eagle Ford where it owns about 3 400 undrilled locations  The Zacks analyst thinks strong focus on two other prospective resources like Delaware basin and Bakken shale is likely to help ConocoPhillips achieve its target of more than 25  CAGR of production through 2017 to 2019 
However  rising production and operating costs are hurting the company s bottom line  Since a majority of ConocoPhillips  production comprises oil  the weak crude pricing scenario could hurt the company s operations

115869,337384,HSIC,What s In The Offing For Thermo Fisher  TMO  In Q1 Earnings ,opinion,Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc    NYSE TMO   is slated to report first quarter 2018 results before the market opens on Apr 25  Last quarter  the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4 89   Moreover  Thermo Fisher has surpassed estimates in all the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 3 08  Let s see  how things are shaping up for this announcement Key CatalystsThermo Fisher has been going strong across its analytical instrument businesses with increasing global demand  Particularly  the company s acquisition of FEI has been largely contributing to its analytical instruments portfolio over the past year  The buyout has enabled Thermo Fisher to access FEI s industry leading high performance electron microscopy platform used for protein study as well as facilitating life science research  This is also a vital highlight of the quarter to be reported Thermo Fisher anticipates realizing total synergies of approximately  80 million by the end of three years following the deal s closure with about  55 million of cost synergies and roughly   25 million of adjusted operating income benefits from revenue related synergies Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    Following the completion of the deal  the company has launched a host of products and expanded its Thermo Scientific Helios G4 DualBeam platform within the scope of material science applications  This should also get reflected in first quarter 2018 performance Apart from FEI related development  another notable unveiling in the company s Analytical Instruments business is its new line of Thermo Scientific air quality monitors called the iQ Series  This platform includes mobile applications for remote monitoring and control as well as wireless connectivity and enhanced services  This in turn is likely to contribute to the company s top line in the yet to be reported quarter Overall  the Waltham MA based company is gearing up for yet another quarter of strong analytical instruments segmental growth  In the period to be reported  Thermo Fisher expects to see a positive impact from the electron microscopy business as well as a robust volume expansion plus productivity The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Analytical Instruments revenues is pegged at  1 138 billion  higher than the year ago figure of  1 05 billion Here are other factors that might influence Thermo Fisher s first quarter results The company s focus to boost growth through implementation of strategies and consolidating its product offerings is encouraging  These initiatives are likely to help it post impressive results in the first quarter The company had spent  900 million on research and development in 2017 and the same trend is continuing through 2018  We expect all innovations and product introductions to substantially drive the company s top line in the first quarter itself The company s aim to expand capabilities in the fast growing Asia Pacific zone as well as the emerging markets should also leads to solid results  Recent standout contributors are China  India and South Korea  With strategic investments to support key customer applications  Thermo Fisher forecasts to maintain a bullish momentum for 2018 Moreover  growth is estimated in applied markets such as environmental and food safeties apart from life science  In addition  the company is betting on some key areas under focus with enormous opportunities at its disposal including advancing precision medicines from mass spectrometry to the targeted gene sequencing and structural biology  However  we are apprehensive about Thermo Fisher facing a foreign exchange headwind on 2018 revenues and adjusted EPS  Also  a hostile macroeconomic condition continues to weigh heavily on the stock  Plus  stiff competition consistently poses challenges to the stock s value Here s What the Quantitative Model Predicts Per the proven Zacks model  a company with a favorable Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  has good chances of beating estimates if it also has a positive  Thermo Fisher has a Zacks Rank  3  which increases the predictive power of ESP and an Earnings ESP of  1 29   which leaves surprise prediction inconclusive  This is because a company needs positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise  Thus this combination does not suggest that the stock is likely to beat on earnings this quarter We caution against the Sell rated stocks   4 or 5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few medical stocks worth

115870,337385,HSIC,Can S E T  Aid Zimmer  ZBH  Q1 Earnings Despite Supply Woes ,opinion,Zimmer Biomet Holdings  Inc    NYSE ZBH   is set to report first quarter 2018 results on Apr 26  before the markets open Last quarter  the company posted earnings in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  However  Zimmer Biomet missed the consensus mark in two of the preceding four quarters  the average being 0 29    Let s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement Key CatalystsThe company is expected to report strong topline numbers within its S E T   Surgical  Sports Medicine  Foot and Ankle  Extremities and Trauma  arm in the to be reported period  Last quarter  revenues at S E T  were driven by solid quarterly sales of the company s surgical portfolio  Also  within upper extremities business  the company saw solid demand for a comprehensive shoulder line In this regard  we note that since last November  the company has received several FDA clearances within S E T  and is particularly  excited about the approval of the Sidus Stem Free Shoulder system  We expect all these developments to significantly contribute to the company s top line in the first quarter itself Zimmer Biomet Holdings  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    On the flip side  the company s business within S E T has been in the recent past  massively ailed by supply issues and a continued pricing pressure The Zacks Consensus Estimate of  435 million for S E T  revenues reflects a decline of 4 2  from the last quarter We are also upbeat about the Spine  Craniomaxillofacial and Thoracic  Spine   CMF  segment  which is expected to deliver another quarter of promising performance  Under the spine category  Zimmer Biomet should continue to gain from a strong uptake of Mobi C Cervical Disc  Also  we are looking forward to top line contributions from the company s recent launch of products like the Avenue T TLIF Cage and Vitality   and Vital Spinal Fixation Systems in the United States However  we are apprehensive about the ongoing revenue dissynergies related to the company s U S  spine sales force integration  Although Zimmer Biomet is working to resolve the impact of these dissynergies  chances of any near term resolution are bleak The Zacks Consensus Estimate of  186 million for Spine revenues indicates a 4 1  decrease from the year ago quarter Overall  first quarter revenues are projected at  2 03 billion  up 0 9  sequentially Other factors likely to influence Zimmer Biomet s first quarter results are Looking at the focused execution of Zimmer Biomet s sales teams  we expect the global adoption rate of the flagship personalized knee system   Persona   to be impressive  We are also enthusiastic about the launch of the Persona Partial Knee System last September  The knee system marked the latest addition to the company s portfolio of personalized and anatomically designed knee implant systems The Zacks Consensus Estimate of  700 million for Knee revenues registers a 4 2  reduction from the last quarter Within Hip business  we expect the company to once again demonstrate a sturdy performance in the Asia Pacific region  Notably  in the previous quarter  the company registered double digit sales growth within Hip in the aforementioned geography  The company is anticipated to produce improved quarterly sales from Taperloc G7 and Arcos systems  However  like all other segments  supply constraints should continue to limit Zimmer Biomet s ability to meet demand of these high growth brands The Zacks Consensus Estimate of  478 million for Knee revenues represents a 4 2  dip from the last quarter Emerging markets have always been a significant revenue generating source for Zimmer Biomet  Despite the recent economic downturn in Latin America  the company managed to drive growth through its operations in the other emerging markets  especially the Asia Pacific and EMEA  Europe  the Middle East and Africa  zones  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first quarter revenues from EMEA of  477 million denotes an improvement of 0 8  from the last quarter However  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of  300 million from APAC in the quarter to be reported translates into a 6 5  fall from the last quarter  We believe  macroeconomic uncertainties and unfavorable currency fluctuations have been denting the company s sales for over the past few quarters  The company has also been burdened with pricing woes As a result  Zimmer Biomet struggled with a negative pricing pressure of approximately 2 5  in 2017  In absence of any favorable changes on these lines  these headwinds might be mirrored in the company s first quarter results Here s what our quantitative model predicts Per the proven Zacks model  a company with a favorable Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  has good chances of beating estimates if it also has a positive  Zimmer Biomet has a Zacks Rank  4  which lowers the predictive power of ESP and an Earnings ESP of  0 57   We caution against the Sell rated stocks  4 or 5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions  Therefore  the combination does not

115872,337387,HSIC,Should First Trust NASDAQ 100 Equal Weighted Index Fund  QQEW  Be On Your Investing Radar ,opinion,"The First Trust NASDAQ 100 Equal Weighted Index Fund  QQEW  was launched on 04 19 2006  and is a passively managed exchange traded fund designed to offer broad exposure to the Large Cap Growth segment of the US equity market 
The fund is sponsored by First Trust Advisors  It has amassed assets over  547 47 M  making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Growth segment of the US equity market 
Why Large Cap Growth
Companies that find themselves in the large cap category typically have a market capitalization above  10 billion  Considered a more stable option  large cap companies boast more predictable cash flows and are less volatile than their mid and small cap counterparts 
Qualities of growth stocks include faster growth rates compared to the broader market  as well as higher valuations and higher than average sales and earnings growth rates  Something to keep in mind is the higher level of volatility that is affiliated with growth stocks  They are likely to outperform value stocks in strong bull markets but over the longer term  value stocks have delivered better returns than growth stocks in almost all markets 
Costs
When considering an ETF s total return  expense ratios are an important factor  and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts in the long term if all other factors remain equal 
Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0 60   putting it on par with most peer products in the space 
It has a 12 month trailing dividend yield of 0 45  
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
While ETFs offer diversified exposure  which minimizes single stock risk  a deep look into a fund s holdings is a valuable exercise  And  most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis 
This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector  about 42  of the portfolio  Consumer Discretionary and Healthcare round out the top three 
Looking at individual holdings  Shire Plc  LON SHP   adr   SHPG  accounts for about 1 24  of total assets  followed by Ulta Beauty  Inc   ULTA  and Henry Schein  Inc   NASDAQ HSIC  
The top 10 holdings account for about 11 49  of total assets under management 
Performance and Risk
QQEW seeks to match the performance of the NASDAQ 100 Equal Weighted Index before fees and expenses  The NASDAQ 100 Equal Weighted Index is the equal weighted version of the NASDAQ 100 Index which includes 100 of the largest non financial securities listed on NASDAQ based on market capitalization 
The ETF has added roughly 3 91  so far this year and was up about 15 99  in the last one year  as of 05 18 2018   In the past 52 week period  it has traded between  52 79 and  63 23 
The ETF has a beta of 1 14 and standard deviation of 15 67  for the trailing three year period  making it a medium risk choice in the space  With about 103 holdings  it effectively diversifies company specific risk 
Alternatives
First Trust NASDAQ 100 Equal Weighted Index Fund carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3  Hold   which is based on expected asset class return  expense ratio  and momentum  among other factors  Thus  QQEW is a good option for those seeking exposure to the Large Cap ETFs area of the market  Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space 
The iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF  IWF  and the PowerShares QQQ  QQQ  track a similar index  While iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF has  41 55 B in assets  PowerShares QQQ has  62 48 B  IWF has an expense ratio of 0 20  and QQQ charges 0 20

115905,337420,HSIC,Will Buyouts Help Quest Diagnostics  DGX  Beat Q1 Earnings ,opinion,Quest Diagnostics Inc    NYSE DGX   is scheduled to report first quarter 2018 earnings performance before the opening bell on Apr 19 Last quarter  the company s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny  delivering a positive surprise of 0 73   Also  the metric outperformed the consensus mark in all the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 6 83  Let s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement Factors at PlayOn a positive note  Quest Diagnostics seems well aligned with its two point growth agenda to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence Per its new long term growth outlook  beyond 2017   revenue increase for the period 2017 2020 is expected to be 3 5  with 1 2  growth projected from acquisitions  Earnings for the period are anticipated to rise faster than revenues in the mid to high single digit range The company estimates revenue growth for the period 2017 2020 at 3 5    Per the company  its increasing number of partnerships with other health care leaders and strategic acquisitions is creating promising opportunities for the top and bottom line growth while improving the patient experience and reducing the overall cost of care In this regard  we take a note of two recent strategic M As by Quest Diagnostics  First  the acquisition of Cleveland HeartLab  which should help strengthen the company s position in the New York metropolitan marketplace  Second  the buyout of Mobile Medical Examination Service MedXM  which should fortify Quest Diagnostics  mobile provider capabilities and population health management solutions for health plans  These two transactions should garner favorable results in the yet to be reported quarter Quest Diagnostics Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise    We are also optimistic about the company s successful execution of its strategy to build esoteric testing business as well as boost profitable growth Additionally  Quest Diagnostics has recently witnessed a significant improvement via infectious disease testing  prescription drug monitoring and industry leading wellness business  Therefore we expect these growth drivers to replicate the company s success story in its upcoming quarterly results  having thus remained active throughout  Also  the performance is likely to drive the same primary metrics like the preceding quarter We strongly believe all these recent developments to have significantly contributed to the company s top line in the first quarter The company expects 2018 revenues in the range of  7 7  7 77 billion  annualized growth of 4 5    The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at  7 94 billion  ahead of the company s projected range Excluding the impact of special items  amortization expense and ETB  excess tax benefit associated with stock based compensation   adjusted EPS for the full year is projected in the band of  6 50  6 70  The Zacks Consensus Estimate of  6 10 falls below this guided range On the flip side  after a phase of continual drag for several quarters in the company s revenue per requisition performance  the last three quarters saw a slight rebound  However  it still remains to be seen if this upside is here to stay or not The company s two Professional Lab Services engagements   WJ Barnabas Health and HealthONE System of HCA Holdings  Inc   HCA    also carry lower revenue per requisition due to the nature of work Further  we should take into consideration the persistent headwind of unit price  which was moderately down in less than 100 basis points  Excluding the impact of Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014  PAMA   the company expects unit price headwinds in 2018 to remain below 100 basis points with PAMA adding an extra headwind of approximately 50 basis points to it  This should also get reflected in the first quarter results Overall  we believe that lack of employment and slow growth of commercially insured lives will continuously affect the company s volumes  measured by the number of requisitions  till the economy turns around for better What Our Model SuggestsPer the proven Zacks model  a company with a favorable Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  has good chances of beating estimates if it also has a positive  Quest Diagnostics has a Zacks Rank  3  which increases the predictive power of ESP and an Earnings ESP of  3 19   which raises confidence about a positive surprise  Together  the combination suggests that the company is likely to beat on earnings this quarter Conversely  we caution against the Sell rated stocks   4 or 5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate

115908,337423,HSIC,WATCHMAN To Aid Boston Scientific  BSX  Q1 Earnings Amid Woes,opinion,Boston Scientific Corporation   NYSE BSX   is scheduled to report first quarter 2018 results before the opening bell on Apr 25 Last quarter  the company delivered earnings in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  However  the average trailing four quarter earnings surprise is pegged at  0 03  Let s see  how things are shaping up prior to this announcement Key CatalystsWithin structural heart  we are looking forward to Boston Scientific s WATCHMAN  ACURATE  and IRIS product lines  expected to strongly contribute to the company s top line in the yet to be reported quarter  Earlier  the company stated that in2018  it expects revenues from WATCHMAN and ACURATE TAVR franchise to gross approximately  400 million We are optimistic about the gradually improving performance in Interventional Cardiology  IC   led by an innovative portfolio and robust commercial teams  globally  More specifically  the company has of late  successfully gained within this business on strong sales of WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure device and its portfolio of complex PCI  percutaneouscoronary intervention  products The WATCHMAN platform is anticipated to experience another excellent quarter on consistent global momentum as Boston Scientific s multiple market development efforts continue to push for growth This apart  new launches within IC business like the WOLVERINE cutting balloon and the company s next generation rotational atherectomy platform called ROTAPRO  are likely to strongly contribute to the top line in the upcoming quarter We are also upbeat about the company s ACURATE  TAVR  transcatheter aortic valve replacement  program  which has recently completed training of European sales and clinical teams Boston Scientific Corporation Price and EPS Surprise    However  ahead of the company s earnings release for the first quarter  we believe its IC business to be once again deeply impacted by the product recall issue within Europe  Notably  the company has recently announced a further delay in its earlier reported timelines for the commercial return of the LOTUS Edge Aortic Valve System in Europe as well as the United States  following the product s voluntary recall  last February Other Factors at PlayAmong the segments  MedSurg is estimated to demonstrate a steady performance  led by endoscopy  Urology and Women s Health are also projected to grow beyond market levels  driven by investment strategies in the key international geographies However  the company is expected to face some downsides within this business too in the yet to be reported quarter  These headwinds may come in the form of year over year difficult pacer comparisons and more competitions in the drug eluting stent space with some new entrants Overall  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first quarter endoscopy revenues is pegged at  420 million  8 5  above the prior year quarter s reported count of  387 million  For Urology and Women s Health  the consensus mark of  289 million remains 9 1  ahead of the year earlier quarter s reported tally of  265 million On the flip side  severe currency headwinds that Boston Scientific have been facing of late  remain a concern  In fact  as the company records 47  of its sales from the international markets  it gets highly exposed to currency fluctuations  This apart  although immaterial for the to be reported quarter  the ongoing tensions between the United States as well as China regarding the imposition of tariffs on imports  have raised concerns for major MedTech players as any adverse move might affect the top line numbers in the future Here s What Our Quantitative Model PredictsPer the proven Zacks model  a company with a favorable Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  has good chances of beating estimates if it also has a positive  Boston Scientific has a Zacks Rank  3  which increases the predictive power of ESP and an Earnings ESP of 0 00   which makes surprise prediction difficult  Together  the combination does not suggest that the company is likely to beat on earnings this quarter

Illumina  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    Accordingly  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Product revenues of  621 million reflects an increase of 26 5  from the year ago quarter Total Services and other revenues  which include genotyping and sequencing services  instrument maintenance contracts and revenues from oncology agreements  have also been strong  The upside is being driven by strength in genotyping services due to sequencing instrument maintenance contracts and increased consumer demand At NIPT  Illumina won Dutch National contract during the previous quarter along with some other encouraging developments  Per management  these factors will more than double sales from this business in 2018   Moreover  the company is making progress with NIPT adoption  courtesy of continued uptake of VeriSeq NIPT Solution  which includes CE IVD marked library prep and analysis software With MiniSeq and MiSeq shipments accounting for roughly 60  of the new to sequencing customer demand and growing NextSeq adoption with commercial customers using the platform in production settings  Illumina s benchtop portfolio has been encouraging The bullish trend is expected to be reflected in the to be reported quarter s results  Thus  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Service and other revenues of  123 million shows a rise of 15  from the year ago quarter Here are the other factors that might influence Illumina s first quarter results In January 2018  Illumina announced the launch of the iSeq 100 Sequencing System  This next generation sequencing system delivers excellent data accuracy  at a low capital cost  making Illumina technology available to virtually any lab  Since the company began shipping the product in January itself  investors will be watching out for the difference it will make to the top line results in the quarter to be reported Geographically  Illumina has been witnessing growing revenues from Europe  the Middle East and Africa  EMEA  led by sequencing instruments and consumables  Solid performance in Asia Pacific propelled by 12  shipment growth in Greater China also encourages us  Recently  management has noticed an uptick in demand from customers who are attempting to set up NIPT operations in China  We believe these developments will open channels for Illumina  thereby enhancing business growth Although immaterial for the to be reported quarter  the ongoing tensions between the United States and China regarding the imposition of tariffs on imports have raised concerns for major MedTech players as any adverse move may mar sales in China in the near term Total oncology testing was up 60  in the last reported quarter  Per management  the solid results were primarily led by continued growth in the translational liquid biopsy segment  Furthermore  Illumina continues to expect robust demand for oncology testing Overall  first quarter total revenues are projected at  743 million  up 24 2  from the prior year quarter What Our Model SuggestsAccording to the Zacks model  a company with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive   You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Illumina has a Zacks Rank  3 and an Earnings ESP of  6 07   a combination that suggests that the company is likely to beat estimates The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of  1 02 reflects a 59 4  rise on a year over year basis Other Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few other medical stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter Myriad Genetics  Inc    NASDAQ MYGN   has an Earnings ESP of  0 61  and a Zacks Rank  2  You can see  Henry Schein  Inc    NASDAQ HSIC   has an Earnings ESP of  3 34  and a Zacks Rank  3 Quest Diagnostics Incorporated   NYSE DGX   has an Earnings ESP of  3 19  and a Zacks Rank  3 Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest StrategiesIt s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  21 9  in 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  115 0    109 3    104 9    98 6   and  67 1  And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  Over the years it has been remarkably consistent  From 2000   2017  the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over  Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we re willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation ",2018-04-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-solid-overall-growth-drive-illuminas-ilmn-q1-earnings-200305160,200305160
115938,337453,HSIC,What To Expect From Quest Diagnostics  DGX  In Q4 Earnings,opinion,Quest Diagnostics Inc    NYSE DGX   is scheduled to report fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 earnings results before the opening bell on Feb 1 Last quarter  the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by four cents delivering a positive earnings surprise of 2 96   Also  it outperformed the consensus mark in all the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 7 4  Let s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement Factors at PlayAfter a phase of sustained drag for several quarters in the company s revenue per requisition performance  the last couple of quarters saw a slight rebound  However  it still remains to be seen if this upside is here to stay or not  The company s two Professional Lab Services engagements   WJ Barnabas Health and HealthONE System of HCA Holdings  Inc   HCA    carry lower revenue per requisition due to the nature of work Overall  we believe a lack of employment and slow growth of commercially insured lives to continuously affect the company s volumes  measured by the number of requisitions  till the economy turns around for better Quest Diagnostics Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise   This apart  unit price headwinds were less than 100 bps in the third quarter  While unit price challenges hovered in moderate ranges  at approximately 1   over the last few years  the company continues to expect the same for the rest of 2017 too Also  in the last couple of years  Quest Diagnostics faced several reimbursement issues hurting its revenues  The company is concerned about the CMS  Centers for Medicare   Medicaid Services  proposal related to Protecting Access to Medicare Act  We believe  reimbursement pressure will be reflected as an overhang in the company s performance this soon to be reported quarter too Notably in December  the company as a key member of the American Clinical Laboratory Association   ACLA   has come forward to support a lawsuit filed by ACLA against the Acting Secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services  HHS   The lawsuit charged that the CMS  operating under the purview of HHS  has failed to follow a congressional directive to implement a market based laboratory payment system However  come what may  this leaves no impact on the company s yet to be reported quarter s revenue numbers On a positive note  Quest Diagnostics seems well aligned with its two point growth agenda to accelerate the same and drive operational excellence We are also optimistic about the company s successful execution of its strategy to build esoteric testing business and boost profitable growth Additionally  Quest Diagnostics has recently witnessed a significant improvement via infectious disease testing  prescription drug monitoring and industry leading wellness business  Therefore we expect these growth drivers to replicate the company s success story in its upcoming quarterly results  having thus remained active throughout  and drive the same primary metrics as well like the preceding quarter We strongly believe all these recent developments to have significantly contributed to the company s top line in the fourth quarter The company expects 2017 revenues of approximately  7 71 billion  annualized growth of approximately 3    The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full year revenues is pegged at  7 94 billion  higher than the guided range Moreover  the company s 2017 adjusted EPS range remains within  5 62  5 67  The Zacks Consensus Estimate of  5 96 for the period also remains above the company s projected range Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Quest Diagnostics is likely to beat on earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a favorable Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  But that is not the case here as you will see below Zacks ESP  Quest Diagnostics has an Earnings ESP of  1 74   This is because the Most Accurate estimate of  1 37 is pegged lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 39  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks Rank  Quest Diagnostics has a Zacks Rank  3  which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  we need a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise  Hence  this combination leaves surprise prediction inconclusive We caution against the Sell rated stocks   4 or 5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing

115942,337457,HSIC,Sell These Healthcare Middlemen About to Get Amazoned,opinion,"A few weeks ago  I told my regular readers at Investors Alley about the announcement from Amazon com  Nasdaq  NASDAQ AMZN  that it was joining forces with JPMorgan  NYSE JPM  and Warren Buffett s BerkshireHathaway to disrupt the healthcare industry  More specifically  the venture is being aimed at the many middlemen in the U S  healthcare industry including insurance companies and pharmacy benefit management companies 
Speaking of middlemen  Amazon apparently is tired of dealing with the likes of FedEx Corporation  NYSE FDX  and United Parcel Service  NYSE UPS  too  It is preparing to launch a delivery service for businesses that will compete directly with the two delivery giants called  Shipping With Amazon  or SWA 
Amazon will roll out the service in Los Angeles in the coming weeks  shipping out goods for merchants that sell on the Amazon website  The company plans to expand the service to a number of other cities this year  It already delivers some of its own goods in 37 U S  cities 
While the move into delivery logistics is interesting  Amazon s ambitions in the healthcare industry should be what catches your attention  The company now looks to be moving into the healthcare supply chain business  You know the business well if you ve had a stay in the hospital and ingested one of those  100 a pill aspirins 
Amazon Steps Into the Healthcare Supply Chain
In a statement  an Amazon spokesperson said   With medical supplies specifically  we hear from both healthcare manufacturers and healthcare customers that they want to find ways to simplify purchasing and reduce costs as a means to address systemic issues that take away focus from patient need  Many large health systems have numerous satellite facilities  and as care shifts closer to the home  they need to address gaps and invent new ways to simplify supplies moving to locations beyond the hospital  
The company is already laying the groundwork for such a move into the healthcare supply chain  It has gotten approval from several states pharmaceutical boards as a wholesale distributor  This is a necessary first step toward selling medical equipment to licensed medical professionals 
Amazon has also met with executives from many of our nation s most prominent hospital systems to brainstorm ideas and point out potential problems in expanding its Amazon Business division into the healthcare supply chain business  It has already begun a pilot program with a large Midwestern hospital system to test whether all goes well in their ordering supplies for the hospital s 150 outpatient locations 
Huge Opportunity for Amazon
The focus on healthcare supplies is a smart move by Amazon since many hospital systems have been buying up medical practices as they move into the rapidly growing outpatient care market  However  most hospital distribution systems have not kept up and are still focused on just servicing the main hospital  Amazon can modernize their distribution system 
It s also a savvy move because it doesn t involve getting complex regulatory approvals  Many states don t require a license at all to sell low tech medical supplies  It s the lowest hanging  fruit  in the very big healthcare market 
And once Amazon understands how to keep the shelves stocked with band aids and gauze  it shouldn t be much of a stretch that it would move up the supply chain  while obtaining regulatory approvals  and begin to provide healthcare systems with medicines and high tech medical devices 
The healthcare supply chain is a huge opportunity for a disruptive company like Amazon  The Wall Street Journal cited a November research report by Citigroup  NYSE C  Global Markets Inc  that found fees  administration  marketing and shipping costs account for an estimated 20  to 30  of healthcare supply costs  As Rob Austin of Navigant Consulting said to the WSJ   There s a lot of people with fingers in the pie  
In other words  more middlemen that are driving up the cost of healthcare for you and me and everyone else in the country  Middlemen that are just begging to be Amazoned  As Jeff Bezos famously said   Your margin is my opportunity  
Stocks Ready to Be Amazoned
So what middlemen companies are in the sights of Amazon in the healthcare supply chain 
Some of these I ve mentioned before including drug distributors Cardinal Health  NYSE CAH  and McKesson  NYSE MCK   But it also includes companies that move basic supplies to doctors  dentists and veterinarians such as Henry Schein  NASDAQ HSIC  and Owens   Minor  NYSE OMI  
In fact  about a week ago  the CEO of Owens   Minor  Paul Cody Phipps  said on a conference call that Amazon was talking to many large hospital systems   including our customers  
These stocks have not done well despite a healthy stock market  Cardinal is down 14  over the past year while McKesson is unchanged and down 3 5  year to date  Henry Schein is down 17 3  over the past 12 months and little changed year to date  while Owens   Minor has nose dived over 53  over the past 52 weeks and is down nearly 15  year to date 
These stocks  especially OMI and HSIC  are to be avoided at all costs  Or even shorted if you have a high risk tolerance  The same goes for the two ETFs that are loaded with middlemen stocks  the iShares U S  Healthcare Providers ETF  NYSE IHF  and the SPDR S P Health Care Services ETF  NYSE XHS  
Once Amazon goes  all in  to the healthcare field  it will be a tough environment for the middlemen that have fed at the healthcare trough for many years to survive

115976,337491,HSIC,Can Thermo Fisher s  TMO  Product Portfolio Up Q4 Earnings ,opinion,Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc    NYSE TMO   is slated to report fourth quarter 2017 results before the market opens on Jan 31  Last quarter  the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3 1   Moreover  Thermo Fisher has surpassed estimates in all the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 2 3  Let s see  how things are shaping up for this announcement Key CatalystThermo Fisher has been going strong across its analytical instrument businesses with increasing global demand  Particularly  the company s acquisition of FEI has already started generating synergies and largely contributing to its analytical instruments portfolio from the last three quarters  The buyout has enabled Thermo Fisher to access FEI s industry leading high performance electron microscopy platform used for protein study and facilitating life science research  This is also a vital highlight of the quarter to be reported Thermo Fisher anticipates realizing total synergies of approximately  80 million by the end of three years following the deal s closure with about  55 million of cost synergies and roughly   25 million of adjusted operating income benefits from revenue related synergies  This should get reflected in fourth quarter 2017 performance Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc Price and EPS Surprise    Apart from FEI related development  another notable launch in the company s Analytical Instruments business is its new line of Thermo Scientific air quality monitors called the iQ Series  This platform includes mobile applications for remote monitoring and control as well as wireless connectivity and enhanced services  This in turn is likely to contribute to the company s top line in the yet to be reported quarter Last but not the least  worth mentioning is the company s recent completion of taking over the desktop scanning electron microscopy  SEM  solutions provider  Phenom World  Thermo Fisher plans to integrate the business into its Analytical Instruments segment  Per management  addition of Phenom World s desktop SEM platform is projected to leverage its position in electron microscopy space and expand its entry level plus desktop SEMs offerings for customers working in materials science  industrial manufacturing  life sciences and electronics industries Overall  the Waltham MA based company is gearing up for yet another quarter of strong analytical instruments segmental growth  In the period to be reported  Thermo Fisher expects to see a positive impact from the electron microscopy business as well as robust volume expansion plus productivity The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Analytical Instruments revenues is pegged at  1 303 billion  higher than the sequentially last quarter s reported figure of  1 190 billion  Total revenue estimate for this segment also remains at an impressive level of  1 11 billion Here are other factors that might influence Thermo Fisher s fourth quarter results The company s focus to boost growth through implementation of strategies and consolidating its product offerings is encouraging  These initiatives are likely to help it post impressive results in the fourth quarter The company had spent  750 million on research and development in 2016 and the same trend is continuing through 2017  We expect all innovations and product launches to significantly contribute to the company s top line in the fourth quarter itself The company s aim to expand capabilities in the fast growing Asia Pacific zone as well as the emerging markets should also lead to solid results  Recent standout contributors are China  India and South Korea  With strategic investments to support key customer applications  Thermo Fisher forecasts to maintain this bullish momentum for the rest of 2017 Growth is also estimated in applied markets such as environmental and food safeties apart from life science  In addition  the company is betting on some key areas under focus with enormous opportunities at its disposal including advancing precision medicines from mass spectrometry to the targeted gene sequencing and structural biology  However  we are apprehensive about Thermo Fisher citing a foreign exchange headwind on 2017 revenues and adjusted EPS  Also  a hostile macroeconomic condition continues to weigh heavily on the stock  Plus  stiff competition consistently imposes challenges on the stock s value Here s what our quantitative model predicts Thermo Fisher does not have the right combination of two main ingredients   a positive  and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or higher   for increasing the odds of an earnings beat this quarter Zacks ESP  Thermo Fisher has an Earnings ESP of  0 2   You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks Rank  Thermo Fisher s Zacks Rank of 3 increases the predictive power of ESP  However  we need a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise  Hence  this combination leaves surprise prediction inconclusive The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter 2017 earnings per share of  2 66 reflects a 10 3  rise on a year over year basis Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few medical stocks worth considering with the right combination of elements to beat estimates this time around Bio Rad Laboratories  Inc    NYSE BIO   has an Earnings ESP of  4 45  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see  Myriad Genetics  Inc    NASDAQ MYGN   has an Earnings ESP of  0 42  and is a Zacks  3 Ranked player Henry Schein  Inc    NASDAQ

power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge

115979,337494,HSIC,Will WATCHMAN Boost Boston Scientific s  BSX  Q4 Earnings ,opinion,"Boston Scientific Corporation   NYSE BSX   is scheduled to report fourth quarter and 2017 results before the opening bell on Feb 1 
Last quarter  the company delivered earnings in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  However  the average trailing four quarter beat is pegged at 0 84  
Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement 
Preliminary ResultsOn Jan 9  Boston Scientific announced an upbeat fourth quarter 2017 preliminary sales performance  Year over year  preliminary net sales for the quarter has been forecast at  2 41 billion  up 9 9  on a reported basis  8 1  on an operational basis  at constant exchange rate or CER  and approximately  6 8  on an organic basis  This reported preliminary revenue figure lies above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 35 billion Notably  organic revenue growth excludes the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates as well as sales from the recent acquisitions of EndoChoice Holdings and Symetis SA For 2017  the company has announced preliminary net sales of  9 05 billion  reflecting 7 9  growth on a reported basis  7 8  increase on operational basis and a 6 6  rise on an organic basis compared with the prior year number  The company s preliminary tally again compares favorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  8 99 billion Key CatalystsBoston Scientific Corporation Price and EPS Surprise    We are optimistic about the company s gradually improving performance in Interventional Cardiology  IC   led by an innovative portfolio and robust commercial teams  globally  More specifically  the company has of late successfully gained within this business on strong sales of WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure device and its portfolio of complex PCI products The WATCHMAN platform is expected to experience another excellent quarter on consistent global momentum as Boston Scientific s multiple market development efforts continue to push for growth  In this regard  Medicare reimbursement rates for DRG 274 increased by an average of 10 6  effective Oct 1  under which  93  of WATCHMAN implants fall All these developments are expected to have significantly boosted the IC business in the fourth quarter itself  The company earlier stated that it expects to end 2017 with more than 375 accounts implanting WATCHMAN and increased reorder rates in previously opened accounts However  ahead of the company s earnings release for the fourth quarter  we believe its IC business to be grossly impacted by the product recall issue within Europe  Notably  in February 2017  the company recalled one of its prime products  the Lotus range of heart devices from Europe  due to device malfunctions  The company also delayed submission of its U S  marketing application for its Lotus Edge device Recently  the company has announced a further delay in its earlier reported timelines for the commercial return of the LOTUS Edge Aortic Valve System in Europe as well as the United States  Notably  while recalling the product last February  Boston Scientific announced the expected time of reintroduction of the LOTUS Edge delivery system in Europe by the first quarter of 2018  The company also expected to file the final Pre Market Approval  PMA  module with the U S  Food and Drug Administration by January 2018 However  per the latest press release  the company is likely to provide a further update on the status of the LOTUS Edge Valve on Feb 1  2018  This delay has been justified by Boston Scientific citing its continuous focus on manufacturing and regulatory milestones to support the long term success of the Lotus platform  The company stated that it is working hard to implement necessary modifications in the device to pass the internal quality standards However  this extra delay might lead to a further setback for the company s fast growing transcatheter aortic valve replacement business within the IC in the soon to be reported quarter The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter IC revenues is pegged at  622 million  a 6 3  higher than the year ago reported number of  585 million Other Factors at PlayAmong the segments  MedSurg is estimated to demonstrate a steady performance  led by endoscopy  Urology and Women s Health are also projected to grow beyond market levels  driven by investment strategies in key international geographies The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter endoscopy revenues is pegged at  417 million  9 7  above the prior year quarter s reported count of  380 million  For Urology and Women s Health  the consensus mark of  303 million remains 10 5  ahead of the year earlier quarter s reported tally of  274 million On the flip side  severe currency headwinds that Boston Scientific has been facing of late remain a concern  In fact  as the company records 47  of its sales from the international markets  it gets highly exposed to currency fluctuations  For the full year  Boston Scientific predicts an unfavorable foreign exchange challenge to the tune of 700 basis points or 8 cents per share on earnings Here s What Our Quantitative Model Predicts Boston Scientific does not have the right combination of the two main ingredients   a positive  and a favorable Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold    for increasing the odds of an earnings beat Zacks ESP  Boston Scientific has an Earnings ESP of 0 00   which makes surprise prediction difficult  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks Rank  Boston Scientific carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   which lowers the predictive power of ESP Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few medical stocks worth considering with the right combination of elements to beat on

Zimmer Biomet Holdings  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise
     We are also upbeat about the Spine  Craniomaxillofacial and Thoracic  Spine   CMF  segment  which is expected to deliver another quarter of promising performance  Under the spine category  Zimmer Biomet should continue to gain from strong uptake of Mobi C Cervical Disc  Also  we are looking forward to top line contributions from the company s launch of products like the Avenue T TLIF Cage and Vitality   and Vital Spinal Fixation Systems in the United States in October 2017 Moreover  although the LDR Holdings acquisition had insignificant contribution to the top line  30 basis points  in the third quarter at the initial phase of integration  it is expected to contribute 120 basis points to full year revenues at CER  Also  management is hopeful of gaining from significant cross selling opportunities that the acquisition provides on the back of a strong spine sales force in the United States Continued uptake of Trauma One Plating System  SternaLock Blu and SternaLock 360 primary closure systems as well as the RibFix Blu Thoracic Fixation System within the craniomaxillofacial and thoracic arm buoys optimism The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Spine revenues of  192 million indicates a rise of 0 5  from the year ago quarter Overall fourth quarter revenues are projected at  2 03 billion  up 0 9  from the prior year quarter Here are the other factors that might influence Zimmer Biomet s fourth quarter results Looking at the focused execution of Zimmer Biomet s sales teams  we expect the global adoption rate of the flagship personalized knee system   Persona   to be impressive  We are also upbeat about the launch of the Persona Partial Knee System last September  The knee system marked the latest addition to the company s portfolio of personalized and anatomically designed knee implant systems  Also  Zimmer Biomet s release of X ray based Patient Specific Instrument  X PSI Knee System  in the first half of 2017 buoys optimism  This is the world s first CE Marked surgical planning system that allows for patient specific implant positioning  solely utilizing the X ray technology  These developments are expected to boost the fourth quarter revenues The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Knee revenues of  723 million indicates an uptick of 0 3  from the year ago quarter Emerging markets have always been a significant revenue generating source for Zimmer Biomet  Despite the recent economic downturn in Latin America  the company managed to drive growth through its operations in other emerging markets  especially the Asia Pacific and EMEA  Europe  the Middle East and Africa   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third quarter revenues from EMEA of  467 million indicates an improvement of 5 2  from the year ago quarter  Moreover  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third quarter revenues from APAC of  313 million indicates a rise of 3 9  from the year ago quarter Meanwhile  macroeconomic uncertainties and unfavorable currency fluctuations have been denting sales for the company over the past few quarters  The company has also been dealing with pricing pressure  In this regard  Zimmer Biomet faced a negative pricing pressure of approximately 2 1  in the last reported quarter  In the absence of any favorable changes on these lines  these headwinds might reflect in the company s fourth quarter results For the second half of 2017  management continues to expect impact from reduced sales expectations  continued spending on critical programs and rising manufacturing costs from the Warsaw North Campus facility Earnings Whispers Our proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Zimmer Biomet this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here as you will see below Zacks ESP  Zimmer Biomet has an Earnings ESP of  0 38   This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at  2 11  while the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at  2 10 Zacks Rank  Zimmer Biomet carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   Please note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 and 5  Strong Sell  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revision momentum The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of  2 10 reflects a 1 9  decline from the year ago quarter Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few medical stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter Bio Rad

Schwab s shares have outperformed the Zacks Investment Brokers industry over the last three months  gaining  7 7  vs  6 9   The performance was supported by impressive earnings surprise history  as the company did not lag expectations in any of the trailing four quarters  
The company s third quarter 2017 results reflect higher revenues and benefits from rising rates  It remains well positioned to gain from the rising rate environment  Also  initiatives to strengthen trading income are likely to support its profitability in the long run despite the near term reduction in the same  
However  a continuous rise in expenses  due to rise in compensation costs  remains a key concern for the company  Further  significant dependence on fee based revenue streams makes us apprehensive

116020,337535,HSIC,Milestone Scientific  A Compelling Opportunity,opinion,"The biotechnology industry is one that is booming with innovation  Cures for some of the world s most devastating illnesses have been and continue to be invented  new technologies are providing physicians with less invasive and more effective options for treating their patients  and breakthroughs in just about every aspect of the industry are taking place at what seems to be a breakneck pace  As a result  finding a corner of the biotechnology space that has little to no competition with a drastic need for innovation can be overwhelmingly difficult to say the least  Nonetheless  one company   Milestone Scientific Inc   NYSE MLSS    has done just that 
An Introduction To MLSS
Founded in 1991  Milestone Scientific is a medical research and development company that s focused on the industry surrounding subcutaneous drug delivery  which is the delivery of drugs under the skin  Interestingly  the hypodermic syringe was invented more than a century ago  In fact  the medical instrument has been around for more than 160 years  Nonetheless  little to no innovation has taken place surrounding this key medical tool since it was invented  This is where MLSS comes in 
When MLSS was founded  the company went on a mission to change what we know about the fear inducing concept known as the hypodermic needle and syringe  A part of the medical industry that has not only led to fear in one third of patients in the United States and around the world  but has also been starved of the innovation the medical industry had been seeing for years  Ultimately  Milestone Scientific wanted to find a way to relieve the pain  discomfort  and anxiety that comes along with this form of drug delivery 
In doing so  the company quickly learned that the hypodermic needle itself wasn t the source of the pain that has caused this fear  discomfort  and anxiety  Instead  the source of this pain was the pressure created when the medication flowed through the needle and into the patient s body  The syringe concept itself was the problem  In fact  as medicine flows through the broad diameter syringe and into the thin diameter hypodermic needle  enormous pressure is created  That pressure can be up to 300 PSI  Considering that most tires are only pumped to around 30 PSI  one could imagine the damage a drug being sent into the body at 300 PSI could do to tissue 
Enter The World Of Dynamic Pressure   Sensing Technology 
Knowing that the hypodermic needle wasn t the source of the pain  discomfort  and anxiety associated with subcutaneous drug delivery  but that pressure was  MLSS set out to solve the problem  This led to the invention of the company s proprietary DPS    dynamic pressure sensing   technology 
Through this technology  Milestone Scientific unlocked the key to largely pain free subcutaneous drug delivery  By monitoring the pressure at which medicine flowed through the needle and into the patient s body  MLSS was able to greatly reduce pain by reducing the flow of medication based on the pain causing pressure associated with the treatment  However  this wasn t the only benefit of the ability to sense pressure dynamically at the injection site 
In fact  through this pressure sensing technology  MLSS realized that they now had the ability to precisely place the needle where it needed to be in order to get the maximum effect of the treatment that was being delivered subcutaneously  Ultimately  the implications of this technology reached further than even the management at the company would have realized early on 
It All Started With The Wand  
With the information amassed through the creation of the DPS  technology  Milestone Scientific moved to the next step  inventing a tool for the dental industry that s like no other  This tool is known as The Wand   Taking advantage of the dynamic pressure sensing technology  The Wand  offers several benefits to clinicians and patients alike  These benefits include 
For Clinicians 
Single Tooth Anesthesia   Due to the unique ability of The Wand  to sense the pressure at the injection site  the tool allows clinicians to anesthetize a single tooth  The proprietary DPS  technology created by MLSS allows clinicians to place the needle in a very small area required to do so  In fact  that area is only about the width of a few of the same hypodermic needles that are used for the procedure  As a result  patients visiting the dentist no longer have to worry about a quarter of their mouth going numb when getting dental work done 
Reduction In Chair Time   At the end of the day  the longer a patient is in a dentist s chair  the more opportunity for earning that dentist is missing out on and perhaps more importantly  the more anxiety takes place in the patient  Through the use of The Wand  by MLSS  patients spend less time in the chair  giving dentists the ability to earn more within their practice while reducing anxiety among patients 
Reduced Quantity Of Anesthetic   With the ability to anesthetize a single tooth  clinicians can now get the desired result with the use of a reduced amount of anesthetic 
Fewer Complications   With less pain for the patient as well as less numbing effects  dentists who take advantage of The Wand  see fewer complications when treating their patients 
Ergonomic Grip   The Wand  was designed by Milestone Scientific with an ergonomic grip  offering comfort to clinicians 
Reduced Patient Cancellations   Because The Wand  eliminates the pain associated with the injection of an anesthetic  fear and anxiety are reduced among patients  leading to less patient cancellations 
Avoidance Of Tachycardia   Through the use of The Wand   clinicians now have the ability to avoid tachycardia  a serious  life threatening condition that is caused when drugs like anesthesia drugs that include the use of epinephrine are injected into the blood vessel  Because The Wand  uses the DPS  technology  dentists can be sure that the needle is not in a blood vessel  but instead  is in the target location for the treatment  avoiding the problem of tachycardia all together 
For Patients 
Painless Injection   The Wand  by MLSS is designed to offer painless injections  bringing a new level of comfort to patients visiting the dentist 
No Collateral Numbness   Through the use of the DPS  technology  dentists now have the ability to anesthetize a single tooth  avoiding collateral numbness throughout the rest of the mouth and tongue 
Faster Onset Of Anesthesia   With the ability to target a single tooth with pinpoint precision  MLSS has created a way to speed up the process of anesthesia 
As a result of all of the benefits listed above  Milestone Scientific has seen great success surrounding The Wand   In fact  the technology has received both FDA and CE marketing clearance  and more than 45 000 units have been sold leading to more than 70 million injections using the technology to date  In 2016  the company generated more than  10 5 million in sales from the product  This technology has also opened several doors for MLSS  as one would imagine 
First and foremost  MLSS has been awarded with 21 patents  many of which are wide ranging  surrounding its proprietary DPS  technology  On top of that  it has seen favorable evaluations in more than 50 peer reviewed independent clinical research reports  Not to mention what is perhaps the largest validation of their work to date  the company has entered into an agreement with Henry Schein  NASDAQ HSIC  
MLSS Enters Agreement With Henry Schein
Recently  Milestone Scientific reached a substantial milestone when they announced that they had entered into an agreement with Henry Schein  NASDAQ HSIC   The recently announced 10 year exclusive distribution agreement signed with the world s largest provider of dental products opens several doors for the company 
First and foremost  Henry Schein has dedicated 25 sales representatives to the product  and they are supported by 900 field representatives  Henry Schein has also agreed to minimum purchase orders in order to maintain exclusivity through the 10 year period  Through this relationship  MLSS plans to ship approximately 2 800 000 disposables in 2017  which represents about 4  market penetration in a market where about 150 000 dentists perform more than 75 million injections annually 
Revenue Growth 
As if the product offering wasn t enough to get excited about  MLSS has seen some impressive revenue growth on a year over year basis throughout the past 3 years  The chart below shows the exceptional revenue growth the company has seen  In the year 2015  the company generated  4 5 million in revenue  followed by  5 8 million in 2016  and  6 2 million in 2017  With the Henry Schein partnership  the potential for future revenue growth is incredible 
Looking Into The Future 
When looking into MLSS at the moment  you re going to see quite a bit about The Wand  and its use in the dental industry  However  the implications of the DPS  technology go far and wide  In fact  Milestone Scientific received CE marketing approval for instruments in both the intra articular and epidural spaces  In the United States market  the company has received FDA clearance for the CompuFlo epidural instrument and is currently working toward FDA clearance for the intra articular instrument  In fact  MLSS is currently in negotiations with regard to forming strategic distribution partnerships around the world surrounding these applications 
This doesn t even go into mentioning the pediatric  cosmetic  veterinary  and many other applications that MLSS is in the process of tackling with their unique technology  In fact  the company is well on their way in some of these applications 
Ophthalmic Injections   At the moment  the Milestone product pipeline includes a proposed plan to develop an Ophthalmic Instrument in the future  MLSS plans on designing this instrument to address several key needs associated with ophthalmic injections  including wet AMD  diabetic macular edema  and retinal vein occlusions  Through the use of their proprietary DPS  technology  the instrument would provide a virtually painless injection while simultaneously controlling the injection pressure to ensure a safe and effective pressure level during an intro ocular administration 
Pediatric Applications   Currently  MLSS products are being used in various pediatric applications  In particular  The Wand  system is being used with great success in pediatric dentistry  as it improves the patients overall experience and decreases fear  Also  due to the ability to pinpoint anesthetic to a single tooth  children don t inadvertently bite themselves after a dental operation  The pediatric community as also benefiting greatly from Milestone s CompuFlo epidural  In fact  two key opinion leaders in the field of pediatric anesthesia have approached MLSS to initiate clinical research using the company s CompuFlo technology for epidurals in children  While this process is relatively young  the company intends to support any such research and will be able to report the results and findings in the future 
Veterinarian Applications   Finally  even the veterinary industry can benefit from Milestone Scientific s proprietary DPS  technology  In fact  Dr  Louis Campoy has completed multiple studies at Cornell College  During the studies  Dr  Louis Campoy used the CompuFlo technology to perform the Maxillary Foramen Block in a horse  To read the studies  click here  This will be a live link upon publication  
DPS  Technology Targets A Potentially Massive Industry 
When looking into the potential of the DPS  among all currently approved applications and applications under development  it becomes clear that MLSS is addressing a massive market  Just take a look at the number of injections that take place in the United States market alone  generating an industry worth more than  1 billion per year 
Epidural   Between labor and delivery  preoperative pain management  and chronic pain  12 8 million epidurals are performed every year in the United States alone 
Peripheral Nerve Block   9 million peripheral nerve block injections are performed in the United States every year 
Intra articular   5 million intra articular injections in the knees  shoulders  hips  and other joints of the body take place in the United States every year 
Cosmetic   8 4 million Botox injections are performed in the United States every year 
DPS  Is The Key Driver Of Value 
In this article  we ve discussed quite a bit surrounding the dental applications as well as the epidural  intra articular  and other applications of this technology  However  these applications  even when combined  aren t the biggest value proposition associated with this technology  The reality is that the technology MLSS has created has the ability to become a disruptive force in both the drug delivery industry and the intellectual property protection industry  Here s how Drug Delivery 
We are already seeing how DPS  can change the shape of drug delivery in dental and other applications  While the dental applications are building revenue right now  the opportunities down the road are endless  and Milestone Scientific knows it  The company has an ultimate goal of creating hundreds of various medical devices designed for different types of injections  and they are well on their way to doing so  With the ability to detect exactly where the needle is in the human body through the use of pressure feedback  there is an abundant need industry wide for a tool like this 
There are hundreds   and potentially thousands   of uses for a tool like this in the medical industry  and the industry needs a solution  On the industry side of things  about 4 5  of epidural injections end in morbidity  This means that the needle has passed the target  touching the membrane surrounding the spinal column  Every time this happens  another anesthesiologist has to perform another epidural and close the hole created with a blood patch  This can leave the patient with severe migraine headaches for up to 6 weeks  transient paralysis for up to 2 years  or even permanent paralysis  The cost of these issues is massive  In fact  the average settlement in an epidural morbidity case costs the facility around  400 000  not to mention the cost of the additional procedure and the cost of the original doctor not being able to work on the patient  With CompuFlo by MLSS  more than 700 epidurals have been performed with a 100  success rate due to the use of the company s DPS  technology  This is just one corner of the vast market 
However  the company isn t stopping with the injections themselves  Another thing to keep in mind here is that  with every device created  MLSS also sells disposables designed to work with that device  Ultimately  these disposables will create a constant stream of revenue beyond the purchase of the medical instruments themselves 
Patent Protection
Patents expire all the time in the medical industry  it s the nature of the beast  When this happens  the company with the brand name drug loses the vast majority of the market to generic competition  However  Milestone Scientific has a solution for this problem as well 
The company intends to partner with the companies that have created drugs with patent expiration  Through these partnerships  MLSS plans to create medical devices designed around the out of patent treatments  Of course  the new devices will only use the brand name drug  giving the pharmaceutical company a leg up in the market once its patent expires  From there  MLSS could license the technology  wholesale the device to the company  or even sell the rights to the device to the company they partnered with 
The Bottom Line
Milestone Scientific is a company that is well worth watching  As the company s Wand Dental subsidiary continues to grow profitability  the company continues to innovate and expand their offering  proving that their product and business model works  With proprietary disposables that provide high margins and continued innovation in new and exciting products surrounding the massive subcutaneous drug delivery market  MLSS is becoming hard to ignore  As revenue continues to grow  the company is expecting continued expansion in operating margins thanks to a highly scalable business model  Moving forward  the CNA Finance team will be watching for continued growth in The Wand  revenue  continued innovation in the subcutaneous drug delivery industry  and expected catalysts including operating results  study publications  and distribution contracts  all of which are expected to come down the wire relatively soon  We ll continue to follow the story closely and bring the news to you as it breaks

116021,337536,HSIC,Cardinal Health  Is The Risk Already Priced In  ,opinion,"Introduction
As a value investor  I am totally cognizant of the reality that attractively valued bargains are hard to find in a strong bull market  Moreover  as an experienced value investor I clearly understand that low valuations in a raging bull market are usually associated with issues and challenges sometimes real  sometimes imaginary  The key to success is to identify when current problems are temporary  thereby creating long term opportunity 
With that said  there are a couple of other aspects of value investing that need to be recognized and understood  As a committed value investor  I will never invest in a stock unless I consider it attractively valued  With extremely high quality companies this can simply mean that valuation needs to be sound or reasonable  With less than stellar companies  valuations need to be extremely low to be of interest  Nevertheless  I will never knowingly overpay for even the best of businesses  On the other hand  just because a company is fairly valued doesn t automatically make it investment worthy 
My point being that although attractive valuation is a critically important investment consideration  it is not the only consideration  From this perspective  valuation is primarily a risk assessment metric more than it is a return assessment  Furthermore  I believe that a comprehensive and thorough research and due diligence effort should be conducted before ever investing in any common stock  However  that requires time and effort on the part of the investor 
Consequently  I will not waste my time or take this important step unless I believe that valuation is attractive enough before I start  To me  as a committed value investor  there is little that is more frustrating than getting all excited about a possible stock investment only to determine that its current valuation is excessive  Unfortunately  it is hard to find attractively valued best of breed stock investments when markets are high like they are today  Unless  of course  the company is faced with issues that Mr  Market is concerned about 
On the other hand  there is nothing a value investor likes better than finding a great business that the market is punishing unjustly  Finding a great business that is undervalued is value investing nirvana  In his 1994 annual report Warren Buffett stated this succinctly as follows   Indeed  we have usually made our best purchases when apprehensions about some macro event were at a peak  Fear is the foe of the faddist  but the friend of the fundamentalist  
To summarize this introduction  finding a great business on sale is a fundamental objective of value investing  However  investing in stocks that meet your specific investment objective is also a sound fundamental practice  In other words  a great stock can be discovered at an attractive valuation and still not be appropriate for your portfolio  For example  you might ignore or reject a non dividend paying growth stock at attractive value because your investment objective is income  This represents another situation where just because a stock is available at an attractive valuation doesn t necessarily imply that it s a good fit for your portfolio 
Cardinal Health Inc  NYSE CAH   A Great Business On Sale  
As I have matured  my investment objective has evolved from attempting to achieve maximum total long term returns to achieving a reliable and growing dividend income stream to supplement my income  Consequently  I am actively looking for attractively valued dividend growth stocks offering dividend yields of 3  or better  This 3  dividend yield goal is not arbitrary  For starters  3  is an above market dividend yield  and secondarily  a yield level that exceeds my income needs  Therefore  my dividend income meets my needs without ever having to harvest principle  shares   This solidifies the opportunity to receive more dividend income through future dividend increases 
Moreover  as stock values have become more and more extended  especially on the majority of high quality dividend growth stocks  such as Aristocrats and Champions   finding attractively valued blue chip dividend growth stocks offering yields of 3  or better has become very challenging  In markets like we have today  there is usually a negative catalyst or catalysts associated with attractive valuations  As previously stated  the trick is to find companies that are either being misappraised by the market  or when the market is overreacting to the negative catalysts 
Cardinal Health Inc   NYSE CAH  is a Dividend Aristocrat that has increased its dividend for 32 consecutive years and is currently yielding 3 3   But perhaps most importantly  I believe the company is worth in the neighborhood of  75 share and is currently available in the mid 50s  Consequently  I believe it offers the rare combination of above average and growing current yield with the opportunity to generate above average capital appreciation over the long run and perhaps the short run as well 
To be clear  I believe that Cardinal Health is facing short term issues that have recently generated weak earnings and cash flows  However  I also believe that the market is currently punishing the company s stock price more than it deserves  Consequently  I suggest that Cardinal Health is an extremely undervalued and therefore attractive Dividend Aristocrat on sale  Furthermore  I do believe the company possesses above average long term growth potential  As a result  I would expect above average longer term total returns resulting from growth coupled with P E ratio expansion  But best of all  Cardinal Health meets my current investment objective because it provides an above average current dividend yield coupled with above average dividend growth 
Additionally  it s also important to point out that my investing strategy and objective is long term buy and hold oriented  As a value investor  I understand that purchasing out of favor stocks can often lead to disappointing short term performance  On the other hand  as a value investor I also understand that purchasing out of favor stocks can lead to enhanced long term total returns at reduced levels of risk  In other words  my investment horizon is at a minimum 3 to 5 years  a typical business cycle  and preferably forever  As an experienced value investor  I have learned that it takes time for a business to increase its intrinsic value  Frankly  it s a lot easier to be patient when the business is paying you lavishly while you wait 
Cardinal Health  Investment Thesis
Once I have identified attractive valuation via FAST Graphs  my next step is to conduct some preliminary research  Therefore  I will look to outside sources such as Morningstar and or Zacks to see what they have to say about the company  Morningstar analyst Vishnu Lekraj in an analyst note on November 6  2017 stated that  Cardinal is one of the most critical players along the pharmaceutical supply chain  The following excerpts provide additional insights into Morningstar s view of Cardinal Health 
 While the firm s results for the quarter were not stellar  we don t believe they reflect the wholesaler s long term position  Accordingly  we are reiterating our wide moat rating and  84 fair value estimate for Cardinal  Pressuring the firm s core pharmaceutical segment was a resetting of its generic portfolio pricing  Over the last year  many independent pharmacy clients have demanded lower generic pricing from their respective pharmaceutical wholesalers and Cardinal s two main rivals  Amerisource and McKesson  NYSE MCK   have had to reprice a material portion of their group purchasing contracts as a result  We believe there has been somewhat of a lag of this trend for Cardinal  which is why its results this quarter were below its peers  
After acknowledging some of the issues facing Cardinal Health and its competitors  Morningstar highlighted Cardinal Health s wide moat as follows 
 Out of all the numerous players along the pharmaceutical supply chain  Cardinal stands out as an elite participant  We believe the firm possesses a wide economic moat  as it is able to turn its significant size and market share into key competitive advantages  Cardinal also plays a critical role within the pharmaceutical industry  given that many supply chain participants depend on its services for streamlined product distribution and procurement  We expect the use of pharmaceuticals to increase over the next several years  which should provide a solid platform for Cardinal s continued success 
Cardinal has also made a few strategic moves that we believe will be beneficial over the long term  For one  it signed an agreement with CVS Caremark where the two firms will combine generic sourcing operations  This should allow it an opportunity to enhance profitability  as the combined sourcing entity will be able to garner greater pricing discounts from generic manufacturers 
Cardinal is the third largest pharmaceutical distributor by revenue and is the main supplier to CVS Health s retail pharmacy network  The firm also supplies several large provider GPOs and mass retailers  The razor thin profitability of these contracts and the enormous amount of capital needed to build a top tier global drug wholesaling distribution operation have formed a solid competitive foundation for Cardinal that has largely kept new entrants at bay  
Therefore  at this cursory level of research and due diligence  Morningstar corroborates my thesis that Cardinal Health is undervalued  However  Zacks Research also provided additional insights that further corroborate my thesis 
Zacks summary 
 Over the last year  Cardinal Health has underperformed the broader industry with respect to price  Increasing generic pricing pressure is a major headwind  Intensifying competition and customer concentration are other bottlenecks  A sluggish macroeconomic scenario and tough product pricing environment are likely to impede growth  Meanwhile  the company is banking on strategic buyouts  joint ventures and supply agreements to drive growth  A solid fiscal 2018 guidance instills our confidence in the stock  Also  Cardinal Health ended first quarter on a solid note  courtesy of an encouraging performance at the Medical segment  Although  the Pharmaceutical segment witnessed strong growth in the Specialty business and gained a huge number of Pharmaceutical Distribution customers  profits at the segment were hurt by generic pharmaceutical pricing and the loss of a major Pharmaceutical Distribution customer  
As is Zacks custom in their research reports they also offer reasons to buy and reasons to sell as follows 
 Reasons to Buy  
Acquisition Drives Growth  Cardinal Health follows an acquisition driven strategy and continues to focus on investment in key growth businesses to gain market traction and boost profits  Cardinal Health announced that it has completed the acquisition of Medtronic s Patient Care  Deep Vein Thrombosis and Nutritional Insufficiency business for  6 1 billion  The Patient Care  Deep Vein Thrombosis and Nutritional Insufficiency business operates across 23 product categories in multiple market sites of care  like industry leading brands of Curity  Kendall  Dover  Argyle and Kangaroo   brands used in nearly every U S  hospital  Cardinal Health expects the acquisition to be accretive to adjusted earnings by more than  0 21 per share in fiscal 2018 
The company has recently entered into an agreement to buy the radioactive diagnostic drug Lymphoseek from Navidea Biopharmaceuticals  In fact over the last five years  the company has spent approximately  5 7 billion on acquisitions of the likes of Cordis  2015   The Harvard Group  2015   AccessClosure  2014   AssuraMed  2013   Kinray  2010   Cardinal Health China  2010  and Healthcare Solutions Holding  2010   These have considerably boosted the company s offerings in diversified fields  The Cordis takeover will expand the company s global footprint over the long haul  Cordis along with AccessClosure will boost the company s portfolio of self manufactured products under the Medical segment  The Harvard Group deal not only expands Cardinal Health s product portfolio but also its existing telesales programs and capabilities  We believe the company will continue to pursue acquisitions which are strategic fits and will also diversify its revenue base over the long term  
Cushioned Against Macroeconomic Sluggishness  Large cap  diversified healthcare distributors such as Cardinal Health are relatively insulated from macro economic uncertainty and a weak economy  Cardinal Health is one of the largest distributors of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies  It has a diversified product portfolio  which is a hedge against the risk of sales shortfall in testing times  The company s generics business continues to show healthy growth  supported by a solid customer base  significant scale of operation and the competence to source products from a complex and global supply network  Cardinal Health has rationalized the number of generic suppliers  In addition  the company has expanded relationships with generic manufacturers that include several benefits like higher service levels  greater clarity on generic cost of goods sold  and a more consistent product supply with fewer disruptions 
Long term Supply Agreements Buoys Optimism  Cardinal Health is also pursuing growth via joint ventures and long term supply agreements with several firms  The company entered a long term strategic agreement with Henry Schein  NASDAQ HSIC  in 2014  under which the latter will purchase Cardinal Health s medical supplies for physician practices  The collaboration is expected to drive core sales and prove accretive to Cardinal Health s earnings in the long term  The signing of a 15 year agreement with Bayer  DE BAYGN  Healthcare for the contract manufacturing of Xofigo is significantly positive  In our opinion  this will help the company leverage its expertise in the nuclear pharmacy industry to expand access to a therapeutic agent and increase the use of radiopharmaceuticals in the U S  and Canada  The Red Oak Sourcing joint venture with CVS Health  NYSE CVS   which will negotiate generic pharmaceutical supply contracts on behalf of both companies  also holds significant long term prospects for Cardinal Health 
Good Client Retention  The performance of Cardinal Health s Pharmaceutical segment has been facilitated by good client retention  with the loss of only a few key customers  Walgreens and Express Scripts   Cardinal Health has already renewed many of its chain customer contracts for subsequent years  The concentration of suppliers has also been well managed by the company 
Strong Balance Sheet  Cardinal Health s strong balance sheet and cash flow enable it to pursue growth opportunities and accretive acquisitions  The company uses its cash flow to return value to investors in the form of dividends and share repurchases  In fiscal 2017  the company returned more than  1 2 billion to shareholders through stock repurchases and dividend payouts  Aggressive share buybacks will boost earnings as well as shareholders  value over the long run  In fiscal 2017  operating cash flow at the company was  1 2 billion  of which  387 million was deployed in capital expenditures 
Reasons to Sell 
Share price movement  Cardinal Health stock price has significantly underperformed thus far in 2017 
Probabilities of Loss of a Major Customer Worrisome  Collectively  5 of Cardinal Health s main customers  including CVS  accounted for as much as 40  of its revenues 
Group Purchasing Organizations  Cardinal Health derives a significant quantum of revenues through agreements with group purchasing organizations  GPO s   The company s largest GPO agents are Asembia  HealthTrust  Innovatix Intalere  Premier Purchasing Partners and 6 others  Loss of any of these agents with severely affect the company sells

Summary and Conclusions
Cardinal Health is a powerhouse in its respective industry  It is the second largest by market and third largest by revenues and one of three major pharmaceutical distributors in the US  Yes  it s true that the company   and in fact its entire industry   is currently out of favor with Mr  Market  Nevertheless  the following slide from Cardinal Health s recent annual meeting of shareholders on November 8  2017 summarizes the breadth and depth of Cardinal Health s business 

Although there is certainly a significant amount of perceived risks associated with investing in Cardinal Health or the pharmaceutical distribution industry in general  I believe that the risks are already reflected in the price  Cardinal Health is aware of the changing healthcare landscape and is taking steps to maintain their relevance and profitability  The following slide depicts Cardinal Health s commitment to shareholders and to continuing to support future growth 

In conclusion  I believe that Cardinal Health represents an intriguing investment opportunity given the state of today s stock market  The company and its entire industry are currently out of favor with the market  However  I contend that Cardinal Health s low valuation mitigates much of the risk associated with investing in it while simultaneously provides the opportunity for enhanced long term returns  Consequently  whether your investment objective is high current income and dividend growth or above  average total returns Cardinal Health might deserve a closer look

116022,337537,HSIC,Patterson Companies Dental Business Dull  Competition Rife,opinion,"On Nov 24  we issued an updated research report on Patterson Companies  Inc    NASDAQ PDCO    A rapidly changing healthcare environment in the United States  unfavorable price movements and a competitive dental products distribution industry pose significant challenges for Patterson Companies 
Patterson carries a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   The estimate revision trend for Patterson Companies has been unfavorable  For the current year  eight analysts moved south compared to no movement in the opposite direction over the last month  As a result  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for full year earnings fell to  2 09 from  2 29 
The company exited the second quarter on a tepid note recently  Further  a downbeat guidance and lackluster performance by the dental segment indicate looming concerns  In the quarter  dental sales  40  of total sales  declined 8 4  at cc year over year to approximately  553 6 million  The decline at the segment was caused by decreased sales of CEREC and digital technology products 

Management expects headwinds in the technology based equipment business to persist through fiscal 2018  adding to our concerns  Patterson s stock is slightly expensive at the moment  A comparative analysis of the company s forward P E  TTM basis  multiple reflects a relatively gloomy picture that might be a concern for investors 
Cutthroat competition in the U S  dental products distribution industry is a major dampener  Notably  Patterson faces serious competition from at least 15 full service distributors  that include Henry Schein  NASDAQ HSIC  Dental  a unit of Henry Schein  and numerous small and local distributors 
However  we are upbeat about the company s Animal Health segment that witnessed strong sales last quarter  Patterson provides a wide range of consumable supplies  equipment  software and value added services  The company s broad spectrum of products cushions it against economic downturns in the MedTech space  We believe a diversified product portfolio  strong veterinary business prospects  accretive acquisitions and strategic partnerships are key catalysts 
Patterson s price movement in the past three months has been disappointing  The company represented a negative return of almost 6 3   comparing unfavorably with the broader  s addition of around 5 2  
Key Picks
A few better ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PetMed Express  Inc    NASDAQ PETS    Myriad Genetics  Inc    NASDAQ MYGN   and Luminex Corp    NASDAQ LMNX    While PetMed and Myriad sport a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   Luminex carries a Zacks Rank  2  You can see

the closing bell Last quarter  the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 15 4   Moreover  Myriad Genetics beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters  the average being 6 2  Let s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement Key CatalystsSimilar to last quarter  Myriad Genetics is expected to gain from strong Molecular Diagnostics performance led by solid contributions from the GeneSight and EndoPredict tests  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Molecular Diagnostics revenues of  170 million reflects an increase of 3  from the year ago quarter We are also upbeat about management s expectations of double digit volume growth in fiscal 2018 for GeneSight  Vectra DA  Prolaris and EndoPredict revenues  all of which make up most of the Molecular Diagnostics portfolio  Myriad Genetics  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise     Per the company  the GeneSight test represents significant opportunities  As GeneSight is in the initial stages of adoption and is placed in a highly under penetrated preventive care market  the product has huge growth potential  Management expects consistent growth in GeneSight test revenues in the quarters ahead  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for GeneSight test of  26 1 million reflects an increase of 263 9  from the year ago quarter and 2 4  sequentially In March  the company  launched  the EndoPredict test in the United States for patients with early stage breast cancer and since then has received encouraging response for it  In August  Myriad Genetics received positive coverage decision for the test from Palmetto GBA  a Medicare Administrative Contractor  MAC  and Anthem  Inc   one of the largest private insurers in the United States  Notably  full implementation of this decision will lend Myriad Genetics coverage for approximately 90  of breast cancer patients The company recently announced positive results from a clinical study evaluating EndoPredict which highlights its superiority over the first generation Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score in predicting breast cancer recurrence in women determined to be at intermediate clinical risk by the Nottingham Prognostic Index  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for GeneSight test of  2 3 million reflects an increase of 35 3  from the year ago quarter Here are the other factors that might influence Myriad Genetics  first quarter results Management seemed upbeat about the prospects of the Prolaris test  In May  the company announced the receipt of a positive final Local Coverage Determination  LCD  to expand Medicare coverage of the Prolaris test by Palmetto GBA  a MAC Again  in May  the company announced plans of showcasing data demonstrating the utility of the Prolaristest in efficiently predicting the 10 year risk of metastases in men treated for prostate cancer at the American Urological Association  AUA  2017 Annual Meeting  These positive flow of news are expected to to boost the top line in the to be reported quarter  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Prolaris test revenues of  3 3 million reflects an increase of 13 8  from the year ago quarter Management estimates adjusted earnings per share of 19 21 cents on total revenue of  181  183 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2018   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for adjusted earnings of 21 cents and revenues of  182 million is within the company s guided range On the flip side  unfavorable foreign currency translation continues to pose a threat  With a considerable portion of its revenues coming from outside the United States  the company faces the risk of exchange rate fluctuations  Additionally  macroeconomic uncertainty and higher expenses owing to extensive pipeline of some testsmay impact the company s margins Here is what our quantitative model predicts Our proven model shows that Myriad Genetics is likely to beat earnings because it has the perfect combination of two key ingredients Zacks ESP   Myriad Genetics has an  of  1 04   A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks Rank  Myriad Genetics currently carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2 or 3  Hold  have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates Conversely

three of the preceding four quarters  with an average positive earnings surprise of 2 63   Let s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement Factors at PlayWalgreens Boots  Retail Pharmacy USA division continued to witness comparable prescription growth as well as strength in retail prescription market in the last reported quarter  Notably  in the fiscal second quarter  the Retail Pharmacy USA division saw the highest comparable prescription growth in more than seven years Several planned developments  early benefits of new pharmacy contracts and volume increase from previously announced strategic pharmacy partnerships have been driving growth in this space over the past few quarters  We expect this growth momentum to continue in the fiscal fourth quarter as well Walgreens Boots Alliance  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    Based on a promising performance in the preceding quarter  Walgreens Boots raised the low end of its guidance for fiscal 2017 by 8 cents and

year basis  Moreover  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal fourth quarter revenues of  30 09 billion reflects a 5 1  improvement on a year over year basis However  the sales performance of the Retail Pharmacy international division continued to disappoint  The reduction in government pharmacy funding in the U K  has been affecting performance  In absence of any near term catalyst  we expect the scenario to persist in the upcoming quarter as well We also note that slowdown in generic introduction has been affecting Walgreens Boots  margins  Of late  increased reimbursement pressures as well as generic drug cost inflation have been denting margins  In the third quarter of 2017  Walgreens Boots  gross margin contracted on account of reimbursement pressure and price inflation of branded drugs Management continues to witness lower profitability in Boots UK comparable pharmacy s gross profit due to lower margin products  Although the company is working to boost efficiency and provide high quality  cost effective pharmacy services  the near term outlook remains bleak Meanwhile  market growth is expected to be strong in certain emerging markets backed by the timing of price increase  Also  in order to expand its footprint in Asia  the company launched its first Boots franchise store in South Korea in April 2017  This development is expected to boost the top line in the fiscal fourth quarter In September 2017  Walgreens Boots announced the receipt of U S  Federal Trade Commission  FTC  approval for the purchase of 1 932 stores  three distribution centers and related inventory from Rite Aid for a total value of  4 375 billion  Post the new transaction s initial closing  synergies of  300 million are expected to be entirely realized within four years of its initial

Henry Schein  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise
 
   Factors at Play
Henry Schein s second quarter 2017 results were quite impressive  recording growth across all four segments   Dental  Animal Health  Medical and Technology and Value Added Services  Geographically  the company gained traction in both North America and overseas  We expect a similar trend in the third quarter as well 
The company s strategy to expand digital dentistry globally is also encouraging  We are also upbeat about management s expectations to witness at least low single digit growth in North America s dental consumable merchandise market in the second half of 2017  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third quarter total revenues of  3 049 billion reflects an increase of 6 4  from the year ago quarter 
The company is currently banking on digital dentistry  which is part of its strategic plan  Henry Schein is busy promoting digital workflows for general dentistry as well as dental specialties  Beginning Sep 1  2017  the company started selling the full range of Dentsply Sirona dental equipment across North America  including the leading CEREC CAD CAM restoration system  This is expected to boost the top line to some extent 
Notably  during the second quarter  Henry Schein Animal Health opened a new National Distribution Service Center  NDSC  in Columbus s Brookhollow neighborhood  This has helped the company operate as a complete solution provider for veterinary practices across the country  We expect this to boost the top line in the yet to be reported quarter 
On the flip side  Henry Schein s disappointing gross and operating margins over the past few quarters due to higher cost of sales and expenses is a matter of concern 
This apart  currency fluctuations and a tough competitive landscape add to the woes  Also  the entry of group purchasing organizations  GPOs  in the United States has intensified competition 
Overall  Henry Schein expects 2017 EPS in the range of  7 17  7 30  reflecting 8 10  growth from the 2016 EPS figure of  6 61

116130,337645,HSIC,Here s Why Investors Should Sell Patterson Companies Now,opinion,"Patterson Companies Inc    NASDAQ PDCO   has had a dismal run on the bourses of late  Year to date  the company has lost 8 8   underperforming the broader industry s gain of 15 3  
A rapidly changing healthcare environment in the United States  unfavorable price movement  a competitive dental products distribution industry and integration risks pose significant challenges for the company 
Political Qualms  The ongoing political conundrum pertaining to the repealing of Obamacare by the Republicans has given rise to uncertainties in the dental space  Last week  the MedTech space received a heavy blow with Trump s latest  Executive Order   where he pulled the plug on Obamacare subsidies that reduce net health care costs for Americans with low income again 
These legislations and regulations are expected to affect expenditures or reimbursements for dental services through private dental insurance plans  We believe this will mar Patterson s overall results in the quarters to come 
Dental Segment Lacks Luster  Patterson s dental segment contributes significantly to total revenue every year  42 7  of net revenues in fiscal 2017   However  decrease in sales of CEREC and other digital technology equipment is likely to mar revenues for dental consumables and dental equipment 
Furthermore  management at Patterson anticipates headwinds in technology equipment business to persist through fiscal 2018 as the company transitions to its new go to market strategy with an expanded technology product portfolio 
Declining Estimates  The estimate revision trend for Patterson has been unfavorable  For the full and next year  two analysts moved south compared to no movement in the opposite direction over the last two months 
As a result  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the full year inched down 0 9  to  2 29 per share  The next year earnings estimates dropped 1 2  to  2 48 per share  The stock has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  Patterson Companies  Inc  Price and Consensus
 

   Cutthroat Competition  The U S  dental products distribution industry is highly competitive and consists principally of national  regional and local full service and mail order distributors  Patterson faces competition from another national full service firm  Henry Schein Dental  a unit of Henry Schein   NASDAQ HSIC   
In addition  there are at least 15 full service distributors that operate on a regional level and hundreds of small local distributors  Patterson needs to continue to introduce products in the market to counter competition  Failure to do so will dent the company s market share 
Key Picks
A few better ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are SONOVA HOLDING   OTC SONVY   and Luminex Corp    NASDAQ LMNX    SONOVA and Luminex sport a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see  
SONOVA represented a solid return of 14 5  over the last year  The company has a long term expected earnings growth rate of 7

116136,337651,HSIC,What To Expect From Thermo Fisher  TMO  In Q3 Earnings,opinion,Medical instruments manufacturer  Thermo Fisher Scientific  Inc    NYSE TMO   is slated to release third quarter 2017 results on Oct 25  before the market opens Last quarter  the company posted earnings of  2 30 per share  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 3   In fact  Thermo Fisher s earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the past four quarters with an average beat of 2 3   Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement Key CatalystThe acquisition of FEI has already started generating synergies and largely contributing to this Waltham MA based company s analytical instruments portfolio from the last two quarters  The acquisition has enabled Thermo Fisher to access FEI s industry leading high performance electron microscopy platform used for protein study and facilitating life science research  This is also a vital highlight of the quarter to be reported Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc Price and EPS Surprise   Thermo Fisher anticipates realizing total synergies of approximately  80 million by the end of three years following the deal s closure with about  55 million of cost synergies and roughly  25 million of adjusted operating income benefits from revenue related synergies  This should get reflected in third quarter 2017 performance Overall  the company is gearing up for yet another quarter of strong analytical instruments segmental growth  In the third quarter  Thermo Fisher expects to see a positive impact from the electron microscopy business as well as strong volume leverage and productivity The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Analytical Instruments operating income is pegged at  233 million  in line with the sequentially last quarter s reported number  Total revenue estimate for this segment also remains at an impressive level of  1 11 billion Here are other factors that might influence Thermo Fisher s third quarter results The company s focus to boost growth through implementation of strategies and strengthening of its product offerings is encouraging  These initiatives are likely to help it post solid results in the third quarter The company had spent  750 million on research and development in 2016 and the same trend is continuing through the last couple of quarters in 2017  A major development in this field is that Novartis  chimeric antigen receptor T cell  CAR T  therapy Kymriah  the first FDA approved cell therapy for Leukemia  utilizes Thermo Fisher s CTS Dynabeads Technology We expect all innovations and product launches to significantly contribute to the company s top line in the third quarter itself The company s aim to expand capabilities in the fast growing Asia Pacific zone as well as the emerging markets should also lead to impressive results  Standout contributors in recent times are China  India and South Korea  With strategic investments to support key customer applications  Thermo Fisher hopes to maintain this bullish momentum for the rest of 2017 Growth is also likely to be seen in applied markets such as  environmental and food safeties apart from life science  In addition  the company is currently betting on some key areas under focus with enormous opportunities  These are advancing precision medicines from mass spectrometry to the targeted gene sequencing and structural biology  However  we are apprehensive about Thermo Fisher citing a foreign exchange headwind on 2017 revenues and adjusted EPS  Also  an unfavorable macroeconomic condition continues to weigh heavily on the stock  Plus  stiff competition continues to impose challenges on the stock s value Here s what our quantitative model predicts Thermo Fisher has the right combination

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including CVS Health  NYSE CVS   CVS   Marriott  MAR  and Enbridge  ENB   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
CVS Health shares have outperformed the Zacks categorized Drug Stores industry year to date losing  0 4  vs   4 4   CVS Health posted better than expected second quarter 2017 with both adjusted EPS and revenues beating expectations  Year over year top line growth was driven by a strong Pharmacy Services segment  benefiting from the upside in the Specialty Pharmacy 
The company s strong PBM selling season is a major positive  However  poor year over year Retail LTC numbers along with margin debacle resulted in a dull earnings performance by the company in the quarter  Despite an unimpressive bottom line scenario the company has raised the lower end of its earnings outlook for 2017 raising investors optimism  The Zacks analyst thinks the Omnicare and Target Pharmacy buyouts should drive enterprise value significantly in the days ahead 
 You can 
Shares of Marriott have outperformed the Zacks Hotels industry in the year to date period  the stock is up  25 7  vs   3 3  gain for the industry   Marriott s second quarter 2017 earnings beat expectations and increased year over year  Notably  with the purchase of Starwood  Marriott became the world s largest hotel company  In fact  the acquisition is likely to result in a bigger brand with increased scale and a robust development pipeline in the long run 
The Zacks analyst likes Marriott s rising North American business  sizeable international exposure and attractive brand position  Further  its investments in technology for hotel bookings will improve guest experience  which in turn should boost occupancy  Yet lingering political uncertainties in key international markets  oversupply in some regions and currency headwinds might continue to limit revenue growth  Integration risks linked to Starwood purchase is an added concern

Enbridge s shares have declined  1 9  over the last one year  significantly underperforming the Zacks Oil   Gas Production industry s gain of  5 7  during the aforesaid period  The company has the longest and most sophisticated crude and liquids pipeline system in the world that spreads over 17 511 miles 
The Zacks analyst likes the merger with Spectra Energy  F SEP  as it has made Enbridge the largest energy infrastructure company in North America in terms of enterprise value  Also  the transaction has given Enbridge the industry s largest backlog of growth projects  worth around C 75 billion  The company believes that this huge backlog will help it to grow its dividend by 10 12  annually from 2018 to 2024 
However  the company s substantial debt load is a matter of concern  Also  during second quarter 2017  Enbridge reported lower than expected results owing to higher operating expenses and accelerated maintenance work at the upstream operations of customers

116186,337701,HSIC,Stocks Today   Retail Sector Earnings Scorecard,opinion,"Thursday May 11  2017
Stocks started today s session in the red  on downbeat earnings results from Macy s  M  and Kohl s  KSS  and a hotter than expected wholesale inflation reading that adds to the likelihood of a Fed rate move at the June FOMC meeting  Tomorrow s CPI reading has assumed relatively more significance following this morning s PPI report 
Macy s and the broader department store space has been struggling for a while given their inability to adjust to the changing consumer spending landscape of growing online sales weighing on foot traffic in the brick and mortar facilities  Macy s results were a bit more disappointing this morning as it not only came out with a bigger than expected decline in same store sales but also missed consensus EPS and revenue estimates  Kohl s did better with respect to EPS and revenue results  on the back of disciplined inventory management  but same store sales missed the mark 
We provide the Q1 earnings season scorecard for the Retail sector below  but please note that this daily publication features the best research output of the Zacks analyst team  In today s write up  we are featuring analyst reports on 16 major stocks  including reports on NVIDIA Corp   NVDA   PNC Financial  PNC  and Anthem  ANTM   These reports have been hand picked from amongst the 70 or so stock research reports published by our analyst team today  You can see all of today s research reports 
Retail Sector Scorecard  as of Thursday  May 11th 
Including this morning s releases from Macy s and Kohl s  we now have Q1 results from 23 of the 42 retailers in the S P 500 index  for the index as whole  we now have results from 452 members   Total earnings for these 23 retailers are up  1 9  from the same period last year on  4 7  higher revenues  with 56 5  beating EPS estimates and an equal proportion beating revenue estimates 
Please note that we have a stand alone Retail sector  unlike the official Standard   Poor s placement of this space in the Consumer Discretionary sector  The Zacks Retail sector includes  besides the traditional department stores and other brick and mortar retailers  the online vendors like Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  and Priceline and restaurant operators  Most of the 23 Zacks Retail sector companies that have reported Q1 results already at this stage are online vendors and restaurant players  with the traditional retail operators starting the reporting process with this morning s Macy s disappointment 
The aggregate results from the 23 retailers that have reported Q1 results already are tracking below what we had seen from the same companies in other recent periods  This is despite the  41 1  growth in Amazon s earnings on  22 6  higher revenues  On an ex Amazon basis  the sector s Q1 earnings growth would be modestly in the negative

NVIDIA shares have surged following the strong quarterly report on Tuesday that eased some of the earlier worries about the company s exposure to a slowing gaming market  The stock was a standout performer last year  but was modestly in the red through the May 9th earnings release  But it is now up  18 3  since the start of the year following the market s enthusiastic reception to its earnings report  The Zacks analyst likes NVIDIA s innovative product pipeline and strength in gaming and high end notebook GPUs  The stock has had impressive run over the past year and the market s post earnings response indicates that the momentum likely has staying power   You can  
Shares of Buy rated PNC Financial outperformed the Zacks Regional Banks industry over the last six months gaining  13 3  vs   8 8   The Zacks analyst likes the company s efforts to generate positive operating leverage through its cost saving initiatives  Also  management projects revenues to rise at a mid single digit rate in 2017  aided by loan growth  Further  its deal to acquire the commercial and vendor finance business of ECN Capital is expected to be marginally accretive to earnings in 2017  On the flip side  the bank remains vulnerable to developments on the interest rate  which have stabilized lately  but still remain below the March level   You can  
Buy rated Anthem shares gained  25 3  year to date compared with the Zacks HMO industry s increase of  12 9   The company reported better than expected first quarter results with earnings surpassing expectations and increasing year over year  The Zacks analyst likes the company s diverse product portfolio  divestitures  prudent capital management  modest cash position  strategic acquisitions and ACO arrangements  Although its proposed merger with Cigna  NYSE CI  has been blocked  this month the company made another move to salvage the deal  However  high debt levels and a weak public exchange business pose risks for Anthem s future earnings   You can

116187,337702,HSIC,Henry Schein  HSIC  Rides On Global Growth  Strategic Deals ,opinion,"On May 25 2017  we issued an updated research report on Melville  NY based Henry Schein  Inc    NASDAQ HSIC    It is a leading distributor of health care products and services across the globe  The company currently carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  
Having delivered better than expected first quarter 2017 performance a month back  Henry Schein has consistently outperformed the S P 500 market at large with respect to share price movement  The stock is up 4 88   significantly above the 0 96  gain of the market 

 
We expect this bullish trend to continue in the ongoing quarter as well  Per last reported quarter  the company has delivered strong year over year growth in all of its four operating segments  Also Henry Schein s strong share gains in both North American and overseas markets along with solid revenues  further raise investors  optimism on the stock 
We are also encouraged by Henry Schein s growing distribution business  boasting a wide global footprint with 61 distribution centers  Apart from North America and Europe  it has presence in Australia and New Zealand as well as in the emerging nations like China  Brazil  Israel  Czech Republic and Poland being the latest 
In 2016  the company completed its majority buyout of the Poland based Dental Cremer  Its decision to acquire an 80  ownership of a Poland based dental distributor of Marrodent will also help it fortify its position in the emerging dental markets 
Also  Henry Schein might gain from several trends in its end markets  one of them being customer demographics  According to a recent estimation  between 2015 2025  the population aged 45 and above will likely grow approximately 12   This demographic trend is expected to boost the utilization of dental and medical products distributed by the company 
However a comparative study of Henry Schein s forward P E  F12M basis  multiple reflects that the stock is quite overvalued  The multiple currently stands at 23 9  stretched when compared to its own range  median of 23 4   Even when compared to the Zacks categorized Medical Dental Supplies industry  the comparison is unfavorable as the current P E  F12M basis  for the industry is 18 3 for the last one month 
It is also overvalued when compared with the S P 500 market of P E  F12M basis  multiple of 18 2  We believe the company s recent developments including several acquisitions and tie ups will keep the valuation stretched for sometime 
This apart  escalating costs and expenses continue to be a drag on the company s margins and put pressure on the bottom line  A tough competitive landscape and pricing pressure also weigh on Henry Schein s stock 
Key Picks
Some other well ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Luminex Corp    NASDAQ LMNX    Inogen  Inc    NASDAQ INGN   and Edwards Lifesciences Corp    NYSE EW    Notably  Luminex and Inogen sport a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   while Edwards Lifesciences carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see 
Luminex has an expected long term adjusted earnings growth of almost 16 3   The stock added roughly 6 8  over the last three months 
Inogen has long term expected earnings growth rate of 17 5   The stock has a solid one year return of around 81 7  
Edwards Lifesciences has an expected long term adjusted earnings growth of almost 15 6   The stock roughly added 14 8  over last year

2016  up 8 4  year over year  Adjusted EPS also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 65  The year over year earnings improvement was driven by strong revenue growth in the quarter Including one time adjustments  Henry Schein s reported net income in the third quarter was  133 7 million or  1 63 per share  reflecting year over year growth of 4 7  and 7 2   respectively Revenues in DetailHenry Schein reported revenues of  2 865 billion in the third quarter  up 6 7  year over year but almost in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  The year over year improvement came on the back of 7 7  growth in local currencies  with a 6  and 1 7  rise in internal sales and acquisitions  respectively  However  unfavorable foreign currency exchange accounted for a decline of 1  in overall revenue growth HENRY SCHEIN IN Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Region wise  Henry Schein experienced 7 3  year over year sales growth in the North American market  while sales in the international market improved 5 2  Segment Analysis     Henry Schein derives revenues from four operating segments  Dental  Medical  Animal Health  and Technology and Value added services In the third quarter  the company derived  1 3 billion in revenues from global Dental sales  up 5 1  year over year  including local currency growth of 5 6  and a 0 5  decline owing to unfavorable foreign exchange   Local currency growth comprised acquisition growth of 1 7  and internal sales growth of 3 9   The company s decision to stop selling low margin precious metals earlier this year negatively impacted growth by approximately 50 basis points  bps   According to the company  while the domestic dental consumable merchandise market continued to reflect slower than historical growth  it appears to be stable The company s global Animal Health segment witnessed a 7 9  improvement in revenues to  790 3 million  including local currency growth of 10 6  and a 2 7  decline related to foreign exchange headwind   The local currency growth included 8 6  growth in internal sales and 2  acquisition growth Worldwide Medical sales scaled up 7 1  year over year to  639 6 million based on local currency growth of 7 1   Foreign currency exchange had no impact on this segment s revenue growth in the third quarter  Revenues from global Technology and Value added Services grew 16 7  to  104 7 million  This included an 18 3  rise in local currencies  with acquisition growth of 10 7  and internal sales improvement of 7 6   However  revenues at this segment declined 1 6  due to unfavorable foreign currency Margin Trends          Gross profit increased 5 4  to  789 5 million in the reported quarter  However  gross margin declined 33 bps from the year ago quarter to 27 6   due to a 7 1  rise in cost of sales  higher than the revenue growth rate   Backed by a 5 8  rise in selling  general   administrative expenses to  583 4 million  adjusted operating income improved 4 4  year over year to  206 1 million  However  adjusted operating margin declined 15 bps to 7 2  in the reported quarter Financial PositionHenry Schein exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  76 1 million  compared with  63 6 million at the end of second quarter 2016  Year to date net cash flow from operating activities was  350 9 million  compared to the year ago equivalent of  288 5 million  During the quarter under review  the company bought back approximately 1 2 million shares for  193 million  On Oct 19  2016  Henry Schein announced that its board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  400 million of shares  This program is in addition to the  400 million repurchase program announced in Dec 2015 GuidanceHenry Schein reiterated its adjusted EPS guidance for 2016  The company still expects to deliver adjusted EPS in the range of  6 55  6 60  reflecting 10 11  year over year growth  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2016 is  6 57  within the company s guided range  The company also expects current restructuring activities to be completed in 2016 Management also provided its full year 2017 EPS guidance  The company expects EPS in the band of  7 17  7 30  reflecting annualized growth of 9  11  Our TakeHenry Schein ended the third quarter of 2016 on a mixed note with earnings handily beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate and revenues in line with the mark  The company s strong share gains in both the North American and overseas markets along with the strong revenues raise optimism However  despite each segment posting strong sales growth  we are disappointed with respect to the company s EPS guidance for 2016 which remained unchanged  The year over year deterioration in Henry Schein s gross and operating margin stemming from higher cost of sales and expenses also concerns us  Meanwhile  foreign currency fluctuations continued to hamper the company s business Zacks Rank   Key PicksHenry Schein currently holds a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Other

116289,337804,HSIC,The Only Way You Should Be Investing In Stocks Right Now,opinion,What the heck is going on with this market  On two occasions this week  the major indexes opened sharply lower and then clawed back higher as the trading session wore on  From hour to hour  the bears    who fear a spreading European contagion  and the market bulls    who ve been digesting solid recent quarterly profits  are wrestling for control of the market My take  the risks that could trigger a market pullback remain formidable  and I don t want to touch stocks that don t have some form of downside protection  This protection can come in many forms  from a bulletproof balance sheet to a history of solid  recurring cash flow I also like companies that are prepared to defend their stock  The companies I discuss below have recently announced major stock buyback plans  and in a market slump  they d be active buyers at a time when few friends can be found  Just as important  any market swoon that does impact these stocks will mean more bang for the buyback buck  In some instances  they may have a chance to sharply lower the number of shares outstanding  which would set the stage for solidly higher earnings per share  EPS  in the future I ve compiled a list of 19 companies that have made buyback announcements since the second quarter began  And their reasons to pursue a buyback now are numerous  Getting to the heart of why they are buying back shares is the key behind seeing if they represent real value Not for me    As a personal rule of thumb  I never like companies that look to buyback shares unless the forward P E  price to earnings  ratio is well below the market average  The only exception  if the near term P E ratios fail to represent what kind of earnings power a company can eventually have    Biotech firm Biogen Idec  Nasdaq  BIIB  and dental supplies distributor Henry Schein  Nasdaq  HSIC  aren t trying to bring attention to a lagging stock    each trades near its 52 week high  Instead  they simply don t know what to do with their excess cash  I think these companies would be far better off holding tight    let cash build higher and buy back shares some time down the road when they ve fallen sharply from their highs    A previous favoriteHecla Mining  NYSE  HL  is a different story   I ve recently written quite a bit about this silver miner  As   if the company can keep its promise that a major shuttered mine will come back online in about eight months  then 2013 results will be far better  The company is using roughly one third of its  280 million cash balance to buy back stock now  in anticipation of a better outlook  and a higher stock price  in the future      The long slog back to relevance  In a similar vein  health care information provider Allscripts  Nasdaq  MDRX  is currently suffering from a botched merger    Allscripts  troubles means earnings per share  EPS  are constrained  likely staying below  1 this year and next  Yet if management can make the right moves to fix the business and return margins to historical levels  then EPS could move sharply higher  In the interim  the  200 million stock buyback can be used to aggressively re absorb shares while they remain deeply out of favor  And this isn t a one time move  In fact  there is already another  200 million buyback plan in place    and even after that  400 million total is earmarked  Allscripts still has  350 million available for future buybacks    So why should investors expect profits to eventually move higher  It s because the current numbers are being impacted by a series of controllable factors that can be fixed  Allscripts  expenses have spiraled too high as management never made a big cost cutting push after the company s mishandled merger with hospital information systems provider Eclipsys    Indeed  the recent moves to bring in fresh management and a new chairman will likely lead to those cost cutting measures investors had already expected to see  As analysts at Auriga Securities note   the problems at Allscripts stem from the top  and we wouldn t be surprised to see further leadership turnover   That creates uncertainty right now  and shares may languish until the new team is fully in place and investors hear more about their turnaround strategies    Yet Auriga s analysts  even as they rate shares a  hold   have a  14 target price  nearly 30  above current levels  And that target is based on very low expectations  by their math  shares are worth more than 15 times the downwardly revised 2012 EPS of  0 90  15 x  0 90    13 50   That multiple currently stands at 12  To put that in perspective  rival Cerner  Nasdaq  CERN  trades for around 35 times projected 2012 profits  Both of these companies operate in the same high growth industry  And Cerner surely deserves a premium for better execution  but should Cerner s P E multiple be higher by a factor of three  If anything  Cerner is operating at peak levels and has little fat to cut  Allscripts s profit potential is more robust  simply because it is currently too bloated and also has room for improvement in terms of salesforce execution    This isn t an endorsement for Allscripts right now  though  Instead  it s a chance for you to really come to understand this business model while it s deeply out of favor    and then buy when you think the time is right  Just a few months ago  investors were looking at Allscripts as a decent company in a really attractive business  After a deep fix  that will likely again be the investor sentiment several quarters from now    Risks to Consider  Buybacks don t prevent stocks from falling    they just cushion the blow against even deeper falls  Share count bloat is one of the key factors behind disappointing EPS growth  Conversely  falling share counts can make a tepid growth story look like much better  That s why these stocks are often a fertile area for investment ideas  Aside from Allscripts  any of the stocks in the list above should give you a good head start on your research  BY David

Guidance
Henry Schein reaffirmed its adjusted EPS guidance for 2016  The company continues to project adjusted EPS at  6 55  6 65  reflecting 10  12  year over year growth  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2016 is  6 62  within the company s guided range 
Our Take
Henry Schein kick started 2016 on an impressive note  with its first quarter top and bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate  The company s strong share gains in both North American and overseas markets along with the record revenues raise optimism  This in turn drove the robust double digit growth in the company s adjusted EPS figure 
However  we remain on the sidelines with respect to the company s unchanged adjusted EPS guidance for 2016 despite each segments posting strong sales growth  The year over year deterioration in Henry Schein s gross margin figure also disappoints us  Meanwhile  foreign currency fluctuations continued to hamper the company s business 
Nevertheless  the recent acquisitions of VetStreet and RxWorks add to the company s strength  These efforts reflect the company s strong cash balance and its ability to finance buyout deals  We expect these investments to not only enhance the company s geographic presence but also boost its business

116292,337807,HSIC,Trading Opportunity  Henry Schein Rally Shows No Signs Of Stopping,opinion,"Along with many other stocks  it took Henry Schein  NASDAQ HSIC  three months to lose half of its value in the last financial crisis at the end of 2008  But unlike many other stocks  Henry Schein used this situation to kick off a huge rally   that is still going on 
In the beginning of 2013  the stock managed to break out of the sideways range that had lasted longer than a decade  With this breakout  the stock once more gained momentum and started to move from new high to new high 
In the actual situation it is very likely that the price will sky rocket above the more than six year old uptrend channel  On a long term view  these breakouts normally fall back into the old channel  but as a short term trading opportunity traders could benefit from the increasing momentum with long positions 
On the daily chart it is easy to see that on Thursday the price broke out from the last sideways range above the upper border line  and the price kept on moving strongly in the trend direction  The retest of the upper border of the sideways range already took place on Friday  Another indication for a continuation of the uptrend is that the correction in the beginning of the week was not able to make new lows  even though it took place with unusual big volume 
A new high above Thursday s daily high could be used for a long entry with a tight stop  A stop at 172 00 lies under the last strong momentum candle  under the last relative low on the daily chart as well as under the upwards trend line from this year 
If the market opens lower on Monday an entry at a price around 174 00 is also possible  but then you should use a larger stop at 168 80  which is below the last relative low on the weekly chart  Through the projection of the last sideways range  the expected target is 184 50
