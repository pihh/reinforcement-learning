3866,225381,CMS,Stocks   S P Closes Near All Time High as Buoyant Banks Fuel Rally,news,"Investing com   The S P 500 closed near record highs on Wednesday  led by a rally in bank shares on surging bond yields  while fears about an escalating trade war between the U S  and China eased 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about 0 61   The S P 500 rose 0 13   while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0 08

Rising Treasury yields are seen as boon for banks  boosting their net interest margin  the difference between the interest income generated by banks and the amount of interest paid out to their lenders

3868,225383,CMS,Top Picks 2019  CMS Energy Corp  CMS,news,"The electric utility business at CMS Energy Corp   NYSE CMS  provides a stable earnings stream supported by continued capital investment  notes Argus Research analyst Jacob Kilstein 
Over the last fifteen years  EPS has grown at an above peer average rate of 7   Management continues to project annual EPS growth of 6  8    better than the average of 5  7  for most utilities 
The company benefits from a favorable location in Michigan  with a rising population  a high proportion of skilled labor  a business friendly regulatory environment  and relatively low exposure to severe weather events 
We believe that the company s consistent  above average growth more than offsets concerns about the stock s high valuation or the negative impact of rising interest rates 
The shares trade at 20 5 times our 2019 EPS forecast  above the peer median of 18 8 for electric and gas utilities with fully regulated operations 
Our  56 target implies a P E of 22 4  which we feel is appropriate given the company s consistent above average performance  Our 12 month target price is  56 per share

3869,225384,CMS,CMS Energy  CMS  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"CMS Energy  CMS  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on October 24  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This energy company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 74 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  25 4  
Revenues are expected to be  1 65 billion  up 3 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 4 45  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for CMS Energy 
For CMS Energy  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  10 20  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that CMS Energy will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that CMS Energy would post earnings of  0 44 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 33  delivering a surprise of  25  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
CMS Energy doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cms-energy-cms-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200474667,200474667

Participants  Prepared Remarks   OperatorGood morning  everyone  and welcome to the CMS Energy 2019 fourth quarter results  The earnings news release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on CMS Energy s website in the investor relations section  This call is being recorded   Operator instructions  Just a reminder  there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call today beginning at 12 00 p m  Eastern Time running through February 6th  This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy s website in the investor relations section   At this time  I would like to turn the call over to Mr  Sri Maddipati  vice president of treasury and investor relations  Please  go ahead  Sri Maddipati    Vice President of Treasury and Investor Relations Good morning  everyone  and thank you for joining us today  With me are Patti Poppe  president and chief executive officer  and Rejji Hayes  executive vice president and chief financial officer  This presentation contains forward looking statements  which are subject to risks and uncertainties  Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially  This presentation also includes non GAAP measures  Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix and posted on our website  Now I ll turn the call over to Patti  Patti Poppe    President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks  Sri  Thank you  everyone  for joining us on our year end earnings call  This morning  I ll share our financial results for 2019 and our 2020 outlook  I ll discuss the roll forward of our five year capital plan and provide an update on key regulatory matters  Rejji will add more details on our financial results  as well as a look ahead to 2020 and beyond  And of course  we look forward to the Q A   For 2019  I m excited to report adjusted earnings of  2 49 per share  We were able to achieve another year of adjusted 7  EPS growth  despite record storms and a variety of headwinds throughout the year  Thanks to our unique operational capabilities that enable us to adapt to changing conditions by managing the work and driving out costs through our lean operating system  the CE way  For 2019 results in the books  we re raising the lower end of our 2020 adjusted EPS guidance from  2 63 to  2 64  giving us a range of  2 64 to  2 68  with a bias to the midpoint  which is up 6 to 8  from the actual result we achieved in 2019  As we roll our plan forward one year  it reflects an additional  0 5 billion in our five year capital plan at the utility  which supports our long term annual adjusted EPS and dividend growth of 6  to 8   and is in line with our previously announced 10 year  25 billion customer investment plan  While there s been a lot of recent discussion around ESG  it s a topic that is not new to us  Our continued success at CMS is driven by our commitment to deliver on the triple bottom line of people  planet and profit  We don t trade one for the other  So while 2019 marked our 17th year of industry leading EPS growth  it was also a remarkable year for our commitment to people  our customers and coworkers and our planet  Our customers awarded us our highest J D  Power customer satisfaction scores ever  and named us No 1 in the Midwest for residential gas  Those satisfied customers were served by a highly engaged and diverse workforce  Our accomplishments on the planet include reaching a settlement in our integrated resource plan  the announcement of our net zero methane emissions goal by 2030 for our gas delivery system and restoring over 1 500 acres of land in our home state  Our ability to meet our triple bottom line is underpinned by world class performance  and we delivered our best ever customer on time delivery metrics  eliminated more than  20 million of waste through the implementation of the CE way  settled our electric rate case for only the second time in our history  and received a gas rate case order that allows us to invest significantly in the safety and reliability of our large and aging gas system  Although 2019 has been another excellent year of solid performance and record achievements  we are still dissatisfied  We ll continue to keep improving as we work to deliver our financial and operational commitments year after year  Now  every year  you ll see the ups and downs that come our way  as illustrated on Slide 6  And every year  our unique capability of adapting to changing conditions enables us to deliver the results you expect  year in and year out  In 2019  we were met with challenge after challenge as storm restoration costs  surpassed our full  year budget to six months into the year  But we don t make excuses for storms or other weather related impacts on revenue  This is what I love about our model  where we ride the roller coaster for you  so you can enjoy the smooth and predictable outcome highlighted by the green line  This model has served our customers and view over the last decade plus  and we ll continue to utilize it going forward  I feel compelled to give a shout out to the entire CMS Energy team for the tenacity and the agility they demonstrated in 2019  Given the headwinds we faced and challenges we overcame  I could not be more proud of the results and thankful for the efforts of my co workers  Like we do every year  we re celebrating on the run and moving on to our next set of priorities and setting new goals  With 2019 behind us and as we prepare to deliver in 2020  we ll continue to make progress on ensuring the safety of our gas system  driving customer satisfaction and delivering on our clean energy plan  The goals we ve set for ourselves in 2020 are ambitious  And as always  they re fueled by the continuing maturity of our lean operating system  the CE way  Our ability to execute on our capital plan and make the investments our system needs will depend on our ability to see and eliminate waste  wherever it is  As we continue to mature in the CE way  we are creating a culture  where all of our co workers are both motivated and able to fulfill our purpose  World class performance  delivering hometown service  These simple words mean a lot to us  Our systems capital demands at the utility continued to grow  And to that end  we re rolling our capital plan forward an additional year  which will increase the spend over the next five years to about  12 25 billion and supports rate base growth of 7  over that period  This increase reflects the continued ramp up in annual capital investments in our electric and gas infrastructure to improve the safety and reliability of our systems  as well as increased investments in solar generation assets agreed to in our IRP  which was approved by the commission last year  It s worth noting that only about 15  of these projects over the next five years are above  200 million  and about 75  of those projects are addressed in multiyear commission orders such as the IRP  which mitigates risk and provides more certainty around execution and regulatory outcomes  We ll also remind you that our five year customer investment plan is limited  not by the needs of our system as that stretches vast and wide across the great state of Michigan  but instead  by balance sheet constraints  workforce capacity and customer affordability  Looking now toward regulatory matters  With the 2016 energy loss fully implemented  and with the benefits of tax reform addressed in recent commission orders  Our regulatory calendar for 2020 is much lighter than in recent years  Last year  we agreed to stay out of an electric rate case and the strategy served us well as we were able to capitalize on some of the cost performance efforts by leveraging the CE way  Now we ll have the opportunity to funnel some of those cost savings back to our customers and offset some of the capital investment need  Coupled with our efforts to ramp our energy efficiency savings to 2  by 2021  we ll keep customers  bills affordable  We anticipate filing our next electric rate case by the end of this quarter  In December 2019  we filed a request in our gas rate case for  245 million of incremental revenue  including a 10 5  ROE and an equity ratio of 52 5  relative to debt  as we continue to focus on the safety and reliability of our gas delivery system  This case builds on the order in our last gas case  where nearly all of the capital investments were approved because you would expect the needs of our system haven t changed that much in just one year  In conjunction with our gas case  we also filed our 10 year natural gas delivery plan  which provides a detailed look into the long term needs of our gas delivery system and supports our 10 year capital plan  We re thankful for the constructive regulatory environment in Michigan that allows for timely rate orders and forward planning  And the commission s commitment to working with us to continuously improve the safety and reliability of our system  I ll remind you  regardless of changing conditions around us  our triple bottom line and simple business model have served our customers and investors well and allows us to perform consistently year in and year out  As highlighted on Slide 10  our track record demonstrates our ability to deliver the consistent premium results you ve come to expect year after year after year  And this year  you can expect the same  With that  I ll turn the call over to Rejji  Rejji Hayes    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Thank you  Patti  and good morning  everyone  Before I get into the details  I d like to share the wonderful news that Travis Uphaus from our IR team and his wife  Maryland  welcome their seventh child  Mara Christine Uphaus on Tuesday morning  So we are wishing the Uphaus family our very best from our headquarters in Jackson  Michigan  As Patti highlighted  we re pleased to report our 2019 adjusted net income of  708 million with  2 49 per share  up 7  year over year  Our adjusted EPS excludes select non recurring items  including estimated severance and retention costs for our co workers at our corn coal facilities  which is scheduled to be retired in 2023  as well as the recognition of an expense related to the potential settlement of legacy legal matters  2019 results of the utility were largely driven by constructive outcomes from our electric rate case settlement in January of 2019  and the gas rate order we received in September  which were partially offset by heavy storm activity  particularly in the first three quarters of the year  Our non utility segments beat guidance by  0 02 in aggregate  largely due to low cost financings at CMS energy and solid performance from Enerbank  As we review our full suite of financial and customer affordability targets for 2019 on Slide 12  you ll note that in addition to achieving 7  annual adjusted EPS growth  we grew our dividend commensurately and generated approximately  1 8 billion of operating cash flow  Our steady cash flow generation and conservative financing strategy over the years  continue to fortify our balance sheet  as evidenced by our strong FFO to debt ratio  which is approximately 17 5  at year end and required no equity issuances in 2019  Lastly  in accordance with our self funding model  we effectively met our customer affordability targets by keeping bills at or below inflation for both the gas and electric businesses  all while investing a record level of capital of approximately  2 3 billion at the utility  Moving on to 2020  As Patti noted  we are raising our 2020 adjusted earnings guidance from  2 64 to  2 68 per share  which implies 6  to 8  annual growth off of our 2019 actuals  Unsurprisingly  we expect utility to drive the vast majority of our consolidated financial performance  with the usual steady contribution from the non utility business segments  One item to note is that enterprises EPS guidance is slightly down from their 2019 results  given the absence of a gain on the sale of select assets in the second quarter of 2019  All in  we ll continue to target the midpoint of our consolidated EPS growth range at year end  To elaborate on the glide path to achieve our 2020 EPS guidance range as you ll note on the waterfall chart on Slide 14  we plan for normal weather  which in this case amounts to an estimated  0 06 of negative variance    negative year over year variance  given the cold of the normal weather experienced in 2019 to the benefit of our gas business  We anticipate that cost reduction initiatives  largely driven by this EU wave  and other expected sources of year over year favorability such as lower storm restoration expenses after an unprecedented level of storm activity last year  will fully offset the absence of favorable weather in 2019  It is also worth noting that we capitalize on an opportunity to fully fund our defined benefit pension plan earlier this month  which provides additional non operating cost savings and EPS risk mitigation  Moving on to rate relief  We anticipate approximately  0 17 of EPS pickup in 2020  As mentioned during our Q3 call  about two thirds of this pickup has already been approved by the commission in the gas rate order we received in September  And the approval of our renewable energy plan in the first quarter of 2019  We ll expect the final order in our pending gas case in October of this year  which effectively makes up the balance of our expected rate relief  driven EPS contribution in 2020  While we plan to file an electric case in Q1 of this year  the test year for that case will start in 2021  Lastly  we apply our usual conservative assumptions around sales  financings  and other variables  As always  we ll adapt to new conditions and circumstances throughout the year to mitigate risk  and increase the likelihood of meeting our financial and operational objectives to the benefit of customers and investors   As we work toward delivering our 2020 EPS target  we remain focused on cost reduction opportunities within our entire 5 5 billion cost structure  the core components of which are illustrated on Slide 15  For well over a decade  we have managed to achieve planned and unplanned cost savings to mitigate intra year risk  and create long term headroom in our electric and gas bills to support our substantial customer investments at the utility  As we look to 2020 and beyond  we continue to believe there are numerous cost reduction opportunities throughout our cost structure  These opportunities include  but are not limited to  the expiration of high priced PPAS  the retirement of our coal fleet  capital enabled savings as we modernize our electric and gas distribution systems  and the continued maturation of our lean operating system  the CE way  These opportunities will provide sources of intra year risk mitigation  as well as a sustainable funding strategy for our long term customer investment plan  which will keep customer s bills low on an absolute basis  and relative to other household staples in Michigan  as depicted in the chart on the right hand side of the page  Moving on to weather normalized sales  As we ve discussed in the past  economic conditions in Michigan remain positive  particularly in our electric service territory  which is anchored by Grand Rapids  one of the fastest growing cities in the country  as evidenced by the statistics on the upper left hand corner of Slide 16  And when it comes to Michigan s economy  we re not passive participants  In fact  in addition to directly investing billions of dollars throughout the state annually  we collaborate with key stakeholders across the state to drive industrial activity through our economic development efforts  These efforts have attracted nearly 300 megawatts of new electric load in our service territory since 2016  and in 2019 alone  the contracts we signed will support over 3 600 jobs  and bring in more than  1 5 billion of investment to Michigan  A prosperous Michigan  supported by our economic development efforts  offers multiple benefits to our business model  In the near term  it drives volumetric sales  which support our financial objectives  and the longer term  it creates headroom in customer bills by reducing our rates  As mentioned in the past  we also continue to see the positive spillover effects of that industrial activity on our higher margin residential and commercial segments over time in the form of steady customer count growth and favorable load trends  As you will note in the chart on the right hand side of the slide  we ve seen average residential load growth of one percent and one and a half percent for the electric and gas businesses respectively over the past five years when normalized for weather and our energy efficiency programs  To summarize  our financial and customer affordability targets for 2020 and beyond  we expect another solid year of 6 to 8  adjusted EPS growth  solid operating cash flow growth  exclusive of the aforementioned discretionary pension contribution  and customer prices at or below inflation  From a balance sheet perspective  we continue to target solid investment grade credit metrics  and as you ll note  our equity needs are approximately  250 million in 2020  due to the previously noted deferral of our equity issuance needs in 2019  We expect our equity needs to be roughly  150 million per year in 2021 and beyond  which can be completed through our ATM equity issuance program  which we ll likely file along with our shelf during the first half of this year  Our model has served our stakeholders well in the past  as customers receive safe  reliable  and clean electric and gas  and affordable prices  and our investors benefit from consistent industry leading financial performance  On Slide  18  we ve refreshed our sensitivity analysis on key variables for your modeling assumptions  As you ll note  with reasonable planning assumptions and robust risk mitigation  the probability of large variances from our plan are minimized  There will always be sources of volatility in this business  be they weather  fuel costs  regulatory outcomes  or otherwise  And every year  we view it as our mandate to do the warning for you and mitigate the risk accordingly  And with that  I ll hand it back to Patti for her concluding remarks before Q A Patti Poppe    President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you  Rejji  Our investment thesis is compelling  and we ll serve our customers  our planet and our investors for years to come  And with that  Chad  would you please open the line for Q A  Questions   Answers  OperatorCertainly  thank you very much  Patti   Operator instructions The first question will come from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI  Please go ahead  Greg Gordon    Evercore ISI    Analyst Hey  Good morning  Patti  Rejji  Patti Poppe    President and Chief Executive Officer Good morning  Greg Rejji Hayes    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Good morning  Greg  Greg Gordon    Evercore ISI    Analyst A couple of questions on the year  So did you    Rejji  did you say that that small asset sale gain from enterprises was in the second quarter  is that correct  Rejji Hayes    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer That s right  Greg Gordon    Evercore ISI    Analyst Can you just give us a little more description of what asset it was and what you saw and the rationale for that Rejji Hayes    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Absolutely  Absolutely  So enterprises specifically dig  add some transmission related assets  So the informal parlance is switchyard assets  which they sold to ITC transmission in the second quarter  And so  we booked a gain of roughly  16 million  or  0 04 in Q2  That was part of our plan throughout the year  which is why you ll see sort of an aberrant trend between our  19 actuals and what we anticipate for 2020  Greg Gordon    Evercore ISI    Analyst Understood  I may be wrong  but I think you re breaking Enerbank out separately now for the first time  I m happy to get the incremental disclosure  but can you just give us the rationale for that  and then  I have one more question  Rejji Hayes    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yeah happy to  So Enerbank this year  and they had a wonderful year  as Patti noted  they hit about 2 6  a little over 2 6 billion in assets  which is in excess of 10  of our consolidated asset threshold  and so we chose to report out the segment at this point  Greg Gordon    Evercore ISI    Analyst Great  My final question is the decision to fund the pension  How much sort of in dollars did you top off the pension  and can we think about the financial benefit of that being sort of the delta between the financing costs and the expected pension return Rejji Hayes    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yeah so starting with your last question first  yes  we did take into account  and you should assume that the EPS related pickup is net of the funding costs  and so  we anticipate about  0 05 of earnings per share upside attributable to that  The amount    and you ll see this in the appendix  is a little over  530 million  and so  that allowed us to fully fund our inactive defined benefit plan  Greg Gordon    Evercore ISI    Analyst And that was funded from a parent infusion  or from off of the actual operating company balance sheet  Rejji Hayes    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer The latter  So we did a term loan in the interim at consumer s energy  And it s interesting  The term loan funding of that was about  300 million  We actually had a little bit of excess cash flow that we allotted us to fund it with a bit of excess cash  which also helped the EPS accretion attributable to that  Greg Gordon    Evercore ISI    Analyst OK  Thank you all very much  Have a great morning  Rejji Hayes    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Thank you  Greg Patti Poppe    President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks  Greg  OperatorThe next question comes from Julien Dumoulin Smith with Bank of America  Please go ahead Julien Dumoulin Smith    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    Analyst Hey  good morning to you  Patti Poppe    President and Chief Executive Officer Good morning  Julien  Julien Dumoulin Smith    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    Analyst Hey  So perhaps  just kicking off  first  as usual  we re focused on the capex and the upward trend  and nicely done on the upper half billion increase here as you roll forward  Can you talk a little bit about the upside trajectory  I suppose  if you take that half billion dollars as just kind of the latest single year in isolation roll forward  and you continue to use that  you end up somewhat in excess of your kind of 10 year plan  So obviously  you ve talked about this a little bit  but perhaps  this might be an opportunity to elaborate a little bit  And then  I ll start with your second question at the same time  DTE had some pushback on their latest process on procurement in their IRP  Any reasons with respect to your ongoing efforts on the renewable side  specifically  I just want to clarify that  Patti Poppe    President and Chief Executive Officer Well  I ll take the first part  and I ll let Raj take the second part  Julien  The capital plan  the  25 billion capital plan  does have fluctuations year to year some  and you ll see we ve got a five year look in the appendix of the deck so you can see what the plan is by year  And we do have some opportunities in that 25 billion  and we talked about that after the third quarter  you know  There s certainly demand for additional spend on electric reliability  and grid modernization  and our gas business  and as always  we re working to balance the competing demands for capital internally  having our internal capital battles  if you will  But also making sure that our bills remain affordable  making sure that the capacity to do the work is possible so that we have good credibility with our regulators that we do what we said we re going to do  And so the upside that you see in this first five year forward adding additional year is the natural fluctuation  but it all supports the  25 billion plan  and that supports our 6 to 8  growth trajectory  Rejji Hayes    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yes  Julien  you also just asked about what could allow us to  I think if I heard you correctly  just dip into those upside opportunities  And as Patti and I have talked about in the past  the constraints are  primarily  you know  customer affordability  and so  that is the primary constraint on whether we ll be able to dip into those upside opportunities of 3 to 4 billion in that 10 year plan  as well as balance sheet constraints and  potentially  workforce capacity  And so  over time  as all of those potentially move favorably  we ll consider recalibrating  but for now  that s where the plan sits  Now  getting to your second question related to  if I heard you correctly  again  the feed wasn t all that good  but it sounded like a potential reaction to  I think  the ALJ s decision and DTE s integrated research plan  Needless to say  we re not going to speak for DTE on their regulatory filings  but if you re asking whether that has an impact on our IRP and the execution of our IRP  The answer to that is  no  we obviously  just concluded the RFP  Well  first  we got approval for IRP in mid last year  and we just concluded in September or deep into Q4 the request for proposal for the first tranche of 300 megawatts of solar  and this is part of a longer term effort to really build out solar generating assets to the tune of six gigawatts by 2040  And this first tranche of  call it  1 1 gigawatts that were approved in the settlement  we just did about 300 megawatts this year  we ll do another 300 megawatts in RFP in September this year  and the balance of 500 megawatts in 2021  half of which will be rate base  half of which will be PPA  And so  we re in execution mode  and obviously  we ll look to file a new IRP in June of 21 for the settlements  So where    that s where we stand on that  Julien Dumoulin Smith    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    Analyst All right  Excellent  I ll leave it there  Thank you all  Best of luck  Patti Poppe    President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks  Julien  Rejji Hayes    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Thank you OperatorThe next question will be from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse  Please go ahead  Michael Weinstein    Credit Suisse    Analyst Hi  Good morning  guys  Patti Poppe    President and Chief Executive Officer Good morning  Michael  Michael Weinstein    Credit Suisse    Analyst I just wanted to confirm that the extra 500 million of capital spending that s planned for the next five years is not part of the 3 to 4 billion of upside opportunities  right  because the total 10 year plan didn t really change that much  Patti Poppe    President and Chief Executive Officer That s right  Michael  You ve got that right  This is just the one year roll forward  so it shows the modification in the plan  Michael Weinstein    Credit Suisse    Analyst Got it  So this is    is it an acceleration of spending that you would ve done in the second five years of that 10 year plan  basically  Patti Poppe    President and Chief Executive Officer No  It s right in line with our plan  It adds some additional  the IRP solar that was approved  as well as some additional electric reliability  and really  the    you can plan on fluctuation between the gas  the electric  the renewable parts of the spend as the years go forward  so that we can optimize that capital spend to the benefit of customers  and again  mitigating the challenges that Rejji articulated around affordability  balance sheet  We re always just working the plan to have the highest value capital year after year  Michael Weinstein    Credit Suisse    Analyst Right  And also  I wanted to confirm that there s no incremental equity needs from any of that either  Obviously  it doesn t look like the plan changed at all in equity  and that this is all ATM and internal programs  right  There s no block equity  Rejji Hayes    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer That s correct   Michael Weinstein    Credit Suisse    Analyst OK  And one thing I would    maybe you could talk a little bit more about is you discussed a little bit about new  and the attraction of new commercial and industrial customers in your territory  And can you discuss the potential impacts on electric load  and on your industrial customers  as electric vehicles gain traction across the supply chain for the auto industry  Patti Poppe    President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah You know  the I would say  the industrial loads that we re seeing being added  actually  ends up being very unrelated to automotive  Michigan is more and more diversified  We ve had some big ag customer additions  and some pharma Additions  and so I would say  if anything  we re seeing some diversification in Michigan in our makeup of our industrial rate base  But I would also say    or our industrial customer base  But I would also offer on the EV front that as the chair of the EEI electric transportation  as the co chair of that committee  I ve had an opportunity to really get exposed to some of the national fleet operators  We had Amazon  for example  at our national EEI meeting in January  talking about their ambitions to electrify their fleet  I see that as a big opportunity  You know  load growth for electric per capita  certainly  has not had significant increases  In fact  it goes down  in many cases  as equipment gets more efficient  lighting gets more efficient  and I see this fleet potential to be actual load growth potential in the future  as their ambitions materialize  Now  I will tell you  it s not going to sneak up on us  because with their    first of all  they need to have electric transportation at the fleet scale available  the actual vehicles  the trucks  etc   and that development cycle is  you know  not fast  But then  we ll be working with them to size their charging stations and make sure we maximize the benefit to the grid  and minimize the addition to peak demand  So I think it s a great opportunity  frankly  for the industry  and Michigan will  certainly  be participants in that  Michael Weinstein    Credit Suisse    Analyst That s super  Thank you very much  Rejji Hayes    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Thank you  OperatorThe next question will be from Praful Mehta with Citigroup  Please go ahead  Praful Mehta    Citi    Analyst Thanks so much  Hi  guys  and congrats on a good quarter  Patti Poppe    President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks  Praful  Rejji Hayes    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Thank you  Praful  Praful Mehta    Citi    Analyst So maybe  first  a more big picture  step back question  utilities  clearly  have been doing well in the current stock price environment  and CMS is clearly doing well too given the execution  Do you think there is any use of that currency  from your perspective  M A or otherwise  that you think you can look at  or execution is primarily the focus at this point Rejji Hayes    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yeah  Praful  our position on M A versus organic growth has been consistent for some time  and you know  we are fully focused on executing on our capital plan  We ve got enough to do within our walls  and as I ve said in the past  we re paying one times book to fund those capital investments  I d rather do that than pay a premium for somebody else s capex backlog  So we re acutely focused on executing on our plan  Praful Mehta    Citi    Analyst Fair enough  Makes sense  Then just quickly on the operating cash flow  when you re looking at the Slide 17 and you say up 100 from the 2020 1 7 billion  just can you walk through that  What s the increase that you re kind of seeing in the long term plan  And  I guess  connected to that  I also saw increased NOL utilization on Slide 23  so just try to understand a little bit of the drivers around the operating cash flow  Rejji Hayes    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yeah So  Praful  as you may recall  prior to the enactment of tax reform at the end of 2017  We were on this very healthy trajectory of about  100 million of year over year  or at least year versus prior year budget  OCF accretion per year  and it has to do with just the very nice fundamentals of this business  I mean  we re investing capital  growing rate base  getting solid customer receipts  and I ll give full credit to our folks who manage working capital very well in our team as well  And so  it s just a nice by product of all that good work there  And so  the only reason we paused slightly was just due to tax reform and the cash flow degradation effects of that  So we  basically  took a two year pause on that level of growth  and so  we guided in 2018 at 1 65 billion  We managed to exceed that  And again  we guided in 2019 to 1 65 billion and managed to exceed that again  And so  now  we feel like  again  relative to what we budgeted the prior year  we ll be back on that sort of  100 million per year increase starting this year in 2020  And so  that s what we have in the forecast  And we feel very good about that  particularly given the magnitude of the capital investment plan  our ability to manage our costs  and again  just execute well on the working capital front  And so  we feel like we have a very nice glide path to continue on that trajectory  Now  as it pertains to NOLs and credits  you know  we obviously  had a significant remeasurement going back to tax reform on our NOLS  We still think we ve got a little bit of utilization left of what s remaining  But then also  we still have quite a few business credits that we ve accumulated over time and we expect modest accretion of that  just given some of our efforts on the renewables side  And so  that s where you see still a decent amount of  I ll say  combination of NOLs and tax credits  And so  at this point  we don t expect to be a federal taxpayer until  call it  2024  There s a modest amount that we ll pay in 2023  based on our forecast  but really not a partial taxpayer until 2024  Is that helpful  Praful Mehta    Citi    Analyst Yeah That s super helpful  Thanks for that  And then  just  finally  in terms of storm impacts and storm costs  is there any    in the current rate case filing  is there any plan there to change what gets recovered  or what is allowed to be recovered in terms of storm costs  Patti Poppe    President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah In our next electric rate case  certainly  we want to reflect the average service restoration expenses  And what we ve been recovering in rates is less than what we ve actually experienced on the last five year average  and so  we want that to be reflective  But we also want and believe that with the age of the system  that our increased spend in both the fundamental reliability of the system  We ve been increasing both the actual spend  as well as the requested spend  we think there s a lot of justification for that to keep up with the age of the system  And so  we ll continue to ramp the reliability spend  but we also want accurate reflection of the operating expense associated with service restoration  while  frankly  at the same time  we re working to reduce the cost of every interruption by making our processes more efficient  by making our utilizing technology to respond faster and at a lower cost  and so  we re doing both simultaneously  Praful Mehta    Citi    Analyst Got it  Super helpful  Congrats again  guys  Rejji Hayes    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Thank you  Patti Poppe    President and Chief Executive Officer Thank you  OperatorAnd our next question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners  Please go ahead  Shar Pourreza    Guggenheim Partners    Analyst Hey  good morning  guys Patti Poppe    President and Chief Executive Officer Good morning  Shar  Rejji Hayes    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Good morning  Shar Shar Pourreza    Guggenheim Partners    Analyst So just on just a couple of questions  on your annual capex regarding your disclosures  that s closer to the back of the slide deck  there s some  obviously  some shuffling of spend between 2020 and 2021  Can you just remind us what actually drove this  and can you maybe talk a little bit more about the new capex you re introducing toward the back end  really more specifically on the mix between gas and electric Rejji Hayes    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yeah  sure  Shar  Happy to take that  So a little bit of the shift that you probably have noticed between what we re expecting  or what we were expecting in 2020 in our prior five year plan that we rolled out in Q1 of last year and sort of this five year plan  it has everything to do with just the timing of the rate case in the four test years  And so  this current vintage  now that we re a year smarter  reflects the magnitude of spend we expect in 2021  and that aligns nicely with the gas case that s pending that we filed in December of last year  And with the electric case will likely file in Q1 of this year  And so  that s really why you see that shifting between  20 and  21  And what we ve always said  and this remains true to form  is that the absolute amount or the quantum of capital we anticipate spending on a five year period  one year period is always pretty consistent  but the composition does change over time  and sometimes  you get shifts intra year  and so  that s effectively what you re seeing  And then  for the outer years I think Patti did a nice job summarizing this  is just we re just basically losing 2019 from the prior vintage and rolling in another year  So going from a  19 to  23 plan to a  20 to  24 plan  and as part of that roll forward  you re seeing an expansion  more of the solar generation will do attributable to the IRPs  so taking on that sort of final tranche of  call it  250 megawatts that will rate base  And then  you couple that with additional spend in both our electric distribution reliability related capital investments  as well as gas and infrastructure spend  And so  those are kind of the pieces you re seeing in the back end of that five year period  Shar Pourreza    Guggenheim Partners    Analyst Got it  Got it  And then  sorry    and then  Patti  just sorry to beat a dead horse on this  but I just have a follow up on that incremental capital opportunities you guys have been highlighting  It seems like you re managing O M well  You have bill headroom that continues to improve  The economic backdrop remains strong in your service stories you kind of highlight  You do have sort of balance sheet capacity  Some kind of curious  what are the drivers that we are missing as far as you look to pull forward some of that spend  Is there anything else outside of just managing toward that 7  growth target that midpoint  Is it a function of trying to find the optimal capital projects internally  So what s sort of the offsets to those drivers  because it seems like the drivers seem to fit toward you accelerating spend versus not  Patti Poppe    President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah You know  one thing I ll tell you about our 10 year capital plan  I think some people might argue that it s impossible to have a 10 year capital plan  because conditions change so much  or you don t know enough about the future  I can tell you  our 10 year capital plan has a significant amount of meat on the bones  And what we intend to do is make sure that we are able to execute the work that we have committed to   And so  I ll tell you  the ramp up of capital requires a significant operational and ability to execute  and prepare the workforce  and when we hear nationally about constraints on ability to attract talent and to build out a workforce  we have to attract the workforce to deliver all that work  And so that  we want to make sure is well timed and well planned  so that we do precisely what we said we re going to do  And it s also important that from an affordability standpoint  that our customers are able to pay  and would value for value the investments that we ll be making on their behalf  So really  customer affordability continues to be front of mind  And as an operator myself  I want to make sure my team is ready and prepared to execute the work that we commit to  It s easy to write a number in a spreadsheet  it s another thing to go dig the trench  and lay the wire  and roll the trucks  So we ve got to make sure that we re ready all the way around  Shar Pourreza    Guggenheim Partners    Analyst Got it  So the human capital aspect is a bit of a concern  OK  great  Thanks so much  guys  Congrats  again  Patti Poppe    President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks  Shar  Rejji Hayes    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Thanks  Shar  OperatorOur next question will be from Jonathan Arnold with Vertical Research  Please go ahead  Jonathan Arnold    Vertical Research    Analyst Good morning  guys  Patti Poppe    President and Chief Executive Officer Good morning  Jonathan  Rejji Hayes    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Good morning to you  Jonathan  Jonathan Arnold    Vertical Research    Analyst Thanks for taking my question  So I was going to ask you about the shift in the capex from  20 to  21  and I think you ve addressed that  so thank you for that  Just one other issue   Now  you re giving this breakout of enterprises  Enerbank and the parent  which it sounds like you will continue to do that going forward given the size  But should we think already about the parent roughly consistent going forward with this number you re showing for 2020  or is that going to move around out in the five year plan Rejji Hayes    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Well  it should increase over time  Jonathan  because keep in mind  you know  that s largely  at this point  interest expense at the parent  And we have  12 2 billion of capital investments that we re going to be funding over this period  and so  obviously  we do the best we can in terms of getting low interest rates realized in our debt financings  but we just assume  with the new money we ll be raising that that interest expense should come up over time or increase over time  and so  we do expect that segment to increase  Every now and then  we overachieve  of course  Katrina s team have been very good at getting financings at lower rates than anticipated  But conservatively  we ll assume that that segment does increase  Jonathan Arnold    Vertical Research    Analyst OK  So you can just basically finance of a portion of the underlying growth   I think that s it  I really wanted to ask on the capex  so thank you Patti Poppe    President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks  Jonathan  OperatorAnd the next question will be from Ali Agha with STRH  Please go ahead  Ali Agha    SunTrust Robinson Humphrey    Analyst Good morning  Patti Poppe    President and Chief Executive Officer Good morning  Ali  Ali Agha    SunTrust Robinson Humphrey    Analyst First question  Rejji or Patti  Can you just remind us again  as you re looking at the sales there  roughly  how much on an annual basis  does energy efficiency sort of take away from the sales numbers  Rejji Hayes    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yeah  so  and this has been basically come out of the new    well  I can t call it new so much anymore  but the 2016 energy law  Ali  And so  we have a one and a half percent year over year reduction target that we get economic incentives on  And so  you take the prior year s load  and then  you reduce that by one and a half percent  and we do that through all the nice programs we have and rebates on LED lightbulbs and things of that nature  and so  that s where  historically  we ve been the last few years  Our current five year plan  and we ve been very public about this as part of our RRP  is to expand those energy waste reduction programs  And so  we re on a glide path to get to a 2  year over year reduction  and so  that will be about 2  of our prior year s load  And so  I just want to reemphasize that we do get economic incentives on those programs  And so  historically  that s been a run rate of  call it   34 million pre tax combined electric and gas  And so  as we glide path that pre tax income will crest at about 47 million toward the latter years of this plan  and we anticipate about 41 million in 2020 alone as we glide path up  And so  we anticipate  again  one and a half to 2  reduction in loan as part of that  And remember  it also gets trued up in rates as we file new cases  and so  that is also something worth noting  Ali Agha    SunTrust Robinson Humphrey    Analyst OK  And so just to be clear  if I look at the numbers for calendar  19  as reported weather normalized was negative 1 4  If you adjust that for efficiency  then it should be relatively flat  And I know you re sort of on an apples to apples basis  looking at that being up 1   I believe  in  20  and perhaps  beyond that  So can you just talk a little bit more about that dynamic  You had load growth going up to one and beyond Rejji Hayes    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Happy to  And we actually tried to get in front of that question because it comes up quite a bit by offering this new Slide 16 in the presentation  But you re thinking about it  Ali  the right way  And so  if you look at that sort of blended  weather normalized electric load for 2019 versus 2018  1 4  down  think of that as flat  I ll also note  what s embedded in that 1 4  is a reduction in volume from a very large  low margin customer  And so  when you back out the effects of the large low margin customer  our weather normalized sales goes from 1 4   down to about half a percent down  And then  if you take out the effects of energy efficiency  well  now  you re up 1   And you can look across all of our channels for electric and see that trend  which we think is the right way to think about it  So residential  flat  so you  again  you normalize for energy efficiency  You re up one and a half percent  commercial down 1 1   You normalize  you re up half a percent  And we have seen those organic trends in our customer counts  just to make sure that we re not being too scientific here  And so we feel quite good about that  and think there is a very healthy economic growth in our service territory  particularly with the high margin part of our supply chain    or sorry  our customer segments  Ali Agha    SunTrust Robinson Humphrey    Analyst Gotcha  And one last question  I know  as you mentioned that the 2016 energy law is fully implemented  etc  Anything of note in this year s legislative session for us to keep an eye on that may be relevant to you folks or something that you guys are keeping an eye on as well Patti Poppe    President and Chief Executive Officer No  Ali  I would suggest  particularly here in Michigan  the    there s nothing really being driven by the elections this fall  certainly  the presidential election is going to be a big distraction  We do have our whole house    state house  of course  has two year terms and our congressional districts have two year terms  And so there s reelections  Our governor did her say at the state last night and she doubled down on her commitment to fix the dam roads here in Michigan  That s our slogan  not mine  And so we re happy to support the investment and infrastructure  And frankly  as we do more road repairs  it s a great opportunity for us to collaborate with our Department of Transportation and our construction work here in Michigan to do our investment and infrastructure at a lower cost for all citizens  So I would say nothing though new from a legislative agenda here in Michigan  OperatorOur next question comes from Travis Miller with Morningstar  Please go ahead Travis Miller    Morningstar Equity Research    Analyst Thank you  good morning  On the gas case  I was wondering if you could lay out some of the    hate to use the word contentious  but some of the more debatable issues that you see coming up there  And in particular  the ROE and the decision to go with the higher request  Patti Poppe    President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah Well  a couple of things  Travis  First of all  as I mentioned  we have this 10 year gas    natural gas delivery plan that we filed with our case  And that plan has been well vetted with    and actually collaborated with our staff at the commission and its development in aligning on our priorities  One thing I can firmly applaud our commission for their commitment to being able to see long term plans  so they can make better decisions in a one year case  And so this 10 year gas plan we filed has a lot of meat on the bones  and I feel very good about it  You can look at our last case and see the    over 90  approval of the capital that we requested is a good indicator that that work that we have committed to doing is the work that the commission would want us to do as well  So we feel good about that   Now on the ROE  Of course  we feel justified in 10 5  ROE ask  And so we always make sure that we have adequate justification for that  It yields about a  25 million impact  If you take the 10 5  to 9 9   And so we recognize that the commission has a job to do  They ve made it clear that they recognize that a healthy ROE is important to the utility  low cost of capital is important for the benefit of customers and the utility  And so we look forward to seeing what the final outcome of that rate case will be  But what s more important  I think  is we really take an eye on it  is the volume of capital and the alignment with the staff and the commission and the work that we re doing  Travis Miller    Morningstar Equity Research    Analyst OK  Great  You anticipated my question on the ROE  so I won t ask that delta number  But broadly on the enterprise and Enerbank and    especially enterprise  what s your three year strategy  Any updates to that here in the last quarter or two  Rejji Hayes    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yeah So the plant at enterprise has been pretty straightforward for some time  And so obviously  a dig drives the vast majority of the financial performance of enterprise  And we really have tried to derisk that business and its future earnings potential quite a bit through the energy contracts that we amended and extended about a year or so ago  And then  we ve also locked in a good deal of our capacity  open margin over the next few years as well  And so we feel like there should be pretty steady  predictable performance at enterprises  I ll also note  we ve done a few of these contract of renewable opportunities  over the last sort of a year and a half  And so we will look to be opportunistic  if those    if we find nice opportunities with third parties  where we can get attractive returns  creditworthy counterparties and basically have to describe very little terminal value to projects like that  And so we ll look to do those from time to time  But again  we expect the three year forward look to be pretty straightforward  Travis Miller    Morningstar Equity Research    Analyst OK  Great  And any of those contracted renewables in the capex plan right now  Rejji Hayes    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Not in the 12 2 we highlighted Travis Miller    Morningstar Equity Research    Analyst OK  Great  Thank you very much Patti Poppe    President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks  Travis OperatorThe next question is from Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank  Andrew Weisel    Scotiabank    Analyst Good morning  everyone Patti Poppe    President and Chief Executive Officer Good morning  Andrew Andrew Weisel    Scotiabank    Analyst Patti  I ve got one near term and one long term  First  in the near term  if you could elaborate  Rejji  you gave a lot of good color on the demand trends by class  Are you able to estimate  like how much of the impact  particularly industrial is related to tariffs and trade wars  And then  what are your assumptions for load growth embedded in the 2020 guidance  Rejji Hayes    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yeah so we have  I ll say  for 2020 guidance  we are fairly conservative in our position both in 2020 and also over the course of the five year plan  And so for electric  And again  if you got to keep it    take into account that we have the energy efficiency programs embedded in that  We re assuming about  call it  flat to slightly declining for electric  And so that is our working assumption for a really 2020 and beyond   And I d say gas  flat to maybe slightly up based  from trends we re seeing there  And so that s our current position  In terms of industrial activity  clearly  we ve talked in the past about the diversified nature of our industrial customers in our electric service territory  And I ll just remind that folks at about 2  of our gross margin equivalent comes from the auto sector  And so yes  of course  we do have exposure to companies that may have some level of exposure to export  import markets  the trade war  whatever you want to call it  But at the end of the day  a lot of the margin we generate comes from our residential and commercial customers  and we continue to see very nice trends there  And so the industrial activity  we re obviously  very supportive of it through our academic development efforts  We do think it s important to Michigan  and our efforts on the residential and commercial side  But really  the vast majority of our sales were driven by residential and commercial  at least the margin there  and we ve seen good trends  The only other data point I ll leave you with is that 1  change in our industrial estimated growth probably drives about  0 05 of EPS  And so there really isn t a significant impact when you see variation in the industrial class because it s much lower margin  Andrew Weisel    Scotiabank    Analyst Right  Makes sense  OK  Good  Next longer term question  You continue to point to the midpoint of the 6 to 8  range  And obviously  you ve been delivering 7   so that s probably not a surprise  My question is  you show rate base growth of 7   excluding the upside opportunities on capex  You have some incremental EPS growth from things like the energy efficiency and demand response incentives  as well as Enerbank growth  My question is  what would prevent you from hitting the high end of the range going forward  Is that equity dilution or any other factors  Patti Poppe    President and Chief Executive Officer Well  I d say  No  1  we re always balancing the ability for our customers to afford the product so that we have a sustainable plan  And I ll also offer    and you can see from our track record on years when there has been some favorability  On the year when we could have delivered more than the midpoint  We reinvested in the business  And so one of the key components of our success here is our consistent performance that you actually can set your watch to that you can rest at night  That s our goal   And so the idea that we would start to fluctuate in pursuit of a higher target  Really is not consistent with our commitment to delivering as you would expect  year after year after year  And actually    so even at this stage of the year  we re thinking two years out  not just next year  And so we re always looking for ways to pull ahead expenses  reinvest favorability for the benefit of the consistency in the long run  Andrew Weisel    Scotiabank    Analyst Sounds good  I ll speak in the last one  Patti  no story of the month  Any quick one you can throw at us  Patti Poppe    President and Chief Executive Officer Let s see  Yeah  there s many of them  Here s one  Let me    just off the top of my head  We had a team at one of our service centers  really looking at their meter management process  And when we went out to talk to them  Garrick Rochow  our head of operations  observed that this team has had this problem of meter inventory and how they were managing that inventory  And because they have these teams called fix it now teams  which are empowered work teams right on the ground level  focused on driving the business  They had identified this issue with their inventories of meters and identified a  2 million savings specifically the benefits    that can be actually parley to other service centers to change their work process  This CE way is becoming embedded in our organization  and the ability to teach our coworkers to see and eliminate waste and improve their process  It reduces what we call their own human struggle when our coworkers see human struggle that they can reduce  it often parlays into dollars  makes their job easier to do  makes them more committed to the ownership of the company  and it s another good example of our real savings that get driven by real people who do the real work  and I could not be more proud of the team  Thanks for asking  We have a big debate whether I should include that in the script  and I am very happy that you asked  Andrew   Inaudible Andrew Weisel    Scotiabank    Analyst I need heaven at your fingertips  Thank you very much OperatorAnd our next question comes from Gregg Orrill with UBS   Please go ahead  Gregg Orrill    UBS    Analyst With the renewable s capex that you outlined on Slide 22  can you maybe comment on how that contributes to rate base growth  or is a portion of overall rate based in the plan Rejji Hayes    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Yeah So Gregg  what that s comprised of  it s the combination of renewable spend  and certainly  the near term portion of this five year plan to get to the RPS    or sorry  renewable portfolio standard of 15  by 2021  as per the energy law  so that s the components you ll see in sort of the 2020 2021 timeframe  and we have good projects in the pipeline that we think will allow us to get there  And then  the latter portion  as we ve talked about in the past  is part of the IRP related renewable spend  And so  again  as we start to execute on this 1 1 gigawatt tranche  half of which will be owned  half of which will be PPA ed or contracted  you know  that s what s making up the balance of that  In terms of the rate base component  we have of the 1 8 billion of capital  we plan to spend in aggregate over the five year period  it probably drives about    or probably represents about 6  of rate base  or thereabouts  So not all that significant at this moment  but over time  we ll expect that to grow  But the vast majority of the spend  as we ve talked about in the past  is wires and pipes  We think that s where    if you really want to get the biggest bang for the buck  it s really in the investment and the safety and reliability of our system  both in gas infrastructure and electric infrastructure  And so  that s where you see the vast majority of the rate base spend and the rate base growth accordingly Gregg Orrill    UBS    Analyst OK  Thank you  and congratulations Rejji Hayes    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Thank you Patti Poppe    President and Chief Executive Officer Thanks  Gregg OperatorAnd our next question is from David Fishman with Goldman Sachs David Fishman    Goldman Sachs    Analyst Hi  Good morning  and congrats on another consistent year Rejji Hayes    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Thank you  David  Good morning Patti Poppe    President and Chief Executive Officer Good morning David Fishman    Goldman Sachs    Analyst Good morning  So I apologize  if this has already been asked  but with the natural gas distribution plan files  given such a long term look  effectively by program  when would you expect  really  if at all  to file for another IRM  or another multiyear mechanism  I mean  just given the detail by category in this filing  along with the IRP and the EDIIP  it certainly seems like you are potentially positioning consumers to work with the commission toward a mechanism of some kind in the 2020s Patti Poppe    President and Chief Executive Officer You know  I would offer this  David  I have mixed feelings about the  or long term plans  because the reality is  the system is dynamic  the demands are dynamic  One of the great strengths of our plan  as I highlighted in my prepared remarks  is that we ve got a lot of flexibility  you know  This large percent of our spend  under  200 million  the ability to file every year  simple concrete filings that are part of a long term plan  allow us to adjust when conditions change  And there s no big bet strategy that we have employed for over a decade now  has served us well in our ability to be flexible  And so  when you lock in a three year filing on a system like the gas system  where you can have dynamism  maybe you ve got new regulations  maybe there s an incident somewhere else in the country that reprioritizes our system and our investment strategy  I personally like the flexibility of an annual filing that allows us to go ahead and adjust as necessary  Now  the simplicity of a filing  if you ve got multiyear plans  certainly  can be appealing  And if our commission was leaning that way and they really preferred that  then of course  we would work with them on that  But I think the idea that we re dynamic  and so is our plan  has more relevance to our ability to deliver consistently David Fishman    Goldman Sachs    Analyst OK  That makes sense  And then  the other item  just on the filing  I thought you guys did a good job of linking out your expectation for kind of cost reductions starting in 2021  kind of through the 2020s  We ve heard a lot about  on the electric side  the potential fuel cost savings in O M  But I was wondering if you could kind of elaborate a little bit  following kind of the extensive review  what kind of buckets or drivers and trajectory you re seeing at the natural gas side and the 2020s Patti Poppe    President and Chief Executive Officer Yeah I d say the natural gas side  it s all about the efficiency of getting the work done  And with every dollar of capital  there s still associated O M that comes with that  so when we can make our capital more efficient  we can make our O M more efficient  So we continue to work on our unit cost  on driving our unit cost  on reducing waste from our    the ability to execute work  our leak backlog and leak response is a large O M expense  and so  when we make the capital investments that reduce vintage services and service lines  and vintage mains  for example  we re able to reduce operating costs  And we just completed  also  a large capital project on our automated meter reading for our gas meters  And that helps reduce O M expense as well that obviously reduces the daily walkthrough of someone s

144574,366089,CMS,CMS Energy  CMS  Upgraded To Buy  Here s What You Should Know,opinion,"CMS Energy  CMS  appears an attractive pick  as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates  which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
A company s changing earnings picture is at the core of the Zacks rating  The system tracks the Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus measure of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years 
Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time  In these situations  the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements 
As such  the Zacks rating upgrade for CMS Energy is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  and the near term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated  The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship  as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock 
Fundamentally speaking  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for CMS Energy imply an improvement in the company s underlying business  Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for CMS Energy
This energy company is expected to earn  2 50 per share for the fiscal year ending December  2019  which represents a year over year change of 7 3  
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for CMS Energy  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 0 1  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

144575,366090,CMS,CMS Energy  CMS  Beats Q3 Earnings Estimates,opinion,"CMS Energy  CMS  came out with quarterly earnings of  0 73 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 62 per share  This compares to earnings of  0 59 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 17 74   A quarter ago  it was expected that this energy company would post earnings of  0 44 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 33  delivering a surprise of  25  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once 
CMS Energy  which belongs to the Zacks Utility   Electric Power industry  posted revenues of  1 55 billion for the quarter ended September 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 52   This compares to year ago revenues of  1 60 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
CMS Energy shares have added about 27 5  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 19 9  
What s Next for CMS Energy 
While CMS Energy has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for CMS Energy was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  0 71 on  1 92 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  2 49 on  7 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Utility   Electric Power is currently in the top 29  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2019-10-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cms-energy-cms-beats-q3-earnings-estimates-200477390,200477390
144576,366091,CMS,CMS Energy  CMS  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when CMS Energy  CMS  reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 30  2020  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This energy company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 69 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  72 5  
Revenues are expected to be  1 88 billion  up 2 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 2  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for CMS Energy 
For CMS Energy  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that CMS Energy will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that CMS Energy would post earnings of  0 62 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 73  delivering a surprise of  17 74  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
CMS Energy doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-01-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cms-energy-cms-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200501141,200501141

144644,366159,CMS,Why CMS Energy  CMS  Is A Great Dividend Stock Right Now,opinion,"All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio  whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  However  when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments  income investors hone in on dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
CMS Energy in Focus
Headquartered in Jackson  CMS Energy  CMS  is a Utilities stock that has seen a price change of 5 02  so far this year  The energy company is paying out a dividend of  0 36 per share at the moment  with a dividend yield of 2 93  compared to the Utility   Electric Power industry s yield of 3 06  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 97  
Taking a look at the company s dividend growth  its current annualized dividend of  1 53 is up 7  from last year  Over the last 5 years  CMS Energy has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 6 95   Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company s payout ratio  a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  CMS Energy s current payout ratio is 59   meaning it paid out 59  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Looking at this fiscal year  CMS expects solid earnings growth  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  2 51 per share  which represents a year over year growth rate of 7 73  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits  However  not all companies offer a quarterly payout 
Big  established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  but it s fairly uncommon to see high growth businesses or tech start ups offer their stockholders a dividend  Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  That said  they can take comfort from the fact that CMS is not only an attractive dividend play  but also represents a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  ",2019-01-31,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-cms-energy-cms-is-a-great-dividend-stock-right-now-200382626,200382626

Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities  but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank  The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions  while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits 
FirstEnergy and CMS Energy are both sporting a Zacks Rank of   2  Buy  right now  The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates  so investors should rest assured that both of these companies have improving earnings outlooks  But this is only part of the picture for value investors 
Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics  These include the long favored P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company s fair value 
FE currently has a forward P E ratio of 15 14  while CMS has a forward P E of 22 37  We also note that FE has a PEG ratio of 2 52  This figure is similar to the commonly used P E ratio  with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company s expected earnings growth rate  CMS currently has a PEG ratio of 3 62 
Another notable valuation metric for FE is its P B ratio of 2 84  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  CMS has a P B of 3 08 
Based on these metrics and many more  FE holds a Value grade of B  while CMS has a Value grade of C 
Both FE and CMS are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks  but based on these valuation figures  we feel that FE is the superior value option right now ",2018-12-04,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/fe-vs-cms-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200364948,200364948
144664,366179,CMS,Will CMS Energy  CMS  Beat Estimates Again In Its Next Earnings Report ,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  CMS Energy  CMS   which belongs to the Zacks Utility   Electric Power industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This energy company has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 10 29  
For the most recent quarter  CMS Energy was expected to post earnings of  0 57 per share  but it reported  0 59 per share instead  representing a surprise of 3 51   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  0 41 per share  while it actually produced  0 48 per share  a surprise of 17 07  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for CMS Energy  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
CMS Energy currently has an Earnings ESP of  0 82   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on January 31  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-01-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-cms-energy-cms-beat-estimates-again-in-its-next-earnings-report-200376754,200376754
