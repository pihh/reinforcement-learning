14302,235817,AMP,Why Ameriprise  AMP  Is Poised To Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider Ameriprise Financial Services  NYSE AMP   This company  which is in the Zacks Financial   Investment Management industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
This financial services company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 4 15  
For the last reported quarter  Ameriprise came out with earnings of  4 24 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 97 per share  representing a surprise of 6 80   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  4 per share and it actually produced earnings of  4 06 per share  delivering a surprise of 1 50  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Ameriprise  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Ameriprise has an Earnings ESP of  0 39  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on January 29  2020 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2020-01-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-ameriprise-amp-is-poised-to-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200500712,200500712

14314,235829,AMP,U S  banks limp away from hopes of interest margin expansion,news,"By David Henry and Sin ad Carew
NEW YORK  Reuters    Big U S  banks are under pressure again  as policymakers around the globe have dashed any hopes that the industry might finally be able to earn more money on loans  after more than a decade of rock bottom interest rates 
On Wednesday  central banks in New Zealand  India and Thailand slashed their benchmark rates to prop up their economies and stave off recession  Those moves followed the U S  Federal Reserve s decision last week to cut its key rate for the first time since the 2008 financial crisis 
The changes have stung major lenders  whose executives have long complained about the impact of low rates on lending income 
During second quarter earnings calls last month  executives from several major U S  lenders softened outlooks for net interest margins  some for the second time in 2019  according to the research firm Portales Partners  Meanwhile  Treasury yields fell to a near record low on Wednesday  with futures markets predicting the Fed will cut rates another three times by year end 
 This is a dangerous situation   said Peter Boockvar  chief investment officer for Bleakley Advisory Group  a wealth management firm with  4 5 billion in assets under management   The global economy is slowing down dramatically  so the banks will get banged twice  
Bank stocks led a decline in major U S  indexes on Wednesday  with blue chip lenders JPMorgan Chase  NYSE JPM    Co  Bank of America Corp  NYSE BAC    Citigroup  Inc  NYSE C    Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC    Co and  Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS  all down 3  to 4    Goldman Sachs Group  Inc  NYSE GS  was down 1 7  
The S P 500 Bank index was down 3 4  on Wednesday  The index has fallen four out of the last five days and has fallen about 9 7  since July 26 
It is a sharp reversal from the beginning of 2019  when Wall Street had been optimistic about the sector  predicting that banks would ride the coattails of a booming U S  economy  But the escalating trade war between the United States and China  combined with softer economic data globally  have led economists to rein in estimates for growth as well as corporate earnings 
Analysts and investors contacted by Reuters on Wednesday issued a cautious tone about U S  banks 
On one hand  narrowing interest margins will hurt  forcing banks to lean harder on fee based income and potentially embark on another round of cost cuts  On the other hand  market volatility can be good for trading operations  and U S  banks are in a better position than European rivals to withstand the economic stress 
 They are in a better shape to deal with lower rates   said David Hendler  founder of research firm Viola Risk Advisors 
He ticked off a list of businesses big banks can depend on besides traditional lending  including trading  prime services  underwriting and dealmaking 
But  for now  David Joy  chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial  NYSE AMP  in Boston  said he is avoiding the sector  Even though U S  bank shares have become less expensive  he said  there is a good chance things will get worse before they get better 
 Banks are probably going to remain under pressure here   he said   They do best when the economy is reaccelerating  and we seem to be going in the opposite direction  ",2019-08-07,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-banks-limp-away-from-hopes-of-interest-margin-expansion-1948062,1948062

14316,235831,AMP,Wall Street Weekahead  Sagging consumer discretionary shares look for a spark,news,"By Chuck Mikolajczak
NEW YORK  Reuters    The strength of the U S  consumer has been often cited as a pillar of the economy and one of the reasons the S P 500 has recently scaled new heights  but consumer discretionary stocks have skipped the party for several months 
The S P consumer discretionary sector  SPLRCD  hit a record high on July 15  But while the S P 500 has continued to climb to new highs  discretionary stocks have gone in the opposite direction  falling nearly 4    N 
Graphic  Consumer discretionary lags broader market  
Subsequent attempts by the sector have fallen short  with the index making lower highs  indicating a downtrend 
Graphic  Consumer discretionary in a downtrend  
The disappointing performance for the sector comes as U S  companies continue to point to strong domestic spending 
On Friday  data showed retail sales rebounded in October  although purchases of big ticket household items and clothing were curtailed  Bank of America Merrill Lynch  NYSE BAC  said its U S  consumer confidence indicator bounced further in the survey period through Nov  12  but remained below July s levels 
According to Refinitiv data  65  of the companies in the sector that have reported earnings have topped expectations  below the 74 6  beat rate for the S P 500 as a whole through Nov  15  The third quarter year over year earnings growth rate for the sector has tumbled to 0 9  from the 9 9  anticipated at the start of the year 
 Earnings across the board have been pretty lackluster   it may be reflective of the consumer taking a little bit of a pause  Consumer spending has been solid but it hasn t been robust   said David Joy  chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial  NYSE AMP  in Boston 
Research firm CFRA forecasts retail sales for the holiday season months of November and December to rise 4 3  to  1 05 trillion  However  CFRA retail analyst Camilla Yanushevsky believes the growth is more a result of an easier comparison with last year  when figures were distorted by the government shutdown  U S  consumers are not as strong at this time as they were a year ago  she says 
 This is a very confusing time for investors looking at this sector   said Kim Forrest  chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners in Pittsburgh   Whither the sales  
A big overhang on these stocks has been the trade war  said Yanushevsky  and the perceived progress in negotiations between the United States and China has been a big factor 
Another round of tariffs on about  156 billion in Chinese imports is scheduled to take effect on Dec  15  raising prices on many consumer products  such as cell phones  Negotiators for the two countries are attempting to reach a deal to cancel current tariffs in phases 
 Right now there is not much optimism  it is kind of a wait  and see before reacting approach   said Yanushevsky   If there is some sort of optimism like a Phase 1 deal is signed and then there is a clear path to Phase 2 and Phase 3  that could reignite that optimism that we saw in the beginning of the year with the securities  
Underperformance in Amazon  O AMZN   by far the biggest weight in the sector at over 20   has contributed to the lackluster returns for the sector  Investors have rotated into beaten down stocks that have become cheap  such as financials  SPSY  and energy  SPNY  names  which have gained more than 3  this month 
 If you back the lens up and say  How has consumer discretionary done for the whole year and when did it top out    it topped out right when we started to cycle into the things that hadn t been working   said Art Hogan  chief market strategist at National Securities in New York 
With Amazon having already reported results  investors will get a look at results from a host of companies in the sector next week  including its second largest weight   Home Depot   N HD  
Other consumer discretionary names due to post results in coming days include  Target   N TGT   Nordstrom  N JWN   Kohl s  N KSS  and Lowe s Companies  N LOW  
 The fact we are having rotations is healthy because that just means we are not glued to what has been working in 2019   said Hogan   As consumer discretionary goes through that mini rotation  it probably comes out of it and next week is probably that catalyst to at least see what has been overdone on the downside here  ",2019-11-15,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/wall-street-weekahead-sagging-consumer-discretionary-shares-look-for-a-spark-2021748,2021748
14317,235832,AMP,Christmas Eve s Stock Apocalypse Was Another Buy the Dip Moment,news," Bloomberg     Steve Chiavarone was rethinking his gift list 
It was the night before Christmas last year  the worst moment of Wall Street s bleakest holiday season in decades  Staring at another 400 plus point plunge in the Dow  its fifth in seven days  the Federated Investors fund manager worried he d been too generous with presents for the kids 
 Market s going the wrong way and you re worried   Hey  did I spend too much    said Chiavarone  whose firm has around  530 billion in client assets   The Christmas goose didn t taste as good that night  
Holidays are supposed to be a time of peace  Last year  they offered a glimpse of the apocalypse  American equities careened toward their worst December since the Depression  Down 1 655 points the week before  the Dow plunged 653 more by the 1 p m  close Christmas Eve  ruining everyone s mood 
In the end  it all turned out to be a giant buying opportunity    stocks went straight up when markets reopened  But for people managing money on Christmas 2018  it s a trauma they won t soon forget  The S P 500 slid to its lowest point in 19 months  with  600 billion in market value erased  The biggest four day slump in more than three years had just happened and nothing suggested it was over 
 My thought was that I m glad the market s closing early today   said David Sowerby  a portfolio manager at Ancora Advisors  After the day ended   I did what any self respecting portfolio manager would do  I went to the gym to work out and relieve some stress  
Threats were everywhere  You had Donald Trump railing against the Federal Reserve  The government was shut down  Uncertainty over economic growth was rampant  News that the president was privately mulling firing Fed Chairman Jerome Powell sent anxiety swirling  At one point  Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin got on the phone with Wall Street banks  checking on their liquidity and infrastructure  It was supposed to restore calm but just made everything worse 
For a day  It was tough to see  but stocks were offering some of the best bargains in a decade  The benchmark index has jumped more than 35  from the nadir that day  hitting repeated records along the way  A gauge of fear in the stock market  the Cboe Volatility Index  has gone from 36 a year ago to 12 now 
This  in 2019  is what the market is supposed to be like around the holidays  Little news  light trading  small moves and low volume  In the five years prior to 2018 s crash  for instance  the biggest swing in the final trading day before the holiday was a gain of about 0 3  on Christmas Eve 2013 
Last year s pre Christmas massacre was business as usual for Michael Matousek  head trader at U S  Global Investors   I was in that whole time  I didn t mind  I basically viewed it as being paid to not go to my in laws   he said by phone from his San Antonio office   A lot of the traders we were dealing with were screaming   Oh  my God  the market is falling  It doesn t look like there s any end to it   
The holiday may have contributed to the volatility  he said  with lower liquidity making for bigger swings  Many desks likely weren t fully staffed  senior traders were on vacation  In their absence   there will be a lot of junior traders there  who may not be able to initiate a stance on a position  depending on the rules of their firm   said Matousek   A junior trader can t decide   This is a short term bottom   and start accumulating  
David Joy  chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial  NYSE AMP   recalled that Christmas Eve  had the look and feel of panic selling  based more on fear rather than any change in fundamentals or outlook   With that backdrop  the market closure was more akin to something of a Christmas miracle 
 Christmas itself gave the market opportunity to take a breather and a second look at things   he said  The day off  came at a very opportune time  
As bad as Christmas Eve was for Wall Street  the day after bred relief  Trump called equities bargains in an Oval Office press conference and the S P 500 spiked near 5  on Dec  26  its single best session since March 2009  Joy was among the buyers when the market reopened  purchasing an exchange traded fund that tracks the Nasdaq 100 and selling it a few months later for a small gain 
Bryce Doty at Sit Investment Associates also presciently saw the bloodbath as a buying opportunity 
 Whether I was in the office or not I was working    these are the times that matter   said the firm s senior vice president   There s only a few days out of the year where there s really some significant opportunities and that was definitely one of the best ones of the year  even though I wouldn t wish it on my worst enemy  ",2019-12-23,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/christmas-eves-stock-apocalypse-was-another-buythedip-moment-2047245,2047245

14319,235834,AMP,Ameriprise  AMP  Hits Fresh High  Is There Still Room To Run ,opinion,"Shares of Ameriprise Financial  NYSE AMP  have been strong performers lately  with the stock up 4 5  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  165 89 in the previous session  Ameriprise Financial has gained 58  since the start of the year compared to the 18 5  move for the Zacks Finance sector and the 13 4  return for the Zacks Financial   Investment Management industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on October 23  2019  Ameriprise reported EPS of  4 24 versus consensus estimate of  3 97 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 12 02  
For the current fiscal year  Ameriprise is expected to post earnings of  16 25 per share on  12 34 billion in revenues  This represents an 8 77  change in EPS on a  3 82  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  17 92 per share on  12 84 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 10 31  and 3 99   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Ameriprise may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Ameriprise has a Value Score of A  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are B and D  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of A 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 10 2X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 9 6X versus its peer group s average of 9 5X  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Ameriprise currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Ameriprise fits the bill  Thus  it seems as though Ameriprise shares could still be poised for more gains ahead ",2019-12-08,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ameriprise-amp-hits-fresh-high-is-there-still-room-to-run-200491189,200491189

14321,235836,AMP,Know These 3 Facts To Avoid Paying Half Your Retirement Income To The IRS   December 20  2019,opinion,"Failing to withdraw a required minimum distribution  RMD  from your own or an inherited IRA by the deadline results in a big tax code penalty  50   That s right  If you were supposed to take out a minimum of  4 000 and  oops   did not do so  you have the privilege of writing the IRS a check for  2 000 
Like many investors  you re likely aiming to build a comfortable nest egg to ensure a comfortable retirement  Among retirement financial planners  this is called the  accumulation phase   In this phase  your goal is to invest wisely by choosing stocks with long term potential for your retirement portfolio  such as Ameriprise Financial Services  NYSE AMP   a current top ranked dividend stock 
There is also a second phase of retirement planning that gets less focus   despite the fact that it s the more interesting part  It s the  distribution phase   which essentially means spending the wealth you ve worked hard to amass 
Making plans for the distribution stage involves deciding where you ll live in retirement  whether you ll travel  your proposed leisure activities  and more decisions that will affect your spending during your golden years 
Along with these aspects  it is important to consider the required minimum distribution  RMD  that applies to most retirement accounts  Essentially  the IRS requires you to withdraw a specific sum from your qualified retirement accounts once you hit age 72 
Why does the IRS requires you to start taking your money out  It s simple   they want to make sure they get their tax  If this rule didn t exist  people could live off other income and never pay tax on their retirement investment gains  Then  that money could be left to family or friends as an inheritance without the IRS collecting any taxes from you 
What You Need to Know About RMDs
Which types of retirement accounts have RMDs  Qualified retirement accounts like IRA accounts  401 k s  457 plans and other tax deferred retirement savings plans like a TSP  403 b   TSA  SEP  or SIMPLE IRA plan require withdrawals in retirement 
When do I have to start taking distributions  For most accounts  you must take your first distribution by April 1 of the year following the calendar year in which you reach age 72 
Every year after your start date  you are required to take your RMD by December 31  Remember  for Roth IRAs you do not have to take an RMD because you paid taxes before contributing  However  other types of Roth accounts do require RMDs  but you may be able to avoid them  for instance  by rolling your Roth 401 k  into your Roth IRA  
What happens if don t take my RMD  The penalty for not taking a required minimum distribution  or if the distribution is not large enough  is a 50  tax on the amount not withdrawn in time 
How much money do I have to withdraw  To calculate a specific RMD  you must divide your prior year s December 31st retirement account balance by a  distribution period  factor based on your age 
Here s an example to give you an idea of the amount  Ann is 70 and will take her first RMD in the year she turns 72  Her IRA balance at the end of the prior year was  100 000  Her  distribution period  factor is 27 4  Dividing  100 000 by 27 4 equals  3 649 63  This is how much Ann is required to withdraw for the calendar year in which she turns 72

14322,235837,AMP,Know These 3 Facts To Avoid Paying Half Your Retirement Income To The IRS   January 09  2020,opinion,"Failing to withdraw a required minimum distribution  RMD  from your own or an inherited IRA by the deadline results in a big tax code penalty  50   That s right  If you were supposed to take out a minimum of  4 000 and  oops   did not do so  you have the privilege of writing the IRS a check for  2 000  It s important to remember that the rules related to RMDs changed on January 1  2020
In case you re like most investors  you re probably trying to build a financial portfolio that is solid enough to guarantee a comfortable retirement  Among retirement financial planners  this is known as the  accumulation phase   In this stage  your objective is to carefully invest by selecting stocks with long term potential for your retirement nest egg  For example  you might choose Ameriprise Financial Services  NYSE AMP   which is a current top ranked dividend stock 
But there is a second phase of retirement planning that gets less attention  even though it s the more enjoyable part  It s the  distribution phase   which simply means spending the assets you ve worked so hard to accumulate 
Preparing for the distribution stage is where you may settle on choices about where you ll live in retirement  whether you ll wish to travel  interests you may seek after  and different choices that will influence your retirement spending 
Along with those choices  you need to be mindful of the RMD  because it applies to the majority of retirement accounts  This IRS rule requires you to withdraw a specific minimum amount from any qualified accounts you have when you reach a certain age  previously it was 70 1 2  but beginning in 2020  it is 72 
What is the point of this mandatory withdrawal by the IRS  Not surprisingly  it s to be sure that the government gets their tax money  Without the RMD requirement  individuals could live off other income and never pay tax on retirement account gains  That cash could be left to family or friends as an inheritance and the IRS would not receive taxes from it 
The Most Important Things to Know About RMDs
Which types of accounts have RMDs  Qualified retirement accounts such as IRAs  401 k s  457 plans  and other tax deferred retirement savings plans like a TSP  403 b   TSA  SEP  or SIMPLE IRA plan require withdrawals in retirement 
When does it become necessary to begin taking distributions  Your first distribution must be taken by April 1 of the year following the calendar year that you turn 72  for most accounts   Also  if you retire after that age  you must take your first RMD from your 401 k   profit sharing  403 b   or other defined contribution plan by April 1 of the year after the calendar year in which you retire 
For each subsequent year after your required beginning date  you must take your RMD by December 31  Note that you do not have to take an RMD on a Roth IRA since you paid taxes prior to contributing  Other types of Roth accounts require RMDs  However  there are ways to avoid them  For example  you can roll your Roth 401 k  into your Roth IRA 
What will happen if I neglect to take my RMD  If you don t take an RMD  or don t take a large enough distribution  you are liable for a 50  tax on the amount that was not withdrawn in time 
How much cash do I need to withdraw  To figure out a particular RMD  you should divide your earlier year s December 31st retirement account balance by a  distribution period  factor dependent on your age 
Example  Ann is 71 and must take her first RMD in the year that she reaches age 72  Her year end IRA balance the prior year was  100 000  Her  distribution period  factor is 27 4  The result of dividing  100 000 by 27 4 is  3 649 63   the amount of the RMD that Ann must withdraw for the calendar year in which she turns 72

14323,235838,AMP,Is Ameriprise  AMP  A Solid Growth Stock  3 Reasons To Think   Yes  ,opinion,"Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all 
That s because  these stocks usually carry above average risk and volatility  In fact  betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss 
However  it s pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Ameriprise Financial Services  NYSE AMP  is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system  In addition to a favorable Growth Score  it carries a top Zacks Rank 
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market  And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  
While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this financial services company is a great growth pick right now  we have highlighted three of the most important factors below 
Earnings Growth
Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor  as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors  For growth investors  double digit earnings growth is highly preferable  as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Ameriprise is 15 5   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 10 9  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 9 9  
Cash Flow Growth
Cash is the lifeblood of any business  but higher than average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Ameriprise is 11 5   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 9 9  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 7 2  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 6 3  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is of course favorable here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
The current year earnings estimates for Ameriprise have been revising upward  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0 6  over the past month 
Bottom Line
Ameriprise has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above  but it also carries a Zacks Rank  2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions 
You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
This combination indicates that Ameriprise is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors ",2020-01-09,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-ameriprise-amp-a-solid-growth-stock-3-reasons-to-think--yes--200497726,200497726

year   72 3  vs   58 6    The Zacks analyst believes that the company has been gaining from growth across most brands and sales channels  The trend continued in first quarter fiscal 2020  wherein both top and bottom lines surpassed estimates and rose year on year Performance was supported by growth in emerging markets  travel retail and online sales  Further  management provided an optimistic view for fiscal 2020  However  the company is witnessing certain headwinds such as soft retail trends in the United States and the U K   costs related to Brexit and tariff impacts in China Additionally  challenges in Hong Kong s retail environment are expected to continue through fiscal 2020  Moreover  adverse currency movements are a concern Shares of BNY Mellon have gained  14 8  in the past three months against the Zacks Major Regional Banks industry s rise of  12 6   The Zacks analyst believes that global diversification efforts and prudent cost management initiatives will aid the bank s financials The company has an impressive earnings surprise history  having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters  Moreover  earnings estimates have been going up ahead of its fourth quarter 2019 results Impressive capital deployment actions reflect a strong balance sheet position  Yet  the Federal Reserve s accommodative monetary policy along with reduced client activities and low volatility are likely to hurt revenues going forward  Concentration risk arising from significant dependence on fee based revenues could alter BNY Mellon s financial position if there is any change in individual investment preferences Canadian Pacific Railway s shares have gained  6 3  over the past six months against the Zacks Rail industry s rise of  0 9   The Zacks analyst believes that this was mainly due to prudent cost management  With consistent cost containment  the company s operating ratio has been improving Its measures to add shareholder value are also appreciative  Under a normal course issuer bid  for which it received acceptance in December 2019   the company can purchase up to 4 8 million shares  Canadian Pacific s buyout of Central Maine   Quebec Railway is a further positive However  Canadian Pacific experienced weak volumes in the fourth quarter amid macroeconomic headwinds and geopolitical tensions  Moreover  poor harvest weather in Canada is hurting grain volumes significantly  The company s high debt levels and capital expenditures also add to its woes  Capex is projected to have been C 1 6 billion in 2019 Other noteworthy

conversion of our new customer relationship management platform  and we re growing the Ameriprise Bank  We brought more than  1 billion of cash sweep balances on the balance sheet in the fourth quarter  bringing our full year total to close to  4 billion  and we will continue to bring sweep deposits on the balance sheet This year  we will be adding additional capabilities  including a mortgage program  pledged loans and a savings deposit product  I also like to point out that outside of the bank  Ameriprise Wealth management expenses will come back to more normalized levels in 2020  We also continue to receive important recognition in the industry  Ameriprise was recently certified by JD Power for providing an outstanding customer service experience  Our teams work hard to deliver industry leading service  so this means a lot I ll leave you with this take away  With our advice value proposition and the investments we ve made  we have a great opportunity to continue to grow in the wealth management business  I m energized by the opportunity we have in front of us  Now  I will turn to our I A businesses  These are strong books that provide earnings diversification and stability  We re focused on delivering insurance and annuity solutions that satisfy client needs  while continuing to evolve our solution mix In the quarter  we generated  185 million in adjusted operating earnings for the protection annuity businesses  and in line with our expectations and we continue to generate strong free cash flow  In terms of annuity sales total variable annuity cash sales were up  when compared to a slower quarter last year  and for the year  sales were in our typical range of about  4 billion This month  we launched our structured solutions annuity product designed exclusively to meet the needs of Ameriprise clients  We expect this will help shift even more of our books away from products with guarantees  Fixed annuity sales were down year over year in line with our plan  In protection  we focused on continuing to shift from IUL to VUL where we had a very strong growth in VUL sales compared to last year Overall  life insurance in force remained stable at  195 billion  As always  we re focused on managing risk appropriately  and ensuring we have the right product designs for our clients and the environment  We will also continue to evaluate further action regarding reinsuring the remaining fixed annuity block this year  Moving to Asset Management  earnings was strong and flows continued to improve We remain focused on serving client needs and pursuing long term growth opportunities in key areas  Columbia Threadneedle ended the quarter with  494 billion in assets under management  up 15  on improving flows and positive markets and the earnings contribution to Ameriprise remain good  We re making good progress  executing our strategy and you can see that in our flow picture  We generated  3 3 billion in net inflows in the quarter  which was up  8 billion from last year This is our third consecutive quarter of improved flows  Investment performance was excellent in 2019 across equities  fixed income and asset allocation portfolios  On an asset weighted basis for our Columbia funds  over 75  are above medium for one year  three year and five year time frames  For Threadneedle funds  over 80  of beating their benchmarks for those same time periods  and we re seeing improved results across strategies and regions with global retail leading the way In US retail  we have been increasing our market share at six of our top eight broker dealer partner firms  and gross sales in our key strategies are good  Our equity flow rate in the quarter was strong  In fact  of the 17 active firms we benchmark  we were in the top five and one of the few that were a net positive for the quarter  and in fixed income  we continue to garner good flows and we feel that we can improve even further  We re seeing a particular strength in our income franchise For example  our dividend income  strategic income and mortgage opportunity funds generated more than  2 2 billion in combined net inflows in the quarter  In EMEA retail  with Brexit now moving forward and reduced uncertainty in the UK sentiment in Europe has improved  Net flows improved by more than  2 billion from last year  We re making good progress  In fact  we were in net inflows in nearly all of our key markets in Europe  Now that we have built out our SICAV product range  and in global institutional net inflows improved by more than  2 billion ex parent to a net outflow of  1 billion We re gaining traction in a number of areas that we talked to you about in November  It was another good quarter in Asset Management  We have a strong product line up  excellent performance and global reach and we re focused on executing well to maintain our momentum  Now  let me turn to our final key area of focus  our capital strength  which is outstanding Last quarter  I highlighted our strong excess capital position and the benefits of the successful sale of the Auto and Home business in terms of freeing up capital and focusing our efforts on our core businesses  Ultimately  we ended the year at  2 2 billion of excess capital  In the fourth quarter  as a continuation of our strong return of capital  we returned 125  of operating earnings through the pick up and the pace of our buyback  and for the year  we reduced our overall share count by 8  To summarize  it was an excellent quarter and year for Ameriprise  We are in a strong position  Later this year  we ll mark our 15th anniversary as an independent publicly traded company  We re incredibly proud of what we ve accomplished  Importantly  we re proud of how we re recognized for our client service  our records of outperformance and how we consistently deliver for shareholders  We re poised and energized to build on our record of performance and growth Now  Walter will discuss the financials in detail  and then we ll take your questions  Walter Walter Berman    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you Jim  Ameriprise delivered another strong quarter of financial results and business metrics with adjusted operating EPS of 11  to  4 20  This was supported by a strong 6  revenue growth  excluding the Auto and Home business that we sold in the quarter  The quality of earnings across our businesses was quite strong however  within the corporate segment there were a few timing related expense items that I d like to explain  First  we incurred higher than normal impairments in our low income housing portfolio  totaling  25 million  The portfolio continues to perform well  and we do not anticipate any impact to our going forward expected tax benefits Second  as part of our reengineering process and evaluation of our overall expense base  going into 2020  we took an elevated level of severance charges in the quarter of  11 million  This action  positions us well moving into 2020  Finally  we had significant share price appreciation in the quarter  which required us to mark to market  some of the previously issued share based compensation awards  This was a  6 million absolute impact in the quarter  but an  18 million variance year over year Going forward  we expect our corporate segment losses to return to the  70 million range  On October 1st  we closed the sale of Auto and Home to American Family the transaction generated a net benefit of  161 million over the course of the year  but is not recognized within our operating results  We returned 125  of earnings to shareholders in the quarter  and 110  for the year based upon the sale of Auto and Home and the changes in our risk profile We enter 2020 with strong balance sheet fundamentals  with  2 2 billion in excess capital and a lower risk profile  With long term care continuing to perform well  which you can see in the appendix  in 2020  we will evaluate reducing leverage while remaining committed to return capital at a pace of 100  plus Let s turn to page six  As I mentioned  adjusted operating net revenue was up 6  to  3 billion after excluding Auto and Home from the prior year period  Revenue growth was driven by Advice   Wealth Management and Asset Management  In Advice   Wealth Management we had a substantial increase in wrap assets and improved transactional activity  driving an 8  increase in revenue  In Asset Management  revenues grew 9  including strong performance fees  annuities and protection revenue was essentially flat In summary  we delivered strong EPS growth of 11  and a return on equity of nearly 39   Turning to slide seven  you can see that our business mix continues to evolve with Advice   Wealth Management generating over half of the company s earnings  up from 33   five years ago  This profitability improvement has been driven by fundamental organic growth and well managed expenses  while still investing for future growth We ve seen a consistent shift in our business mix over the past few years and expect this to continue as we    investments in areas of opportunity within Wealth Management business  Advice   Wealth Management continues to perform well across leading and lagging indicators as you can see on slide eight  Advice   Wealth Management  adjusted operating net revenues grew 8  Wrap assets were up 26  to  318 billion  with net inflows of  4 4 billion in the quarter  Transactional activity also increased 5  year over year  We had a good quarter for experienced advisor recruiting with 63 advisors joining us from other firms in the quarter  with much higher trailing 12 month productivity and market levels improved nicely Pretax adjusted operating earnings were up 5  or  19 million in the face of a  22 million headwind related to recent Fed rate cuts  A strong increase in revenue allowed us to continue to drive profitable growth despite short term interest rates  G A increased 6  excluding the bank  consistent with expectations  We are continuing to make substantial investments for growth and seeing elevated volume related expenses  given strong activity levels Our expectation is that G A growth  excluding the bank will be in the range of 3  to 4   Finally  our margin was solid at 22 6  and we expect we can maintain it in this range  Let s turn to asset management on page nine  In the quarter  we saw a substantial  8 billion improvement with net inflows of  3 3 billion  Excluding former parent related flows  net inflows were  4 2 billion  benefiting from continued improvement in retail  in North America and Europe as well as from reinvested dividends  From a financial perspective  the business is demonstrating an improved trajectory  Asset Management continues to generate substantial revenue and pre tax adjusted operating earnings for Ameriprise Pretax adjusted operating revenue was up 9  to  770 million  driven by strong performance fees and market appreciation with lower pressure from the cumulative impact of flows  Underlying expenses remain well managed  Within the quarter  expenses were impacted by elevated performance fee and year end timing related compensation adjustments  as well as a higher distribution expense associated with revenue growth Margins in the quarter were 36  remaining in our target range of 35  to 39   Turning to page 10 results in annuities and protection are solid  Annuities continue to perform in line with expectations  but very consistent profitability  We saw good improvement in variable annuity sales of 9  in the quarter  though still down for the full year We have launched a new structured variable annuity product in the first quarter  that will further diversify our offering away from    benefit features and our variable annuity net amount of risk  still remains one of the lowest in the industry  Protection earnings were down slightly to  65 million  claims remain in line with expectations Now  let s move to balance sheet on slide 11  We accelerated the pace of capital return to shareholders in 2019 with  2 4 billion returned via buybacks and dividends  This is a continuation of our long standing track record of capital return  In fact  over the past 10 years  we have returned over  18 billion to shareholders and reduced our diluted share count by approximately 50  We continue to generate substantial free cash flow  which along with excellent balance sheet fundamentals will support continued capital return  We enter 2020 from a position of strength with  2 2 billion of excess capital  We remain committed to returning capital to shareholders  assessing potential changes to our capital structure to best support our current business mix and evaluating additional reinsurance opportunities With that  we will take your questions Questions and Answers Walter Berman    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you   Operator Instructions  And our first question comes from Andrew Kligerman from Credit Suisse Andrew Kligerman    Credit Suisse    AnalystHey good morning  So  I m looking at the advisor count and here at 98 71  Phonetic   It s roughly flattish with the last year s number  Could you talk a little bit about your ability to grow that count going into 2020 and the productivity of those advisors  I know revenue per advisor was up 6  year over year  a lot of moving parts there  So  how do you see that evolving in 2020 as well James Cracchiolo    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes  So  we think that the account count would probably pick up a bit as we go forward  We actually netted out a number of advisors in the IPI area and others as we reform  then restructured that channel as well as in some of the central sites as we shifted things around  But  we actually feel good about the recruitment  We re actually focused a bit more on higher productivity and so the average productivity of the people who were leaving us was still much lower  So  we focus mainly on the growth of that productivity and the type of people we re bringing in But  I think the advisor count should probably pick up a bit more like we were doing more at the beginning part of the year and I feel good about the type of productivity we re bringing in and the recruitment then  and the ramping up of the people who are here Andrew Kligerman    Credit Suisse    AnalystGot it  And staying on Advice   Wealth  fee rates they were around 108 basis points by our calculation in the quarter  and that s kind of versus the recent 109 basis point to 111 basis point range over the last two years or so  And  so I don t know is that a function of moving up market and how do you    why is that  and where do you see the fees kind of shaking out in 2020 and 2021 James Cracchiolo    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes  So  I think it s part of the idea of us continuing now to bring in more clients at a little higher levels  where then the rates get a bit lower as the asset levels and managing are a bit higher  And so  that s actually    it s a good positive thing for us  I mean  our net inflow of client activity is pretty strong  continues to be good and consistent  and we are bringing in more clients and the more affluent and we re probably going to embark on something this year to even focus a bit more even on the higher net worth channels  So  I think that s a favorable for us Andrew Kligerman    Credit Suisse    AnalystGot it  And then one last quick one  110  payout ratio    110  in 2019  2 2 billion of excess capital  Could you get that ratio even higher in 2020 Walter Berman    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerWe could  but the issue is I think  as Jim said  at the Investor Day we re targeting at this stage 100  plus  but we are certainly monitoring that and evaluating Andrew  as we do but certainly we have a generation capacity and we will be evaluating that as we move forward Andrew Kligerman    Credit Suisse    AnalystThanks a lot OperatorOur next question comes from Humphrey Lee from Dowling   Partners Humphrey Lee    Dowling   Partners    AnalystGood morning and thank you for taking my questions  A question with regard to the G A expenses  I think in Jim and Walter s prepared remarks  you talked about expenses should normalize in 2020  and I think specifically in and A WM  the G A expenses  excluding the bank would be kind of 3  to 5  growth  but I guess  when we look at the overall enterprise how should we think about the expenses in general  and then also how much of a banking related expense do you anticipate for A WMJames Cracchiolo    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerOkay  So  I think as we indicated  Yes  I think what you said for AWM  the expense range after normalizing for the bank is it will be in the 3  to 5  range  As it relates to AMP  it is lower than that and normally will be in the range of 2  that range  So  we anticipate that will continue as we look  but as we evaluate it  but that is what is a reasonably good expectation Humphrey Lee    Dowling   Partners    AnalystOkay  So  including the bank or overall AMP G A expenses would be in the 2  range  is that what you re suggesting James Cracchiolo    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerNo  The bank will be above that because we normalize for it  At the AWM level  it s about 200 basis points  if you add for the bank  So  I think it will be a little less for AMP  because the AMP size of the expense base will be neutralized  so it gets a little less impact  But  that is basically from that standpoint of normalized Humphrey Lee    Dowling   Partners    AnalystOkay  got it  And then in    again  in your prepared remarks you talked about the fixed annuity block it doesn t look like the lower interest rate right now affects how you think about the block in terms of potential transactions  Is that a fair statement  And then also  can you remind us how much statutory capital that you have right now backing that business Walter Berman    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  So listen  the interest rates do affect it  but we do believe there is a    we are evaluating that there is potential viability and certainly pursuing a fixed annuity reinsurance  and we are in discussions and we evaluate that  This is a general range  it s probably around an area of  750 million to  800 million that we can free up Humphrey Lee    Dowling   Partners    AnalystOkay  great  Thank you OperatorOur following question comes from Kenneth Lee from RBC Capital Markets Kenneth Lee    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystHi  thanks for taking my question  Just one within the Asset Management business  a follow up on the prepared remarks  you touched upon seeing improving investor sentiment within the UK EMEA region due to the Brexit clarity  I m wondering whether you would expect to see further improvement in net fund flows of this year due to the increase in clarity  and perhaps you could just tell us  which products    investment products you could see potentially gaining from this improving sentiment  Thanks James Cracchiolo    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerOkay  So  I think you re more explicitly asking about UK in Europe  our EMEA business  Yes  we saw a nice improvement bounce back occurring in the fourth quarter  moving from some negative in the first month of the quarter to actually inflows in the second and third month of the quarter and we see that continuing  Europe was actually positive for us  good  UK was still coming back  but it was still a bit weaker  but we feel like that will start to change in remedy now that they have gone through the elections at the end of the year  So  we re reasonably optimistic that there will be a little less uncertainty  I mean  there is still uncertainty to the extent of what is that trade agreement and things at the end of the year  but the people in London are feeling better  and feel like the business can come back there and the appetite would increase And  we have a good line up  I mean we have excellent performance in our funds  Our UK equity type products are really good  We ve gained even in a negative year flows there  and we now have a full line of products in the SICAV range in Europe and that bodes well for us  as there is a pick up  and we re seeing that pick up in things like European equities and various things like that  So  we are positive on that to be an improvement this year Kenneth Lee    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystGreat  and just one follow up if I may  Looking at the former parent company related outflows  looking back over the past year or so  net outflows related to that have been declining  Just wondering whether we would expect a similar kind of trajectory going forward or just wanted to get your thoughts there  Thanks James Cracchiolo    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes  So  I think we ve seen some improvement in the domestic part of that and then the outflow from our relationship here  The Zurich activity has been pretty consistent  once in a while they ll have a pension that closes and there is some lumpiness  but it s pretty much been running like what we ve seen from quarter to quarter just based on the drawdown of these closed books and assets  But as I said  the assets that remain there due to a combination of appreciation and even some difference in some of the products that we replace  that have a bit higher fee  the revenue gets offset even though that flow negative in that  that book is there So  but I would probably say I  it s been running that way consistently for a while so I don t see much change there from a flow  but the revenue has been pretty stable Kenneth Lee    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystVery helpful  thank you very much OperatorOur following question comes from John Barnidge from Piper Sandler John Barnidge    Piper Sandler    AnalystThanks  Deposit volume in 4Q 2019 for VA s was the highest since 2Q 2018  thought it was somewhat surprising given the decline in rates during the year and associated repricing activity  Can you talk about your positioning in the distribution environment there  Thank you James Cracchiolo    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes  we did see a bit more of a pick up  I mean  a year ago this quarter it was a slower period for us  but we saw a bit more activity toward the end of the year  We actually just in the end of this month  we just launched our structured annuity product  and we actually think that would pick up some traction as well in the current year and shift some of the business from the guarantee product  I mean  we still sell a reasonable portion of annuities without living benefits as well  which is good So  we re not looking for a substantial growth  but we re looking for probably a bit more growth  but also a shift to now some of the structured product as well  which is good for us  So  we want to keep that book growing or stable with slight growth  which is good and the mix improving  So  that s what we re probably seeing right now John Barnidge    Piper Sandler    AnalystGreat  And my follow up  does Brexit clarity change your view around M A for asset management  as I believe the fee rate for retail is a bit higher in EMEA than in the US James Cracchiolo    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWell  we want to continue to grow in EMEA and Europe to the point you reference  based on fee rates and the use of actives as well  So  we keep our eye out for opportunities  but we actually feel like some of the investments we re making and the expansion of resources that we re putting on the continent  gives us some opportunity for further growth there as well John Barnidge    Piper Sandler    AnalystThanks for the answer OperatorOur following question comes from Tom Gallagher from Evercore Thomas Gallagher    Evercore    AnalystGood morning  Just a question on the AWM growth  Just looking at page 13 of the supplement  it looks like total client AUM versus the wrap accounts is growing a bit slower  Just curious if  are you seeing outflows in the non wrap business  And overall  how is that impacting your growth in that business and just overall economics James Cracchiolo    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWell  looking at the client flows  they re still pretty    very good  So  they re in excess of the  4 billion  I don t know exactly with the ins and outs  there is some ins and outs  but a shift between the non wrap to wrap has slowed a lot  I mean  it s sort of leveled out  I can t tell you    like from period to period it might be slight  But  the net of the effect of what those flows are our gross client net client inflows in total  So  it s within that realm  I would probably say with the fourth quarter  which is the markets being where they were  I d probably think activity would slow it a little more for investment purposes  just because people were waiting for the next shoe to drop  But I think it s been pretty stable Thomas Gallagher    Evercore    AnalystSo Jim  just following up on that  would you say overall flows into the complex  from a total client assets would be close to the  4 billion mark James Cracchiolo    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerIt s north not of  4 billion  but in that range in the fourth quarter Thomas Gallagher    Evercore    AnalystOkay  that s helpful  And then  how should we think about total capital return  I mean  I know you ve returned more than the 90  certainly last year  you re sitting on substantial excess as we stand today  How are you thinking about utilization of the excess  are you thinking more strategic M A  or are there opportunities out there and then maybe doing more buybacks  if nothing  if you don t find anything like where are you leaning now more toward with deployment of that excess  particularly after the P C capital freed significant amount James Cracchiolo    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo  as you saw we did pick up the buyback  As we said    Walter  just mentioned that we re probably looking to continue  we usually say 90 to 100  we re saying probably 100 plus at this point in time  not knowing the world and the etc  But  if things present good opportunities for additional  we do that  but we constantly monitor the cash flow  continues to be quite good and strong  As Walter also said  we re probably looking to reinsure some more as we go through the year  So  I think buyback still would be probably the main return mechanism  We will look presenting to the Board about a dividend increase again this year  consistent with all the years that we ve done that  and you know  we always look at some M A strategically to fit in  but that depends on opportunities that may come along or not  but we have enough capital flexibility that  that should not affect our buyback trajectory Thomas Gallagher    Evercore    AnalystOkay  thanks OperatorOur following question comes from Suneet Kamath from Citi Suneet Kamath    Citi    AnalystThanks  good morning  I just wanted to start with the A WM margin  So  if the Fed is on hold now  is the impact of the    what they did last year in terms of rate cut sort of fully baked into the 22 6  margin Walter Berman    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  basically  it is a small deviation  but basically it is Suneet Kamath    Citi    AnalystAnd then  at Investor Day  I mean I don t want to nitpick here  but you talked about a 20  plus margin A WM  on this call you re saying you can maintain at 2006  Is there sort of in a change in how you re thinking about that margin  relative to what you told us at Investor Day Walter Berman    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerNo  not at all Suneet Kamath    Citi    AnalystAnd then the last one I had is on the bank  I think we have a good sense of what the expenses are  but can you give us a sense of what the bank revenues are and how you expect that to progress as we move through 2020 Walter Berman    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  So  as we indicated  we had a small profit in 2019 and we do expect with the launches of different products and adding more transfer sweep money over  the revenues will grow  Obviously  this is a challenging market for investment  But  on that base  we do see the revenues growing and also increasing our profitability in 2020 Suneet Kamath    Citi    AnalystDo you have a sense of the revenue base though  right now from the bank Walter Berman    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerLet me    I don t want to guess that  so let us get back to you on it  I ll get it too Suneet Kamath    Citi    AnalystAll right  thanks Walter OperatorOur following question comes from Erik Bass from Autonomous Research Erik Bass    Autonomous Research    AnalystHi  thank you  A couple of follow ups on Advice   Wealth  sort of along the same line as Suneet s questions  I guess first  would you expect cash yields to be pretty stable going forward if the Fed remains on hold or are there any competitive dynamics that could create some noise there James Cracchiolo    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerNo  I don t believe that we see any    I mean  obviously  we are constantly monitoring and measuring  But no  we don t see any of this at this time Erik Bass    Autonomous Research    AnalystGot it  And then  Morgan Stanley recently provided a target of getting its Wealth Management business margins to the 28  to 30  range over the next two years  and I realize there are differences between its business and yours  But  do you see getting to kind of a mid 20  margin is something that may be achievable over the intermediate term  as the bank reaches scale and if you continue to improve advisor productivity levels James Cracchiolo    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I would say this  I mean one of the things very clearly as you have sort of compressed rates out there with what the Fed recently did versus some of the banks that might have been started previously  where based on their investments and other things like the wirehouses with their banking entities and the use of that  But  I would actually say if you get a bit better and some of the yield curve or some pick up a little bit on some of the longer rates  not substantially  I think you can see what we re shifting into the bank  with the developments going through the bank that  that could be adding to margins  even if the Fed maintained rates right now  so to speak  depending on what happens in the larger climate  but we re ramping up the bank in a period when those things are pretty compressed  But  we feel good about it because it gives us the opportunity  if things normalize a little better again Erik Bass    Autonomous Research    AnalystOkay  thank you  And is there a correlation between productivity and margin or does productivity just help drive revenues  but kind of your payout stay the same and it s sort of margin neutral James Cracchiolo    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThe productivity over the years have definitely    I mean  you can see our margins have grown up pretty    pretty tremendously  We do still have sort of an independent and an employee base  The employee margins have increased nicely  our independents are quite good  And so  we have added through margin  based upon the productivity increase and the business growth  and I don t see that changing substantially I think  what we re just managing is you had spurts in markets and other things  So  we re just averaging that out right now  but as Walter said our expense growth should come down a bit  outside of the bank back to more normalized levels  So  we feel good about maintaining and improving that margin over time But again  things are with the environment  you can t always predict that and what the impact may be in the short term Erik Bass    Autonomous Research    AnalystCertainly  And thank you for the comments OperatorAnd the last question comes from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs Alex Blostein    Goldman Sachs    AnalystHey guys  thanks for taking a couple of questions here  I have a few on AWM mostly  So  I guess first  is it possible for you to give us a sense how much in net interest income  you expect to generate at the bank in 2020 and sort of what that contemplates  In other words  are there more deposits  you re going to move from sweep or whatever you move that s enough to kind of just put it into loans or other things you guys are doing at the bank  that s my first question Walter Berman    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerI guess  let me first    since  we started the bank midyear  obviously we ll get the calendarization effects so that will get the net interest margin  Phonetic  increasing on that basis  We will be increasing  certainly as I indicated  the sweep flows into the bank so that  well  but again  as Jim has    in this market  the rates are fairly concerted And we are certainly looking at launching and having a more emphasis on our privilege loan program and certainly on    and getting into a deposit program Alex Blostein    Goldman Sachs    AnalystOkay  But no rough sense of in terms of the revenue dollars that you expect to get out of the bank this year Walter Berman    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerNo  not exactly that  again as    we d have to  we re not forecasting  but certainly there will be an increase and again we are assuming an increase in profitability  But  I don t have the exact correlation James Cracchiolo    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAnd Alex  we re forming as we ve started to ramp up the bank  the shift in the sweep  Looking at the current environment and regarding both our lending and our investment strategy  the roll out of some of the products this year  we will be forming that and as that gets more informed  we will be chatting with you and informing you as well  So  we re just at the early stages of that  but all the groundwork  all the foundational elements even the initial shift in  the launch of the credit card  the initial sweeps  etc have taken place  So  we re right on track to our plans  but the second level of that will be forming as we go in through this year Alex Blostein    Goldman Sachs    AnalystGot it  thanks  And then in terms of the asset growth  So  at a high level  everything you guys are talking about sounds great  in terms of recruiting  higher productivity  etc  When we look at the wrap flows this year  they ve decelerated versus last year  despite the fact that what feels like has been a very robust  environment for the industry  as well as some of your peers  So  what s been driving the decline in wrap accounts this year  What do you think is a reasonable  either dollar amount of organic growth  do you expect to get out of that over the next kind of 12 months to 24 months And then  when you look I guess  at the fee rate on wrap accounts  that s also been coming down for the last couple of years  So  kind of help us reconcile all those three maybe  Thanks James Cracchiolo    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  we don t really see that what you re saying  per se  I know that the wrap account in previous year or two were a bit higher  but remember that was part of an industry shift  We were part of that moving with the DoL and activities and accelerating some of that transfer  but from an organic growth level  as I said a  4 4 billion is still pretty nicely organical growth  and we see that continuing  We feel like our fee rates are pretty good as you said  as we continue to move up market  some of the fees will be lower  naturally  based upon pricing  But no  I don t see it could move slightly from what we said  but I don t see a slowdown  per se Our client activity is good  but we do a lot more business than wrap  and so  importantly it s not just a wrap business per se  we try to do more comprehensive business  but I feel that that s not necessarily I see a slowing    I see things go period to period  but I think over the longer term  we feel pretty good about it and we think that  that will continue and you know our wrap balances were up 26  year over year So  I m not sure we re out aligned in anything in the industry  There may be some further shift for some people where they were behind on it  and accelerating it  but we have always had a good strong wrap business Alex Blostein    Goldman Sachs    AnalystGot it  Great  thanks very much

114565,336080,AMP,Wall Street Week Ahead  Doubts increase that first quarter will be earnings low point,news,"By Caroline Valetkevitch NEW YORK  Reuters    As Wall Street braces for what may be the first U S  profit decline since 2016  investors say the first quarter may not mark the low point for 2019 earnings  In the immediate term  markets could be roiled depending on what or if any information is released from Special Counsel Robert Mueller s report on his investigation into Russia s role in the 2016 presidential election  which was submitted to Attorney General William Barr late on Friday   Concerns about economic weakness in the United States and abroad and the lack of a U S  China trade deal are hanging over the longer term outlook  even as the Federal Reserve s dovish stance on interest rates is expected to relieve some of the pressure on companies and the economy  In a troubling sign for the U S  outlook  a report on Friday showed U S  manufacturing activity unexpectedly cooled in March  and the spread between three month Treasury bills and 10 year note yields inverted for the first time since 2007  An inverted Treasury yield curve is seen as a warning of a coming recession   As stocks sold off in December  some investors worried 2019 would bring a profit recession for S P 500 companies  defined as at least two quarters of year over year declines  The last U S  profit recession ran from July 2015 through June of 2016  Analysts  after cutting earnings forecasts for 2019  now expect a 1 7 percent year over year earnings decline in the first quarter  and some profit growth for the rest of the year  according to IBES data from Refinitiv  With the Fed on pause and stocks rebounding  optimism seemed to be increasing that the profit outlook would stabilize after hitting a low point in the current quarter  Many investors say that is now less certain   It would be great if Q1 represented a low point  but I m not betting on it   said Jack Ablin  chief investment officer at Cresset Capital Management in Chicago   I worry that the comparisons are going to be much more difficult as we navigate the rest of the year   This year s earnings growth already was expected to shrink dramatically compared with 2018  when steep corporate tax cuts fueled earnings gains of about 24 percent   Since the start of the year  the forecast for second quarter profit growth has fallen to 3 0 percent from 6 4 percent  while estimated growth for the third quarter has dropped to 2 7 percent from 4 9 percent  based on Refinitiv s data  The fourth quarter growth estimate has come down as well  though it is still relatively strong  at 9 1 percent  Those numbers could keep falling  while the first quarter forecast is likely to improve from here  Since 1994  earnings have surprised to the upside on average by 3 2 percent  according to Refinitiv data  which suggests S P 500 companies will post an earnings gain for the first quarter  Still  with investors largely discounting weaker profit trends  the first quarter reporting period could bring market volatility  Ameriprise Financial  NYSE AMP  strategists said   On Tuesday  FedEx Corp  NYSE FDX  cut its 2019 profit forecast for the second time in three months  causing its stock to drop and raising fresh worries about the impact of the trade conflict on earnings  The company cited slowing global economic conditions and weaker trade growth  Also  Nike s shares fell 6 61 percent on Friday after it reported North American sales that fell short of expectations  The United States initially had a deadline to reach a deal on trade with China by March 1  but the White house has said it needs more time   There are real concerns  FedEx s numbers are a perfect example  There s been a global growth slowdown  and companies are communicating that in terms of their guidance for the first quarter and throughout the year   said Anthony Saglimbene  global market strategist at Ameriprise Financial in Troy  Michigan  To be sure  a lot of those fears could be reversed if there is a resolution in the U S  China trade conflict  and if companies  first quarter reports are not as weak as expected  he said  Strategists said they expect to hear more from companies on the trade conflict when first quarter reporting kicks into high gear around mid April

While Ameriprise s Price is expecting solid data  he cautions   The market has more downside risk than upside risk primarily because of the yield inversion  the concern over the tone of economic data over the past few months  not just in the United States  but around the world  ",2019-03-30,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-investors-seek-comfort-in-flood-of-data-1822397,1822397
114568,336083,AMP,Fed officials see risks in weaker inflation expectations  trade row,news,"By Howard Schneider WASHINGTON  Reuters    A drop in the consumer outlook for inflation and intensifying trade tensions drew caution from Federal Reserve officials on Monday as policymakers faced fresh market volatility and a renewed set of risks  While Fed officials have largely discounted the trade war so far as unlikely to derail the U S  economic expansion  officials emphasized Monday that a protracted tit for tat battle between the United States and China was a different matter that might require a Fed response   If the impact of the tariffs   and whatever financial market reaction to those tariffs is   causes more of a slowdown  then we do have the tools available to us  including lower interest rates   Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren  a voter this year on Fed rate policy  said in an interview with Reuters  While Rosengren said he was  not necessarily  expecting a rate cut to be necessary  the market sell off Monday was deep and potentially disruptive to the Fed s core expectation that interest rates will remain on hold for some time to come  Major U S  equity markets were down between 2  and 3 5  on Monday  while bond investors sharply increased their bets that the Fed would be forced to cut rates this year  A closely watched spread between long  and short term bonds turned negative  seen by some officials as a sign of weakened market confidence in the economic outlook  After the collapse of U S  China talks last week and the threat of tariffs ratcheting ever higher  there was more reason to believe the tensions will last a while    If it s the worst case scenario and it s ever increasing tariffs for an extended period of time  that could change things  that could have a real effect on U S  GDP growth   Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said on CNBC  Traders and analysts on Monday said the volatility is likely to continue   You cannot game what two leaders   are going to do from day to day   said Anthony Saglimbene  global market strategist with Ameriprise Financial  NYSE AMP  Services in Troy  Michigan  of the high stakes standoff between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping   RATE CUTS BACK ON RADAR Fed officials have been careful to say that nothing yet has changed their core outlook  which envisions rates to be held in their current range of between 2 25  and 2 5  until either growth demonstrably weakens and inflation falls further  justifying a rate cut  or faster inflation makes higher rates warranted   As the trade war intensified over the last few days  however  traders in the federal funds futures market have moved decisively in favor of expecting a Fed rate cut in coming months  Data from the CME Group  NASDAQ CME  now sees the Fed cutting rates in October  with a near 10 percentage point shift since Friday in the probability of a rate reduction at that Fed meeting   The pressure on the Fed could come from several directions  Economic growth overall could slow if the tariff wars continue and global trade declines   wealth effects  could directly impact business and household confidence and spending if the stock declines continue  higher costs could hit company profits  and discourage hiring  A further complication for the Fed  The inflation outlook among U S  consumers dipped sharply in April  countering Fed policymaker hopes that inflation dynamics will improve and the pace of price increases soon rise toward their target level  Survey data released by the New York Federal Reserve on Monday showed consumer expectations of the inflation rate over the next year fell to 2 6  from 2 82  in the March survey  The nearly quarter point drop was the third largest since the survey was launched in mid 2013  The outlook for inflation over the next three years also fell  to 2 69  from 2 86   evidence that medium term expectations have also weakened in recent weeks  Following the Fed s most recent meeting  Chairman Jerome Powell and others said they felt recent weak inflation readings were driven by  transitory  factors that would disappear over time and allow overall inflation to rise  But a drop in inflation expectations is another matter  and could be evidence that households and businesses are losing faith in the Fed s ability to deliver on its inflation goal   a worrying development for central bankers who feel their ability to keep expectations set around their inflation target is critical to meeting the goal  As of the Fed s last policy statement on May 1  officials said they felt expectations remained stable   
While consumer surveys are discounted by some officials as overly influenced by things like changes in gasoline prices and other costs that consumers closely monitor  some broader market expectation measures have also shifted  Since late April  for example  a St  Louis Federal Reserve measure of the inflation rate expected five years from now  based on trading in different types of bonds  dipped to 1 9  from 2 1   a sign traders also see weaker inflation ahead ",2019-05-13,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/us-consumer-views-on-inflation-dip-as-trade-outlook-clouds-markets-1866308,1866308

114594,336109,AMP, Institutional Buyers  Bitcoin ETF Seen As the Catalysts to Turn Crypto Bears Into Crypto Bulls ,news,"After Bitcoin s price tanked over the weekend  dragging down the prices of other cryptos with it  there s renewed talk about what could turn crypto bears into crypto bulls 
Much of the crypto discussion piggybacks on previous talk about the catalysts that could move cryptos  prices higher  especially Bitcoin s 
Over the weekend  Bitcoin s   6 000 to around  5 900  While it quickly rebounded  trading higher about 24 hours after plunge  the crypto s fall caused observers to start speculating over how the space is in need of something measurable to move the cryptos in it higher and become more stable 
Let s discuss some of thoughts being bandied about 
The elusive ETF
For years  crypto observers have talked about a Bitcoin exchange traded fund being key to propelling the crypto s price higher  Many were enamored by the Winklevoss twins  efforts to bring one online  but they were quickly disappointed by the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission s  no way  response to their idea 
Still  many won t give up hope  This includes Ari Paul who co founded BlockTower  a cryptocurrency hedge fund 
If and when there is a Bitcoin ETF in the crypto world  Paul believes it could propel Bitcoin s price to  35 000 
Michael Strutton  the CEO at IronWood  Sunday  his thoughts about what could move Bitcoin s price higher  He wrote 

Let me describe how  easy  it is  Once the Securities and Exchange Commission allows Bitcoin ETFs  anyone with a 401K  IRA  or an investment account  like with the following top five broker dealers  could invest in Bitcoin with a simple click   no wire transfer or credit card fees  no explaining Coinbase  other crypto exchanges  and security hurdles 

The top broker dealers he listed are  Fidelity   Charles Schwab   NYSE SCHW   Edward Jones  Ameriprise Financial  NYSE AMP  and TD Ameritrade  
Come on in  Institutions
Another catalyst that could drive Bitcoin s price higher is the entry of more institutions who invest in the space  With the launch of Bitcoin futures contracts by the CBOE and CME Group  NASDAQ CME   institutions are increasingly warming to the space 
We  to you earlier this month that the crypto market is no longer relegated to enthusiasts alone  Furthermore  with the massive profit potential on display  institutional investors have been open to entering crypto markets 
Paul agrees  saying that the next BTC rally will likely be the result of more institutional investors getting in on the action  and he sees the pickup happening before the end of this year 
Furthermore  Paul believes that once services like Coinbase Custody are up and running  institutional investors could be ready to enter 
Snagging the institutions
One of the biggest hurdles in attracting institutions relates to getting them comfortable with cryptos being a part of a legitimate asset class 
A move by the Intercontinental Exchange  ICE   which is the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange  could help  We  how it is launching a trading platform that would allow investors to purchase Bitcoin 
The structure would entail swap contracts  These contracts would be settled with actual   physical  Bitcoin placed in the customer s account  That means that Bitcoin would be available at settlement  which could be as soon as the next day 
In addition  this platform could address the issues over custodianship  which also concern institutional players

114599,336114,AMP,A decade of U S  economic sluggishness may have just snapped back to normal,news,"By Howard Schneider WASHINGTON  Reuters    For a solid decade after the collapse of Lehman Brothers touched off a global financial crisis  there was good reason to think the U S  economy remained broken  from skepticism about the health of the labor market to tepid economic growth and the moribund rate of interest paid on U S  Treasury bonds  In a heartbeat  that seemed to change this week  adding facts on the ground to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell s glowing portrait of a historically rosy and extended period of super low unemployment  modest inflation and steady growth  It came through Amazon com Inc s  O AMZN  move to a  15 minimum wage  possibly setting the bar for companies nationwide  It came through a jump in long term bond yields that signaled faith the gears of growth will remain engaged for a record long recovery  On Friday  it came through the 3 7 percent unemployment rate  a 49 year low  continuing a run of employment growth that many analysts  including at the Fed  have long expected to slow   Wage inflation is creeping higher   said Russell Price  senior economist at Ameriprise Financial  NYSE AMP  Services Inc in Troy  Michigan   There s no question the job market in the United States is possibly at its best in a generation  There s no question or debate about that  The jobs report has become a inflation report   Treasury bond yields rose further on the payrolls report  with the benchmark 10 year note yield touching its highest level since 2011  and U S  stocks slipped  The week s events were not just consistent with the good times scenario both Powell and U S  President Donald Trump have laid out  They validated it  and in doing so pointed to a U S  economy that may be starting to work more like it used to  As an exercise in old fashioned supply and demand  Amazon s decision to raise starting wages across the board was perhaps the best example  Fed and other officials have been anticipating for a while  in fact  that the lack of available workers would prompt companies to raise wages   When productivity growth is faster  that is your opportunity to share some of your extra output with your workers  That s what gets wages higher   said Vincent Reinhart  Chief Economist at investment manager Standish  and former head of the Fed s monetary affairs division  Even former skeptics have become open to the idea that a recent rise in productivity may turn into a trend  drawing comparisons with the  Great Moderation  period of growth during the 1990s  which also featured low unemployment and solid wage growth The rise in long term bond rates also may herald a return to more normal conditions  giving cautious investors a reasonable return after years of lackluster outcomes  and easing concerns about a flat or  inverted  yield curve that would herald loss of faith in the future  There is reason to think it may continue  To pay for the Republican tax cuts and the bump in defense spending  the Treasury is flooding the market with bonds at a near record pace  with gross issuance of bills  notes and bonds in August topping  1 trillion in a month for only the second time ever  according to federal SIFMA data  To sell all those bonds  the Treasury may have to pay higher rates  Meanwhile  a major customer  the Fed  whose purchases of  3 5 trillion of assets during and after the crisis helped foster the recovery  has started shrinking its bond portfolio by  50 billion a month  There are risks surrounding the week s development  and a few anomalies  The Fed  for example  is convinced that with its gradual continuing rate increases  inflation will remain controlled   even as unemployment dives for years to come below levels not seen since the 1960s  If inflation does kick in  as it might be expected to do with such a hot labor market and with Trump s tariffs pushing up the cost of some imports  it would force the Fed to speed up rate hikes and possibly end the party  Surging bond rates could also throw cold water on Powell s positive thinking  and call the Fed s whole strategy of gradual rate increases into question  High Treasury rates mean higher rates for mortgage lending  auto loans  and a host of other forms of credit that could slow the real economy more than the Fed would like    The tariffs  quotas  and trade threats are like shooting the starter s pistol to say  let s think about renegotiating  wages and salaries  said Reinhart   It is possible that the limited influence of resource slack on wages and prices was because we were just stuck   but  that could change    A  divergent  U S  economy  as Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester warned  could also mean a stronger dollar   and fewer exports and growth  But as she noted  for a decade now the concern has been about persistent weakness   that the economy was stuck in a state of what prominent economists deemed  secular stagnation   The return of volatility  of reasonable returns for savers  of wage pressure benefiting workers  may all pose risks  But they are the risks of a more normal world

114631,336146,AMP,Pricey U S  home sales soar as buyers ignore new tax code,news,"By Herbert Lash NEW YORK  Reuters    A housing shortage  strong economy and robust demand have pushed many homes in major U S  cities over  1 million  offsetting buyers  concerns about the reduced benefits of owning a pricey property under President Donald Trump s tax reform  data show  Home sales at  750 000 and above have surged by double digits annually in the past three years  closings data from realtor com show for 30 counties on the east and west coasts  Sales below  750 000 are down in the past two years due to a scarcity of homes priced around  500 000 and below and the lower end s larger market size has pulled down overall sales  the data show  While the Trump tax plan affects homes for sale above  750 000  the fact that overall sales fell suggests the new tax law is not the main culprit for the decline  The new law caps the deductibility of mortgage debt at  750 000 and annual property taxes at  10 000  This was expected to hurt home sales as fewer people would be able to utilize mortgage interest and property deductions when paying taxes   Overall sales in 30 counties with million dollar homes that realtor com examined fell 8 5 percent in December from a year ago and 7 0 percent year over year in January   But the number of homes sold above  750 000 actually grew in December and January  though they slowed to single digit gains of 7 9 percent and 4 8 percent from a year earlier  respectively  Ten counties accounted for three fourths of the 4 268 sales in January above  1 million  while half or more homes sold in San Mateo  San Francisco and Santa Clara counties in California and New York county  which is Manhattan  were above that mark   Our data suggests that in these high priced markets there was enough momentum in demand and enough inventory toward the end of last year and the beginning of 2018 to power sales growth in the  750 000 plus segment   Javier Vivas  director of economic research at realtor com  told Reuters  For an interactive graphic showing high end versus low end sales  click   The stock market boom and higher property values have helped propel the high end  said Russell Price  senior economist at Ameriprise Financial  NYSE AMP  Services Inc in Troy  Michigan   Those that can afford a  1 million plus property have seen their net worth benefit from asset price inflation over the last several years   Price said    This is a marked difference when compared to most working class Americans that primarily see their spending power and home affordability as a function of wage gains alone   The 30 county data from realtor com represent 98 percent of final closings unlike the less comprehensive  but more timely  samplings often used to indicate real estate activity  The counties account for 10 percent of all home sales and 60 percent of sales above  1 million  but just 1 percent of U S  counties   The new tax code created a pause among home buyers in December and is much discussed  said Paul Breunich  president and chief executive of William Pitt Julia B  Fee Sotheby s International Realty in Stamford  Connecticut   It s definitely having some effect but consumer confidence and the economy are overriding the tax costs   Breunich said  An overall sales decline in the 30 counties in December and January prompted an outcry from realtors about the tax reform s perceived impact  The falloff was in line with declining nationwide home sales during those two months  according to the National Association of Realtors  NAR   and sales rebounded in February  it said   Preliminary realtor com data for the 30 counties still show an overall  though slower  decline in February  But sales rose at the high end that month too  highlighting the supply constraint at the low end and strong demand for pricier homes  The variance is due to an accelerating decline in sales below  750 000 in the 30 counties and the shrinking size of that segment  which was almost three times larger than sales above that threshold in 2014  By last year it was less than double the size of the higher end where sales are still rising  TAX LAW TAKES BACK SEAT FOR NOW The supply demand imbalance is proving to be less acute at the higher price points and the overall pool of buyers in this segment remains large  Vivas said    While many that were on the fence of buying a million dollar home many have had to reassess their move   Vivas said   For many this year the purchase decision will be driven by finding the right home more than the new tax code   Most buyers see around  1 million as a  sweet spot  because if  200 000 is put down on a purchase there s still a tax break on a mortgage up to  750 000   That is how most buyers are viewing it   said Judi Desiderio  chief executive of Town   Country Real Estate in East Hampton  New York  adding accountants are very busy fielding calls from their clients  Sales have not been uniform  even within the same region  Manhattan had the sharpest overall sales slump from a year ago in January but the biggest gain was nearby Nassau county on Long Island  Both were 27 percent   one negative  the other positive  NAR in January estimated home prices would likely slide this year by 6 2 percent in New Jersey and 4 8 percent in New York  the biggest declines by state  due to the tax reform  New York had the highest average deduction of state and local taxes in 2014 at  21 000 per tax payer  according to the Urban Brookings Tax Policy Center  followed by Connecticut and New Jersey  But the high end remains hot and is a seller s market  Never before have there been more eyes on fewer homes  Vivas has said  A sampling of nationwide U S  housing data for March show the median listing price was up 8 percent from a year ago  surpassing the 2017 high  and the inventory of available homes for sale was down 8 percent year over year  realtor com said

114654,336169,AMP,Dow pops 20 000 and raises hopes rally is recharging,news,By Rodrigo Campos and Chuck Mikolajczak NEW YORK  Reuters    The Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJI  index s pop over 20 000 on Wednesday crowns a frenetic post U S  election rally that featured the second fastest ever climb between 1 000 point milestones in the Dow s 120 year history  The rally  driven by enthusiasm over pro growth policies from newly minted U S  President Donald Trump and an optimistic start to earnings season  has led to some speculation that stocks have run up too far  Analysts and investors  however  remain optimistic that the nearly nine year bull run in equities will continue as long as the economy and corporate profits continue to show growth   While the Dow hitting 20 000 is one of the least meaningful data points on my screen  it does suggest that the equity rally is pretty broad based   said Michael Purves  chief global strategist and head of derivatives research at Weeden   Co   What s important is that the Dow is going up    The 42 session surge from the first close above 19 000 was driven by financial stocks  specifically Goldman Sachs  N GS  and JPMorgan Chase  N JPM   which were together responsible for more than 20 percent of the move  The fastest move between these thousand point milestones was 24 trading days between 10 000 and 11 000  from March 29 to May 3 of 1999  The rise from 18 000 to 19 000 took the Dow 483 trading sessions  Much of the gains have come from stocks expected to benefit as the administration moves to put its policies in place   Banks have been among the best performers since the Nov  8 election of Trump  as investors bet that his expected fiscal stimulus will trigger inflation and bring higher interest rates  The largest contributor to the index s run from Nov  22 was Goldman  which has single handedly added over 170 points  Goldman is the only Dow component stock that trades above  200  so its influence in the price weighted index is naturally larger  The President expressed his enthusiasm over the milestone  with a  Great   tweet on the official Twitter account of the office   The advance has also been fueled by a solid start to quarterly earnings season  which has encouraged investors and helped equities resume their upward trajectory after consecutive weeks of modest declines    In our view  investors have focused too much on Trump   said Maximilian Kunkel  Ultra High Net Worth Investment Strategist at UBS Wealth Management   But it is clearly earnings that are driving the rally   Fourth quarter earnings are now expected to show growth of 6 8 percent  according to Thomson Reuters data  marking the strongest growth in two years   RED FLAGS The rise from Nov  22  when the Dow first closed above 19 000  has been so steep that the Dow is just over 2 percent away from hitting the level analysts expected at the end of 2017  according to the most recent Reuters poll  The pace of gains has caused some concern and increasingly cautious moves by some traders  The Dow s trailing price to earnings valuation is at 20 6   the highest level in over seven years   The big question for us is how much of that better earnings growth  or the anticipation of it  is already reflected in prices   said David Joy  chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial  NYSE AMP  in Boston    We need that earnings growth to justify the multiples where they already are   he said   Some analysts have cautioned that stocks could also be held back if the administration s policies become bogged down in the political process as the year rolls on  Other potential pitfalls would be a strengthening dollar and a Federal Reserve that may move more aggressively than anticipated    To the extent that there is room for disappointment on the policy side  we may see the market back away from these exuberant highs   said Bruce McCain  chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank  in Cleveland  Even if the Dow remains the proxy for stocks  performance for the person on the street  its importance as a benchmark has withered over time  A total of just  35 9 billion is indexed against it  compared with  2 1 trillion indexed against the S P 500  SPX   according to data from S P Dow Jones Indices  Market watchers played down the significance of the round number hit as a psychological milestone but not a particularly meaningful one   It s like watching your odometer cross over 100 000 or peeking up at the clock and noticing that it s exactly noon   said Brian Jacobsen  chief portfolio strategist at  Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC  Funds Management in Menomonee Falls  Wisconsin   There are no magic numbers  but we like to pretend that there are  ,2017-01-25,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/dow-pops-20,000-and-raises-hopes-rally-is-recharging-455666",455666

114672,336187,AMP,3 Reasons Why Ameriprise  AMP  Is A Great Growth Stock,opinion,"Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  However  it isn t easy to find a great growth stock 
In addition to volatility  these stocks carry above average risk by their very nature  Also  one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end 
However  it s pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Our proprietary system currently recommends Ameriprise Financial Services  NYSE AMP  as one such stock  This company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market  And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  
While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this financial services company is a great growth pick right now  we have highlighted three of the most important factors below 
Earnings Growth
Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth  as surging profit levels is what most investors are after  For growth investors  double digit earnings growth is highly preferable  as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Ameriprise is 15 5   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 11 8  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 10 5  
Cash Flow Growth
Cash is the lifeblood of any business  but higher than average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Ameriprise is 11 5   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 8 9  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 7 2  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 5 2  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is of course favorable here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
The current year earnings estimates for Ameriprise have been revising upward  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0 8  over the past month 
Bottom Line
While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Ameriprise a Zacks Rank  2 stock  it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above

Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times 
Ameriprise  which belongs to the Zacks Financial   Investment Management industry  posted revenues of  3 29 billion for the quarter ended December 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9 95   This compares to year ago revenues of  3 18 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Ameriprise shares have lost about 0 9  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 1 4  
What s Next for Ameriprise 
While Ameriprise has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Ameriprise was favorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

114675,336190,AMP,Legg Mason  LM  Hits Fresh High  Is There Still Room To Run ,opinion,"Shares of Legg Mason  LM  have been strong performers lately  with the stock up 8 6  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  40 61 in the previous session  Legg Mason has gained 10 3  since the start of the year compared to the  0 7  move for the Zacks Finance sector and the 5  return for the Zacks Financial   Investment Management industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on January 29  2020  Legg Mason reported EPS of  1 03 versus consensus estimate of  0 95 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 2 96  
For the current fiscal year  Legg Mason is expected to post earnings of  3 73 per share on  2 91 billion in revenues  This represents a 1081 58  change in EPS on a 0 27  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  4 12 per share on  2 97 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 10 59  and 2 13   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Legg Mason may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Legg Mason has a Value Score of A  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are B and B  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of A 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 10 6X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 4 2X versus its peer group s average of 10 3X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 0 8  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Legg Mason currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Legg Mason fits the bill  Thus  it seems as though Legg Mason shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come 
How Does Legg Mason Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of Legg Mason have been soaring  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also impressive  including Focus Financial Partners  FOCS   T  Rowe Price Group  TROW   and Ameriprise Financial  NYSE AMP   all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices

114690,336205,AMP,Traders nix bets on summer U S  rate hike after weak jobs report,news,"By Ann Saphir
 Reuters    Traders on Friday abandoned bets on a summer interest rate hike in the United States after a government report showed U S  employers added far fewer jobs in May than expected  suggesting economic growth may have lost some momentum 
The Federal Reserve is now expected to wait until November or later before raising rates  rather than doing so in July  based on the price of futures contracts tied to the Fed s benchmark policy rate 
Indeed  traders now see little chance of the Fed increasing rates more than once in 2016  in contrast to the Fed s view  in its most recent forecasts  that two hikes would be appropriate 
Nonfarm payrolls increased by only 38 000 jobs last month  the smallest gain since September 2010  the Labor Department said on Friday 
The slowdown in job gains  is quite surprising   said Russell Price  senior economist at Ameriprise Financial  NYSE AMP  Services Inc in Troy  Mich   The Fed was pretty much in line to raise rates on June 15  I think this is the number that really puts them on hold  

Traders see no rate hike until at least November  when they peg the probability of an increase at about a 52 percent chance  although it is just one week before the U S  presidential election  Traders put December at a 68 percent probability  based on Fed funds futures prices ",2016-06-03,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economic-indicators/traders-nix-bets-on-summer-u.s.-rate-hike-after-weak-jobs-report-406373,406373

114693,336208,AMP,N Y  investment adviser  lawyer indicted for insider trading,news,"By Nate Raymond
NEW YORK  Reuters    A Long Island investment adviser and a former partner at a major law firm have been indicted on charges that they engaged in insider trading ahead of  Pfizer   NYSE PFE  Inc s acquisition of King Pharmaceuticals Inc in 2010  prosecutors said on Wednesday 
Tibor Klein  who owned advisory firm Klein Financial Services  and Robert Schulman  a Washington  D C   patent lawyer who at the time was with the law firm Hunton   Williams  were charged in an indictment filed in Central Islip  New York 
Prosecutors said Klein  who lives in Melville  New York  learned about the planned  3 6 billion merger from Schulman  who had been representing King Pharmaceuticals in patent litigation since 2009 
Prosecutors said that on the basis of Schulman s tip  Klein bought stock in King on behalf of himself  Schulman and his advisory clients  enabling them to make a combined  300 000 in profits when the deal was announced 
Klein had also tipped a broker in Florida about the expected merger  who traded on the information and split the more than  100 000 in profits he made with Klein  prosecutors said 
Prosecutors did not name the broker  but an earlier U S  Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit identified him as Michael Shechtman  a former Ameriprise Financial Inc  NYSE AMP  stockbroker and friend of Klein s 
Shechtman pleaded guilty in November 2014 to conspiracy to commit securities fraud in connection with the case 
Both Klein  43  and Schulman  58  were arrested on charges of conspiracy and securities fraud and are expected to appear later on Wednesday in federal courts in Central Islip and Alexandria  Virginia  respectively 
 We are extremely disappointed by the government s decision to charge Mr  Klein   said Christopher Bruno  his lawyer   Mr  Klein intends to vigorously defend these charges at trial  
Christopher Mead  Schulman s attorney  in an email said the  evidence at trial will show that my client is innocent  
The indictment followed an earlier civil lawsuit in 2013 by the SEC against Klein and Shechtman over the same trades 
The criminal case  though  differs in terms of the SEC s lawsuit by alleging that Schulman  who was most recently a partner at the law firm Arent Fox  intentionally tipped Klein 
The SEC had by contrast alleged that Klein misappropriated the information from Schulman  who during an August 2010 meal at his home after several glasses of wine became intoxicated and blurted out   It would be nice to be King for a day

markets  the U S  dollar and most commodities if Republican candidate Donald Trump becomes the next U S  president  as appeared increasingly likely on Wednesday  Markets fear a Trump victory could trigger global economic and political turmoil  creating massive uncertainty for investors who had been counting on a win by Democrat Hillary Clinton  whose policies were seen as more staid but predictable   If current market moves hold or go further  there is likely to be quite a bit of de leveraging and forced selling tomorrow   Mohamed El Erian  chief economic adviser at Allianz  DE ALVG   said as global markets skidded   MKTS GLOB  Trump has threatened to rip up major trade agreements and impose barriers in the United States on imports from countries such as Mexico and China  which could reduce trade flows  harm already sluggish global growth and inflame geopolitical tensions   He s campaigned on three sort of core pillars   immigration  trade barriers and helping manufacturing get restored  He hasn t really articulated a clear plan and he is a volatile messenger   said Michael Purves  chief global strategist at Weeden   Co   You don t know whether he is going to carry through with that   Jack Ablin  chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago  forecast U S  stocks could drop as much as 10 percent over the next 10 sessions if Trump is elected to the most powerful office in the world   Foreign markets  particularly emerging markets  would take most of the brunt   he said   These are markets that rely more on selling to us than us selling to them    Market mayhem could also prevent the U S  Federal Reserve from raising interest rates as expected in December  and force other central banks to ease policy further  As the chance of a Trump upset grew  global markets plunged  with some losses eclipsing the carnage seen after Britain s shock vote to leave the European Union in late June   Whatever the outcome  this is a horribly angry electorate   said Daniel Alpert  managing partner at Westwood Capital LLC in New York   The markets will tank and then  those around Trump who have reasonable minds will script him with some pablum for the markets and calm them   But that is not the issue  The issue is that he cannot fulfill the goals of those who are in his crazy inner circle and  at the same time  truly address the interests of those who have risen up against the Washington consensus    Trump was leading Democrat Hillary Clinton in the Electoral College by a tally of 244 209 as of 0440 GMT  with some key swing states still too close to call  A tally of 270 is needed to win   The dollar  the Mexican peso and crude oil all plunged as Trump gained ground  Both the S P E mini futures and Nasdaq futures slid about 5 percent  likely wiping trillions of dollars of value off global financial markets  The slump in futures foreshadows a rocky start to U S  trading when markets open on Wednesday that could linger for weeks    If Trump wins  we see the S P falling to about 2 000 initially   from Tuesday s close of 2140  said David R  Kotok  Chairman and Chief Investment Officer  Cumberland Advisors in Florida   Equities and the economy are all about confidence  which would be fragile    the path for equities should be driven by Trump   Republican  leadership  the Fed and data   and whether they engender confidence  or not   Traditional safe havens such as sovereign bonds  the Japanese yen and gold all rallied  Emerging markets such as Mexico and companies related to them such as large U S  stocks with global exposure are likely to bear the brunt of panic selling  investors forecast   The MSCI Emerging Markets index plummeted 2 9 percent  its biggest one day drop since the June 24 Brexit shock   The Mexican peso is seen the bellwether for Trump s chances of a victory as his policies are damaging to Mexico s export heavy economy  It plunged more than 13 percent against the dollar to a record low as early projections put the maverick candidate with no political experience ahead    We d probably see a selloff in riskier assets  in particular emerging markets assets  particularly the Mexican peso   said Omer Esiner  chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington  D C   We re seeing that play out right now and I suspect if you see a Trump win we d be seeing a continuation of something like that   Many investors drew comparisons with the Brexit vote  when the British pound tumbled more than 11 percent and the MSCI World index dropped almost 5 percent in a single day as the shock outcome caught markets unaware  World stocks clawed back those initial losses in the following weeks as buyers hunted through the wreckage for bargains  though the pound has extended losses    With Brexit  we had one bad day  but this is different   said Donald Selkin  chief markets strategist at National Securities in New York    His tax cuts could open up a huge increase in the budget deficit and his trade sanctions could interrupt world trade  This could put us in a recession   Even if heavily sold global stocks attempt a rebound  gains are likely to be tempered by uncertainty over whether Trump will follow through on his aggressive campaign rhetoric with actual policies   A more isolationist trade policy in the U S  would be negative for the global economy more broadly  and especially a trade reliant nation such as Australia   said Craig James  chief economist at CommSec in Sydney  adding there were further risks if Trump adopted a more confrontationist policy toward China  David Joy  chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial  NYSE AMP  in Boston  agreed   If Trump wins    there is going to be a long period of uncertainty about what policy initiatives are likely to be enacted  what is going to be the response of the Fed  how are consumers going to respond  and if business is just going to put their hands in their pockets

114784,336299,AMP,Why Ameriprise  AMP  Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Ameriprise Financial Services  NYSE AMP   which belongs to the Zacks Financial   Investment Management industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This financial services company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 2 69  
For the most recent quarter  Ameriprise was expected to post earnings of  4 per share  but it reported  4 06 per share instead  representing a surprise of 1 50   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  3 61 per share  while it actually produced  3 75 per share  a surprise of 3 88  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Ameriprise lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Ameriprise has an Earnings ESP of  2 52  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate

While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments  income investors hone in on dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long term returns  with dividend contributions exceeding one third of total returns in many cases

Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits  It s important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout 
High growth firms or tech start ups  for example  rarely provide their shareholders a dividend  while larger  more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  AMP presents a compelling investment opportunity  it s not only an attractive dividend play  but the stock also boasts a strong Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  ",2019-08-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ameriprise-financial-services-amp-is-a-top-dividend-stock-right-now-should-you-buy-200460263,200460263

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 1 50   A quarter ago  it was expected that this financial services company would post earnings of  3 61 per share when it actually produced earnings of  3 75  delivering a surprise of 3 88  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
Ameriprise  which belongs to the Zacks Financial   Investment Management industry  posted revenues of  3 25 billion for the quarter ended June 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 10 11   This compares to year ago revenues of  3 20 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters

What s Next for Ameriprise 
While Ameriprise has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Ameriprise was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

114865,336380,AMP,Retirement Dividend Growth Portfolio Concentrated Or Diversified  Part 3,opinion,"Introduction
This article is a refresh and an update of an article I originally posted in 2015   However  the principles I am presenting are timeless and worthy of being revisited   Moreover  I have updated the supporting examples to more precisely reflect our current market environment 
Designing the common stock portion of your retirement portfolio is very challenging  For starters  there is not a perfect or even best way to design a stock portfolio  However  there are many effective strategies that have produced successful long term results  The key to success is to find and implement the strategy that best fits your own unique goals  objectives  needs  and most importantly   risk tolerances   More to the point  don t let anyone try to dictate what you should do   Instead  if you are using a professional advisor  you dictate to them what you want and need and most importantly would be comfortable with 
Common Stock Portfolio Design
This article is dealing with designing the common stock portion of your retirement portfolio   For some retired investors  this may be the whole portfolio   For others  they might want or feel more comfortable with some liquid cash assets  fixed income  etc  Nevertheless  this article is only dealing with the common stock portion 
There are many aspects associated with designing a common stock portfolio that need to be considered  The number of individual companies to include in your portfolio is a big one  In addition to the number of companies  how much weight you should put in each one  Should they be equally weighted  In other words  when constructing the portfolio should you put the exact same percentage of your portfolio in each company  Or  does it make more sense to overweight some and underweight others  Moreover  should you own stocks from every sector or just the sectors you like the best 
These are just a few of the important questions that investors must grapple with when designing a common stock portfolio  But most importantly  and I repeat myself  there is no absolute or perfect strategy for constructing a stock portfolio that fits every individual investor  On the other hand  there are important considerations that every individual investor would be well advised to contemplate  Ultimately  it comes down to designing a stock portfolio that suits you 
Therefore  my objective with this article is to provide some food for thought and common stock portfolio design ideas that I hope can help individual investors make better choices that fit and meet their own needs  I am a big proponent of applying logic and common sense to the investing process  Consequently  rather than just giving specific portfolio construction strategies  I also intend to offer some logical ways to look at common stock portfolio construction 
The Universal Principle  Start With A Plan
I believe that there is only one principle about constructing a common stock portfolio that universally applies to every investor  Prior to building any portfolio  common stock or otherwise  it is imperative that every investor starts by developing a comprehensive and detailed plan  Importantly  it s not only imperative to have a plan  it s even more vital to be disciplined about following it 
This is commonly referred to as an investment policy statement  IPS   However  an IPS generally goes beyond defining investment goals and objectives  it also takes into consideration risk tolerance  liquidity requirements and asset allocation  However  for the purposes of this specific article  I am simply referring to a well thought out plan design for the common stock portion of an overall portfolio  Therefore  my discussion will be limited to investment goals  objectives and risk tolerances 
Logically then  the first step in creating your investment plan is to clearly identify and determine your specific investment goals and needs  For example  if your primary objective is growth or total return  your focus might be best placed on a portfolio combination of growth stocks and or above average growing dividend growth stocks  In contrast  if your primary objective is current income  your focus might be best placed on a portfolio combination of blue chip dividend paying stalwarts and or high yield stocks 
Of course  there are many variations of what the most appropriate mix of stocks might be  Therefore  depending on your needs and risk tolerances  the mix of appropriate stocks are only limited by each investor s imagination coupled with their needs  Once again  there is not a perfectly right or wrong answer  except to design a portfolio that can meet your goals  and one that you are comfortable enough with to stay the course 
How Many Stocks Should My Portfolio Hold 
The question of how many stocks a portfolio should contain has been widely discussed  and even hotly debated  Some of the greatest investors that ever walked the planet have shared their views and opinions  and there have been numerous academic studies conducted as well  However  there really is no consensus  and many of the differing views are supported by compelling and logical arguments  Interestingly  the arguments of many renowned fundamental investors versus academics that have conducted studies are not that far apart 
Therefore  instead of supporting any specific number of holdings  I have chosen to offer some practical considerations that individual investors might think about  On the other hand  I will also share some of the views and opinions of others who have studied the subject of how many stocks to own 
The Simple and Basic Mathematics Behind How Many Stocks to Own
At the risk of being accused of stating the obvious  I believe it s important to consider and have a clear perspective of the basic mathematics behind how many stocks you own  In my opinion  this is important because it relates to the investor s risk tolerance  Additionally  it also relates to the potential rate of return a portfolio can achieve  So  let s look at some basic numbers 
For starters  let s assume that you are constructing an equal weighted portfolio  This simply means that when initially constructing your portfolio you place the same dollar amount and or percentage amount in each selection  Therefore  the number of stocks you place in a portfolio represents the percentage of your portfolio it comprises  The basic math is simple  If you hold 5 stocks  they each comprise 20  of your portfolio  If you hold 10 stocks  they each comprise 10   If you hold 20 stocks  they each represent 5   If you hold 25 stocks  they each represent 4   and so on 
The fewer stocks you own  the greater your exposure to good or to bad things happening in the future to each individual stock  For example  all things being equal  if you only hold 5 stocks  and 1 of them falls 50  in value  your overall portfolio would drop by 10   In contrast  if you hold 25 stocks  and 1 of them falls 50  in value  your overall portfolio would only drop 2   This represents the risk aspect discussed previously  The lower your tolerance for risk  the more stocks you should hold   and vice versa  Therefore  although this is pretty basic  I believe it s an important yet simple mathematical perspective to hold clearly in the back of your mind at all times 
Concentrated or Diversified  What Do The Experts Suggest 
Let s start with what academic studies have concluded  Frankly  I was surprised to discover that there are academic studies that support concentrated stock portfolios  For example  according to a MorningStar   academic professors Frank Riley and Keith Brown reported in their book  Investment Analysis And Portfolio Management  that about 90  of the maximum benefit of diversification was derived from portfolios of 12 to 18 stocks 
To paraphrase the report  this suggests that by owning only 18 stocks you will get the same return as investing in a passive market index  The report also suggested that if you own more than 18 stocks  you are simply increasing your workload without receiving much benefit  The MorningStar report went on to suggest that there is also a practical risk to being too diversified  The report implies that by owning more than 18 stocks it becomes nearly impossible to know your companies well enough 
I suggest that the reader follows the above link and read some of the other chapters on constructing a common stock portfolio  Frankly  this short course does a better job of discussing ways to build a common stock portfolio  and more succinctly than I can in this article 
As an investor with a strong orientation to valuation  I have made it a point to study the behaviors of the most renowned value investors that have ever lived  However  I am certainly not alone in that endeavor  There is an excellent website on value investing founded by fellow Seeking Alpha author Vishal Khandelwal that studies and reports on the behaviors and practices of prominent value investors and value investing in general 
In a post titled  How Many Stocks Should You Own    He offered a summary of the opinions of several legendary investors that I personally admire greatly as follows 
 Just to sum up  here is what the legends have advised on how many stocks you should own in your portfolio 
Ben Graham   10 to 30 with each company being large  prominent and conservatively financed 
John Keynes   2 to 3 companies which one thinks one knows something about and in the management of which one thoroughly believes 
Warren Buffett   5 to 10 if you are a know something investor  able to understand business economics and to find sensibly priced companies that possess important long term competitive advantages 
Seth Klarman   10 to 15 better off knowing a lot about a few investments than knowing only a little about each of a great many holdings  
Additionally  one of my favorite value investors of all time  Phil Fisher  had very strong opinions on how many stocks investors should hold  The following quote taken from the book  The Warren Buffett Way  by Robert G  Hagstrom nicely summarizes Phil Fisher s views 
 Phil Fisher taught Buffett the benefits of focusing on just a few investments  He believed that it was a mistake to teach investors that putting their eggs in several baskets reduces risk  The danger in purchasing too many stocks  he felt  is that it becomes impossible to watch all the eggs in all the baskets  In his view  buying shares in a company without taking the time to develop a thorough understanding of the business was far more risky than having limited diversification  
To summarize this section on how many stocks to put in a portfolio  I suggest that less is more  For anyone managing their own stock portfolio  a comprehensive understanding of each business you own is worth more than the marginal benefit of being more broadly diversified  On the other hand  if you are very sensitive to risk  you might need to own more stocks just for the peace of mind it brings 
For example  an equally weighted portfolio of 30 stocks means that each holding only represents a little over 3  of your total portfolio  Therefore  no calamitous disaster on one holding will affect your overall portfolio very much  Nevertheless  a portfolio of only 10 stocks might be too concentrated for many investors  Consequently  I believe an equally weighted portfolio of 20 to 25 stocks offers a good compromise for most investors  However  this is not an ironclad rule and many investors might only be comfortable holding more than 25 or 30 stocks  At the end of the day  it s really a matter of investor preference and risk tolerance   However  the mathematical realities discussed above could serve as a common sense guide 
Should You Equal Weight or Overweight Portfolio Holdings 
The answer to the question regarding how many stocks to hold in a portfolio discussed above related primarily to an equal weighted portfolio of stocks  However  there is also the question of overweighting versus equal weighting that can also affect the optimum number of stocks to hold in a portfolio  This is a question that many investors who self manage their own stock portfolios have as evidenced by the following comment by a reader on one of my past articles 
 Nice Summary Chuck  
I have a question which you might have an opinion on re  building a portfolio 
Is it better to equal dollar weight your stock selection  OR could you allocate the capital better by overweighting predicted higher annual ROR vs lower predicted annual ROR  I guess this would slant the portfolio a bit to perhaps more faster growing companies  
In response to this question  I offer the following statements and observations   There are advantages and disadvantages to both equal weighting of a stock portfolio and overweighting your holdings  To my way of thinking  the best course of action  as always  relates to the individual investor s own goals and to their risk tolerances  Additionally  each individual investor s general knowledge about investing in stocks coupled with the amount of time they have available for research are additional important factors 
To complicate matters more  there are numerous approaches and strategies that can be implemented with overweighting stocks in your portfolio  Unfortunately  I will only be able to address a few of the more prominent ones  However  I think it s important that the reader understands that there are many approaches towards overweighting a stock portfolio  but not necessarily a best one 
The 60 40  70 30  80 20 and 90 10 Approach
One conceptual approach that I have personally successfully implemented over my career for investors in the accumulation phase prior to retirement is one I call the 60 40  70 30  80 20 and 90 10 Approach  This common stock portfolio design concept primarily dealt with two broad categories of equally weighted common stocks   blue chip dividend paying stalwarts and growth oriented stocks 
The central idea is to build a solid foundation of conservative blue chips supplemented by riskier growth stocks  If both your risk tolerances and total return needs were high  you might put 60  of your money in conservative blue chips and 40  in more aggressive growth stocks  In contrast  if your risk tolerances were low but you still needed some additional growth  you might put 90  of your money in blue chips and only 10  in growth  Of course  each additional blend would be determined by the needs and risk tolerances of each individual investor  In essence  the more growth you choose  the higher your total return expectation  However  the more growth you choose  the more risk you must be willing to assume 
Variations of this approach could also be applied to already retired investors in need of income  In this situation you would blend your mix based on the yield characteristics of your individual selections  This could be blue chip dividend paying stalwarts such as Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  or Procter   Gamble  mixed in with the appropriate mix of higher yielding REITs and or MLPs 
The key is that your common stock portfolio should be custom designed to meet your own goals  needs and risk tolerances  There is no one size fits all  and each individual investor is unique and different  However  there are common sense tried and true principles that can be  and should be  commonly applied  Always starting with a well defined plan is a good example 
The More Aggressive Concentrated Diversified Approach
As the reader can imagine  there are numerous variations and common stock blending strategies that can be implemented than just those discussed above  Another one that I have successfully implemented is what I call the aggressive concentrated diversified approach  An example of this strategy might be to place 50  of your money into your top 5 selections  10  of your total in each   The remaining 50  of your money could be heavily diversified by putting 2  increments into 25 additional companies  or even 1  increments into 50 additional companies 
With this strategy  you are very selective with your top 5 holdings in the first place  and in the second place  you research  watch and monitor them closely and comprehensively  To be clear  your top 5 holdings are intensely researched and focused upon  With the remaining  for example 25 or 50  you allow the principle of broader diversification to take care of them  The idea here is to swing at the fences with half of your money and look for singles and doubles with the other half 
Although this is a risky portfolio construction strategy  it can pay off enormously in the long run  The 5 stocks you are overweight in could be aggressive growth stocks capable of producing the 10   20  or 30 baggers that Peter Lynch talked about in his book  One Up On Wall Street   The remaining stocks could be comprised of more conservative blue chip dividend payers  If you want to be really aggressive with a total return objective  every stock could be aggressive growth  Once again  the variations are endless  It all comes down to your own goals and risk tolerances 
As an interesting aside  Peter Lynch utilized a variation of this strategy  but at a different scale  when he ran the Fidelity Magellan fund  In his book  One Up On Wall Street  in the chapter  Designing A Portfolio  he had this to say 
 Some people ascribe my success to my having specialized in growth stocks  But that s only partly accurate  I never put more than 30  to 40  of my funds assets in the growth stocks  The rest I spread out among the other categories described in this book  Normally I keep about 10  to 20  or so in the stalwarts  another 10  to 20  or so in the cyclicals  and the rest in turnarounds  Although I own 1400 stocks in all  half of my funds assets are invested in 100 stocks  and two thirds in 200 stocks  1  of the money is spread out among 500 secondary opportunities I am monitoring periodically  with the possibility of tuning in later  
After reading the above  the reader should consider that Peter Lynch had billions of dollars to deal with and invest  as well as a large staff of associates to assist him  Obviously  for us average investors out there  our resources are much more limited  Nevertheless  the underlying principles that Peter Lynch was articulating appropriately apply  only the scale of our resources is different 
The Importance Of Sound Valuation On The Buy Side
One of the most important principles that I ve often previously discussed is only investing in stocks at sound valuation  It doesn t matter whether you re buying growth stocks  blue chip stalwarts or any of the other categories discussed in this series   investing at sound valuation matters  You can equally weight your portfolios or use an overweight strategy like what I presented above  and sound valuation matters regardless 
There are many ways to control risk  proper diversification is certainly one of them  But so is being prudent when purchasing stocks  any stock  So  from my point of view  the best portfolio construction advice that I can offer is always to focus on value  And although this is critical on the buy side  it also importantly applies to the sell side  In other words  no matter how you ve constructed it  once your portfolio is constructed  focusing on valuation is a tried and true portfolio management technique

As I ve done in previous articles in this series  I am going to offer some examples of common stocks possessing certain characteristics that were referenced above   I do want the reader to understand that these characteristics are entirely different than the categories discussed in part 2   When reviewing the associated performance results  take special note of the level of dividend income versus the S P 500 that each of the higher yielding samples have produced   In contrast  note how the capital appreciation component of the growth stocks generated all the return with little or no dividend income 
Finally  in each of the categories that Peter Lynch discussed  it is possible to find stocks that possess the characteristics I will be offering below   In other words  categories and characteristics are different things   I will be elaborating in the analyze out loud video that follows 
Enbridge Inc   ENB   Characteristics  Above Average Growth High Yield









Simon Property Group  NYSE SPG   Characteristics   Moderate Growth High Yield









Ameriprise Financial Inc  NYSE AMP   Characteristics  Above Average Growth Moderate Yield









 Cigna Corp   NYSE CI   Characteristics   High Growth Low Yield









Facebook  NASDAQ FB   Characteristics  High Growth No Yield









The above are just a few examples of the many options that common stocks offer to investors   I hope the reader understands that the true scope of the variations in common stocks would be far too extensive to cover in one article   Therefore  what I hope to accomplish with the few examples I presented is the recognition on the reader s part that stocks come in various sizes  shapes and flavors   More to the point  these variations can be chosen and or integrated into a portfolio that can perform according to an individual investor s unique goals or objectives

Summary and Conclusions
There is no consensus on the best way to construct a common stock portfolio  On the other hand  there are many practical methods that have proven successful  Perhaps most importantly of all  is that each investor should  know thyself   The odds are very low that your portfolio can produce the results you want and need if it is not constructed in a way that is compatible with your own psyche and goals  The key to any well designed portfolio strategy lies in your ability to effectively implement it over time  If your holdings make you uncomfortable  no matter how conservative or aggressive they may be  you can end up being your portfolio s own worst enemy 
Additionally  I believe that portfolios should be goal specific oriented  Instead of worrying about beating the market or generating the highest total returns  I believe it makes more sense to build a portfolio that meets your needs  If you need maximum income   invest for that  If growth is your goal   invest for that  Every common stock portfolio has a job to do  and therefore  it should be designed with a clear and specific focus on achieving those goals 
As an aside  I consider this common refrain   about investing in index funds because you can t beat the market   a lot of nonsense   For starters  at any given moment in time  the market can be either overvalued or undervalued   Therefore  as I often state  measuring performance without simultaneously measuring valuation is a job half done   Furthermore  remember that no matter what the quality  an overvalued stock is significantly riskier than an undervalued stock   Additionally  an index fund may not produce the level of income the investor needs  while a carefully constructed dividend growth portfolio could   There is more to portfolio performance than total return  which when stocks are overvalued could be a risky illusion 
Importantly  in order to achieve your goals  you must start out with a well thought out plan  Constructing an appropriate common stock portfolio should never be about throwing a bunch of mud on the wall and hoping that some of it sticks  To me it makes much more sense to invest in the types of common stocks that are aligned with your objectives and risk tolerances 
Most great investors recommend knowing as much about the companies you own as is humanly possible  I contend that the same advice relates to your portfolio as well  Each investor should have a clear perspective and understanding of what their portfolios are designed to do  and whether each of the individual parts can get the job done 
Finally  if you are desirous of self managing your own portfolios  there is no substitute for continuously conducting comprehensive research and due diligence  This requires the willingness and ability to allocate the proper time and attention to your portfolios  This principle supports concentration over excessive diversification  And in the long run  it also pays to have the proper tools at your disposal  In today s Internet age  many tools are available for free  Other tools such as the FAST Graphs  fundamentals analyzer software tool that I use require a modest fee  Nevertheless  the point is to develop a plan  acquire the tools to execute the plan  and be as precise as possible in what stocks you select and whether their attributes are compatible with your needs

Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  and investors often view it by its dividend yield  a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long term returns  with dividend contributions exceeding one third of total returns in many cases

Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits  It s important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout 
For instance  it s a rare occurrence when a tech start up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend  It s more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends  During periods of rising interest rates  income investors must be mindful that high yielding stocks tend to struggle  That said  they can take comfort from the fact that AMP is not only an attractive dividend play  but is also a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  ",2019-07-07,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/are-you-looking-for-a-highgrowth-dividend-stock-ameriprise-financial-services-amp-could-be-a-great-choice-200437688,200437688
114894,336409,AMP,Ameriprise Financial Services  AMP  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Q2 Release,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on lower revenues when Ameriprise Financial Services  NYSE AMP  reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This financial services company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  4 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  11 1  
Revenues are expected to be  2 95 billion  down 7 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Ameriprise 
For Ameriprise  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  2  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Ameriprise will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Ameriprise would post earnings of  3 61 per share when it actually produced earnings of  3 75  delivering a surprise of  3 88  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

From greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages  investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  But  not every company offers a quarterly payout 
Big  established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  but it s fairly uncommon to see high growth businesses or tech start ups offer their stockholders a dividend  During periods of rising interest rates  income investors must be mindful that high yielding stocks tend to struggle  That said  they can take comfort from the fact that AMP is not only an attractive dividend play  but also represents a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  ",2019-05-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-ameriprise-financial-services-amp-is-a-great-dividend-stock-right-now-200422193,200422193

114929,336444,AMP,Can Value Investors Pick Ameriprise Financial  AMP  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Ameriprise Financial  Inc    NYSE AMP   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Ameriprise Financial has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 10 2  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares quite favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 17 89  However  if we focus on the long term PE trend  Ameriprise Financial s current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 12 33 over the past five years The stock s PE also compares favorably with the Finance Market s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 14 05  This indicates that the stock is quite undervalued right now  compared to its peers Now  Ameriprise Financial has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 9 51  which is lower than the current level  So  it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Ameriprise Financial stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Ameriprise Financial has a P S ratio of just 1 67  This is quite lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 24x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Ameriprise Financial currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Ameriprise Financial a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Ameriprise Financial might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of F and a Momentum Score of C  This gives AMP a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of D   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been bullish  The current quarter has seen two upward revision versus no downward revisions over the past sixty days  while the full year estimates have seen two upward and no downward revisions in the past sixty days This has had a positive impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has shot up 3 4  over the past two months  while the full year estimate has surged 2 9   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Ameriprise Financial  Inc  Price and Consensus   Such bullish analyst sentiments is the reason why the stock has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and why we are looking for outperformance from the company in the near term Bottom LineAmeriprise Financial is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Also  a strong industry rank  among Top 35  of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  2 instils optimism in the stock However  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below We believe  despite an unsatisfactory past industry performance  good industry and Zacks ranks and a signal that the stock is likely to benefit from favorable broader factors in the immediate future  Add to this robust value metrics  and we believe that we have a strong value contender in AMP The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47

114950,336465,AMP,Analysts Estimate Ameriprise Financial Services  AMP  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Ameriprise Financial Services  NYSE AMP  reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 24  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This financial services company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  3 61 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  2 4  
Revenues are expected to be  3 04 billion  down 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 26  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Ameriprise 
For Ameriprise  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Ameriprise will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Ameriprise would post earnings of  3 68 per share when it actually produced earnings of  3 80  delivering a surprise of  3 26  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss

114954,336469,AMP,Ameriprise  AMP  Moves To Buy  Rationale Behind The Upgrade,opinion,"Ameriprise Financial Services  NYSE AMP  could be a solid choice for investors given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   An upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices    has triggered this rating change 
The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company s changing earnings picture  The Zacks Consensus Estimate    the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell side analysts covering the stock    for the current and following years is tracked by the system 
The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors  since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
As such  the Zacks rating upgrade for Ameriprise is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  and the near term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated  That s partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock 
For Ameriprise  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company s underlying business  And investors  appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Ameriprise
For the fiscal year ending December  2019  this financial services company is expected to earn  15 90 per share  which is a change of 6 4  from the year ago reported number 
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Ameriprise  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 0 9  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

The upgrade of Ameriprise to a Zacks Rank  2 positions it in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions  implying that the stock might move higher in the near term ",2019-04-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ameriprise-amp-moves-to-buy-rationale-behind-the-upgrade-200412836,200412836
114955,336470,AMP,This Is Why Ameriprise Financial Services  AMP  Is A Great Dividend Stock,opinion,"Whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  all investors love seeing their portfolios score big returns  However  when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments  income investors hone in on dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long term returns  with dividend contributions exceeding one third of total returns in many cases 
Ameriprise Financial  NYSE AMP  Services in Focus
Based in Minneapolis  Ameriprise Financial Services  AMP  is in the Finance sector  and so far this year  shares have seen a price change of 41 53   The financial services company is paying out a dividend of  0 9 per share at the moment  with a dividend yield of 2 44  compared to the Financial   Investment Management industry s yield of 2 95  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 89  
Looking at dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  3 60 is up 2  from last year  Over the last 5 years  Ameriprise Financial Services has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 11 09   Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company s payout ratio  a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Right now  Ameriprise s payout ratio is 24   which means it paid out 24  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Looking at this fiscal year  AMP expects solid earnings growth  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  15 90 per share  with earnings expected to increase 6 43  from the year ago period 
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits  However  not all companies offer a quarterly payout 
Big  established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  but it s fairly uncommon to see high growth businesses or tech start ups offer their stockholders a dividend  Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  AMP presents a compelling investment opportunity  it s not only an attractive dividend play  but the stock also boasts a strong Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  ",2019-04-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/this-is-why-ameriprise-financial-services-amp-is-a-great-dividend-stock-200412928,200412928

115004,336519,AMP,Ameriprise Financial Services  AMP  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Ameriprise Financial Services  NYSE AMP  reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 30  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This financial services company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  3 68 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  12 9  
Revenues are expected to be  3 18 billion  up 0 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2 36  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Ameriprise 
For Ameriprise  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Ameriprise will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Ameriprise would post earnings of  3 61 per share when it actually produced earnings of  3 74  delivering a surprise of  3 60  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Ameriprise doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ameriprise-financial-services-amp-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200378473,200378473

115244,336759,AMP,3 Numbers  German Industrial Output Expected To Rise Again For June ,opinion,"Economists expect a sixth consecutive rise in German industry output in June
Some analysts think that Germany s economy is at risk of overheating
The Eurozone Sentix Investor Confidence Index should reaffirm bullish sentiment
A firmer reading is projected for July for the US Labor Market Conditions Index
Industrial activity for Germany is the main event for economic news in Europe today  We ll also see new numbers for the Sentix Investor Confidence Index in the Eurozone and the Federal Reserve s US Labor Market Conditions Index 
Germany  Industrial Production  0600 GMT   Factory orders in Europe s largest economy rose more than forecast in June  according to Friday s report from the Economy Ministry  The news offers fresh evidence for anticipating that economic activity will accelerate in the second half of the year 
 The order numbers are another mosaic tile in what is a very positive picture of the economy   an economist at Nordea 
Recent survey data for Germany s manufacturing sector is also strong  Although the Manufacturing PMI for the country slipped to 58 1 in July   a five month low   the latest reading is still quite strong and holding at well above the neutral 50 mark 
 The recent strength of the PMI was corroborated by official data in May which saw manufacturing output growth accelerate to 4 9  year over year    an economist at IHS Markit  
Today s hard data on industrial activity for June  however  is expected to decelerate to a modest 0 2  monthly advance  the slowest gain so far this year  according to TradingEconomics com s consensus forecast 
Today s numbers hint at a softer round of numbers for the industrial sector  but some analysts think that Germany s economy is at risk of overheating   The German economy is already growing above its potential for the fifth year in a row   an economist at  Deutsche Bank  As a result  economic risk is rising  including the potential that the country s widely praised competitiveness on the international stage will weaken 
By that standard  today s data on industrial activity may be welcomed if  as expected  the profile for June shows a bit less froth in the industrial sector 

Eurozone  Sentix Investor Confidence Index  0830 GMT   The stronger run of economic growth this year for the Eurozone is an encouraging sign  but it s a complicating factor for the European Central Bank s monetary policy  One byproduct of the firmer macro trend is the strengthening of the euro  Some analysts estimate that the currency s real exchange rate has touched a three year high recently 
One repercussion from the trend is an outlook for softer inflation  An economist at Berenberg estimates that the euro s climb since June will pare inflation by 0 2 percentage points this year and 0 4 percentage points next year   That would be a significant impact   Kallum Pickering told FT last week   It could imply a slower pace of tapering next year  
Will today s update on investor sentiment alter the bullish outlook for the economy or the euro  Probably not  The Euro Coin Indicator s July reading held above the 0 6  mark  suggesting that third quarter GDP growth in Q3 will remain on track to match Q2 s solid pace 
The Eurozone Composite PMI also paints an upbeat profile for last month s macro trend   The surveys indicated a slight cooling in the pace of growth in July  but this is still an encouragingly upbeat picture of business conditions   said the chief economist at IHS Markit 
Considering the tailwind of late  today s Sentix update will probably offer another optimistic data point 

US  Labor Market Conditions Index  1400 GMT   The US economy added more jobs than expected in July  providing support for analysts who project that growth is on a stable  healthy course   At first blush  the payrolls report  is pretty strong   said the chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial  NYSE AMP  
Despite the revival in growth last month  including faster wage growth  the year over year change in payrolls continued weaken  easing to a 1 5  increase   close to the slowest advance in four years 
The deceleration isn t a new phenomenon  The labour market s annual pace peaked at nearly 2 3  in February 2015 and has been sliding ever since  albeit gradually in fits and starts 
The question is whether the ongoing slowdown in the annual rate of growth is a sign that the economy will cool in this year s second half  Today s July update of the Fed s Labor Market Conditions Index  LMCI   a multi factor measure  may provide a new clue 
TradingEconomics com s econometric estimate sees LMCI ticking up to 2 0 from June s 1 5 reading  That s enough to keep the economy s bulls happy  at least for now  A downside surprise  on the other hand  may signal that the labour market s softer annual growth rate will continue in the months ahead

115307,336822,AMP,Is Ameriprise Financial  AMP  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Ameriprise Financial  Inc    NYSE AMP   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Ameriprise Financial has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12 95  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 19 99  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Ameriprise Financial s current PE ratio somewhat below its midpoint  which is 13 02  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Finance sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 14 79  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Ameriprise Financial has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 11 91  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Ameriprise Financial stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Ameriprise Financial has a P S ratio of about 1 74  This is substantially lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 44 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Ameriprise Financial currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  B   putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes AMP a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Ameriprise Financial might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  F  and a Momentum score of  B   This gives AMP a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  D    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current quarter has seen two estimates go higher in the past sixty days and two lower  while the full year estimate has seen four upward and no downward revisions in the same time period This has had a favorable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has inched up by 0 4  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has risen by about 1 8   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below AMERIPRISE FINANCIAL SERVICES  INC  Price and Consensus    Despite this positive trend  the stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which indicates expectations of in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineAmeriprise Financial is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  despite a decent industry rank  top 38  out of more than 250 industries   a Zacks Rank  3  makes it hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks Financial Investment Management sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for the broader factors to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick

   Earnings WhispersOur proven model indicates that Ameriprise is likely to beat the earnings estimates this time  Note that a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or at least 2  Buy  or 3  Hold  to have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings  This is the case here  as elaborated below Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP for Ameriprise is  2 09   This is because the Most Accurate estimate of  2 44 is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 39 Zacks Rank  Ameriprise carries a Zacks Rank  3  which increases the predictive power of ESP  This  along with a positive ESP  increases the chances of a beat in the upcoming release 
So  will Ameriprise be able to reverse the trend this earnings season or will it succumb to industry wide challenges  Let s check how things have shaped up prior to the earnings release Factors to Impact Q3 ResultsAmeriprise is expected to have witnessed better profitability during the quarter  due to the company s persistent initiatives to improve its business  Further  we expect Advice   Wealth Management segment s  AWM  performance to drive the company s results  The AWM segment had delivered a growth in assets in the previous quarter  Based on expectations of improved advisor productivity  the same is expected to continue in the to be reported quarter 
Also  margin expansion in anticipated to have taken place in the AWM and Asset Management segments during the quarter 
However  due to the persistent low interest rate environment  new sales are anticipated to have been limited during the quarter  As a result  Annuities  fixed income book is expected to gradually run off  This  in turn  will lead to a marginal decline in earnings 
Notably  the institutional funding which was anticipated in the second quarter of 2016  but was delayed due to Brexit  would result in  2 6 billion worth of institutional net outflows in the third quarter  including approximately  2 billion of very low fee  short duration fixed income mandates  Moreover  costs associated with advertising and technology upgrades are anticipated to ramp up the company s expenses Also  owing the new DOL regulation  operating expenses are likely to slightly trend up during the quarter  Hence  on the whole  total operating expenses should move up in the third quarter Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few finance stocks that you may want to consider  as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the upcoming announcements Raymond James Financial  Inc    NYSE RJF   is slated to release its results on Oct 26  The company has an Earnings ESP of  2 04  and carries a Zacks Rank  2  You can see

115469,336984,AMP,October s Wild Ride For Alternatives ,opinion,"October s Wild Ride
October created quite a wild ride for investors across investment strategies and asset classes  The S P 500 Index was off by more than 5 5  by October 15th while the DJ Euro Stoxx 50 Index was down 11  by mid month  The VIX began the month at about 16 but spiked to more than 31 intraday on the 15th  All appeared lost as hedge funds  specifically event driven funds  were facing large losses due to the AbbVie   Shire deal falling apart  Hedge funds de risked  investors panicked  close family members began calling me asking whether they should go to cash  all signs of what was to follow over the next couple of weeks  By the end of the month domestic equity indexes were all solidly in the green  The VIX fell to lower levels than it began the month  closing at 14 52  and once again all was right in the world  Except for the fact that many investors  hedge funds among the worst offenders  sold risk exactly at the worst possible moment  This left most hedge fund indexes flat to down for the month and investors rather disappointed 

Liquid Alts Corner The big story on fund flows for the month was the large losses in long short equity driven almost entirely by MainStay Marketfield Fund  which shed more than  2 2 billion in assets bringing YTD losses to nearly  3 7 billion  In addition  even those who were still garnering assets  such as the Gotham Absolute Return Fund and Robeco Boston Partners L S Research Fund  did slow at a much slower rate  Multialternative continued to raise assets  bringing the categories YTD flows just ahead of long short equity at nearly  7 3 billion after raising  550 million during October  Blackstone Alternative Mult Strategy Fund led the category with  100 million in flows  Managed Futures was the only other category with positive flows  bringing in  360 million as Catalyst Hedged Futures and AQR Managed Futures Strategy Fund each gained a bit under  100 million in assets 

Making Hedge Funds Look Cheap Jason Kephart of Morningstar did a nice write up in HFMWeek recently regarding ways many liquid alternatives are less than fully transparent with the actual fees paid by the end investor 


Recently  the low cost focus has shifted to the hedge fund world  where management fees of 2  and performance fees of 20  have historically been the norm  The September announcement by the California Public Employees  Retirement System  CalPERS   the nation s largest pension fund  is ending its investment in hedge funds  partly because of the costs   and will likely only increase their scrutiny on fees 
Some observers view the focus on hedge fund costs as a positive for liquid investments  which  for the most part  are cheaper than hedge funds  The average liquid alternative mutual fund charges about 1 8  with no performance fee  and such funds come with the bonus features of daily liquidity and portfolio holding transparency  both scarce in the hedge fund world 
Indeed  that trinity of features included in liquid alternatives has already led to an influx of investor cash  Liquid alternative mutual funds took in net inflows of  20bn YTD through August and total net assets now stand at  161bn  up from  50bn in 2009 
There is a small subset of managed futures funds  however  that notably lack two of those features  About one third of the 50 managed futures mutual funds available today don t fully disclose fees or portfolio holdings to investors  These funds are investing indirectly in third party CTAs through total return swaps  The swaps allow the mutual funds to hire underlying managers that aren t willing to give up their performance fee  a fee that is restricted in mutual funds by the Investment Company Act of 1940  The total return swaps also act as a kind of invisibility cloak for the management and performance fees of the third party CTAs and their underlying holdings    


Columbia and Blackstone Join in Liquid Alts Initiative


Blackstone Alternative Asset Management agreed to research and develop an investment offering  according to a statement today from the Columbia business at Ameriprise Financial Inc   AMP   Class A shares of the mutual fund will be available to the general public with a minimum initial investment of  2 000 for most buyers  and the maximum sales charge is listed as 5 75 percent  according to a prospectus  Blackstone funds will be included as part of Columbia s offerings 
Asset managers have been adding alternative mutual funds to win clients and generate fee revenue  The offerings use approaches traditionally employed by hedge funds  such as betting against stocks through short sales or investing in non traditional assets  including leveraged loans and commodities  Boston based Columbia hired William Landes from Gottex Fund Management Holdings Ltd  in June to expand specialized strategies 
 The objective is modest volatility  downside risk protection  and diversification against the other assets in the portfolio   Landes said in an interview today   I would argue if a category like alternatives is able to deliver that  it is applicable to anyone s portfolio 


 In The News
Tough Month for Hedge Funds As mentioned above  it has been quite a gruesome month for many large hedge funds 


This month has not been kind to some of the biggest names in the industry  with the likes of Brevan Howard Asset Management  Fortress Investment Group  Pershing Square Capital Management  Tudor Investment Corp   and York Capital Management all suffering losses  some of them sizeable  Most notably  global macro funds which posted big gains in September  marking a turnaround from a brutal first eight months returned to their losing ways 
None more so that Discovery Capital Management  whose  15 billion flagship dropped 11 2  in the first half of October  more than doubling its year to date decline  Both Tudor and Brevan Howard s macro strategies shed about 3  in the first two weeks of the month  putting the latter back in the red for the year after it managed to climb out of it in September 
Graham Capital Management s  800 million Proprietary Matrix Fund is down 5  this month  erasing its year to date gains  A levered version of the same strategy shed 10   Rubicon Fund Management s Global Fund is also down 5  this month  Moore Capital Management shed 1 43  in the first week of October  increasing its year to date decline to 5 38  
It isn t only global macro managers struggling  Owl Creek Asset Management shed 9 1  through Oct  17 and is now down 12 9  on the year 


Porsche  OTC POAHY   The Hedge Fund that Also Made Cars


In 2008  Porsche was cruising  The luxury car manufacturer generated  13 5 BN in pre tax profit  and sold a record 98 652 automobiles   a staggering  136K profit per car sold  Even for a luxury brand  the numbers seemed nearly impossible  Upon closer inspection   11 5 billion dollars of that profit wasn t from selling cars   it was from speculating on financial derivatives  Porsche was furtively amassing a sizable position in call options to buy up Volkswagen shares  As a report from the BBC put it  Porsche was  a hedge fund with a carmaker attached   In 2008  the car business was good  but the financial engineering business was even better


In The ClassroomLong Short Equity Analysis

Among the true liquid alternative categories tracked by Morningstar  Long Short Equity is by far the largest in terms of assets under management  Contributing factors to the popularity of the strategy are the fact that the investment argument is intuitive and compelling  liquidity is a lower order concern than for many alternative strategies  and investors need not radically shift their thinking around asset allocation and portfolio construction in order to take advantage of these strategies  We ll explore each of those ideas in turn 

Cliff Asness  Somewhat Tepid Defense of hedge Funds As usual  AQR s Cliff Asness offered some great thoughts when it comes to analyzing hedge funds and the absurdity of direct comparisons to stock index returns  It is definitely worth a quick browse at the very least  From the conclusion 


Many of the current articles that are critical of hedge funds may be giving good advice  but for the wrong reasons  Hedge funds  broadly speaking  are  and always have been  net long equities  but nowhere near fully invested  That is  again  they have betas between 0 0 and 1 0  two numbers that would both be much easier to analyze than the truth  Their performance in the specific years often cited  2008 and 2013  are much less anomalous when this is acknowledged  2008 was not as bad for hedge funds as it looks when they are viewed alone  as they are net long and expected to fall with the market  and 2013 s underperformance versus the market is not as bad as hedge funds are not close to fully invested  and thus  not generally expected to keep up with a skyrocketing market 


And Lastly  From everyone at 361  we wish you a wonderful Thanksgiving holiday filled with family  friends  and great food  And best of luck to those Black Friday shoppers and remember to use Alt Tab on Cyber Monday

115470,336985,AMP,What Is The  Market   ,opinion,"Commentators are constantly bombarding the public with news regarding the  market   It seems that every  market  move can be explained by the action of our President  OPEC  Draghi  Yellen  or a Goldman Sach s analyst  As we all consume the commentary  we tend to ignore a glaring question  what is the  market   To many it s the Dow Jones Industrial Average  as this seems the most frequently quoted in the media  To others  it s the S P 500 Index  as it includes the vast majority of well known U S  companies  To some  it s what their neighbor says they have made this year at the neighborhood holiday party 
Some may wonder why this even matters and what it has to do with alternative investments  The answer is that when trying to analyze how a portfolio or money manager has performed  it is important to understand what  market  is the appropriate comparison and what the drivers of performance have been  This is especially true when looking at months such as October and November when spreads between different markets were large  oil was down more than 14  while the Nasdaq 100 was up 4 6   or when portfolio changes made mid month drastically change performance outcomes  the S P 500 was down 5 5  MTD through October 15th then reversed direction  gaining 8 4  in the second half of the month   When markets exhibit volatility  and dispersion between markets is high  investors need to ignore the commentators  and their neighbors  and instead endeavor to understand what is driving returns  Only then can useful conclusions be had 
Liquid Alts Corner

Long Short Equity once again experienced the largest outflows among alternative funds  with nearly  900 million in net redemptions during November  However  this was due almost entirely to the MainStay Marketfield Fund  which shed another  1 6 billion during the month  and has now seen more than  5 billion exit during the year  The largest inflow was for the V2 Hedged Equity Fund  which launched during the month with  243 million  Market Neutral funds also saw outflows  which totaled about  140 million  The Arbitrage Fund was the largest contributor  with roughly  100 million coming out of the fund during the month  Offsetting some of the outflows was the PIMCO Fundamental Advantage Absolute Return Strategy  which gained  274 million  bringing its year to date growth to  825 million  Finally  the Multi alternative universe was once again the largest asset gathering category  with  790 million in positive flows  Funds within the category saw widespread inflows  with the GMO Special Opportunities Fund garnering the most assets  as investors added  150 million into the fund during the month

Hedge Funds In The NewsNot Everyone is Jumping on the Liquidity Bandwagon as Lockups Return Hedge fund managers want their lockups back and they are willing to negotiate  For years  liquidity has been the byword among investors  driving hedge funds to reduce or even abandon lock up periods  during which clients are restricted from redeeming  But as the industry s performance has waned  some firms are looking to hold on to money for longer  enabling them to invest in more illiquid and potentially profitable opportunities 
Two thirds of new hedge funds insisted on lock ups of a year or more  according to eVestment  with the average fund imposing a 377 day wait before allowing withdrawals without penalty  But to win over skeptical clients  many are offering fee reductions in exchange for the reduced liquidity  The Wall Street Journal reports  with the size of the reduction tied to the length of the lockup 

AlphaMetrix Settles with Feds
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has reached a settlement with former futures fund manager AlphaMetrix that requires the defunct company to pay  5 6 million  though it s unlikely that payment will ever be made in full 
The agreement was filed yesterday in the U S  District Court for the Northern District of Illinois in Chicago and a hearing on it is scheduled for Dec  16  It calls for AlphaMetrix to pay restitution of  2 8 million  plus interest  and a civil monetary penalty of  2 8 million  While there would be a priority on paying the  2 8 million to investors still owed money  the penalty isn t likely to be collected 
The agency sued AlphaMetrix in November 2013 after it became apparent that the Chicago based firm s top executives were using money they owed fund managers and investors to prop up the failing firm s finances 
At the time  the National Futures Association shut the firm down and the CFTC received court authority to freeze AlphaMetrix s assets and appoint a federal receiver  who over the past year has been liquidating the assets to repay fund managers  investors and other creditors  The investors are owed about  3 5 million in rebates and the managers are owed about  7 2 million in rebates  according to the receiver s filings in court 

In The Classroom Among the truly alternative mutual fund categories tracked by Morningstar  Long Short Equity is by far the largest  with approximately  56 billion in assets under management as of November 30  As we stated in last month s Alternatives Briefing  the popularity of the category is understandable  as the investment argument is intuitive and compelling  liquidity is a lower order concern than for many alternative strategies  and investors need not radically shift their thinking around asset allocation and portfolio construction in order to take advantage of these strategies  But there is one complicating factor  and that is identifying skilled managers in the space  which is no small task  So how should investors evaluate long short equity managers 

If you d like our thoughts on the subject  please
