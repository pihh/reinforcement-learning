0,221515,NIO,Why Shares of Chinese Electric Car Maker NIO Are Flying High Today,news,"What s happening
Shares of Chinese electric car maker NIO  NYSE NIO  were sharply higher on Wednesday morning after a Chinese business news outlet reported that the cash strapped company had secured new financing from a major automaker  As of 12 p m  EST  NIO s American depositary shares  ADS  were up about 16  from Tuesday s closing price 
So what
According to a report from Chinese business news site Sina Finance that cites a person familiar with the matter  NIO will soon receive a cash infusion of about  1 billion from Guangzhou based GAC Group  OTC GNZUF    At press time  neither NIO nor GAC had confirmed    or denied    the report  

GAC is one of China s big domestic automakers  It has significant joint ventures with Honda Motor and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles  among others  If GAC has in fact decided to make a major investment in NIO    and as of now  neither company has confirmed the report    then NIO s future is bright  
That s an important development  In its 15 months as a public company  NIO has seen rising sales and strong customer loyalty  but its rapidly declining cash has called its future into question  As of Sept  30  the company had just  274 3 million remaining  down from  1 123 billion on March 31 
Now what
If this report is accurate and if the deal closes  then it s extremely bullish for NIO    but I think that auto investors should tread a bit carefully here  Note that an earlier bailout deal fell through at the last minute because of concerns about the company s viability  Use caution with this one ",2020-01-15,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pigqi,2060327

11,221526,NIO,Will Trade War And Controversies Thwart Tesla s Growth ,opinion,The young and flamboyant face of Tesla has dulled lately  The northward movement of its growth has been obstructed by both external and internal factors  The nagging U S  China trade war and rising tariffs are hampering Tesla s profits from international markets  What s more  the frequent controversial tweets by its CEO have made Tesla  share price volatile Will it now be possible for the magnificent electronic car maker to reap profits given that its peers are catching up fast Impact of U S  Sino Trade WarThe electric car maker has captured a sweet spot in the Chinese market  In fact  China is the biggest international market for Tesla  Inc    NASDAQ TSLA    In the second quarter of 2019  Tesla recorded  1 5 billion in sales from China  With strong sales of its Model 3  Model X and Model S in the third quarter  the Chinese government has granted a 10  purchase tax reduction to the company  exclusively As a result of the trade war  China has imposed 25  tariffs on U S  auto imports from Dec 15 which would increase the cost for Tesla  But with the 10  discount  Tesla can avoid concerns of a price rise  However  two things will constantly bother Tesla in this respect The electric car maker will have to be diligent enough to stoke up consumer demand to beat competitors  But most importantly  it must prepare itself for worse  If 25  tariffs are imposed with the existing duties on auto imports  imported autos in China will cost 50  more after Dec 15  Now  the fate of Tesla depends on the U S  China high level talks  If the trade war escalates  the company will be exposed to tariffs and the Chinese government can easily retract the purchase tax reduction In the present scenario  Tesla is already highly priced in China and any tariff induced rise could hurt its sales  However  Tesla is working hard on running its Shanghai based manufacturing plant as soon as possible Tesla  Musk and ControversiesComing to controversies  both Tesla and its CEO Elon Musk are in the spotlight  Last year  the owner of Tesla and SpaceX landed in controversies with the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission  SEC  and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  NHTSA  In August 2018  Musk s tweet  am considering taking Tesla private at  420  Funding secured  dragged Tesla to court  Later  per a court judgment  Musk agreed to submit public statements about Tesla s finances vetted by its legal counsel  The deal with the SEC also included a damaging cost and Musk had to step down from the position of Tesla s chairman Further  in September last year  Tesla had claimed its cars to be the  safest  and said that its Model S has a 5 4 star rating  As per NHTSA  the car did get five star rating in all categories but cannot be claimed as the safest car and Tesla has been misleading its customer Another comment made by Musk in 2018 recently haunted him  Musk  in a tweet  had called Vernon Unsworth  a diver who rescued young soccer players stuck in Thailand s underwater cave a  pedo guy  and referred to him as a  child rapist   There was a rift between them since Unsworth criticized Musk s rescue plan with a submarine  In September 2018  Unsworth sued for defamation and the tussle is going on These distorted information and tweets by Tesla s CEO had led to huge volatility in the stock price  Neither the tweet on privatizing the company nor safety related comments could be ignored Tesla has been growing for a long time in spite of critics calling it as a money losing venture  Though it has provided good returns to bears and short sellers  Tesla has not posted profits in the last few years  In fact  the company s shares have declined 26 5  on a year to date basis in contrast the S P 500 s rise of 17 2  Tesla s controversies are shifting attention away from its fundamentals  The company has gained a lot of attention in the overseas market and dominates the electric vehicle market  In fact  other established automakers like Ford Motor Company   NYSE F    General Motors Company   NYSE GM    NIO Inc    NYSE NIO   and Volkswagen  DE VOWG p  AG   OTC VWAGY   are closing following it and catching up pace in electrifying their vehicles Volvo s Polestar 2 model is lately giving tough competition to Tesla s Model 3 by following some of Tesla s strategies  However  Tesla s software and battery capabilities give it an edge over its competitors  Unfortunately  Tesla s frequent controversies are distracting and disrupting its image Tesla

12,221527,NIO,China s Auto Sales Still In Free Fall  Any Recovery In Sight ,opinion,The auto sales slump in China  which is the world s largest car market  refuses to die down  In more than two decades  vehicle sales slid for the first time in China in 2018 and the country s car sales are likely to fall again this year amid macro economic headwinds  Markedly  in September  car sales in China sank for the 15th time in the past 16 months Let s delve deeper China s Auto Market Crashing  Domestic Weakness   Trade War StingAccording to data provided by China Association of Automobile Manufacturers   CAAM    auto sales fell 5 2  year over year to 2 27 million in September  This followed year over year decline of 6 9  and 4 3  in August and July  respectively  Per CAAM  sales of sedans  minivans  sports utility vehicles and SUVs in the global industry s largest market fell to 1 9 million  Waning consumer demand in the wake of tariff woes and economic slowdown is dragging down the country s vehicle sales Let s take a closer look at the latest inflation data and other economic indicators for China  The country s economic malaise is reflected in September inflation data  which released yesterday  Notably  the country s consumer inflation climbed to its highest levels in nearly six years amid rising pork prices  China s factory deflation also deepened in the month  with producer price index declining 1 2  year over year  marking the third month of contraction in a row  Contracting imports  exports and industry profits are other weak spots  Meanwhile  the country s economic slowdown has been intensified with its ongoing trade war with the United States  While a partial trade deal on Oct 11 offered a ray of hope  the trade tensions are still very much prevailing and not expected to wane anytime soon   With the economic slowdown and U S Sino trade tiff  China s auto market has been faltering like never before  Sales of new energy vehicles   NEV   including all electric and plug in hybrids declined around 34   dropping for the third consecutive month  due to a fall in government subsidies for purchases of such cars  Notably  NEV sales increased for 18 consecutive months till mid 2019  when it fell 4 7  and 15 7  in July and August  respectively  This is especially a matter of concern for China  which is targeting 60  of all automobiles sold in the country to run on electric motors by 2035  The ballooning EV market could burst  which is a concern for electric car makers like Tesla   NASDAQ TSLA   and Nio Inc    NYSE NIO   Affected by the sluggish Chinese economy  automakers are reeling from declining demand of cars in China  Slowing economy and trade war tensions have impacted consumer sentiment  which is crucial for the sale of big ticket discretionary items like automobiles China Woes Put Automakers in a Tight Spot  GM   F in FocusUncertainty with regard to the economic situation in China prompted people to tighten purse strings  in turn hitting U S  auto bigwigs like General Motors   NYSE GM   and Ford   NYSE F    Both General Motors and Ford carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  U S  top automaker General Motors  sales in China tumbled 17 5  year over year in the July September period  In addition to weak demand and trade tiff  increasing competition also impacted the company s sales in China  In fact  year to date  General Motors  sales in China have fallen 15 8   with the company reporting negative sales growth for five consecutive quarters  In a bid to restore sales  the company has targeted to launch 20 new and refreshed models in China this year  General Motors  rival  Ford s sales in China also took a hit  declining 30 3  year over year in the third quarter of 2019  Notably  Ford s sales in the country have been on a decline since 2007  A weak auto market and trade war politics continued to worsen Ford s ongoing slump in China  To revive its position in the country  the firm plans to launch more than 30 new models through 2021 More Bumps Ahead While some industry watchdogs are of the opinion that the slump in China s auto market is likely to bottom out soon  there are no signs of a turnaround yet  With every new data coming out of the country pointing to a slowdown in the economy  there is not much optimism  In fact  per Reuters  China s auto sales could witness negative to low growth over the next three years amid low consumer confidence and trade tiff with the United States  The 19 month old trade tussle between the United States and China is yet to reach a conclusion  In addition to a weak economic outlook  tighter terms for vehicle financing and increasing popularity of ride sharing platforms are also likely to weigh on car sales  With the auto sector s output being a key component in China s GDP  the government is likely to provide support in the event of a prolonged downcycle  In fact  the slowdown did prompt the Chinese authorities to take measures for boosting auto sales in order to kickstart the sputtering economy  For instance  China s State Council asked the local governments to gradually relax restrictions on auto sales  support the purchase of NEVs and expand the second hand car market in the country to prop up the auto market  The efforts have not yielded the required results yet and carmakers are waiting with bated breath to witness a rebound in China s auto market While China still needs to rev up stimulus measures for boosting sales  improvement in the economy and consumer spending  along with the U S  Sino trade truce will be crucial for the auto sector to recover from the slump  Automakers will have to be prepared for a prolonged period of weakness and resort to cost containment and other strategies to overcome the resultant challenges Free  Zacks  Single Best Stock Set to Double Today you are invited to download our just released Special Report that reveals 5 stocks with the most potential to gain  100  or more

14,221529,NIO,Can NIO Pose A Serious Challenge To Tesla s China Presence ,opinion,It seems that NIO Inc    NYSE NIO     touted as China s Tesla   NASDAQ TSLA   equivalent   has failed to live up to expectations  Electric vehicle  EV  startup Nio was talked up as a potential Tesla killer when it powered past its Chinese peers to make an IPO on NYSE last year  While NIO carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Tesla is a Zacks  2  Buy  Ranked firm  You can see NIO s unique selling proposition to provide EVs at competitive pricing has not been able to sustain the company as it is bearing the brunt of cost inefficiency  Since its IPO  the firm has tumbled roughly 64  as it is grappling with numerous challenges  While Elon Musk is accelerating Tesla s China strategy with Shanghai Gigafactory  NIO recently appointed Wei Feng as new CFO amid financial struggles  It remains to be seen if NIO can weather financial crisis and make a comeback  However  we believe that it will be a tough task for Nio to rebound and challenge Tesla s presence in China  at least in the near future  Let s delve deeper Nio in DoldrumsPer Bloomberg  NIO has piled up more than  5 billion losses in just four years In comparison  Tesla took almost 15 years to accumulate such losses  NIO has been navigating choppy waters since its listing and desperately needs a recharge to survive  as the competition in the EV market heats up in China As we know  NIO does not really manufacture its own cars  It contracts state owned JAC Motors to make vehicles  In turn  JAC charges fee for every car  Due to its partnership with JAC  NIO generates lower margins than its peers that manufacture their own cars  While the company initially planned to construct its own manufacturing facility in Shanghai  it finally dropped the plan due to financing issues  As the company relies on JAC  there is not much scope to streamline manufacturing costs  On top of that  NIO does not have a dealership network and instead sells its vehicles through apps and a network of swanky NIO Houses  located in some of the most expensive areas of China s largest cities Moreover  huge vehicle recalls are affecting the reliability and reputation of NIO  in addition to taking a toll on expenses and margins  In June  the company recalled around 5 000 ES8 electric SUVs after battery fires in China  Amid the recalls  the vehicle margin   a key metric to gauge how much a firm earns on each car it sells   plummeted to  24  in second quarter 2019  Even excluding costs related to recalls  its vehicle margin was negative 4   Despite falling deliveries and increasing loses in the second quarter of 2019  NIO has not outlined any long term profitability path yet With the company bearing the brunt of high SG A and R D costs  gross margins are taking a hit  Hence  the discount at which NIO is selling cars is not a result of operational efficiencies  Instead  the firm is losing money on every sold vehicle  NIO s sales to fixed asset ratio is one of the worst in the industry  This is particularly bad for a company that does not own assembly plants  The firm s weak cash flow situation also alleviates problems  It raised  650 million through convertible bonds just a few months after its public listing  Recently  it raised another  200 million from Tencent Holdings through convertible notes Amid high overhead costs  the company has started slashing headcounts  However  even if NIO manages to trim costs and rev up deliveries  its path to profitability seems uncertain  given macro economic headwinds in China and the reputational hit amid battery recalls Tesla Revs Up Expansion in ChinaIn contrast to NIO that has been struggling amid headwinds  Tesla is making an aggressive push to China s EV market  Tesla s Gigafactory 3 in Shanghai will give the company access to the largest EV market on the planet  It will help Tesla to bypass tariffs and cut costs substantially  Gigafactory 3 is ahead of schedule  with cars appearing to be already out for delivery  In phase 1  the firm intends to produce 250 000 annually in Gigafactory 3 and eventually reach a capacity of 500 000 units  Tesla also intends to carry out after sales network expansion in China by opening new repair and maintenance shops  along with charging stations in the country With the Gigafactory 3 being a significant catalyst for Tesla  it will become even more difficult for NIO to maintain strong margins  given its production rate and vehicle lineup Final ThoughtsChina is battling an auto slowdown amid slowing economic growth  trade tensions with the United States and roll back of subsidies on new energy vehicles  In more than two decades  vehicle sales had slid for the first time in China in 2018 and the country s car sales are likely to fall again this year amid macro economic headwinds  China s auto sales fell for the 16th consecutive month in October  with sales of new energy vehicles remaining a major concern  as the rate of decline for EVs has been increasing With the phasing out of subsidies  foreign carmakers are trying to make inroads into China s EV market  While Ford   NYSE F   is revamping its product line

21,221536,NIO,What Commodities And Transportation Are Telling Us  Part II,opinion,"In part I of this report we talked about what commodities and transports where doing in relation to each other  Here in Part II  we show you in detail what we expect to take place 
This chart highlights our Custom Smart Cash Index  in blue  as well as the CBOE Commodity Index pricing levels  red   This data goes all the way back to 2012 and highlights a number of key pricing rotations  First  we can see that commodities have been decreasing in total value from 2012 through mid 2017  We can also identify a key support level that was established in the commodities index near the beginning of 2016   coming just a month or so before the bottom in the Smart Cash Index 
We believe this key bottom in both the commodities and Smart Cash indices reflect a dramatic pricing shift that took place at that point in time  Although commodities have yet to rally beyond their upper high ranges  we can see the Smart Cash Index rallied to new all time highs  The rally that started near the end of 2016 in the Smart Cash Index was likely the result of a capital shift  which we have discussed extensively in the past  With commodity prices staying historically low and an increase in economic optimism  capital shifted away from commodity based sectors and into technology and biotech  Now it appears this rally has run its course and a new capital shift is taking place 

Until commodities begin to break out of the downward price channels highlighted on this chart  global capital will be searching for two primary objectives  safety and hedged returns  By this  we mean to say that global capital and investment will seek out strong blue chip and mid cap performers that can produce safety in growth  dividends and hedge against currency swings or further eroding commodity price levels  Think of this as a move to key elements supporting the global economies 
Watch heavy equipment  support services and retailers  tool suppliers and mid level equipment suppliers  transportation services for these items and the repair parts and services to keep these tools running efficiently  Human services  labor  labor services  medical services and entertainment services are likely to do well over the next 12 24 months  In an economy where commodity prices are relatively low and transportation and capital are flowing quite well  one can easily see that capital will seek out and identify the strongest opportunity for safety and growth as sectors continue to shift  After a massive rally in technology and bio tech  we believe a continued shift toward blue  and mid caps is taking place right now  Technology and bio tech will likely find some support in the near future and become opportunistic investments  But right now  we believe global investors are focusing on different targets to hedge the risks that are associated with certain technology stocks 
In closing  our research highlights that commodities are not increasing as one would expect in an expanding global market economy  We believe this is one core factor that will continue to drive a capital shift toward opportunity and performance in the blue  and mid caps  Investors will re enter the technology and bio tech sectors when pricing levels become more opportunistic   at some point in the future  This means there is a strong likelihood that US and global blue chips  banks  industrial supply  basic materials and human services  entertainment  basic human essentials  regional human services and utilities  will continue to perform well 
The US and the global economy is growing  just not as one would expect in a  total growth  environment  We believe the global economy has shifted to support fundamental growth elements that are related more closely to the types of industry and market sectors that support the fundamental growth components  We ve discussed our theory that global economies operate in a  growth or protection mode  many times before  We believe the current global economic stance is more in tune with moderate growth while still being overly protective  Watch commodities and the transportation index for signs that the global economy has entered a larger growth phase and for more opportunity of a broader capital shift 
This concludes our two part series on how we identify market opportunities  Analysis like this has allowed us to generate substantial profits in the past 30 days with UGAZ 30   NIO 21 6   ROKU 18  and GDXJ 10 5  ",2019-03-06,Chris Vermeulen,https://www.investing.com/analysis/what-commodities-and-transportation-are-telling-us-part-ii-200395224,200395224

Stocks were weak once again  We can see in the chart that the S P 500 is testing its lows from the other day  and for now those lows are holding  At this point  I can t say I m overly concerned  A pullback to 2 750 wouldn t concern me either 

Russell  RUT 
The Russell  now that is a different story  We can see the index has broken its uptrend and a drop below 1 530 clearly triggers a steeper decline to 1 492  Diverging indexes are never a good sign  We really need to see the Russell stabilize here  I would get more nervous over the short term should the Russell crack below 1 530  It would likely signal a steeper pullback for the S P 500 too  We will need to monitor 

Biotech  XBI 
The SPDR S P Biotech  NYSE XBI  continues to look really weak  and a drop to  85 25 seems likely at this point 

Nio Inc  NIO 
NIO Inc  NYSE NIO  shares tanked over 20   I went through the story this morning  The stock fell right through support at  8 35 and now appears to be on its way to that  7 72 region I mentioned earlier 

General Electric  GE 
General Electric Company  NYSE GE  also continues to fall  and I noted this morning the stock was facing a decline below  9  This afternoon it seems like those odds just improved for a drop to  8 90 

AT T  T 
AT T Inc  NYSE T  continues to look really weak  The stock continues to fall after failing at resistance at  31 20 and suggests a decline to  28 92  In fact  according to data from SmartStops  the equity just entered an elevated risk state indicating there may be further declines ahead 

Blackberry  BB 
I have really screwed up this BlackBerry Ltd  NYSE BB   after weeks of getting it right  I guess I ran out luck  I don t know  I have to think about this one  The RSI really bothers me though 

Micron  MU 
Micron Technology Inc  NASDAQ MU  is another one that has turned against me  This one appears to be entering a region where it should find support around  36 and bounce 

Advanced Micro Devices Inc  AMD 
Advanced Micro Devices Inc  NASDAQ AMD  also has turned sour  A drop below  22 80 means  21 is coming 

Amazon  AMZN 
Amazon com Inc  NASDAQ AMZN  is failing at this downtrend  I really thought this time it would break out  We will need to watch this one closely now 

Netflix  NFLX

NIO Inc  NYSE NIO  shares are falling 15  in the pre market after the company reported results that fell short of expectations  No headlines of doom or breaking news alert push messages on this one though  The stock is sinking  and there appears to be a triple top formed with a drop below  8 35 pushing the stock lower to  7 72

Tesla  TSLA 
Tesla Inc  NASDAQ TSLA   however  is trading slightly higher this morning  The stock has been whacked in recent days  I think the decline in the shares seems a bit excessive 
But I did a find a piece of evidence to suggest that Tesla is indeed rushing the Model Y by moving the event to March 14  get this  BY ONE FULL DAY  Yes  1 Day  Here is a Tweet from the Man himself on May 23  2018 at 11 52PM 


Of course  this is part of a series of Tweets where he admits he made it up at first  Regardless  it would suggest to me that the intention has always been there for unveiling around this time  Plus March was when they revealed the Model 3 for the first time  I would hardly say this news is rushed 
Anyway  it looks like the Bloomberg Model 3 tracker is suggesting that Tesla has produced about 60 000 units so far this quarter  At the current pace of 5 700 per week  it may result in the company producing pretty close to 85 000 units for the quarter  just in Model 3 s  In the fourth quarter  they made a total of nearly 62 000  That is almost a 40  increase in production  but demand for the car is soft  Right 
Anyway  the stock has fallen to its lowest levels since October  but the good thing is that the RSI somehow is still trending higher 

Qualcomm  QCOM 
Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  continues to trend higher  I wrote the other day how I was still seeing bullish options betting in the stock  An increase to  56 continues to look likely over the short term 

General Electric  GE 
The last one for today is General Electric Company  NYSE GE   The stock continues to be a disaster  Every time  you think the last piece of bad news is priced in  more bad news comes  Yesterday out of nowhere comes the cashflow bomb  A decline below  9 00 seems entirely possible given its latest decline and break below the uptrend

24,221539,NIO,A Central Bank War Just Started And Its Good For Stocks,opinion,"ECB Effects
The move in the euro was huge  falling over 200 pips  huge  But the most important piece here is that the euro broke essential support at 1 13  I wrote up my thoughts on why the euro could even fall to parity  and why the Fed may need to cut rates later this year 

Draghi was very dovish today with his outlook  so much so that German Bunds fell to around 6 bps from 13 bps  Our 10 year fell to 2 63   A break below 2 62  sends the 10 year back to its December lows 

Over time investors should come to realize that rates will remain low and that the Fed will need to stay on hold to avoid having the dollar strengthen too much  Should the dollar rise  it will kill off whatever inflationary forces there are while hurting our multinational companies  The result may be a Fed that needs to cut rates by late 2019 to keep the dollar in line versus the euro and avoid this scenario 
But this should be good for stocks as investors move out on the risk curve  and low interest rate foster multiple expansion for stocks 
S P 500  SPY  NYSE SPY  
Stocks did end up falling some  with the S P 500 dropping by roughly 80 basis point to 2 748  Certainly not the end of days  but a decline worth noting  The S P 500 did manage to close at a pretty substantial level of support around 2 750  Remember this was one of the reasons I had some hesitation a couple of weeks backs about the market  and a level I tried to keep in the back of everyone s mind  Now that gap is filled  what next 
From my point of view  it is now crucial for the S P 500 to hold support around this 2 735 level  A drop below that support zone gets things moving to the downside with the potential for a drop below 2 700 

Russell 2000  IWM 
The Russell s decline was the most noticeable because it did fall below that level of support I had noted last night at 1 535  The Russell s drop has me much more concerned than the S P 500 at this point  The chart now suggestions that the index could drop by another 2  to around 1 492  There is a minor support level about at 1 520  but I have no confidence in that level acting as anything substantial 
I know 2  doesn t sound like much  but consider that the Russell was at 1 600 on February 23  When you think about that way  we are talking about a nearly 7  drop from that peak 
You can even make a case for the Russell to drop back to around 1 450 a full 9  off those February highs  But it would create a very bullish pattern known a reverse head and shoulders  That could eventually lead to higher prices down the road 
Again  my outlook for the full year continues to suggest stock will continue to head higher  That is not to say there will not be pullbacks along the way 

Nio  NYSE NIO 
Nio continues to deflate  and it looks like it may be possible now for a drop to  6 50 

Splunk  NASDAQ SPLK 
Splunk is nearing a potentially big breakdown should it fall below  123  potentially to  108 

Facebook  NASDAQ FB 
Facebook was lower today  and the stock is looking more and more as if filling the gap at  148 is around the corner 

Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX 
Netflix was also down today  falling back to  352  The stock has looked very weak  and a drop to  337 seems possible still 

Apple  NASDAQ AAPL 
Apple got as high as  178  pretty close but no cigar to the  182 I was looking for  Now the stock is sitting on an uptrend and a break of that uptrend pushes the shares back to  165 

JD  JD 
JD is still looking as if it could drop to around  26 over the coming days 

NVIDIA Corporation  NASDAQ NVDA 
Finally  Nvidia did fall below  150 today  and I m still looking for that  139 to  140 region 

See you on Jobs Friday

25,221540,NIO,Does Nio Have What It Takes To Get Out Of Penny Stock Territory ,opinion,"Nio Inc   NYSE NIO  hasn t been the Cinderella story that many had originally hoped for since its IPO  There s no denying that its debut on the US markets was exciting especially when it hit highs of nearly  14 a share  But that s where the excitement tends to tailor off a bit  Over the last few months and recently  the last few weeks  shares of the  Chinese Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA   have dropped to all time lows  In fact  last week Nio shares fell into penny stock territory 
Does this electric vehicle company really have what it takes to get out of the range of becoming a penny stock  If you were to ask someone   What is a penny stock   the basic definition is a stock that trades under  5 per share  Given that Nio had been briefly trading below  5 last week  it technically flirted with the penny stock price level  But why 
Nio Running On Fumes At The End Of Q1
In early March  investors saw Nio shares plummet from  10 16 on March 5 to an opening price of  8 26 the following day  What contributed most to this was the company s latest earnings report  More specifically it was the corporate guidance offered for the future of Nio 
Though people like Jim Cramer say they  wouldn t sell  Nio  Wall Street didn t necessarily feel the same way  Bank of America Merrill Lynch  NYSE NYSE BAC  downgraded the stock from Neutral to Underperform 
The sequential slowdown in vehicle deliveries in January and February was mainly caused by accelerated deliveries made at the end of last year in anticipation of EV subsidy reductions in China in 2019  the seasonal slowdowns surrounding the January 1st and Chinese New Year holidays  as well as the current slowdown of macro economic conditions in China  particularly in the automotive sector   said Nio in a company statement 
A Light At The End Of The Test Tunnel For Nio
Though Q4 figures showed positive progress  there will be hurdles for Nio to get over  Let s look at some of the highlights that could positively impact Nio considering the drab outlook guided by the company 
For starters  the company s update on first quarter deliveries came in above its original expectations  The company is expected between 3 500 and 3 800 ES8s delivered  compared to 7 980 in Q4   As of March 31  2019  cumulative ES8 deliveries reached over 15 000 vehicles with 3 989 being delivered in the first quarter  This figure was higher by 339 vehicles compared to its guidance range midpoint of 3 650 
Additionally  the recent dip in price could have added more exposure to investors who simply do not have attention on stocks outside of the  penny stock  range  One article even states   So  on the bright side  maybe this drop opened up new attention from investors who would have not seen the company  otherwise  
Several milestones for the company continue to breed investor confidence  Financial results showed things like delivery to nearly 8 000 customers  which is about 1 10th of Tesla s Q4 deliveries for its last period  This figure surpasses company expectations and compared to its initial guidance from the end of 2018  the trend has continued in exceeding anticipated growth figures 
Nio also hinted at an  affordable  auto  the ES6  This model is set for production later this year with a sticker of roughly  52 000 
A Clear Road For An EV Gold Rush
Due  in part to the recent changes in China s standards for new energy vehicles  which will qualify for subsidies  the EV market is getting hot for big money raises  Furthermore  a particular deal struck at the time of the Nio IPO could bring an advantage  It happened to be that the Chinese electric vehicle maker blocked the eight top investment banks that did its IPO from working for rivals  They did this by placing in a year long non compete clause according to Reuters 
The top eight banks worldwide for equity sales in 2018  were Bank of America Merrill Lynch  Citigroup  NYSE NYSE C   Credit Suisse  SIX SIX CSGN   Deutsche Bank  DE DE DBKGn   Goldman Sachs  NYSE NYSE GS   JPMorgan  NYSE NYSE JPM   Morgan Stanley  NYSE NYSE MS   and UBS  NYSE UBS  according to Refinitiv data  They all were also the banks that Nio had hired 
Though the Reuters source didn t consent to be named  this could give Nio a strong lead  NIO s rivals will essentially be blocked from raising public or private funds from these banks for 12 months following the IPO 
A Look At The Landscape
As the major global banks could be locked up for now  the landscape for EV in China continues to grow  Leap Motor  a smaller EV producer was seeking a private raise of about  372 million  Deutsche Bank and Chinese brokerage Huatai United Securities are acting as the advisors on the deal 
In January  Byton sought to raise at least  500 million to finance its growth according to Reuters  The company is only 3 years old but already has more than 50 000 customers and a valuation of more than  4 billion according to its CEO and Co Founder  Daniel Kirchert 
Finally  WM Motor recently announced that it had closed its Series C funding round of  446 16 million  3 billion Yuan   The raise was led by Baidu  NASDAQ BIDU   In total  the company has been able to raise around  3 4 billion  23 billion Yuan  ",2019-04-02,Joe Sirianni,https://www.investing.com/analysis/does-nio-have-what-it-takes-to-get-out-of-penny-stock-territory-200403198,200403198
26,221541,NIO,China Stimulus  Buy Nio,opinion,"Most of the investing public is running scared from shares of China electric car maker Nio  NYSE NIO   However  after falling from a 52 week high of  13 80 to its current  2 58  investors may want to take a second speculative look  China stimulus is getting into the system and more is coming  In fact  China will be forced to compete with lower interest rates and additional stimulus from the European Central Bank  Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan  The government looks at electric cars as essential for the future power of China by eliminating smog in the major cities  Car makes like NIO will see additional help and support from the Chinese government  While deliveries have fallen lately  that is likely within a month or two of changing as the stimulus kicks in 
The trade deal  while it may go on for a little longer  will end  The end date will likely be prior to the 2020 elections  At 52 week lows  any hint of a cease fire or agreement between the United States and China will send shorts running  President Trump needs a win going into the election and a deal with China that stimulates the economy might be the one thing that could help him win  and he knows it  
On a technical basis  NIO has already made a pivot low on June 14 at  2 35  After that low  the stock ran over  3 00 and is currently in a classic bull retrace  In addition  technical metrics like the RSI and MACD are showing positive divergences  signaling further upside is likely  The stock is still oversold on a monthly and weekly basis signaling there is still upside to go  I have a technical target in the next couple months of  4 35  That is a potential upside move of 70   Hedge funds continue to hold large positions with a long term view  In the last two weeks  sellers have started to fade with volume becoming lighter while large block buyers have increased 
Please note  this is a speculative call on a small mid cap stock  Any position should be small and part of a diversified portfolio ",2019-06-27,Gareth Soloway,https://www.investing.com/analysis/china-stimulus-buy-nio-200435369,200435369
27,221542,NIO,2 Chinese Stocks Seeing Unusually Heavy Options Trading,opinion,"Trade tensions between Washington and Beijing have kept U S  listed Chinese stocks on the collective radar  Two names in particular that options traders have been eyeing are Hangzhou based e commerce concern Alibaba  NYSE BABA  and Shanghai based electric car maker Nio  NYSE NIO 
In fact  both BABA and NIO popped up on a list of stocks that have seen the heaviest weekly options activity in the past 10 days  courtesy of Schaeffer s Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White  with names highlighted in yellow new to the list  The bulk of activity for both BABA and NIO has occurred on the call side 

Alibaba Bulls See More Upside
Alibaba saw 200 847 calls change hands over the past two weeks  compared to 116 524 puts  A healthy portion of this was likely a result of speculators purchasing new positions  per BABA s 10 day call put volume ratio of 2 36 at the International Securities Exchange  ISE   Cboe Options Exchange  CBOE   and NASDAQ OMX PHLX  PHLX   which ranks in the 74th annual percentile  meaning calls have been bought to open over puts at an accelerated clip 
Drilling down  the September 175 call saw the biggest increase in open interest over this two week time frame  and was likely used alongside the September 175 put to initiate a straddle in the now back month series  As far as weekly options  nearly 6 000 weekly 8 30 180 strike calls were initiated in the last 10 sessions  some of which were bought  according to data from the major options exchanges 
Today  amid lighter than usual volume  speculators appear to be buying to open BABA s weekly 7 26 175 strike call for a volume weighted average price of  1 11  By doing so  call buyers expect the stock to jump above breakeven at  176 11  strike plus premium paid  by expiration at the close this Friday  July 26  At last check  Alibaba stock is down 0 6  at  171 98  testing recent support at its 80 day moving average and a trendline connecting higher lows since late May 

Nio Call Traders See Bigger Short Term Gains
In the last 10 sessions  199 729 Nio call options traded  compared to 69 062 puts  Data from the ISE  CBOE  and PHLX confirms significant buy to open activity in the past two weeks  per the stock s top heavy 10 day call put volume ratio of 4 05 
While the August 3 call saw the biggest increase among non expired options over this time frame  the weekly 7 26 3 50 strike call was also popular  Data from the major options exchanges confirms significant buy to open activity at each strike  meaning speculators are targeting short term gains for the Chinese stock 
Most recently  though  NIO shares are trading down 0 5  at  3 35  The equity rebounded from its June 17 record low of  2 35  but ran out of steam at the  4 mark    near its 80 day moving average and its late May pre bear gap levels  Year to date  Nio stock is down 47 4  ",2019-07-23,Schaeffer's Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/2-chinese-stocks-seeing-unusually-heavy-options-trading-200442862,200442862

30,221545,NIO,Wall Street slips from records as investors lock in year end gains,news,"By April Joyner
NEW YORK  Reuters    Wall Street s major stock indexes slipped from record highs on Monday as investors booked profits from gains made this month after the United States and China reached a trade deal 
The S P 500  the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq posted their biggest one day percentage declines in about four weeks 
Monday brought minor updates on the U S  China trade agreement  White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said the pact was likely to be signed in the next week but that confirmation would come from President Donald Trump or U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer 
A South China Morning Post report said Chinese Vice Premier Liu He would travel to Washington later this week to sign the deal 
The news provided little impetus for U S  stocks to extend their steep climb  analysts said  Going into Monday  the benchmark S P 500 had notched record high closes in nine of the past 11 sessions 
 Many traders and portfolio managers have reached their targets and don t want to jeopardize their performance   said Quincy Krosby  chief market strategist at Prudential Financial  NYSE PRU  in Newark  New Jersey   So it s not unusual to see some profit taking as we get to the close of the year  
The Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJI  fell 183 12 points  or 0 64   to 28 462 14  the S P 500  SPX  lost 18 73 points  or 0 58   to 3 221 29 and the Nasdaq Composite  IXIC  dropped 60 62 points  or 0 67   to 8 945 99 
Communications services stocks  SPLRCL  fell 1   the biggest percentage decline among the S P 500 s sectors  Technology stocks  SPLRCT  dropped 0 6  and weighed most heavily on the benchmark index  Technology  up 47 5  year to date  and communication services  up 30 6   have led in percentage gains on the S P 500 this year 
It is  not uncommon for the leading sectors to pull back first when people start to sell because if it is an outperformer  then it warrants a lot more downside risk   said Randy Frederick  vice president of trading and derivatives for  Charles Schwab   NYSE SCHW  in Austin  Texas 
On Tuesday  stocks will trade on Wall Street for a full session prior to Wednesday s New Year s Day break  In a bright spot among U S  stocks  Nio Inc  N NIO  shares surged 53 7  after the Chinese electric vehicle maker and Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA  rival beat quarterly revenue estimates on higher demand 
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1 43 to 1 ratio  on Nasdaq  a 1 52 to 1 ratio favored decliners 
The S P 500 posted 17 new 52 week highs and no new lows  the Nasdaq Composite recorded 80 new highs and 29 new lows

Shares of NIO  NYSE NIO   a Chinese designer and manufacturer of premium electric vehicles  EVs   were soaring more than 60  early Monday afternoon after the struggling automaker released better than expected financial results for the third quarter 
So what
Deliveries jumped 35  sequentially  reaching 4 799 during the third quarter  That helped drive vehicle sales to  242 5 million during the quarter  a 22 5  increase from the second quarter and a 21 5  improvement from the prior year s third quarter  Total revenue increased 25  to  257 million versus the prior year  easily topping analysts  estimates of  234 million 
Vehicle margin checked in at a negative 6 8  during the third quarter  which was a large sequential improvement from the negative 24 1  in the second quarter  but slightly worse than the prior year s negative 4 3   NIO s net loss was  352 8 million during the third quarter  a 23 3  decrease from the second quarter and a 10 3  decrease from the prior year s result 
 The electric vehicle sector experienced substantial softness in the second half of 2019 after the reduction of EV subsidies in China   CEO William Bin Li said in a press release   Despite the challenges  NIO s sales improved solidly since September

Even with today s surge  it s been a bumpy ride for investors over the past year  Management reiterated confidence that the company s financial health would improve as cost cutting efforts begin to gain traction  During its third annual NIO Day on Dec  28  it unveiled its new EC6 model  which is expected to compete with Tesla s Model Y  giving hope that better days are ahead for sales and financial results 
While NIO s stock is up 133  over the past three months  it remains one of the riskier auto stocks in the market  Furthermore  it seems fairly clear the company needs capital  and investors should keep an eye out for possible announcements of a financing deal  If the company can secure reasonable capital  successfully accelerate sales of its EVs  and cut costs  it ll go a long way to persuading investors that 2019 was only a speed bump on its way to a bright future ",2019-12-30,The Motley Fool,https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/12/30/why-shares-of-nio-raced-over-70-higher-monday-afte.aspx?source=iedfolrf0000001,2050025
32,221547,NIO,6 Stocks To Watch  Nivida Could Be Falling,opinion,"6 Stocks To Watch  March 6 Trading Session
Stocks
Stocks went pretty much nowhere on March 5  with the S P 500 finishing the day down about 10 bps  I was modestly surprised that stocks didn t get a boost from the strong services PMI data which came in at 59 7 versus estimates of 57 2  It was one of the highest reading in some time 

Let us not forget that the services industry in the US far outweighs the manufacturing sector 

While it is nice to obsess about weak manufacturing PMI s because it sounds so dire and creates headlines of doom  let s just stop and call it a day 
Biotech  XBI 
BiotechI stocks plunged on the news that FDA Commish Dr  Scott Gottlieb is resigning  The only reason for the decline is that the market fears the unknown  and not knowing the next commissioner is the unknown  Sell first  ask questions later 
You can see from the chart below that the day was going rather well for Biotech  that is  before the news 

Netflix  NFLX 
I drew in a new trend line for Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX   and this time it is a downtrend  The stock did rise today  but notice where the stock stopped rising  right at resistance at  355 

Alphabet  GOOGL 
Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL  popped above  1 170 briefly  and that could step up a rise to  1225 

Roku Inc  ROKU 
Roku Inc  NASDAQ ROKU  was up today  I m assuming on the news that you can now use Alexa and Roku together  I download the skill to my Alexa  it s ok  certainly not worth a 3  rise in the stock  
IQiyi  IQ 
iQIYI Inc  NASDAQ IQ  went up today  it doesn t seem to care what I think  Not many stocks do  Someone asked me if it is possible for IQiyi to consolidate sideways back to the trend line  I would agree with that  it is entirely possible  I will also admit at this point a move lower to  24 is likely not on the table anymore  I still think it is overbought based on that RSI 

Nivida  NVDA 
I m beginning to regret changing my view on NVIDIA Corporation  NASDAQ NVDA  a few weeks back to increasing to  178  Because now  I have to admit that it was the wrong call  and now I have to flip back to say I think it is going to fall  It just makes me feel dumb  But I m going to flip  sorry  folks  It doesn t happen that often  but Nvidia just doesn t look right  So a drop below  150 sends it back towards  139  and I do see this one falling 

Nio  NIO 
I have a rhetorical question  why is that everybody screams and cries about Tesla s valuation  but yet the start up NIO Inc  NYSE NIO  is praised as the Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA  killer  The company has a market cap that is a third of Ford and Fiat  That is right Nio has a  10 billion market cap 

The company is even more expensive than Tesla  I don t see as much as of controversy around Nio and its valuation  Hardly even the same amount of short interest in the stock either

34,221549,NIO,3 Reasons NIO   China s Tesla   Should Be On Your Radar,opinion,"In case you ve never heard of it  NIO Inc   NYSE NIO  is a Shanghai based automobile manufacturer specializing in designing and developing electric autonomous vehicles  The company  which has been dubbed the  Tesla of China   was founded four years ago and listed on the New York Stock Exchange this past September  raising  1 8 billion 
It currently offers two main models  the ES6  which is a five passenger SUV with a 358 000 yuan  or  52 000 price tag  and the ES8  which is an upscale  seven passenger  three row SUV positioned as a domestic Chinese alternative to Tesla s  NASDAQ TSLA  Model X  It s priced at 448 000 yuan  or around  65 000 versus the Model X s sticker price of  113 000 
NIO s third model  the EP9  is an electric powered  two seater sports car  which the company claims is one of the world s fastest electric cars  Its 1 360 horsepower engine propels it to 160 mph in 7 1 seconds  Only six have been sold so far for a hefty  1 2 million apiece 
Besides the incredible upside for the entire electric vehicle industry  thus for the company as well  there are three additional reasons which we believe makes this stock something that should be on every investor s radar 
1  Accelerating Sales in China
NIO delivered a total of 11 348 vehicles in 2018  over fulfilling their respective sales targets  among which 3 318 units were handed over in December alone 

The company is already outselling Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA  in China by a wide margin  as the U S  electric automaker has struggled under trade war tariffs  which have driven up the price of its Model X SUV and Model 3 Sedan 

China is the world s largest and fast growing market for new energy vehicles  NEVs   a category comprising electric battery cars and plug in electric hybrids  China s NEV sales shot up 61 7  year on year to 1 256 million units in 2018  according to sales data released by the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers  CAAM  
Looking beyond China  NIO has ambitions to expand into Europe and the U S  in the next two to three years  according to Jack Cheng  one of the founders of NIO and now the CEO of XPT  NIO s powertrain division  He says it s 

 The first vehicle to market to the European standard already so we will be able to take a step into Europe  Then we can begin moving into the U S  because it is a more critical market  

2  Big Time Investor Backing
The buzz about NIO increased following reports that U K  investment management firm and Tesla investor Baillie Gifford acquired an 11 4  stake in the Chinese company on Oct  9  The firm owns 85 3 million NIO shares  the company said in a filing with the U S  s Securities and Exchange Commission 
The news made some serious waves  Baillie Gifford is Tesla s largest outside shareholder  with a 9  stake  Tesla s largest investor  founder and CEO Elon Musk  owns about 20  of shares 
Investment advisory firm Vanguard and Morgan Stanley also disclosed that they purchased 19 million and 12 million shares respectively of NIO during the most recent quarter  Other prominent investors include China s Tencent Holdings  OTC TCEHY   tech company Baidu  NASDAQ BIDU   privately held Singaporean holding company Temasek  Chinese tech company Lenovo  OTC LNVGF  and Sequoia Capital 
Additionally  notorious short seller Andrew Left of Citron Research published a lengthy thesis on NIO and made the long case for shares to rally to  12  They re currently trading at  7 44 as of yesterday s close 
 Just like Tesla was not a simple U S  electric car story  NIO is so much more than just a Chinese electric car story  NIO s visionary management is revolutionizing the high end auto industry in China   he wrote in a note on Nov  19  According to Citron  the Chinese EV automaker is  not just a car company   but  a lifestyle and a brand that is ready to disrupt  
3  Bullish Technical Picture
Since shares began trading on Sept  12  the stock hit a high of  13 80 and a low of  5 62  At yesterday s closing price  that represents a gain of around 19 4  from its IPO price of  6 00 
From a technical standpoint  the stock broke above key resistance near the  8 30 level on Feb  6  before pulling back in a constructive manner  towards its 50 day moving average at around  7  The stock needs to hold this level before successfully retesting its recent breakout price ",2019-02-13,Jesse Cohen/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-reasons-nio-chinas-tesla-should-be-on-your-radar-200387204,200387204
35,221550,NIO,Is It The Right Time To Enter NIO  The Tesla Of China ,opinion,"NIO Inc  NYSE NIO   the Chinese electric carmaker that has given a stellar year to date return of 50   Let us look at the various factors which are driving the stock higher 
Electric vehicle industry is one of the hottest investment ideas as the automobile industry transitions from the combustion engine to the hybrids  China is the leading producer of new energy vehicles  NEVs  
The stock is up in the past couple of days after the CBS 60 Minutes interview which focused on how the company is working to become more of a lifestyle brand in China  For a question of whether the company aspires to be the Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA  of China  The founder and CEO William Li replied 
 It s like the clothes fashion models wear on the catwalk    It s not the same  They may be beautiful  but you can t wear them every day   The comparison continued to include supermodels   So Tesla is the supermodel and you re the girl next door   asked correspondent Holly    Williams     Yeah   Li replied  He further mentioned that the China will manufacture more than 1 million electric vehicles this year with massive support from the government 
The company is founded in 2014 by Chinese entrepreneur William LI  It is backed by the Chinese Technology Company Tencent Holdings Ltd  HK 0700   It got listed in September 2018 
The company is expected to release its fourth quarter 2018 results on March 05  2019  During the third quarter results released on November 06  2018 revenue rose 3 095  to RMB 1 469 million  US  214 million  when compared to the second quarter of 2018  Net loss was RMB 2 810 million an increase of 57  from the second quarter 
Cash and cash equivalent at the end of November 2018 was RMB 9 153 million  USD 1 3 billion   The company recently raises  650 million through the convertible bond 
The initial demand for the company s vehicles is very strong  NIO began deliveries of the ES8  a 7 seater high performance electric SUV in China from June 2018  The company delivered 3 318 ES8 vehicles in December 2018 when compared to 3 089 delivered in November and a total of 11 348 vehicles in June to December 2018 period  The company could also give a tough competition for Tesla vehicles in the China market due to lower pricing and also the company is able to ramp up the production 
After the success of ES8  the company has launched lower priced electric SUV ES6 in December 2018 for a price of around  50 000 which is around  14 000 less than the ES8  The deliveries are expected in June 2019 
Risks
China is reducing the subsidies given to electric vehicles  Even though it is the biggest market there is intense competition in the Chinese EV market  Slowing Chinese economy could also put a dent on the company s revenues  The company is young and the production has only begun last year 
Conclusion
This is a high growth stock  Investors need to understand the risk of investing in such companies  However  returns could also very high  Also  the company s efficiency in producing vehicles on time is very appreciable  It could also attract Tesla investors and other investors who are interested to invest in electric vehicles

37,221552,NIO,Stock Market News  Tesla Falls  NIO Jumps as Electric Cars Heat Up,news,"The stock market gave up ground on Monday morning  as investors couldn t continue to ride positive momentum from earlier in the holiday period into the final two days of 2019  Investors are trying to stay confident about their views for the market and the U S  economy in 2020  but many still point to the strong market performance in the past year as a reason to expect at least a pause in the upward trends of major stock indexes  As of 11 a m  EST  the Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJINDICES  DJI  was down 178 points to 28 468  The S P 500  SNPINDEX  GSPC  lost 18 points to 3 222  while the Nasdaq Composite  NASDAQINDEX  IXIC  fell 70 points to 8 937 
Even though holiday trading was relatively quiet  there was considerable attention on the electric vehicle market  Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA  saw its stock give up some ground  but Chinese counterpart NIO  NYSE NIO  enjoyed solid gains on good news for the industry 
Will Tesla underdeliver 
Shares of Tesla were down more than 3  Monday morning as investors reacted to mixed news  Although the electric vehicle pioneer celebrated a key milestone  some of those following the stock aren t as comfortable about its near term prospects 

On the positive side  Tesla delivered its first Model 3 cars from its Chinese Gigafactory facility in Shanghai  The plant produced 15 electric cars for Tesla employees  celebrating the end of a year long process of getting the China production site up and running  Tesla has high hopes for the facility  especially because it will allow the company to serve the growing Chinese consumer auto market without facing the same trade related tensions that come with bringing vehicles across the Pacific from U S  production plants 
However  Tesla got a dose of pessimism from stock analysts at Cowen  The analysts believe that Tesla s full year delivery numbers are likely to fall short of the 360 000 to 400 000 vehicles that the company has projected  The shortfall could come in large part because the automaker s higher end Model S and Model X vehicles haven t seen as much demand as initially expected  and Cowen thinks that the stock could get cut in half from current levels if demand from mature auto markets doesn t accelerate soon 
Tesla s stock has been extremely volatile  and opinions about the carmaker are strong on both sides  In the end  investors will have to wait to see how Tesla actually performs in the long run  especially in key markets like China 
NIO gets a charge
Shares of NIO soared more than 40  as the Chinese electric vehicle maker announced its latest financial results  Although NIO has suffered through a painful few months  today s news has apparently restored some confidence in the stock 
NIO s numbers indicated continued growth  The company delivered almost 4 800 vehicles in the third quarter of 2019  up from about 3 550 vehicles in the second quarter  About 4 200 of those deliveries were of the ES6 SUV model  while NIO delivered just over 600 of its higher end ES8 SUVs  Overall revenue was up 22  compared to three months earlier  and losses narrowed from previous levels 
What has some investors especially excited is the fact that NIO has announced a new model  The EC6 will be what the company calls a  smart premium electric coupe SUV   and CEO William Bin Li believes that the automaker s  pursuit of both high performance and stylish design in our products  should help it overcome pressures from reductions in government subsidies for electric vehicles 
NIO and Tesla will continue to fight hard for supremacy in the Chinese electric car market  but there s likely more than enough room for both to prosper  With so much potential  China could become the most important market for electric vehicles on the planet    and investors will have to place their bets on whether Tesla or NIO will end up on top ",2019-12-30,The Motley Fool,https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/12/30/stock-market-news-tesla-falls-nio-jumps-as-electri.aspx?source=iedfolrf0000001,2049939

Founder and CEO William Bin Li said NIO delivered a total of 4 799 ES8 and ES6 vehicles in the third quarter of 2019  representing a 35 1  increase from the second quarter  The electric vehicle sector experienced substantial softness in the second half of 2019 after the reduction of EV subsidies in China  Despite the challenges  NIO s sales improved solidly since September    We expect over 8 000 vehicles to be delivered in the fourth quarter  a record of quarterly deliveries in our history  With that  the total aggregate deliveries in 2019 are estimated to reach over 20 300 At its  Nio Day  event last week  the company announced a new 100 kWh battery pack for the top of the line ES8 and a 20 kWh home fast charging unit  The 100 kWh battery pack can be swapped in for existing ES8s with the original 74 kWh pack because the two battery packs are designed to fit into the same amount of space For the fourth quarter  ending this month  Nio expects to deliver 8 000 units  a 67  sequential increase  Total revenues are projected at  393 2 million  up about 53  sequentially Analysts are forecasting a quarterly net loss per share of  0 30 and revenues of  289 19 million  For the full year  the forecast net loss totals  1 49 on sales of  1 03 billion The smaller than expected per share loss  the higher revenues and the forecast for a jump of almost a third in quarterly revenues has made investors giddy  Shares traded up around 20  in Monday s premarket  at  2 90 in a 52 week range of  1 19 to  10 64  The 12 month consensus price target is  3 03

39,221554,NIO,NIO s Sales Are Rising  but Is It Enough ,news,"Chinese electric automaker NIO  NYSE NIO  said that it delivered 2 528 vehicles in November  down from a year ago but in line with its October result  as its sales rebound held steady after a tough second quarter 
NIO is still thought to be running dangerously low on cash  But the company is proceeding as if all is well  opening new stores and hinting that a new model is coming soon 
Best month of 2019  but still down from 2018
NIO s November delivery total was down 18  from November of 2018  but it was still the company s best month for deliveries since the beginning of the year  

In a statement  CEO William Li said that the company expanded its network of stores in November by opening 37 new  NIO Spaces   These are smaller and simpler  and less expensive  versions of its Apple Store inspired  NIO Houses   Together with the existing NIO Houses  the company now has one or more outlets in 41 Chinese cities  
Li also noted that sales of NIO s larger ES8 crossover jumped over 50  from October as a new longer range version launched last month began shipping to customers  NIO had said previously that a new 84 kilowatt hour battery would become available on both the two row  5 passenger  ES6 and the three row  6 or 7 passenger  ES8 in October  

NIO had cut the price of the entry level ES6 Standard Version at the end of September  ahead of the launch of the longer range version  
Is this good news 
It s hard to know  as NIO has been extraordinarily secretive about the state of its finances since it revealed on Sept  24 that it had burned about  620 million in the second quarter  leaving it with just  503 4 million in cash as of June 30  
The company had said in early September that it expected to raise  200 million by the end of the month  but it has yet to confirm whether that deal actually happened  China s National Business Daily reported that another anticipated financing deal  with a district government in Zhejiang province  fell through  with government officials citing  heavy risks  as the reason  
That latter deal would have given NIO an infusion of at least  707 million  along with assistance in building a much needed factory  
Given all that  and given that NIO has yet to even announce a date for its third quarter earnings release  it s hard to be optimistic about a very slight bump in sales  The stock has had a good rebound following news of a collaboration with Intel subsidiary Mobileye  but I think investors interested in this Chinese company should be very cautious until NIO gives us a clear picture of its financial situation and prospects ",2019-12-09,The Motley Fool,https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/12/09/nio-november-2019-sales.aspx?source=iedfolrf0000001,2037108

41,221556,NIO,With racing and music events  Tesla gets over marketing allergy in China,news,"By Yilei Sun and Alexandria Sage
SHANGHAI SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters    Tesla Inc  O TSLA  has always shown disdain for marketing  with CEO Elon Musk boasting his company does not advertise  instead using the money it would have spent to develop products 
But in China  the world s biggest electric vehicle market where Tesla is gearing up for a major sales push  that tune has started to change as the automaker promotes racing events  showroom parties with DJs and a line of Chinese Tesla stickers for chat apps 
Case in point  Wang Yubo  a 30 year old marketing executive and Tesla car owner  was invited by the company to burnish his driving skills at a Shanghai racing track this month 
 I learned how to push my Model 3 to its limits   said Wang  who writes both enthusiastic and critical blogs about Tesla and occasionally races his car with friends 
Tesla is expanding its focus beyond products to service  says Leo Liu  head of the company s China driving school which aims to teach people  to make full use of their cars  
It held three such events for auto reporters  social media influencers and a handful of owners in August   one in Beijing and two in Shanghai and plans to expand to other big cities such as Guangzhou and Chengdu 
 We are also thinking of having more difficult ones on ice tracks in winter this year   Liu said  adding that more owners will be invited in the future 
While Tesla hasn t embarked on conventional TV or billboard advertising  the U S  firm s China Chief Tom Zhu has been working on strategies this year to boost the brand s appeal  frequently seeking ideas and opinions from marketing and sales experts  sources familiar with the discussions said 
The sources were not authorized to speak to the media and declined to be identified  Tesla declined to comment 
BIG FACTORY  BIG PLANS
Helping raise his profile in China  Musk is currently visiting the country and on Thursday held a discussion with Alibaba s  N BABA  Jack Ma at an AI industry event  although they avoided controversial issues like the U S  China trade war 
Tesla s new efforts to reach customers in China come as the Silicon Valley automaker is preparing to open a big vehicle assembly factory in Shanghai and confront fierce competition in the luxury electric vehicle market it invented 
The firm s first overseas factory is due to start production by the end of the year and Tesla has said it should be able to build 3 000 Model 3 vehicles a week in its initial phases 
That would translate to nearly four times the number of imported Model 3 vehicles sold in China per month this year  according to figures from research firm LMC Automotive 
The plant is slated to have annual output capacity of 250 000 vehicles after production of the Model Y is added 
 We have to learn how to manage a larger sales and after sales system as production is growing to a completely different level   said one source   That s why we are doing these events now  
The sources added  however  that Tesla is spending far less than what a conventional carmaker in China would be spending on marketing 
In Tesla s favor  it has been exporting cars to China since 2014 and remains the benchmark that other automakers in China often compare their electric vehicles to when they advertise 
The launch of the Model 3 for the Chinese market in late February has also gone well  sending Tesla s China revenue jumping 42  to  1 5 billion in the first half   equivalent to 13 5  of total revenue 
But Tesla in China doesn t have the headstart in all electric vehicles that it had in the U S  market when it debuted the Model S in 2012 
Chinese startup Nio Inc  N NIO  sells two premium all electric SUVs  Jaguar has launched is I PACE SUV and BMW  DE BMWG  has its i3 hatchback and i8 sportscar  By the end of the year  Audi will have two all electric SUVs on the market while Daimler s  DE DAIGn  Mercedes will have one 
The U S firm also doesn t expect Musk s cult status to propel sales to the same extent it does elsewhere  the sources said 
Most Chinese do not have easy access to his Twitter feed followed by nearly 28 million  although Tesla translates some of his less controversial tweets on its Weibo account 
In addition to chat app stickers that express various emotions   a market strategy also used by other automakers   Tesla is partnering with Tencent s  HK 0700  QQ Music streaming service in organizing parties with DJs at showrooms 
Both marketing tactics are China only developments  the sources said 
Social media users have noticed much more activity on Tesla s Weibo account in recent months while company has also held several roundtables with reporters and internet influencers throughout China since July 
According to sources  executives explained pricing strategy and expansion plans for its charging network and said they wanted to improve communication with the public 
By contrast  in the United States Tesla rarely grants media access to its executives beyond earnings calls and product launches 




 Tesla has finally realized the importance of adjusting to China   said Wang   Given time  it will become more mature  ",2019-08-30,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/with-racing-and-music-events-tesla-gets-over-marketing-allergy-in-china-1967031,1967031

44,221559,NIO,Nio  Mobileye partner on self driving consumer passenger cars in China,news,"By Tina Bellon
 Reuters    Chinese electric car startup Nio Inc  N NIO  and Intel Corp s  O INTC  self driving car technology firm Mobileye  F 0ME  on Tuesday said they would partner to develop autonomous vehicles for the consumer market in China and eventually other countries 
Under the agreement  Nio will manufacture and produce at mass scale a self driving system designed by Mobileye  which will be integrated into Nio s electric vehicle consumer lines  as well as Mobileye s driverless ride hailing services 
The self driving kit provided by Israel based Mobileye includes the vision processing chip  camera  radar and lidar sensors  as well as safety and mapping software 
Nio will also develop a version of self driving electric vehicles that Mobileye will deploy as robotaxis for ride hailing services in global markets 
No financial details of the partnership were disclosed 
The companies plan an initial release in China beginning in 2022  Mobileye President and Chief Executive Officer Amnon Shashua told Reuters in an interview on Monday 
 The deal with Nio will also enable us to harvest data in compliance with Chinese regulations and improve mapping to support autonomous driving   Shashua said 
The Mobileye CEO added that a rollout in China was more efficient as the regulatory environment was centralized and the Chinese government was working on standardizing Mobileye s safety model for self driving cars into law 
Manufacturers and suppliers are increasingly skeptical about the speed of adoption of fully automated self driving systems  because of their high cost  complexity  and regulatory hurdles 
In the meantime  they have begun focusing on deploying more advanced driver assistance systems  ADAS   which share components  but cost much less and can generate much needed revenue to help defray the cost of developing full self driving systems 
Mobileye on Tuesday said it powers ADAS in car models of more than 27 automakers

49,221564,NIO,StockBeat  Nio in Sharp Reverse on Wider Than Expected Loss,news,"Investing com   Nio slid sharply on Wednesday after the China based electric automaker reported a wider than expected loss  blaming a slowdown in China and weaker SUV demand 
NIO  NYSE NIO  reported a fourth quarter loss per share of 3 37 renminbi   wider than the 2 22 billion loss per share consensus  according to estimates from Investing com  Revenue for the quarter came in at 3 44 billion renminbi  beating expectations of 2 91 billion 
The electric automaker blamed the loss on a slowdown in deliveries  particularly for its ES8  an SUV launched last year in the Chinese market  as demand waned and Chinese consumers held back from auto purchases amid a slowdown in the economy 
 Deliveries of the ES8 in January and February 2019 were 1 805 and 811 vehicles respectively  which reflect a greater than anticipated slowdown in monthly deliveries compared to December 2018   Nio said 
The company also suffered an overhang from accelerated deliveries toward the end of last year  when Chinese consumers rushed to buy electric vehicles to beat the electric vehicle subsidy that went into effect this year 
In a sign that optimism may have soured  the company slammed the brakes on the plans to open a factory in Shanghai  raising concerns that slowing auto sales in China are set to continue 
The electric automaker s deeper than expected swerve into the red also prompted some on Wall Street to turn bearish 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch dropped Nio to an underperform rating from neutral  citing the company s downgraded forecast for shipments 
For the first quarter  Nio is expecting ES8 delivery to be between 3 500 and 3 800 vehicles  a decrease of 56  to 52  from fourth quarter  The company guided revenue between 1 39 billion renminbi and 1 52 billion renminbi  which would be about 60  to 56  lower year on year ",2019-03-06,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/marketpulse-nio-in-sharp-reverse-on-widerthanexpected-loss-1799694,1799694

Trump s threats reportedly prompted China to scrap this week s scheduled round of trade talks  consistent with its policy of refusing to negotiate  with a gun to its head   The Wall Street Journal reported that a trade delegation would fly to Washington as planned 
It wasn t clear  however  whether vice premier Liu He would head the delegation  as scheduled  Liu s absence would make it harder for the delegation to make any top level decisions and thus possibly push back further the timeline for a possible resolution to the dispute between the two countries 
The tweets came as a surprise after officials close to the talks had briefed about gradual progress and dangled the possibility of a summit at the end of May to sign off on a deal

Trump s intervention came only 48 hours after another solid employment report damped hopes of any near term interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve  Three senior Fed officials may offer their interpretation of that report when they speak later Monday

56,221571,NIO,Ford  Zayo Group  Nio Sidestep Selloff,news,"Investing com   Ford  Zayo Group and Nio offered a semblance of safety heading into the close Monday in the midst of broad based selling 
Ford Motor Company  NYSE F  rose 2  after German automaker VW confirmed the two brands would jointly develop electric vehicles or autonomous driving  but denied rumours that a merger between the two companies was in the making 
VW CEO Diess said Monday the joint development of commercial vehicles was  core to the alliance   but denied the partnership would lead to a full merger with Ford  claiming  that was never the objective of our talks  
Fibre optic provider Group Holdings Inc  NYSE ZAYO  shares surged 10  following a Bloomberg report that an investor group led by Blackstone  NYSE BX  and Stonepeak may be interested in making an offer for the company 
The uptick in Zayo comes after a prolonged period of mostly sideways action in the wake its quarterly results  which fell short of consensus estimates  though Wells Fargo said the weakness was somewhat overdone 
 While we understand the company fell short of the September quarter expectations and management credibility is at an all time low  the market s reaction seems a bit extreme given that Zayo remains the largest independent owner of North American fiber assets   Wells Fargo said in a note to clients 
Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA  rival  NIO Inc   NYSE NIO  rose 7  after Citron Research Andrew Left delivered an upbeat assessment of the electric automaker  claiming it is  not just a car company   but a lifestyle and brand that is  ready to disrupt

57,221572,NIO,Stocks   Dow Drops Nearly 400 Points as Apple Leads Tech Rout,news,"Investing com   A rout in Apple and Facebook  NASDAQ FB  Monday swept through tech  prompting a wave of selling across the broader market 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell about 1 56   the S P 500 fell 1 66   while the Nasdaq Composite fell 3 03  
Sentiment soured on FAANG stocks after investors digested a Wall Street Journal report that Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  was considering cutting production as demand for its newest slate of phones was not as strong as the company had hoped  Its shares fell 4  
The plunge in Apple sent shockwaves throughout shares of its suppliers  some of whom had cut their growth outlook last week  adding further pressure in tech 
Facebook  NASDAQ FB  also exacerbated the slide in the broader market as The Wall Street Journal reported that CEO Mark Zuckerberg may be driving out top executives  Its shares fell 6  
The report from the Journal  indicating further signs of turmoil for the social media giant  comes just days after the company had denied allegations that it had conspired to cover up Russian influence and propaganda on its platform 
Energy  meanwhile  also played a role in the selloff even as U S  oil prices settled higher  on potential European Union sanctions on Iran and possible OPEC production cuts 
In a sign of skittish sentiment on stocks  defensive sectors of the market like estate and utilities closed in positive territory for the day as investors sought refuge from riskier sectors 
Lingering optimism on U S  China trade was soiled  meanwhile  following Vice President Mike Pence s remarks Sunday  asserting that there would be no end to U S  charges on  250 billion worth of Chinese goods unless China changed its practices toward trade  Pence s comments come ahead of a crucial meeting between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G20 summit slated for the end of November 
So far  the United States has slapped tariffs on  250 billion worth of Chinese goods  about half the value of U S  imports from the country  China has retaliated with tariffs on  110 billion worth of American exports 
On the economic front  investors had to contend with yet another report pointing to a slowdown in the U S  housing market  which did little to lift sentiment on equities 
The National Association of Home Builders Wells Fargo Housing Market Index fell eight points to 60 in November  That was the lowest reading since August 2016 
In corporate news  Tesla rival NIO  NYSE NIO  soared 9  after Citron Research Andrew Left delivered an upbeat assessment of the electric automaker  claiming it is  not just a car company   but a lifestyle and brand that is  ready to disrupt
