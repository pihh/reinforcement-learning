3663,225178,PEG,PSEG  PEG  Reports Next Week  What To Know Ahead Of The Release,opinion,"PSEG  PEG  is expected to deliver flat earnings compared to the year ago quarter on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on October 31  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This parent company of PSEG Power and Public Service Electric   Gas Co  Is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 95 per share in its upcoming report  which represents no change from the year ago quarter 
Revenues are expected to be  2 55 billion  up 6 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3 98  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for PSEG 
For PSEG  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that PSEG will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that PSEG would post earnings of  0 62 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 58  delivering a surprise of  6 45  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
PSEG doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/pseg-peg-reports-next-week-what-to-know-ahead-of-the-release-200477592,200477592

3671,225186,PEG,Are You Looking For A High Growth Dividend Stock  PSEG  PEG  Could Be A Great Choice,opinion,"All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio  whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  However  when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long term returns  with dividend contributions exceeding one third of total returns in many cases 
PSEG in Focus
Headquartered in Newark  PSEG  PEG  is a Utilities stock that has seen a price change of 15 31  so far this year  Currently paying a dividend of  0 47 per share  the company has a dividend yield of 3 13   In comparison  the Utility   Electric Power industry s yield is 2 89   while the S P 500 s yield is 1 88  
Looking at dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  1 88 is up 4 4  from last year  In the past five year period  PSEG has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 5 01   Looking ahead  future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  PSEG s current payout ratio is 58   meaning it paid out 58  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
PEG is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  3 28 per share  which represents a year over year growth rate of 5 13  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for many reasons  they greatly improve stock investing profits  decrease overall portfolio risk  and carry tax advantages  among others  It s important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout 
Big  established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  but it s fairly uncommon to see high growth businesses or tech start ups offer their stockholders a dividend  During periods of rising interest rates  income investors must be mindful that high yielding stocks tend to struggle  With that in mind  PEG is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-07-09,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/are-you-looking-for-a-highgrowth-dividend-stock-pseg-peg-could-be-a-great-choice-200438524,200438524

146482,367997,PEG,U S  utilities file legal challenge to Trump power plant rule,news," Reuters    Con Edison and eight other U S  utilities mostly from Democratic led states have filed a legal challenge to the Trump administration s plan to cut carbon emissions from power plants  which replaces a much tougher Obama era rule 
The New York based power company said in a statement on Monday that the Affordable Clean Energy  ACE  rule undermines efforts already under way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by investing in renewable energy  electric vehicle infrastructure and energy efficiency and other clean technologies 
The group of utilities  which calls itself the Power Companies Climate Coalition  have already invested heavily in adopting those technologies because their state governments passed laws requiring them to adopt large amounts of renewable energy such as wind and solar 
In addition to Con Ed  the coalition comprises  Exelon Corp   N EXC    National Grid   L NG   PG E Corp  N PCG   Public Service Enterprise Group Inc  N PEG   Los Angeles Department of Water and Power  Seattle City Light  Sacramento Municipal Utility District and New York Power Authority  Together  they serve over 23 million customers in 49 states 
A similar suit was filed by Democratic led states and cities in August 
The utility group s petition was filed in the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals on Sept  6 but was not widely reported at the time 
In a statement released on the day it filed the petition  the coalition said the Environmental Protection Agency s ACE rule  fails to acknowledge the ways in which they and others within the power sector have already reduced their carbon emissions while maintaining reliability  
The rule  finalized in June of this year  is aimed at helping coal companies facing tough competition from renewable energy suppliers  It gives states three years to devise their own plans to cut emissions mainly by encouraging coal fired power plants to improve efficiency 
Obama s Clean Power Plan aimed to slash power plant carbon emissions by more than a third from 2005 levels by 2030 by pushing utilities to drop coal  That regulation was never enacted because of lawsuits by Republican led states ",2019-09-16,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-utilities-file-legal-challenge-to-trump-power-plant-rule-1979105,1979105

When looking at the last two reports  this parent company of PSEG Power and Public Service Electric   Gas Co  Has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 3 24   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the last reported quarter  PSEG came out with earnings of  0 95 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 92 per share  representing a surprise of 3 26   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  0 62 per share and it actually produced earnings of  0 64 per share  delivering a surprise of 3 23  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for PSEG lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
PSEG has an Earnings ESP of  1 82  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on February 27  2019 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-02-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-pseg-peg-could-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200386888,200386888
146567,368082,PEG,Analysts Estimate PSEG  PEG  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when PSEG  PEG  reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 27  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise

This parent company of PSEG Power and Public Service Electric   Gas Co  Is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 55 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  3 5  
Revenues are expected to be  2 36 billion  up 12 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2 08  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for PSEG 
For PSEG  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 18  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that PSEG will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that PSEG would post earnings of  0 92 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 95  delivering a surprise of  3 26  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
PSEG doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-02-19,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-pseg-peg-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200390193,200390193

146644,368159,PEG,Is Public Service Enterprise  PEG  A Suitable Value Pick  ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated   NYSE PEG   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Public Service Enterprise has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15 00  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 05  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Public Service Enterprise s current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years However  the stock s PE compares unfavorably with the Zacks classified Utility Electric Power industry trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 13 97  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively overvalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Public Service Enterprise has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 14 94  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for the stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  PEG has a P S ratio of about 2 45  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 11 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is around its highs in particular over the past few years If anything  Public Service Enterprise is towards the higher end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  which suggests that the company s stock price has already appreciated to some degree  relative to its sales Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Public Service Enterprise currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  B   putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Public Service Enterprise a good choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 5 45  which is far better than the industry average of 7 22  Clearly  PEG is a good choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Public Service Enterprise might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  B  and a Momentum score of  B   This gives PEG a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  B    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimate has been mixed at best  The current year has seen two upward and no downward estimate revision in the past thirty days  while the next year has seen two upward and downward estimate revision in the same time frame As a result  the current year consensus estimate has remained stable in the past one month  while the next year estimate has inched higher by 0 7   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated Price and Consensus   This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LinePublic Service Enterprise is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its good lineup of statistics on this front  However  the stock belongs to an industry which is ranked among the bottom 37   out of more than 250 industries   indicating that broader factors are unfavorable for the company  In fact  over the past one year  the Zacks Utility Electric Power industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for broader factors to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single

146681,368197,PEG, 2 Low Beta Utility Dividend Stocks Beating The Market,opinion,"Looking for low beta dividend stocks  that don t march to the beat of the market  It s a common theme these days  with P Es of traditional value stocks and defensive stocks getting a bit stretched  Thanks to their dividend yields  and defensive attributes  normally stodgy Utilities stocks have led the pack in 2016  by a wide margin 
With this market leading success in mind  we wondered if there were any low beta utility dividend stocks left  which were still reasonably priced  We came up with two stocks  Public Service Enterprise Group   NYSE PEG   and South Jersey Industries   NYSE SJI   both of which have low betas  and a dividend yield over 3  
Profiles  South Jersey Industries is an energy services holding company based in Folsom  NJ  that operates through two primary subsidiaries   South Jersey Gas delivers natural gas to approximately 375 000 customers in southern New Jersey  SJI s non regulated businesses  under South Jersey Energy Solutions  develops  owns and operates on site energy production facilities  acquiring and marketing natural gas and electricity for retail customers  providing wholesale commodity marketing and fuel management services  and offering HVAC and other energy efficiency related services  South Jersey Gas was founded in 1948 
Public Service Enterprise Group  through its subsidiaries  operates as an energy company primarily in the Northeastern and Mid  Atlantic United States  The company operates nuclear  coal  gas  oil fired  and renewable generation facilities with a generation capacity of approximately 11 678 megawatts  It sells electricity  natural gas  emissions credits  and a series of energy related products  The company also transmits electricity  and distributes electricity and gas to residential  commercial  and industrial customers  as well as invests in solar generation projects  and implements energy efficiency and demand response programs  In addition  it offers appliance services and repairs to customers 
Don t get fooled by the dividend history for SJI   they did cut their dividend by half  but this was due to a 2 for 1 stock split  SJI has a lower dividend yield  but a much better dividend growth rate than PEG  at 11 14  
Both companies cover their dividends with ample EPS  with PEG being a tad more conservative  at 51   vs  61  for SJI 
Options There are options listed for PEG and SJI  but they re not that attractive at present  
Valuations  PEG is a much bigger firm  at over 10x SJI s market cap  It also looks much cheaper than SJI  on a P E basis  in addition to having lower Price Book EV EBITDA  and Price Sales valuations 

Performance and Technical  SJI s higher valuations stem from the huge outperformance it has had in 2016   it s up over 37  year to date 
That outperformance is the trade off vs  beta   PEG has a much lower beta  of only  20  vs   62 for SJI  But  hey  we ll take a 22  year to date gain  no problem  PEG s trading volume of 3 plus million shares day is about 5x SJI s volume  but both stocks are liquid 
This 2016 chart shows how SJI took off in mid May  after increasing the size of a secondary offering of its common stock by 500 000 shares  bringing the total offering to 7 million shares  SJI also received an analyst upgrade to Buy from Guggenheim   Each column represents a month in this chart  
Financials  PEG has slightly better ROA  ROE  and ROI stats than SJI  in addition to having a higher Operating Margin  and a lower debt load 
Disclosure  Author owned no shares of PEG or SJI  at the time of this writing

146710,368226,PEG,Value Investing  A Model,opinion,I ran across this article  Value Investor or Value Pretender  Which Are You   by John Mihaljevic who puts out The Manual of Ideas  along with Oliver Mihaljevic  I appreciate what they do   you can learn a lot from their organization   I told him that I was going to write this  and he said to me   The piece was meant tongue in cheek but feel free to rip it apart    I will rip it apart  but gently  because every point he made is mostly true for value investors  but there are variations in the way that value investors operate  so you can do some of the things he says you can t do  and still be a value investor   what matters is how you implement them   There will be more parts to my  Education of a Risk Manager  series  and one of them will deal with all of the different managers that I met  and how much they varied in terms of what they thought were factors that mattered   Thus  as I developed my own theories of value investing  I considered the range of opinion  and realized that there is a single model for value investing  but that it is complex enough that different parties use different approximations of the full model  and those approximations do better and worse in different environments   Like a David Letterman style Top 10 list  John Mihaljevic listed and described things that made you a value pretender  Time to go through them   Reason  10  You invest based on chart patterns I don t use chart patterns  but I do use momentum both positively   negatively  There is decent evidence that investors are slow to react to new information  and so stocks with strong price momentum over 200 days tend to do better  There is some evidence where there is lousy price momentum over a 4 year period  that things tend to mean revert   Granted  there is a tendency among some value investors to troll the 52 week low list  I like doing that too  but you have to be careful  because maybe you are missing something that cleverer investors know  The same would be true of short interest figures  Whenever I see one of my stocks gain a high short interest ratio  shares sold short   volume  or   of mkt cap sold short   I do a review to see what I don t know  That s why I am not afraid of the high level of shorting on Stancorp Financial  This is a conservatively run firm that manages risk up front  Even though disability claims rise when unemployment is high  they underwrite better than most of the industry   There have been some very successful value plus momentum investors  The balance is tricky  but blending two of the most powerful anomalies does bear fruit   Reason  9  You assume multiple expansion in your investment theses I never assume that  but if you are buying them  safe and cheap   you often do get multiple expansion  The challenge is figuring out where things are less bad then the implied opinion of the depressed valuation   Reason  8  You try to figure out how a company will do vis   vis quarterly EPS estimates I don t do that either  but I have known some value managers that incorporate prior earnings surprise data  because past earnings surprises are correlated with future surprises  Often  near the the turnaround point for a company s stock  there are some earnings surprises   Reason  7  You base your decisions on analyst recommendations I have few arguments with this  except negatively  Sell side analysts are trailing indicators  I like buying companies where the sell side is negative  but not very negative  With very negative opinion  there are often reasons to stay away  unless you possess specific knowledge that the sell side analysts do not have   Reason  6  You use P E to Growth  PEG  as a key valuation metric I m sorry  but PEG works  if indeed you have the growth rate right  which is a challenge  I do try to analyze sustainable competitive advantage for the firms that I own  That often leads to growth  Now I am a growth skeptic  so it takes a lot to make me pay up for growth  but occasionally I will do so  when the PEG is low enough   Reason  5  You use EBITDA as a measure of cash flow EBITDA is not cash flow from operations  or free cash flow  but it is a valuable figure in value investing when it divides into Enterprise Value  Value of Debt   Value of Stock   Cash   Low ratios of Enterprise value divided by EBITDA are very effective at identifying promising investments   it indicates cheap assets  and in a time when M A is hot  it can really pay off   Reason  4  You would worry about your portfolio if the market closed for a year I could live with the market closed  but there are advantages to having it open  With any given stock  there are times in a year to increase or reduce exposure   if you have a firm idea of what the firm is worth  you can buy more during dips  and sell a little into strong rallies  Short term  one month  stock price movements are fickle  and commonly reverse   Reason  3  You make investment decisions based on the activity or tips of others But Manual of Ideas tracks the 13F filings of great investors  I get good ideas from the best investors also  but you have to do your own research  Many bright investors chat with each other  and I had many occasions at the hedge fund that I worked for where I disagreed with a friend of the boss  I was right more often than I was wrong   Perhaps a better way to phrase it is  choose your idea generators wisely  but do your own research as well    Reason  2  Your investment process centers on the market opportunity This is largely true  but when I know a industry or sector is in horrible shape  I often buy the strongest name in the industry  realizing that they will do well as the competition dies  and they don t  Also  there are times when few recognize that pricing power has shifted  and it is time to take a position on a misunderstood industry that is about to grow faster than expected  Particularly with cyclical companies this idea can be promising   The same applies to countries where the markets are washed out  Don t try to time the bottom  but when a country is cheap  buy a promising safe company in the country after things have turned up for 100 days or so   Reason  1  Your investment theses do not reference the stock price At some points  I like to own companies with strong management teams relative to their industry  I will let valuation stretch at those points  because there is more of a sustainable competitive advantage there  You get more positive surprises  and that definitely aids total returns   That said  a focus valuation is key to all investing  The only thing more important is margin of safety   Margin of Safety There are three elements to margin of safety   1  Sustainable Competitive Advantage  Strong Gross Margins  2  Strong Balance Sheet  Conservative Accounting  3  Cheap Price vs Likely Value  This is different from other formulations of margin of safety  because one has to take into account factors that make it less certain that we can calculate value  Many value managers were buying cheap financials up until September 2008  only to realize that their estimates of value were wrong because credit losses would be far worse than expected   Good stock analysis begins with good bond analysis  If you wouldn t buy a bond from the firm  you probably shouldn t buy the stock  Value investing is conservative  and looks for situations where there is little credit risk   Conclusion  I am a firm believer in value investing  but I realize that there are many ways to approach the process  I watch other value investors  and continue to learn  Good value investors are lifelong learners  and generalists with broad knowledge  It is not a narrow discipline  but one that can accommodate new knowledge   Full disclosure  long SFG,2013-04-04,David Merkel,https://www.investing.com/analysis/value-investing:-a-model-161582,161582
