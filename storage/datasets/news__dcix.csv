1813,223328,DCIX,Diana Containerships  57  on  6M buyback program,news,Diana Containerships  NASDAQ DCIX  is soaring postmarket  up 57 2  on after hours volume that s approaching its daily regular session volume  following announcement of a share repurchase program  The company s authorized buying back up to  6M in common shares Market cap at the close was just  11 5M  Some 1 26M shares have moved since the close  recent regular session volume is 1 65M shares  Now read ,2019-01-09,Seeking Alpha,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/diana-containerships-57-on-6m-buyback-program-1743088,1743088
1814,223329,DCIX,Morgan Stanley Turns In A Strong Report Card On Speculation,opinion,"At the beginning of the year   that Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS  recently included in 13G filings to disclose significant stakes  My interest was sparked by a surprising stake in Xunlei Limited  NASDAQ XNET   and I was further surprised to find a notable list of speculative stakes by Morgan  Now that   I thought I would take a quick look at the year to date performance of those stocks  The relatively strong performance card suggests that Morgan Stanley sure knows how to speculate 
For reference  the S P 500  via SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   is up 2 2  year to date  The more speculative NASDAQ is up 4 9  year to date  The even more speculative iShares Russell 2000 ETF  NYSE IWM  is up just 0 6  since the end of 2017 
Year to date performance of Morgan s recent positions  mostly speculative  in descending order 
Atara Biotherapeutics  Inc   NASDAQ ATRA   151  SharpSpring  Inc   NASDAQ SHSP   13 0  Apptio  Inc   NASDAQ APTI   11 4  PennyMac Financial Services  Inc   NYSE PFSI   11 2  Asbury Automotive Group  Inc   NYSE ABG   7 5  Overstock  NASDAQ OSTK   0 4  Highland Floating Rate Opportun  HFRO    0 3  BlackRock 2022 Global Income Opportunity Trust  NYSE BGIO    1 5  Roku  NASDAQ ROKU    7 0  Xunlei Limited  NASDAQ XNET    13 0  PHH Corporation  NYSE PHH    15 0  Diana Container Ships  NASDAQ DCIX    31 5 
I am guessing the position in Atara is by itself enough to make up for the losing positions  including the head scratcher position in DCIX  Morgan s strongest stocks barely swooned during the recent sell off  ATRA is at an all time high  APTI is just off its all time high  SHSP actually RALLIED during the sell off  PFSI took a spill during the sell off  but its bounce back has been sharp enough to send the stock soaring to a new all time high 
In other words  when Morgan speaks it likely pays to listen  However  and very ironically  my two active positions which overlap with Morgan are hedged shorts in OSTK and ROKU that I have flipped multiple times  I have not shorted XNET this year 

Morgan s position in Atara Biotherapeutics  Inc   NASDAQ ATRA  is by far its best speculation to date in 2018  The stock continues to ride momentum from January s success with the FDA 


PennyMac Financial Services  Inc   NYSE PFSI  bounced sharply out of the recent sell off  It is a bit surprising to see a mortgage company come out the sell off with MORE vigor 


Morgan Stanley s position in Diana Containerships Inc   NASDAQ DCIX  is by far its worst of 2018  I am still scratching my head over this position since DCIX mainly just sells off day after day

So what the heck is going on with shipping companies this week  A recent note from Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC  analysts Michael Webber suggests that this industry is being affected by a bubble created by algorithm based trading 
 While we believe retail momentum and short covering likely got this trade going  given the sheer size of the volume and the continued  relentless  pricing movements  we believe momentum based algorithms  quant trading  are likely a very significant factor catalyst at this point   Webber noted 
 We believe this is important to note  given that if these moves were purely a retail momentum trade  the incremental value created could have relatively more staying power than a more quant driven flash  esque  bubble  
Long story short  these shipping stocks are going absolutely crazy right now  If you are a brave investor  perhaps there are some short term plays to be made here  but the sheer volatility of these stocks is enough to keep me away for now

1981,223496,DCIX,Here s What s Fueling The Irrational Rally In Shipping Stocks,opinion,"Sino Global Shipping America Ltd  NASDAQ SINO  just became the latest container ship company to see its shares rise well over 1 000  in the past week 
SINO joins DryShips Inc  NASDAQ DRYS  and Diana Containerships Inc  NASDAQ DCIX  in the frenzied rally that actually caused  yesterday  and now into today  There s no word on when DRYS will resume trading  as Nasdaq attempts to find out what exactly is leading to these unprecedented gains   Update  Nasdaq says DRYS will resume trading at 10 30am today  
These companies have gone from nearly bankrupt penny stocks to incredible gainers almost overnight  Benzinga has a possible explanation as to why 

One of the primary reasons for the extreme moves in DryShips and other shipping stocks is a combination of large short positions in the stocks and extremely low share counts  DryShips in particular lowered its share count from around 672 million to only around 1 million via a series of reverse stock splits throughout the year  The splits were intended to allow the stock to maintain its Nasdaq listing after it had lost more than 98 percent of its value in the first 10 months of 2016 
Even industry insiders are suspicious of the move  Euroseas Chief Financial Officer Tasos Aslidis told Benzinga rising shipping rates have been  significant  but not to the point of justifying such wild moves in  stock  price  

A few other reasons are floating around as well  including a sharp uptick in the Baltic Dry Index  which has been rising steadily over the past few months  Another explanation is the successful bankruptcy liquidation of Korea s Hanjin Shipping Co Ltd  KS 117930   whose assets sold at a higher than expected price 
 also points out that shipping rates are sharply rising 

The day rates for the most popular large dry bulk vessels  capesizes  soared by more than 10  overnight   which is now fueling the speculative fires in the bulkers this morning 

Finally  a major Taiwanese government bailout of its two largest shipping companies  Evergreen Marine Corp  and Yang Ming Marine Transport  was just approved  This  1 9 billion package may be giving hope to other nearly bankrupt shippers that they too could see some government help coming their way 
Whatever the true catalysts  the moves in these stocks are highly irregular and completely irrational  We continue to urge investors to stay away from them as a result ",2016-11-18,ETF Daily News,https://www.investing.com/analysis/here’s-what’s-fueling-the-irrational-rally-in-shipping-stocks-200165320,200165320

1984,223499,DCIX,The Speculations Of Morgan Stanley ,opinion,"The raging bull market has helped facilitate instant excitement any time a company announces a cryptocurrency related project or product  Xunlei Ltd Adr  NASDAQ XNET  is one of several companies that have enjoyed such a boost  XNET soared from just over  4 to  25 in less than two months on the heels of crypto news 

Xunlei Limited  XNET  is riding a crypto surge 
I think of such stocks as the playthings of speculators  so I was very surprised to see  that Morgan Stanley took a 5 1  passive stake in XNET  I shared the news with a trader friend because I concluded the Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS  endorsement ended the opportunity to short the stock  He agreed and informed me that MS has recently disclosed stakes in other very speculative  Wondering whether there is more to this story  I decided to check out the SEC 13G filings myself  Sure enough  since November  MS has disclosed several of speculative stakes 
I only looked back to late November  but I found a sufficient number of filings of interest  I list them below by the date of the disclosed ownership  The SEC filing typically gets released about a week after the date of the ownership stake  I put an asterisk by the names I consider particularly speculative  The percentage stake is listed along with the name of the company  A link to the SEC filing is provided on the date  I include charts of particular interest

   SharpSpring Inc  NASDAQ SHSP   1 1  SHSP is the one of two single digit stocks on the list  It is also a micro cap stock  so I am very curious to uncover what Morgan finds so special about this small Florida based internet services provider 
With a market cap of 36M and average daily volume of 77K  hardly anyone else besides Morgan Stanley is paying attention to Florida based internet service provide SharpSpring  SHSP

 November 30  Overstock com  NASDAQ OSTK   11 4  This position caught my interest most of all  First of all  this stake is Morgan s largest of the ones I found  Secondly  OSTK has become a crypto blockchain play which means  combined with the XNET position  Morgan is clearly trying to make big moves in the space 

Overstock com  OSTK  is well supported by its uptrending 50 day moving average  DMA  as it rides a crypto blockchain surge

 December 4  Diana Containerships Inc  NASDAQ DCIX   5 3  Of all the speculations in this list  DCIX baffled me the most  I think the chart stands by itself for generating bewilderment  DCIX traded over  700 000 share in 2011  I do not even want to count the number of reverse splits that DCIX has implemented since then 

This weekly chart of Diana Containerships  DCIX  is enough said  DCIX traded above 700 000 in 2011

PHH Corporation  PHH  had a rough 2017 
I cannot say whether Morgan Stanley has been any more speculative than usual  This exercise just opened my eyes to the range of speculation that the big boy financial institutions may dare to enjoy  I will check back on these names from time to time and perhaps add to the list as Morgan adds to its docket  Since some of these passive stakes have already paid off handsomely for Morgan  I suspect the gold is not done here 
Be careful out there 
Full disclosure  short OSTK shares  short OSTK call spread  note   I will not be holding these positions much longer now that I know about Morgan s extra large stake  ",2018-01-03,Dr. Duru,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-speculations-of-morgan-stanley-200277181,200277181
