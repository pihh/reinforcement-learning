3882,225397,MXIM,AI Poised to Impact High Skill U S  Jobs Including Finance  Tech,news," Bloomberg     Artificial intelligence is coming for America s high paid professions as it creates winners and losers across the labor market like never before 
White collar jobs and better educated occupations along with production workers are among the most susceptible to AI s spread into the economy  according to a Brookings Institution report Wednesday that draws on a new analysis of patent data by a Stanford University economist 
 Just as the impacts of robotics and software tend to be sizable and negative on exposed middle  and low skill occupations  so AI s inroads are projected to negatively impact higher skill occupations   researchers Mark Muro  Jacob Whiton and Robert Maxim  NASDAQ MXIM  wrote  Workers with graduate or professional degrees will be almost four times as exposed to AI as workers with just a high school degree  the report showed 
The researchers also concluded that AI appears most likely to affect men  prime age and white and Asian American workers  Business  finance  and technology will be more exposed  along with natural resource and production industries  they found  Farming  one of humanity s earliest jobs  may also be affected by AI as drones and precision agriculture help boost productivity  Farming  fishing and forestry had the top exposure score of any occupational group 
The paper is the latest in a growing body of research on how labor markets may be upended by AI  the algorithms that can learn to handle tasks by finding statistical patterns in data rather than by following directions from people 
The findings also highlight how much remains unknown about the effects of AI versus other types of automation on jobs  and that while the impacts may be concentrated more in some areas than others  the technology ultimately could affect work in almost every occupational group  Some 740 of 769 occupations in the analysis could be  exposed to  complemented by  or completed by AI   the researchers concluded 
The category of market research analysts and marketing specialists has the highest exposure to AI  according to the report s scores  followed by sales managers  computer programmers and personal financial advisers 
While high end jobs face an impact  that may not go all the way to the top   the most elite workers    such as CEOs    appear to be somewhat protected   the researchers find 
Metro Areas
Geographically  the bigger  more technologically oriented metro areas that are heavily involved in manufacturing are likely to experience the most disruption  according to the researchers with the institution s Metropolitan Policy Program 
Exposure to AI will be greatest in the eastern heartland from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico given ties to manufacturing in states including Wisconsin  Michigan  Indiana  Kentucky  Tennessee and Alabama  Washington state also is highly exposed because of the concentration of advanced manufacturing and technology in the Seattle area  the home of  Microsoft Corp   NASDAQ MSFT   and Amazon com Inc  NASDAQ AMZN    as well as Boeing  NYSE BA  Co  s main aircraft plants 
Patent Data
The report by Muro and his colleagues builds on their earlier work though takes a new direction because of their partnership with Stanford economist and Ph D  student Michael Webb  In his paper out this month  Webb combines descriptions from a U S  Labor Department database of occupations and tasks with the text of patents containing information about what technologies do 
There were more than 640 000 applications filed and 338 000 patents issued last year  according to the U S  Patent and Trademark Office  They give owners the exclusive right to an invention  and the applications for them can show where research funding is spent 
Webb uses a natural language processing algorithm    itself a kind of AI    to extract the verb noun pairs from the patent filings  such as how a doctor s job description might include the task  diagnose condition   Then he quantifies how many patents correspond to technology with similar verb noun pairs  such as  diagnose disease   Finally he uses the prevalence of those patents to assign a score to the task  and aggregates the task level scores to occupations 
Men and Women
AI is less likely to be able to take over in situations where relationships between people are key  which means men are more likely to be affected than women  Webb said in an interview   Women are much more likely to be in occupations that require strong interpersonal skills   Webb said in a phone interview 
Webb also cautioned that timing is a big question   We are too early in the development of AI to know how much more of the technology there is to be developed  and too early also to know how long it will take to be adopted   Webb wrote in the paper   If history is a guide  the main impacts on the labor market may not appear for three decades  
Muro and his colleagues emphasize that the findings don t have a time element 
 Webb s novel procedures demonstrate that we have a lot to learn about artificial intelligence  and that these are extremely early days in our inquiries   the researchers wrote   What s coming may not resemble what we have been experiencing or expect to experience  ",2019-11-20,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economic-indicators/ai-poised-to-impact-highskill-us-jobs-including-finance-tech-2024108,2024108
3883,225398,MXIM,Dunkin  profit beats as costs dip  defends in competitive breakfast and coffee market,news,"By Nivedita Balu
 Reuters    Dunkin  Brands Group Inc  O DNKN  reported better than expected quarterly profit amid lower costs on Thursday and raised its forecast for 2019  betting on investments to improve delivery and new menu items to boost growth 
The company  which also owns ice cream chain Baskin Robbins  now expects adjusted earnings of  3 10 per share to  3 12 per share for 2019  exceeding its prior estimate of  3 02 to  3 05 
Shares of the company  whose brand has been built around donuts and coffee  climbed 6  to  78 43 in morning trading 
Besides pushing for speedy delivery and introducing new menu items  the company has also latched on to the plant based meat trend that has taken over the restaurant industry  by rolling out Beyond Meat  O BYND  breakfast sandwiches 
 We believe it s a trend and not a fad   Chief Executive David Hoffmann told Reuters in a phone interview  adding that the chain put its unique  Dunkin  spin on it  
It will be the first breakfast restaurant to launch a plant based protein nationwide when it rolls out its Beyond Sausage Sandwich on Nov  5 after successful tests in Manhattan and a few other areas 
But Dunkin  is also playing defence in an extremely competitive breakfast and coffee markets  pushing into premium coffees sold at affordable prices compared with rival  Starbucks Corp   O SBUX  
Sales at its U S  Dunkin  stores open more than an year rose at a slower than expected pace  growing 1 5  in the third quarter ended Sept  28  below 1 7  estimates  according to IBES data from Refinitiv 
It also saw a decline in traffic versus Starbucks  3  gain  Dunkin  didn t provide details on the drop in traffic 
 Although we believe espresso  along with targeted  2 afternoon beverage promotions  helped deliver afternoon traffic  it likely was not enough to offset the traffic decline  in the core morning part of the day  Maxim  NASDAQ MXIM  analyst Stephen Anderson wrote in a note about Dunkin  
 We know there is more to be done  The consumer  we think  is strong  We are seeing a really good  healthy consumer   Hoffmann told Reuters 
Burger chain The Wendy s Co  O WEN  also plans to launch into breakfast next year 
Dunkin s DD Perks loyalty programme had 12 million members at the end of the third quarter as it continued to boost its digital programs 
 We know we ve got some gaps to close in terms of our loyalty and also mobile order and pay   Hoffmann told investors during an earlier call 
General and administrative expenses fell nearly 6  in the quarter 
Net income rose to  72 4 million   56 million   or 86 cents per share  from  66 1 million  or 79 cents per share  a year earlier

181544,403060,MXIM,Russian Finance Chief Demoted Amid Kremlin Spending Push,news," Bloomberg     President Vladimir Putin demoted the man seen as the architect of the tight budget policies that have made Russian bonds an investor favorite  fueling expectations the Kremlin is planning a spending spree to boost living standards 
Anton Siluanov lost his role as first deputy prime minister  but retained his post as finance minister in the cabinet shake up  The first deputy prime minister job went to Andrey Belousov  a Kremlin aide known for his advocacy of a greater state role in the economy  effectively making him Siluanov s boss 
Economy Minister Maxim  NASDAQ MXIM  Oreshkin was replaced with Maxim Reshetnikov  a former regional governor  Oreshkin is likely to become a Kremlin economic aide  two people familiar with the matter said last week 
 The most important task of the new government is to improve the welfare of our citizens   Putin said at a meeting with the new team late Tuesday 
 The market would happily take a somewhat higher fiscal spending if it meant that growth finally accelerates   said Viktor Szabo  an investment director at Aberdeen Asset Management in London  before the cabinet was named   Decent growth is the only factor missing in the otherwise very solid macro story  
Optimism Over Putin s Spending Vow Stokes Rally in Russia Stocks
At the first meeting of the new cabinet  new Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin promised to spur economic growth and improve Russia s investment climate  He said he wants to focus on accelerating progress on delivering Putin s so called National Projects  a  400 billion infrastructure spending program that has been slow to start 
One of the architects of the spending plans  Belousov proposed in 2018 that the government could increase taxes on metals  mining and chemical companies to raise funding  The plan was scrapped after Siluanov s ministry ruled it would hurt the investment climate 
In a speech in parliament last week  Mishustin vowed to stick with the current tight money policies that have helped bring down inflation  The former tax chief moved to install his own team at the government headquarters  known as the White House  naming Dmitry Grigorenko  a lieutenant from the State Tax Service  as his chief of staff 
New Spending
Spending on the National projects was meant to get underway last year but the plans were stalled after getting caught up in bureaucracy  As a result  inflation slowed well below a central bank s target and economic growth has struggled to break above 2  
Putin also announced proposals to spend about 4 trillion rubles   65 billion  over four years  as much as 1  of gross domestic product  in new benefits for the poor and families 
Yields on Russian local currency bonds maturing in 10 years have climbed 3 basis points to 6 22  this week  The ruble dropped when news broke about the government overhaul last week  and was trading down 0 4  on Tuesday

181546,403062,MXIM,Putin hoping to secure economic legacy with reshuffle  sources,news,"By Andrey Ostroukh and Gabrielle T trault Farber
MOSCOW  Reuters    A Russian government reshuffle that brought in a new first deputy prime minister and a new economy minister is an attempt by President Vladimir Putin to secure his economic legacy  say two sources close to the government  but it also carries risks 
The reshuffle  which remodeled the government s economic decision making bloc  is fuelling concerns about higher state spending and inflation risks  though analysts say they expect Russia s robust fiscal framework to survive 
Putin approved the new government on Tuesday and described it as a break with the past 
The sources said Putin hopes the reshuffle will help accelerate implementation of a vast state spending plan seen as the centerpiece of what may be his final presidential term 
The plan envisages breathing new life into Russia s stagnant economy by spending more than 25 trillion rubles   404 billion  between now and 2024 on major projects in 13 areas  including health  education and infrastructure 
In the reshuffle  Andrei Belousov  Putin s economic adviser since 2013 and a key architect of the spending plans  was appointed first deputy prime minister  replacing Finance Minister Anton Siluanov who had held that role since May 2018 
Maxim  NASDAQ MXIM  Reshetnikov  a former regional governor  was appointed Russia s new economy minister  replacing Maxim Oreshkin 
Putin  67  is due to step down as president in 2024  though many say a proposed constitutional shake up he is pushing through at the moment is designed to allow him to continue wielding influence in another role 
Dmitry Medvedev  Russia s prime minister since 2012  had been in charge of implementing the economic plan until Putin abruptly replaced him last week with former tax chief Mikhail Mishustin 
 Putin could see  Medvedev  wasn t doing anything  it was infuriating that he was just sitting and waiting for the presidency to fall to him again   said one of the sources who regularly meets Russian officials 
Medvedev served as Russia s president from 2008 to 2012 as the constitution barred Putin for a third consecutive term 
VISIBLE REBOOT
Putin had grown unhappy with Medvedev s failure to deliver at a time when falling real wages and declining government popularity risked deepening public anger  another source close to the government said 
The second source said Putin was concerned about the impact of falling living standards and a plan to hike the pension age  and wanted a visible reboot to assuage public anxiety and speed up the roll out of his national projects 
 We need to realize the national projects more actively so that people feel changes to their lives and around them soon   Mishustin  Putin s new prime minister  told his cabinet at their first meeting on Tuesday 
However  the promotion of Belousov  who has a reputation as a proponent of state capitalism  is causing concern among some investors 
His appointment  implies a shift from the economic agenda and tight fiscal policy to spending and the National Projects   Alfa Bank said in a note to clients 
Higher state spending could create inflationary risks  which will limit room for further rate cuts by the central bank while wiping out Russia s budget surplus 
In the old set up  Finance Minister Siluanov had been crucial in implementing a prudent fiscal policy  known as the budget rule  designed to shield the economy from swings in the price of oil 
But his demotion and Belousov s elevation open the door to possible change 
 The appointment of Belousov raises concerns about a softening of fiscal policy   said Kirill Tremasov  a former economy ministry official who heads research at Locko Invest firm 
However  Moody s credit rating agency said Russia would be able to cope with higher state spending  given its low public debt and the rebuilding of fiscal reserves following the implementation of its fiscal rule in 2018 and some spending under execution in recent years ",2020-01-22,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/putin-hoping-to-secure-economic-legacy-with-reshuffle-sources-2065094,2065094

181549,403065,MXIM,Let s get the party started  Super Bowl set for epic bash,news,"By Steve Keating
MIAMI  Reuters    Take one of the world s great party destinations  add a Super Bowl and throw in a milestone celebration like the National Football League s 100th anniversary and you have all the ingredients for an epic bash 
With plenty of sun  surf and sand there is never a need for an excuse to party in Miami but the Super Bowl  back in its favorite city for a record 11th time  has generated an unprecedented buzz dialing up the heat on South Beach 
From Lady Gaga to Post Malone and Black Eyed Peas to Guns N  Roses  many of music s hottest acts will be fronting parties during Super Bowl week  providing a magnet for A listers  titans of industry and the rich and famous 
 Post Malone is probably one of the top three artists in the world and then you combine that with a location on the water in Miami and that is really a special thing   John Terzian  the co owner of hospitality and lifestyle company h wood Group and Bootsy Bellows  told Reuters 
 Every year  especially when you go to a city like Miami  you have to really do something major 
 It s a big undertaking and there is a lot of competition  
 Special  is often code for expensive and the  Bootsy on the Water  Super Bowl splash on Friday will require deep pockets if you want to go full VIP  which includes the eight hour use of a 125 foot yacht with an onstage private suite for 80 guests going for  150 000 
The Kansas City Chiefs and San Francisco 49ers are the undisputed Super Bowl headliners on Sunday  but until then the another competition will be played out in posh night spots across Miami with party planners and promoters upping their games 
Miami will offer something for everyone from gospel to disco  in every price range from free to  I m going to need to win a lottery to pay for this  
 PARTY CITY 
Super Bowl Experience  an NFL style theme park  will be free for kids while a ticket to the Super Bowl Gospel Celebration can be had for a modest  38 
If you are up for the classic full monty Super Bowl experience  however  it will cost you much more and you will not lack for choice 
Like the Bootsy event  the AT T TV Super Saturday Night with Lady Gaga constructed a venue on an island  complete with hurricane certification  while Sports Illustrated has taken over the iconic Fountainbleau Hotel for what it shamelessly bills as  THE PARTY  
 It is because it is Miami  it s a party city  the weather is more conducive and people enjoy going to Miami in the winter as opposed to say Minneapolis   Roger Hyde  the senior vice president of creative services at AT T in charge of Super Bowl event planning told Reuters 
 Location is obviously the biggest thing for us  Unlike a lot of the other competitive parties around town we don t just go rent a venue we build a venue 
 There are going to be a lot of parties  there are going to be a lot of events but that just keeps us pushing harder to put on the best and biggest event we possibly can 
 It s all about what s possible  
ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE
And it seems anything is possible in Miami depending on your party taste 
Former New England Patriots fun loving tight end Rob Gronkowski is hosting the  Gronk Beach Festival  while the Maxim  NASDAQ MXIM  Big Game Experience is going with a Havana Nights theme 
 We ve been doing this for over 10 years and the last five we have great analytics and we are seeing a 600 percent increase of traffic through social and our ticket sites   Michael Heller  the founder of Talent Resources Sports   which is putting together the Sports Illustrated event  told Reuters   I ve never seen anything like this 
 What was harder this year was knowing that there s going to be so many more events to compete with  
Having spent hundreds  and in some cases thousands  of dollars on a ticket  the priority for partygoers is having a good time 
Yet the Super Bowl  one of the world s mega sporting events  also means big business with companies like Pepsi  Budweiser and AT T using the stage to activate sponsorships and push their brands 
 We ve been advertising at Super Bowl for over four decades  our first ad ran in 1975  so we ve seen the anticipation and excitement around the event grow   said Richard Oppy  Global vice president of global brands  Anheuser Busch InBev  the world s largest brewer 
 Specifically we ve seen a growing global appeal to the event which inspired our activation this year

Thank you  Kathy  Good afternoon to all our participants  We appreciate you joining us today and your interest in Maxim Integrated  Let me first summarize last quarter s results and our outlook  Our December quarter results met our expectations while also maintaining lean inventory levels  Looking forward to the March quarter  we expect a return to revenue growth for the company from the same quarter last year  driven by growth in communications and data center  industrial and automotive markets  We continue to be cautious  given the persistent macro and trade uncertainty  but demand is improving  Let me provide some color by end market  starting with automotive  In the December quarter  our automotive business was up 5  sequentially with double digit growth in our secular growth areas of BMS and driver assistance systems  Our revenue growth in our overall automotive business fared better than the growth of global car production  We see ample content growth opportunities for Maxim in ADAS applications in power management and point to point serial link data communication products  At the consumer electronics show  we held a large number of customer discussions on our BMS  driver assistance and power management solutions  our latest generation automotive serial link products  transport video  audio and data at 12 gigabits per second  In recent quarters  we grew our serial link business from Chinese OEM customers  At CES  we showcased our wireless BMS technology and new families of high voltage automotive power solutions that efficiently control and supervise the hundreds of watts of power required for advanced driver assistance systems  In the March quarter  automotive is expected to be strongly up sequentially  We also anticipate automotive revenue to be up from the same quarter last year  driven by driver assistance and infotainment content  Let me next turn to the industrial market  In the December quarter  industrial was up 7  from the prior quarter  We experienced sequential growth in factory automation and automated test equipment markets  Days of inventory in the channel remained relatively similar to the prior quarter  In the March quarter  we expect industrial to be up sequentially  Industrial is also expected to be up from the same quarter last year  driven by automated test equipment  financial terminals  and core industrial  including factory automation  Now let me next discuss communications and data center  In the December quarter  comms and data center was up 25  sequentially  We experienced a strong ramp in demand for 25G optical products for base stations and 100G optical products for data center applications  We re excited about the rapid deployment of our analog laser driver products  Hyperscale data centers and 5G base station uplinks need to move more data while staying within their already constrained power budgets  Maxim s transmitter products address both challenges within the power and cost constraints of our customers  In the March quarter  we anticipate comms and data center revenue to be strongly up from the prior quarter  In the past  our optical business has shown large demand fluctuations based on customer capex deployments  We are currently enjoying a period of strong demand  Comms and data center is expected to be strongly up from the same quarter last year in 100G optical for data center and 25G optical for 4G and 5G base station applications  Finally  let me turn to consumer  In the December quarter  consumer was down 15  sequentially with expected weakness in smartphones and seasonal declines in other customer electronics  The peak of holiday shipments for consumer electronics had occurred in the September quarter  In the March quarter  we expect consumer to be flat sequentially  Gaming growth  new flagship phones ramp and other customers are expected to be seasonally down  Consumer is expected to be down strongly from the same quarter last year  To summarize  we have built Maxim to be resilient and to position the company to outperform as conditions get better  Market demand is improving  and we expect revenue growth in the March quarter compared to the same quarter last year in communications and data center  industrial and automotive  We are executing on our strategy to grow revenue with new design wins and long lived products in automotive and industrial  Our analog business model and flexible manufacturing strategy enable consistent company profitability and stability  Now I will turn the call over to Brian Brian White    Chief Financial Officer Thanks  Tun   and thank you to everyone on the call today  Revenue for fiscal Q2 was  551 million  up 3  sequentially and  6 million higher than the midpoint of our forecast range entering the quarter  Compared to the same quarter a year ago  revenue was down 4   Our revenue mix by major markets in Q2 was approximately 30   industrial  26   automotive  24   comms and data center  and 20   consumer  Now let me turn to our distribution channel  Distribution comprised 51  of Maxim s revenue in Q2  We ended the quarter with just 49 days of channel inventory  up one day from the prior quarter and well below our long term target of 60 days  Our lean channel inventory was enabled by our tight inventory management  combined with stronger than expected resales for optical and BMS products  Turning to the P L  Maxim s gross margin  excluding special items  was 66   up 100 basis points from the prior quarter and above the midpoint of our guidance with the increase driven by favorable manufacturing efficiencies  Operating expenses  excluding special items  were  188 million  up approximately  3 million from the prior quarter  reflecting the full quarter impact of annual merit increases for employees and an increase in variable compensation due to higher profitability  Q2 GAAP operating income  excluding special items  was  176 million  Operating margin was 31 9  of revenue  up 160 basis points from the prior quarter  due to higher revenue and improved gross margin  The Q2 GAAP tax rate  excluding special items  was 13  and equal to our current outlook for the remainder of this fiscal year  GAAP earnings per share  excluding special items  was  0 56   0 03 above the midpoint of our guidance range  Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow  total cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were  1 8 billion  down  10 million from the prior quarter  Q2 inventory days ended at 109  down six days from Q1  And inventory dollars were down 5  from the prior quarter  Capital expenditures were  14 million  Trailing 12 month free cash flow  defined as cash from operations less capital expenditures  was  737 million or 34  of revenue  Free cash flow per share was  2 70  and our free cash flow yield is 4 5  at yesterday s closing stock price  For capital return  share repurchases totaled  108 million in Q2 as we bought back approximately 1 9 million shares  Dividends totaled  130 million in the quarter  Based on yesterday s closing stock price and our quarterly dividend of  0 48 per share  our dividend yield is 3 2   Total return of cash through dividends and share repurchases was 126  of free cash flow on a trailing 12 month basis  Now I ll turn to our outlook for the March quarter  Our beginning fiscal Q3 backlog was  456 million  Based on this beginning backlog and expected turns  we forecast Q3 revenue to be between  555 million and  595 million  up 4  from the prior quarter and up 6  year over year at the midpoint  Q3 gross margin  excluding special items  is forecasted at 65 5  to 67 5   up 50 basis points from the prior quarter  at the midpoint on higher revenue  Q3 operating expenses  excluding special items  are expected to be up approximately  2 million from Q2  driven by higher variable compensation on increased profitability  Fiscal Q3 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 3  of revenue  And our tax rate  excluding special items  is expected to remain at 13   For Q3 GAAP earnings per share  excluding special items  we expect the range of  0 57 to  0 65  In summary  we are pleased to see improving business trends with an outlook for continued sequential revenue growth in the March quarter  along with the return to year over year revenue growth  That growth  combined with our strong financial model  enables us to generate increasing profits  cash flows and shareholder return  With that  I will turn the call back over to Kathy Kathy Ta    Vice President  Investor Relations Thanks  Brian  That concludes our prepared remarks  and we will now open the call for questions  We would like to continue the same Q A process that we ve used in previous calls   Operator instructions  Jonathan  could we please have our first question  Questions   Answers  OperatorOur first question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank  Your question  please Ross Seymore    Deutsche Bank    Analyst Thanks for letting me ask a question  and congrats on the strong quarter and guide  Tun   I just wanted to go back to last quarter and compare it to this quarter  A quarter ago  I think stabilization was the operative phrase you used to describe the business  It seems like things have gotten better across the board given your guidance  Can you just give us an update on either geographically or by end market  Do you think it s true that demand is getting better  Or is it that 49 days of inventory in the channel  which is still very low  just starting to refill as you look into the March quarter Tunc Doluca    Chief Executive Officer Yes  So I will summarize what I said in the prepared remarks  But essentially  considering our Q3 guide  what we re seeing is a few things happening  Number one  we have some good growth  really end market demand driven growth in our automotive products and in our optical products for both data center and 5G  So that s strong demand we re seeing from our customers with nice growth  On the other hand  on the industrial side  we ve not really seen a full recovery  I d say  to like two year ago levels  But both Q2 and Q3 had some growth compared to the same period last year  so what we re seeing there is reasonable demand coming from customers  And in all of this  we ve been able to also maintain lean inventory levels in the distribution channel  So I think one of the questions that we got last quarter was the growth really coming from refilling the inventory in distribution  and that s not what we did  So essentially  it s very strong growth in some areas that I mentioned in automotive and comms data center  but we re seeing a broadening increase in demand  And geographically  I guess  geographically  maybe Brian can answer that piece Brian White    Chief Financial Officer Sure  Geographically  particularly as we look at resales through distribution  the Asia region continues to be the strongest with particular strength in China  And in terms of softer areas  Europe continues to be a little bit weak Ross Seymore    Deutsche Bank    Analyst Thank you OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JP Morgan  Your question  please Harlan Sur    J P  Morgan    Analyst Good afternoon  Solid execution on the quarter  guys  and good to see the return of year over year growth this quarter  It s a little bit hard to calculate exactly because of the revenue segmentation change in fiscal  19  but it looks like your auto business had another year of outperformance  I think it was flat to maybe slightly up in calendar year  19 versus auto production that was down about 5  to 7   This year  the outlook is for flattish auto production growth  And within that  I think China EV production is targeted to grow about 8   So given your exposure to some of the faster growing segments  like EV and ADAS with some of your serial link and BMS products  do you think that this segment can approach kind of low teens percentage year over year growth as the year unfolds Tunc Doluca    Chief Executive Officer OK  So let me take that one  So essentially  with what you summarized there well with our exposure to EVs  which is a faster growing segment  estimated to grow about 20  per year and our good market position with our BMS products  And also  in ADAS  we have a lot of design wins we ve had in the past few years  and those are ramping into production  So those two segments  we believe  were going to grow at much better rates than our average  Infotainment is more tied to growth in the car units  but that s doing pretty well  too  recently  so it s really hard to exactly predict  But I think we continue to believe that we can grow faster than car production units globally  a  because content s growth is faster than car production units  and b  because we ve invested and have great products and technology for two of those segments that are in kind of  I would call it  in hyper growth globally  So  yes  we will grow  You stated a number  I m a little reluctant to give a number  But we believe  for this year for the long term  we do expect automotive to grow in the low teens Harlan Sur    J P  Morgan    Analyst OK  Thanks  Tunc Tunc Doluca    Chief Executive Officer OK  Thank you  Harlan OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from the line Ambrish Srivastava from BMO  Your question  please Jamison Crone    BMO Capital Markets    Analyst Hi  guys  Thanks for the question  This is Jamison calling in for Ambrish  So I was hoping just to continue touching on auto  So while I appreciate the fact that you outgrew auto SAAR  and I believe you said that auto grew 5  sequentially  I believe last quarter  you had guided it to be up strongly  So first  was this below your previous expectations  And second  can you talk about the broader auto demand environment  And what gives you confidence in the guide for the end market to be up strongly in the March quarter Tunc Doluca    Chief Executive Officer Yes  So I m going to do a little bit from memory  and I think Kathy can help me here  We did guide to strong growth  I think we were maybe a little bit under that but not a large number  So I think that we came pretty close  maybe slightly lower in the previous quarter  This quarter  we know we are seeing very strong demand  especially for our products that go into ADAS system  So that s the strong growth driver for us  and we ve got some good design wins in China OEMs  which I mentioned in the call  So there are some specific areas in automotive that are doing really well for us  And as we had spoken last time  some of the slowing growth we saw in automotive  we ve attributed to maybe inventory digestion as car production slowed last year  So the fact that we re also believing that we re seeing that infotainment will be another growth  so seems like that is maybe confirming that maybe some of that inventory is now being digested by car manufacturers  So we re feeling pretty good about the demand we re seeing in automotive for this quarter Jamison Crone    BMO Capital Markets    Analyst Thank you Tunc Doluca    Chief Executive Officer You re welcome  Thank you  Jamison OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America  Your question  please Blake Friedman    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    Analyst Hi  This is Blake Friedman on for Vivek Arya  I was just curious how we should think about the virus impact in China s growth in Q1  And if there is any impact  which end markets  specifically  you see that having more of an impact versus others Tunc Doluca    Chief Executive Officer Yes  So obviously  this development about restrictions in travel and so on have occurred pretty recently  So to get a full assessment on which market it will affect having a comprehensive view on that  it s pretty short  frankly  to figure that out  In the areas that are affected  there are some of our optical module makers in that region  and they have communicated that they will shut down a bit longer than the normal Lunar year shutdown  so there will be some effects on that  We don t believe it s going to be a large effect on us  but that s the only customer information that we have some specifics on so far  We don t believe that s going to have an impact on our total revenue for the quarter Blake Friedman    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    Analyst Got it  Thank you Tunc Doluca    Chief Executive Officer Thank you  Blake OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse  Your question  please John Pitzer    Credit Suisse    Analyst Yes  Good afternoon  guys  and congratulations on the solid results  Tun   I m just kind of curious about the backlog coverage you re bringing into the March quarter  It s at the midpoint of your revenue guide  about 79   which is as high as I think I d seen it  So help me understand  Other than trying to take a conservative stance because there is still some macro uncertainty out there  is there anything specifically that s driving the backlog coverage to be this high versus what s usually kind of in the low 70s as business mix into end markets that are more backlog oriented than turns  Or just help me understand why turns couldn t be better in the quarter Brian White    Chief Financial Officer John  this is Brian  That s a great observation  And as Tun  mentioned  we ve had very strong demand for our optical products  And so what you re seeing is the effect of the higher than usual amount of optical orders in our backlog that we don t expect to ship all of which this quarter John Pitzer    Credit Suisse    Analyst Thank you Brian White    Chief Financial Officer Thank you  John OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley  Your question  please Craig Hettenbach    Morgan Stanley    Analyst Yes  Thank you  Tun   just a follow up on your comments about wireless BMS at CES  Can you just talk about kind of the developments there and just gauge the time line in terms of product introductions  And then what period of time could you see those products eventually come to the market Tunc Doluca    Chief Executive Officer Yes  So wireless BMS is a technology that we have been working on  Essentially  what we developed in a nutshell was a way to be able to connect all of our individual  essentially metrology chips that are on the packs to talk to a central control unit through wireless technology  We demonstrated that it can be done  Obviously  we need to do more work to make sure that it is as robust as wired technology  And as you predicted  that s going to take a little bit more time  It s hard for us to really tell exactly when it will gain enough customer acceptance in terms of how robust it is as a complete system  But revenues from this will not are not on the horizon for multiple years  so it s really just a technology that we re showing  but we have to productize it in a way that s equivalent to our ASIL D solutions that we have in our wired products right now  So revenue wise  multiple years in the future Craig Hettenbach    Morgan Stanley    Analyst Thanks Tunc Doluca    Chief Executive Officer Thank you OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from the line of C J  Muse from Evercore  Your question  please Matt Prisco    Evercore ISI    Analyst Hey  guys  This is Matt Prisco on for C J  I just wanted to dig a little more into the comms and data center side of the business  stronger than expected this quarter  great guide next quarter  So can you just kind of dig into a little bit more what s driving that uptick across both 25 gig and 100 gig  And how sustainable are those trends as we kind of think through all of calendar  20 Tunc Doluca    Chief Executive Officer Yes  So there are really two components to the strong growth in comms and data center  One of them is in data center where we re selling products that are 100G or 4x25G lanes  We have a strong presence and good design wins on the laser driver portion for which we basically have an analog solution  And that  if you recall  we had strong growth in that about a couple of years ago  And then there was a lot of inventory built at our customers  And the module makers took us a while to drain that down  and now it s back for the last two quarters  So that s the story there  I think we re getting to a healthy level of consumption on those products as the cloud customers essentially are deploying more data transport capability in their data centers  So that s what s driving that  so it s really a recovery from an inventory correction last year  On the 25G front  it s one lane x 25 transceiver IC  plus some transimpedance amplifier products and like a system management chip for a module  so it s kind of a set of products that we sell into that  And that solution is very popular for 5G and  I guess  4G installations that are trying to be made 5G ready for base stations and that we re seeing a strong growth  especially now coming from China  because we have  again  a popular solution that everybody liked  And these designs were won probably about a couple of years ago  So that s what s ramping  As long as the 4G  5G rollout continues  I think we re going to continue to sell these products because of our strong market position  But as I said in my prepared remarks  both of these businesses and especially the 25G connections  this business is kind of lumpy  And right now  we re enjoying a good spot  But those of you that have followed these markets  always remember in the past that there are times when there s some inventory digestion that happens and so on  But I think right now  fundamentally  long term  even if we get this lumpiness  I think  these are good growth markets because of the amount of data that s being moved  both in data centers and in wireless  Thank you  Matt OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from the line of Mitch Steves from RBC Capital Markets  Your question  please Mitch Steves    RBC Capital Markets    Analyst I actually wanted to focus a bit on the consumer side  It looks like that s seeing a lot more pressure than we thought  at least near term  Can you walk through what you guys expect for maybe the full year out of that business in terms of like the calendar year  if it is this like company specific  Or do you think this is like an industrywide issue that we ll see  particularly since Apple s reported numbers are pretty solid in the quarter Tunc Doluca    Chief Executive Officer Yes  So just to remind everybody  I mean  our consumer business  if you walk back a few years ago  was pretty concentrated on one our largest customer  Our strategy has been for multiple years to diversify the business to go into multiple other customers  as well as other markets  even if same customers  And we ve been executing on that plan  If you look at our guidance into the current quarter  basically  our large customer is ramping a new flagship phone  We ve got good demand for our gaming products  but many of the other products really go into a seasonally weak period after the holiday season  So we re seeing that  Our seasonality is definitely changing  and maybe it s already changed to be more heavier in Q1 than it used to be basically in our Q2    in our Q3  sorry  So it s going to be heavier in the Q1 of the next fiscal year  Now your question is are we seeing something that s particular to Maxim  Yes  Our content has gone down at our largest customer  so you are seeing the effects of that  But we are seeing good demand from other customers  but it takes a while for this all to balance out Mitch Steves    RBC Capital Markets    Analyst Thank you Tunc Doluca    Chief Executive Officer Welcome  Thank you  Mitch OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis from Barclays  Your question  please Tom O Malley    Barclays    Analyst Hey  guys  This is Tom O Malley on for Blayne Curtis  Congratulations on the nice results  Looking at market share  you guys have obviously come from levels with some weaker trends  and you re seeing above average growth in terms of seasonality  Can you remind us what normal seasonality for June is  I know you just finished talking about how consumer is a little bit different than historically  but what s the right way to think about the entire business into the fourth fiscal quarter  And do you think just coming from a lower base  that you can outgrow that Tunc Doluca    Chief Executive Officer Yes  I assume you asked about the March quarter  not June seasonality growth Tom O Malley    Barclays    Analyst March seasonality and for the rest of the fiscal year  if that s OK Tunc Doluca    Chief Executive Officer OK  So I don t have the seasonality numbers in front of me  but I m sure Kathy is going to help me out here Kathy Ta    Vice President  Investor Relations OK  So  Tom  this is Kathy  So of course  we re only guiding one quarter at a time  but we do usually see that the first half of any given calendar year is better for industrial and automotive  And historically  as Tun  outlined in his last question and answer  we had historically benefited from a ramp in smartphone revenue in June quarter  but that s changed now because of the lower content that we have with that customer  So Samsung is a much smaller part of our revenue  and so we should not expect that to recur this year in our June quarter  And then finally  for comms and data center  given the lumpiness of optical  it s hard to predict  and there s not really a seasonality that we can point to there OperatorThank you   Operator instructions  Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Kwan from Stifel  Nicolaus  Your question  please Jeremy Kwan    Stifel Financial Corp     Analyst Yes  And let me add my congratulations on a solid quarter  I had a question on the automotive side  You mentioned battery management  ADAS  Those are growing very nicely as they are your key drivers in that segment  Can you give us a sense of how big that is relative to your    maybe the legacy or the larger auto business Tunc Doluca    Chief Executive Officer Yes  So let s see if we took Q3 as an example  Roughly half the business  half of automotive is infotainment  And if you look at BMS and ADAS  they re probably in the range of the mid teens of automotive each  So that s kind of gives you an idea  I mean  these numbers vary because the mix changes quarter over quarter  So half infotainment  mid teens for BMS and probably around mid teens for ADAS  roughly  Did that answer your question Jeremy Kwan    Stifel Financial Corp     Analyst Yes  That s very helpful  And where do you see that going in the next three to five years  that proportion Tunc Doluca    Chief Executive Officer Yes  It s hard for us to predict that  but higher would be the obvious answer  I mean  they re clearly growing  if you look at some of the numbers we quoted  double digits and so on  And clearly  they will grow pretty quickly  Just to give you an example  similar calls a year or two ago  we would use to say infotainment was 60  to 70  of the business  so the rest of it has grown pretty nicely Jeremy Kwan    Stifel Financial Corp     Analyst Great  Thank you Tunc Doluca    Chief Executive Officer Thank you  Jeremy OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg from Stifel  Your question  please Tore Svanberg    Stifel Financial Corp     Analyst Yes  hi  and congratulations on the quarter  I m not sure if this question has been asked  if you ve addressed this  but Intel on their call talked a lot about very strong data center dynamics over the first half  but then they re kind of expecting a slowdown second half  I know it s very early on  and I don t even know if you have the visibility  but do you have any thoughts on that particular topic Tunc Doluca    Chief Executive Officer I mean  honestly  Tore  I mean  if we re    I don t think we re going to add anything to what Intel knows  They know their customers better than we do  And remember that we re one or two farther away from them because we re selling to mostly our data center customers who are module makers that are selling to cloud customers  And I don t think we can say anything that either confirms or denies with Intel would say  My recommendation would be to go with whatever they re projecting  Sorry  I couldn t help you on that one Tore Svanberg    Stifel Financial Corp     Analyst No  that s fair  Tun   My follow up is on the channel inventory  So it s obviously below your target  and I m just wondering what the dynamics are there  Is it mainly because of shortages  Or is it just customers kind of being gun shy about visibility  Just trying to understand why it s running still quite a bit below your long term target Tunc Doluca    Chief Executive Officer I want to make sure I understand the question  Your question was about China inventory Tore Svanberg    Stifel Financial Corp     Analyst No  channel inventory  channel  not China Tunc Doluca    Chief Executive Officer Channel  channel inventory  Well  I mean  essentially  channel inventory  as you know  it s running below our model  Our desire is to bring it back up to what our model levels are  and we actually said that in the last call  But we saw    as you stated  we saw a stronger demand for the optical products especially  and that caused us not to be able to completely catch up to what we wanted  Our read is that the end demand for these parts are pretty strong  so they re basically being consumed pretty soon after we ship them  And there s not too much inventory because of strong demand more than anything Kathy Ta    Vice President  Investor Relations Can I just add to that  Tore  Sorry  I d just add to that  Tore  This is Kathy  So we also highlighted last quarter that we re starting to ship serial link products to Chinese OEMs in automotive  and that goes to JASTI  We saw strong resales of those products as well  so there are some Maxim specific products that are doing quite well in the resales to China JASTI Tore Svanberg    Stifel Financial Corp     Analyst That s very helpful  Thank you very much Tunc Doluca    Chief Executive Officer Thanks  Tore OperatorThank you  This does conclude the question and answer session  I d like to hand the program back to Kathy for any further remarks Kathy Ta    Vice President  Investor Relations OK  Thank you  Jonathan  That concludes today s conference call  Thank you for your participation and for

181551,403067,MXIM,Headaches but no hangovers as Miami gears up for Super Bowl,news,"By Steve Keating
MIAMI  Reuters    After a night of living up to its party reputation Miami was looking for more on Sunday as the final countdown to the Super Bowl between the Kansas City Chief and San Francisco 49ers began under a blanket of security and protests 
More than eight hours before 1830 ET kickoff  fans  some who had paid over  5 000 for a ticket  made their way through miles of bumper to bumper traffic  protests by local residents and airport type security before settling into their seats at Hard Rock Stadium 
 We just bought our tickets this morning and came   said Shon Yust  a lifelong Chiefs fan from Kansas City not saying what he paid   The prices were slightly lower but not substantially 
 I m 51  going to be 52  the last time they were in the Super Bowl  I was two  So  we re like   We better go   
The sky high prices and challenges have done little to spoil the party as the NFL returned to its favorite Super Bowl city for a record 11th time 
Chiefs and Niners supporters decked out in team jerseys along with A listers and celebrities warmed up for America s biggest sporting event  which will be watched by a global television audience  by turning South Beach into one big party on Saturday night 
From the Sports Illustrated bash at the iconic Fountainbleau Hotel to Budweiser s BUDX Hotel event at the other end of Collins Ave   South Beach was turned into one big blowout 
Away from the downtown core Maxim  NASDAQ MXIM  and Lady Gaga anchored the party scene as celebrations raged into the small hours of the morning 
More than 400 private jets  twice the usual number for a weekend  were reported to have clogged up local airports depositing their cargo of high rollers 
Included among those was Air Force One with President Donald Trump spending the weekend at his nearby Mar a Lago golf club 
Not everyone was excited about the Super Bowl being back in Miami 
Residents of Miami Gardens  the mostly black  working class area surrounding the stadium  have long felt neglected and even exploited by the Miami Dolphins organization and expressed their unhappiness with about 100 people staging a protest 
They say their quality of life has suffered from the region s eternal quest for tourism dollars  and fear the area s black community faces a new chapter in a history of displacement 
Instead of joining millions of Americans celebrating this weekend s game  protesters took to the streets outside the venue on Sunday to express their frustration ",2020-02-02,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/headaches-but-no-hangovers-as-miami-gears-up-for-super-bowl-2073978,2073978

 Reuters    Adamis Pharmaceuticals Corp  O ADMP  said on Monday the U S  Food and Drug Administration declined to approve its opioid overdose treatment  Zimhi  sending its shares plunging 56  
In a so called complete response letter  CRL   the FDA questioned the treatment s chemistry  manufacturing and controls process  but not its safety or effectiveness  the company said 
The drug is a naloxone pre filled single dose syringe used for emergency treatment of known or suspected opioid overdose  and investors hoped the treatment would help the San Diego based company reduce its reliance on its emergency allergy shot  Symjepi 
Adamis Pharmaceuticals had revenue of about  5 9 million in the third quarter  a 54  jump from a year earlier on Symjepi demand 
Maxim  NASDAQ MXIM  Group analyst Jason McCarthy in a note  ahead of FDA s decision  estimated Zimhi to bring in peak sales of  70 8 mln in 2028 
 We believe the comments and recommendations stated in the CRL are manageable and plan to fully cooperate with the FDA   Adamis Chief Executive Dennis Carlo said in a statement 
The company said it will request a meeting with the FDA  as soon as reasonably possible  and plans to resubmit its application for approval 
Adamis is seeking to use Zimhi  which delivers high doses of naloxone  as part of the fight against the opioid crisis in the United States 
Opioids were involved in nearly 400 000 overdose deaths in the United States from 1999 to 2017  according to the U S  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
The U S  Department of Health and Human Services last December had recommended prescribing or co prescribing naloxone to high risk patients for opioid overdose

181578,403094,MXIM,Russia  Belarus closer to resolving oil  gas issues  says Moscow,news,"MOSCOW  Reuters    Russia and Belarus have come closer to resolving their differences on oil and gas supplies  Russia s economy minister said on Saturday after talks between the two countries 
Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Belarusian counterpart Alexander Lukashenko were holding talks on Saturday on an integration road map in the southern Russian city of Sochi 
A lack of detail on what such a pact might include has fueled fears that Moscow aims to gain new influence in ex Soviet Belarus as part of a plan to absorb it 
 A lot of progress has been made  even on oil and gas  The positions have come significantly closer   Russian Economy Minister Maxim  NASDAQ MXIM  Oreshkin said  without providing any detail 
Oreshkin added that the two presidents would meet again in St  Petersburg on Dec  20 
Lukashenko  who did not address the press after the talks  last month threatened not to sign an integration deal with Russia if it failed to resolve  oil and gas issues  
Russia has provided energy subsidies to Belarus in the form of cheap oil and gas and low cost loans to keep Minsk in its political orbit  but now plans to phase these out to lessen the burden on its economy 
Belarus has said that it stands to lose hundreds of millions of dollars a year from changes to Russian tax policy and has tried to negotiate compensation  Russia says the subsidies cost its exchequer billions of dollars 
Lukashenko this week said the countries had yet to reach an agreement over compensation in a dispute over tainted Russian oil that was pumped through the Druzhba pipeline 
He said the financial losses sustained by Belarus over the contamination of oil in the Druzhba pipeline amounted to hundreds of millions of dollars 
The Belarusian leader  who has been in power since 1994  has dismissed opposition fears that a possible integration pact with Russia could end with his country losing its independence to Moscow 
He has said the two countries are not discussing deeper political ties

Last week  Nginx s offices in Moscow were searched following a complaint by Lynwood Investments  a company acting on behalf of Rambler 
Rambler said that it owned the rights to Nginx  as the service was developed by two employees of the firm at the time  Igor Sysoev and Maxim  NASDAQ MXIM  Konovalov 
Sysoev has previously been cited in Russian media reports as saying that his development of Nginx was never part of his responsibilities as a Rambler employee 
Russian state lender Sberbank  which owns 46 5  of Rambler  criticized Rambler for its pursuit of Nginx and called an extraordinary meeting of Rambler s board of directors on Monday 
The board said in a statement after the meeting that it had asked Rambler s management team to request Russian law enforcement agencies cease pursuit of the criminal case  and begin talks with Nginx and with F5  a U S  firm that bought Nginx in March for  670 million 
 We will do our utmost to ensure that this situation is resolved through negotiations  with the involvements of all parties   the statement quoted Rambler board chairman and Sberbank first deputy chief executive Lev Khasis as saying 
The Nginx matter follows a case against U S  investor Michael Calvey and his private equity group Baring Vostok  Calvey and some other group s executives were detained in February on embezzlement charges

181602,403118,MXIM,Relentless rise of consumer debt in Russia fuels bubble fears for some,news,"By Darya Korsunskaya  Elena Fabrichnaya and Tatiana Voronova
MOSCOW  Reuters    Natalia Leontyeva  a Siberian sales manager  bought a second hand car in 2013 with a loan worth about four monthly salaries  She now owes the equivalent of at least four years of earnings  one of a growing number of Russians struggling with debt 
 You pay one month s instalment  then the second  But then something happens again and it all piles up   she said by phone from the city of Novosibirsk in Siberia where she works at a steelworks 
After five years of shrinking real incomes  many Russians are borrowing to make ends meet or even just to pay off their creditors   and the issue is climbing up the political agenda 
 A third of those people taking loans already owe more than their annual income   Maxim  NASDAQ MXIM  Oreshkin  Russia s economy minister  told Reuters   This is an issue of financial education  a debt trap  in some cases worse than gambling  
For Russia as a whole  the burden of total household debt is relatively low  partly because only 5 5 million of its 147 million people have mortgages 
But interest rates on personal loans are high and more than half of Russians surveyed by state pollster VTsIOM said they had debts  For a significant number  they are a major concern 
Some 2 5 million people earning up to 20 000 roubles   303 09  a month  which is less than half the average wage  spend more than half of that on loan repayments  the National Association of Professional Collection Agencies estimates 
On Wednesday  President Vladimir Putin discussed consumer debt with Andrey Kostin  head of second biggest state run bank VTB  MM VTBR   telling him in televised comments   people should not be pushed to some kind of extreme state  
Kostin told Putin he understood the problem and that banks should wear a  human face  when dealing with its clients 
Their exchange highlighted the sensitivity of the problem for Putin  whose popularity ratings have slipped since he was reelected by an overwhelming majority last year 
Moscow is in the grip of protests over the exclusion of opposition candidates from a local election and sporadic protests over issues ranging from waste disposal to unwanted construction have flared elsewhere 
TIGHTENING
The central bank has tightened lending rules in recent years  and raised the amount of money banks need to set aside to cover loan losses 
This has moderated the potential fallout for the financial system but Oreshkin said borrowers are still exposed 
 In consumer lending  there is high indebtedness and     it is growing at a rate far higher than the nominal increases in incomes   he said 
Outstanding loans were 16 3 trillion roubles   248 billion  as of early July  up from 10 6 trillion five years ago  according to central bank data 
And while the rate of consumer lending increase has dropped from a 60  year on year peak in 2012  it was still over 20  last year despite the central bank s attempts to rein it in 
Consumer lending growth rate has currently stabilized at 24 25  in annual terms  the central bank said in a response to a request to comment from Reuters 
 A fast increase in    outstanding consumer debt is leading to a rising debt burden for households   it said   This increases vulnerability of the financial system but the size of this lending segment does not pose    a threat  either for the banking sector s stability  or for the economy  
Olga Ulyanova  an analyst with Moody s rating agency in Moscow  praised the central bank s measures but said more actions might be needed including a possible ban on lending to highly indebted borrowers 
 The central bank s measures are timely and preemptive   she said   But it will have to continue the policy of tightening as the current measures are not sufficient to normalize the segment s growth rate  
The central bank said in its response that it will raise risk requirements again for consumer loans in October  under which banks will have to evaluate a borrower s existing debt before issuing a new loan 
Oreshkin has also said there was no risk for the financial system s stability as banks have enough provisions while adding  in comments to Russian media last month  that there was a bubble in consumer lending when it came to certain households 
The economy ministry is working on proposals to simplify the process of individuals declaring themselves bankrupt and on changing the criteria for people to claim insolvency based on income left over after loan repayments  he told Reuters 
 POINT OF NO RETURN 
Russia s household debt to gross domestic product ratio is 14   compared with around 30  in Czech Republic and Poland and 75  in Sweden  Moody s said 
Non performing loans  or outstanding debt by individuals that is not being serviced for more than 90 days  stood at 797 billion roubles  or 5  of the total retail loans held by banks  as of July 1  according to the central bank  These loans are provisioned by over 90   it said 
But almost one in five new loans are being spent on servicing existing debt and more than 30  of consumer loans issued in January March 2019 went to people already spending more than half their income on debt servicing  Moody s said  citing central bank data 
This means the lending is not fully filtering into growth in the economy  which is projected to grow at 1 1 5  this year versus 2 3  last year  under pressure from drop in oil prices and sanctions since 2014 over Russia s annexation of Crimea 
One high ranking government financial official who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue said that when it came to those already spending large sums in debt servicing   the point of no return has been passed already  
 The most dreadful thing is not that banks or the central bank do not realize there is an issue  but that people with salaries of 30 40 000 roubles have to spend 20 000 on servicing their debt   the official said 
The number of bankruptcies has grown from up to 20 000 in 2016  the year after a new private bankruptcy law came in  to almost 44 000 in 2018  It grew by around 29 000 in the first six months of this year  a 52  rise year on year  according to Russian official registry Fedresurs 
Consumer lending accounts for over a tenth of total loans at Russia s top banks  state owned Sberbank  MM SBER  and VTB  MM VTBR   while for private TCS Group  L TCSq  consumer lending forms its core business 
Mikhail Matovnikov  chief analyst with Sberbank  said that consumer lending growth is already slowing down and does not pose systemic risks 
VTB said that consumer loans are one of the most profitable businesses for the bank  But it said that VTB has a high quality consumer loan portfolio so there is no rise in non performing loans in this area 
 Our bank has had risk processes for a long time already which do not allow loans to highly indebted borrowers   VTB said in a written reply to Reuters  TCS did not reply to a request for a comment ",2019-08-15,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/relentless-rise-of-consumer-debt-in-russia-fuels-bubble-fears-for-some-1955880,1955880

 Reuters    Russian chess grandmaster Anatoly Karpov has been unable for several months to obtain a visa to travel to the United States  his friend  the owner of a chess academy in New York who invited him to teach a summer camp there  said on Wednesday 
Karpov  68  considered one of the greatest chess players of the modern era  has visited the United States regularly since 1972  He first applied for the non immigrant visa in March and is still waiting for it to be approved  said Maxim  NASDAQ MXIM  Dlugy of the Chess Max Academy 
 He was suddenly called in for an interview in the Moscow embassy and asked   Are you going to talk to U S  Senators and Congressmen  We ll have to check that out    Dlugy told Reuters 
Staff members of U S  Representative Carolyn Maloney and U S  Senator Chuck Schumer both contacted the U S  Embassy in Moscow on Karpov s behalf and were told that his application was still being processed 
 This processing cannot be waived or expedited as it is crucial for the final decision regarding the issuance of a visa   the embassy s public liaison unit said in a July 2 letter to Maloney s office 
 Mr  Karpov will be notified as soon as this process is complete  Be assured that as of today  no further documents or actions are needed from Mr  Karpov   the embassy said 
A spokesman for the U S  Department of State  Noel Clay  told Reuters in an email on Wednesday that he could not answer questions about the status of Karpov s visa application because such records were kept confidential under federal law 
Karpov  who was the official world champion from 1975 to 1985 when he was defeated by Garry Kasparov  was believed to be in Moscow on Wednesday evening but could not be reached for comment by Reuters 
Dlugy said Karpov has been helping train top young U S  chess players at the Chess Max Academy for the past two years and has had no difficulty securing a visa during his long career 
 I sincerely hope for the betterment of relations between Russia and the United States that a gracious welcome is extended rather than the cold shoulder of delay   Dlugy said in a letter to Schumer

181605,403121,MXIM,Russia s Putin calls for rise in incomes  stronger economic growth,news,"MOSCOW  Reuters    President Vladimir Putin on Monday described Russia s economic growth as insufficient  telling the head of the central bank and top government officials to come up with ways to boost real incomes growth 
The issue of real disposable incomes has recently been one of the most socially sensitive in Russia where economic growth has slowed from an average of about 7  a year from 2000 08  coupled with a steep drop in the rouble amid Western sanctions and lower oil prices 
Putin raised the lingering incomes issue at a meeting with Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina  Economy Minister Maxim  NASDAQ MXIM  Oreshkin  Finance Minister Anton Siluanov and Aide to the President  Andrei Belousov 
Praising a slowdown in annual inflation to 4 5  from double digit levels a few years ago  Putin  who has been in power for nearly 20 years  said that was not enough to improve the living conditions of Russian citizens 
 Even against this background  and given the increase in wages in the economy  people s real incomes are growing slowly  This state of affairs cannot but cause concern   Putin said 
Households  real disposable incomes  or the money they have after taxes and inflation are taken into account  rose 0 1  in 2018 after falling for several years in a row  In the first half of 2019  they dropped again by 1 3  compared with a year ago 
Putin  who has repeatedly ordered attempts to boost Russia s economic growth to make the country one of the world s top five economies  said gross domestic product growth of 0 7  in the first six months of 2019 was not sufficient 
 The pace is certainly positive but the overall dynamics can t be satisfactory for us  We need to make economic growth more sustainable and dynamic   Putin said 
Putin s comments came less than two weeks before the central bank s board meeting where analysts expect it to cut the key rate  lowering the cost of borrowing amid sluggish economic growth and slowing inflation

Consumer price growth in Russia is set to slow well below the 4  target as retail demand stalls  according to an Economy Ministry report released Monday  The ministry sees inflation sliding to 3  at the end of next year  down from the previously projected 3 8   as weak consumer demand weighs on economic growth in 2020  which will slow to 1 7  from 2  forecast in April  it said 
The grim prognosis comes ahead of the central bank s Sept  6 rates meeting  with all eyes on the regulator to see if the easing cycle continues after two succcessive cuts brought the key interest rate down to 7 25   The economy of the world s largest energy exporter could use the help  Consumer demand is weak after five years of stagnating incomes and the Economy Ministry expects investment  led by President Vladimir Putin s  400 billion spending plan on Russia s National Projects to 2024  to replace it as the main growth driver 
Economy Minister Maxim  NASDAQ MXIM  Oreshkin warned in a national radio interview last month that  the economy will definitely fall into recession  if a surge in consumer lending continues unchecked until the bubble bursts on its own   Our estimate is that 2021 is the year when it blows up   he said on Ekho Moskvy radio 
His comments opened a public breach with the central bank  which has dismissed his warnings as unfounded and brushed off his calls for it to move more decisively to curb lending  It argues the main obstacle to faster growth is slow progress on reforms to improve the investment environment    the responsibility of Oreshkin and his government colleagues 
Economy Decelerated
Russia s economy decelerated sharply this year  expanding 0 7  in the first six months after 2 3  growth in 2018  Shrinking of nominal budget spending in the second quarter dragged on investment  but a spike later in the year will help growth  the central bank said in a report earlier Monday 
Growth numbers this year don t bode well for Putin s ambitions  His goal of turning Russia into a leading economy while providing consistent growth in living standards has failed to materialize so far  The current trend seen in the first half of the year isn t satisfactory  he told officials at a meeting earlier Monday

The benchmark rate was cut to 7  from 7 25   according to a statement published on Friday  The move to the lowest level since March 2014 was forecast by 33 economists out of 35 in a Bloomberg survey  with one analyst forecasting a bigger cut and one expecting no change 
 If the situation develops in line with the baseline forecast  the Bank of Russia will consider the necessity of a further key rate reduction at one of the upcoming board of directors  meetings   the central bank said in a statement 
Bank of Russia Governor Elvira Nabiullina will hold a news conference at 3pm in Moscow 
The central bank renewed its easing cycle in June after a couple of rate hikes last year to stem risks to inflation from a tax rise  Some economists had suggested recent ruble weakness and proposals for an increase in spending may limit easing going forward

181609,403125,MXIM,Russian celebrities demand release of actor jailed over protest,news,"By Tom Balmforth
MOSCOW  Reuters    Many Russian celebrities took to social media on Tuesday to condemn what they said was the brazenly unjust jailing of a novice actor over an opposition protest and demanded that the authorities release him from prison 
Pavel Ustinov  23  was sentenced on Monday to three and a half years in jail for dislocating a police officer s shoulder when he was arrested during an Aug  3 rally in Moscow  He denied the charges and said he had not even taken part in the protest 
The Kremlin s critics have pointed to the conviction and others like it as examples of how the authorities have handed out harsh sentences to scare off would be sympathizers from joining the biggest protest movement in the capital for years 
The authorities deny that and say many of this summer s opposition protests were illegal because they were not formally authorized and that people were prosecuted for breaking the law 
Ustinov s cause was taken up by celebrities such as TV star Maxim  NASDAQ MXIM  Galkin and popular singer Sergey Lazarev who shared their anger with millions of followers on Instagram 
 This is simply a monstrous sentence for a young man who wasn t doing anything  He was just standing by the metro waiting for his friend     Lazarev wrote to his 4 2 million followers 
 The  police  hurled themselves at one guy in such an inept group that it s a wonder they didn t break anything else of one another   Galkin told his 6 4 million followers 
The opposition regularly confronts the authorities over what it considers abuses by the authorities  but it is unusual for those causes to be taken up by celebrities with mass appeal 
 You can clearly see in the video of his arrest that he didn t resist the    police   actor Alexander Pal said on Instagram   This is an entirely fabricated case  
 The monstrous injustice and cynicism that this is done with could concern anyone   actor Danila Kozlovsky wrote 
The Kremlin s spokesman said it would be inappropriate for him to comment on a court ruling  but that Ustinov could appeal if he chose to do so 
Some Moscow theaters issued calls for him to be freed following performances on Monday evening  Ustinov studied acting and has played minor roles in films 
 We re convinced of his innocence  Let s not be dead souls  let s not be silent about this  let s talk about this  Let s support Pavel Ustinov   a theater worker told the audience after a performance at the Na Strastnom theater in Moscow 
Police arrested more than two thousand people at protests over the summer that flared after more than a dozen opposition candidates were barred from taking part in a local election in Moscow that was held this month 
Several were given jail terms of up to three and a half years for assaulting police officers  convictions the opposition says are part of a broader crackdown aimed at stymying its activities ",2019-09-17,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/russian-celebrities-demand-release-of-actor-jailed-over-protest-1979697,1979697
181611,403127,MXIM,Russian minister to Putin  We must restore trust in courts  police,news,"MOSCOW  Reuters    Economy Minister Maxim  NASDAQ MXIM  Oreshkin told President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday that Russia must restore trust in its courts and law enforcement agencies if the government is to have a chance of fulfilling the Kremlin s ambitious economic plans 
The unusually direct comments to Putin were broadcast on state television and come as the government is searching for ways to kick start a stagnant economy that is on course to grow just 1  this year 
After his re election by a landslide last year  Putin set sweeping political and economic goals for his government  among them making Russia a top five global economy by the end of his current term in 2024 
The economy has weathered an array of shocks over the last five years ranging from Western sanctions to volatile prices for oil  one of its main sources of revenue  But although it is currently stable  a pickup in economic growth has remained elusive 
The Kremlin s critics say economic growth is hamstrung by the investment climate and point to the arrest this year of several executives at prominent private equity group Baring Vostok  including U S  investor Michael Calvey 
The embezzlement case against Baring Vostok rattled Russia s business community and prompted several prominent officials and businessmen to voice concerns about the treatment of the executives 
In an apparent nod to such concerns  Oreshkin told Putin at a meeting with officials that it was  very important  to  restore the faith of entrepreneurs in law enforcement and the courts  
 Without changing the trend now it will be very difficult to achieve a positive result in investment activity overall   he said ",2019-09-25,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/russian-minister-to-putin-we-must-restore-trust-in-courts-police-1986044,1986044

181632,403148,MXIM,Russia Minister Sees Economic  Blow Up  Unless Central Bank Acts,news," Bloomberg     With President Vladimir Putin regularly promising higher living standards  economy ministers in Russia tend to focus on upbeat news in their public statements  So it was something of a shock when Maxim  NASDAQ MXIM  Oreshkin warned of a looming credit crisis in a national radio interview 
 The economy will definitely fall into recession  if the consumer lending surge continues unchecked until the bubble bursts on its own  Oreshkin said in a prime time interview on the Ekho Moskvy radio station on July 21   Our estimate is that 2021 is the year when it blows up  
The appearance was only the latest in an intensifying campaign the former investment bank economist has been waging to sound the alarm about what he says is a potentially mortal threat to Putin s hopes of speeding up economic growth 
Along the way  he s opened a public breach with the central bank  which has dismissed his warnings as unfounded and brushed off his calls for it to move more decisive to to curb lending  It argues the main obstacle to faster growth is slow progress on reforms to improve the investment environment    the responsibility of Oreshkin and his government colleagues 
Behind the unusually open bureaucratic battle is deepening alarm in the Russian leadership about the weak economic performance as five straight years of stagnation and falling living standards have driven support for Putin and the ruling party to the lowest in years  As part of his re election campaign last year  the Russian leader pledged to bring growth above 3  a year by the end of his term in 2024  That s a rate the economy hasn t seen since 2012 
A  400 billion spending plan that s supposed to help revive the economy has gotten off to a sluggish start  while the global slowdown triggered by fears of a widening trade war between the U S  and China pushed Russia s growth to 0 7  in the first half of this year  Several forecasters have trimmed their outlooks for this year and next 
 In the government  everyone is nervous about bad economic growth   said Andrei Kolesnikov  analyst at the Carnegie Moscow Center 
The Economy Ministry forecasts that the pace will pick up later this year once government funds begin flowing  accelerating to 3 1  in 2021  well ahead of the end of Putin s term  But according to Oreshkin  that will only happen if the central bank moves quickly now to control what he calls a dangerous bubble in consumer lending 
He says he s been raising the alarm internally about the issue for more than a year  but went public because the central bank s efforts to rein in the lending boom so far haven t worked  He denies any rift with the powerful monetary authority  saying he s just engaging in  public discussion  
Oreshkin marshals data showing consumer debt growing at 25     1 8 trillion rubles   28 billion  last year    with payments depressing living standards  For a third of borrowers  debt payments take up more than 60  of their monthly income  Many simply refinance existing obligations with new borrowing  delaying repayment that they ll never be able to make  Meanwhile  lending to companies is growing much more slowly  something Oreshkin argues stifles investment and growth 
The central bank says the worries about consumer lending are misplaced   There s no bubble there  we don t see one by any indicator   said Elvira Nabiullina  governor of the central bank 
In a 21 page report issued in June after an earlier salvo from the Economy Ministry  the regulator produced chart after chart showing the debt boom isn t out of control and hasn t hurt consumer incomes  In fact  according to the central bank  the borrowing has been the main factor keeping economic growth in positive territory this year 
Tightening rules for consumer lending won t boost credit for the corporate sector  according to the central bank  Companies are holding back on investment not because of the cost of capital but because of the government s failure to deliver on long planned moves to improve the business climate  which is what business surveys show is the main impediment to expansion 
 When proposing steps to increase economic growth  we first of all should remove the barriers that economic agents and we see as obstacles   Nabiullina said 
Analysts tend to side with the central bank 
 There is a problem with unsecured lending  but the central bank  with something of a delay  is dealing with it and all isn t lost yet   said Alexander Danilov  banking analyst at Fitch Ratings in Moscow 
 The danger from lending and the stimulation of economic growth are two different problems   said Alexey Vedev  a former deputy economy minister   Oreshkin is a politician and he needs to explain why the president s decree won t be fulfilled   he added  referring to Putin s 2018 order mandating growth above 3  ",2019-07-30,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/russia-minister-sees-economicblow-up-unless-central-bank-acts-1938425,1938425

181635,403151,MXIM,Russian opposition plans new protest despite over 1 000 arrests,news,"By Andrew Osborn and Maxim  NASDAQ MXIM  Rodionov
MOSCOW  Reuters    Russia s anti Kremlin opposition said it was planning a nationwide protest next weekend despite police forcibly detaining over 1 000 people on Saturday for attending what they said was an illegal march in Moscow to demand free elections 
Saturday s protest  conceived by opposition activists as a peaceful walk to protest against the exclusion of their candidates from a Moscow election next month  was systematically and sometimes violently dispersed by police 
OVD Info  an independent monitoring group  said on Sunday that police had detained 1 001 people on Saturday  up from its earlier estimate of just over 800 people  Many but not all of those detained were later released by police  but OVD Info said 19 were kept in custody overnight 
It said some of those detained had their phones confiscated and had been denied access to a lawyer  Russian investigators had initiated a criminal case against one man  accusing him of injuring a police officer  the TASS news agency reported 
Faced with a wave of summer protests  authorities have opened criminal proceedings for what they term mass civil unrest  an offence punishable with up to 15 years in jail 
Although they have rejected protesters  complaints  they have said they ll allow protests in Moscow on Saturday and Sunday next weekend  albeit in a location away from the city center which the opposition has rejected in the past 
But Leonid Volkov  an ally of jailed anti Kremlin opposition politician Alexei Navalny  said late on Saturday that Navalny s political movement planned to organize another of its own protests on Aug  10 which he said would be nationwide 
He said protesters would demand that jailed activists be released  that opposition candidates be allow to run in the Moscow election  and that the mayor of Moscow and other top officials resign 
 This is a matter of human dignity  about the right to choose and express your opinion   Volkov wrote on Twitter 
 Muscovites have had their elections stolen  are being arrested by the thousand  hundreds are being beaten and dozens jailed  Therefore we ll have to prove our existence on the streets of our cities  
He said the opposition did not plan to ask Moscow officials for permission to protest but would do so in other cities 
Activists say the Russian constitution allows them to freely protest  But authorities say they need to agree the timing and location in advance  something that was not done ahead of Saturday s protest 
The focus of protesters  anger is a prohibition on a number of opposition minded candidates  some of whom are allies of Navalny  from taking part in a September election for Moscow s city legislature 
That vote  though local  is seen as a dry run for a national parliamentary election in 2021 
Authorities say opposition candidates failed to collect enough genuine signatures to register and say the election will be competitive  The excluded candidates say that is a lie and insist on taking part in a contest they believe they could win 
Navalny and at least seven of his allies are currently in jail for breaking protest laws  The ruling United Russia party dominates the national parliament and Navalny and his allies are starved of media air time 
President Vladimir Putin and the Kremlin have not commented on the standoff with the opposition  but Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin  a Putin ally  has condemned the protests as cynically orchestrated mass disorder 
At well over 60 percent  Putin s approval rating is still high compared with many other world leaders  but is lower than it used to be due to discontent over years of falling incomes

181657,403173,MXIM, We ll pay nothing   TowerJazz seeks growth with minimal investment,news,By Tova Cohen and Steven Scheer MIGDAL HA EMEK  Israel  Reuters    Executives at Panasonic were surprised when Russell Ellwanger  CEO of Israeli chipmaker TowerJazz  TA TSEM   asked to partner in three of their factories without putting any cash on the table   They had said that to do the deal it would be between a  300 million  226 12 million pounds  and  400 million cost for us   he told Reuters in an interview   I said   No  we want to do this deal     but we will pay nothing    Instead Ellwanger sealed the joint venture with what he characterized as a win win deal  his company filled the unused capacity at the Japanese plants and struck a five year deal to supply chips to Panasonic  T 6752  from the joint venture  It also agreed to hand over  7 5 million in TowerJazz stock  plus about half of what it earned from selling chips made at the factories to other customers   The latter presents Panasonic with  100 million a year  Ellwanger has managed to strike agreements   like the 2014 Panasonic one   to expand the company s manufacturing operations with minimal investment  He is counting on this strategy to drive further growth   but it has its limits and risks   Rather than building or buying a factory at huge cost  TowerJazz looks for plants owned by bigger fish with idle capacity that is hitting their profitability  It takes up that capacity while striking supply deals and offering other incentives such as a cut of profits and technical know how  Ellwanger used similar tactics to acquire a factory in Texas from Maxim Integrated Products  O MXIM  that wasn t producing at full capacity and thus costly to run  Rather than paying in cash  it struck a 15 year supply deal with the U S  multinational and handed over  40 million in stock   In the latest deal  TowerJazz said in August it was linking up with Tacoma Semiconductor Technology to establish a plant in China  It will not invest any money but will provide technological and operational expertise in exchange for half the annual capacity of 240 000 chips   The ability to identify such opportunities has been Ellwanger s signature since 2005  when he left California to take on the task of running TowerJazz  which had  100 million in annual revenue and was saddled with  530 million of net debt   The company  which specializes in the kind of analog chips used in cars  medical sensors and power management  is now debt free  profitable and with annual revenue approaching  1 5 billion  Its shares are up 64 percent in 2017 versus a roughly 30 percent gain in the Philadelphia chip companies index  SOX   and have doubled over the past 12 months   LIMITS TO GROWTH The strategy of filling the unused capacity of the likes of Panasonic and Maxim is partly born of necessity  Building or buying a factory can costs hundreds of millions of dollars  a big undertaking for a company with net cash of  143 million at the end of June  However such opportunities do not come around very often  limiting the company s growth  And with chipmaking heavily dependent on volume  TowerJazz faces a challenge in increasing production capacity fast enough to remain competitive in the market for specialty analog chips   At present the company only has enough capacity to increase annual revenue to  1 62 billion by the end of 2019  according to  Credit Suisse   SIX CSGN  semiconductor sector analyst Quang Tung Le  who last month started coverage of Tower  Craig Hallum analyst Richard Shannon said the company would hit the limits of their capacity by the end of 2018  precluding further growth   The timeframe to get capacity online  in China  will not be early enough   he added  The analog chips produced by TowerJazz regulate functions such as temperature  speed  sound and electrical current as opposed to digital chips that process binary information  Manufacturers of analog  and mixed signal  devices tend to have more varied markets than digital   In the analog mixed signal foundry sector TowerJazz has a 30 percent market share followed by Vanguard  TWO 5347   Hua Hong Semiconductor  HK 1347   Dongbu Hi Tek  KS 000990  and X FAB  PA XFAB     Since Russell took over he has performed a heroic turnaround of a company that was on its deathbed   said Robert Katz  managing director of New York based Senvest Management  TowerJazz s second largest investor with a 5 2 percent stake   Ellwanger says TowerJazz had enough capacity without China to get through 2018  but he s actively pursuing more deals like the one with Panasonic to fill the impending gap   There are technologies we are looking at buying   the CEO said in the interview at his offices in the northern city of Migdal Ha emek  near TowerJazz s two Israeli plants  built before he joined the company   He added that TowerJazz wanted to  get strongly into sensors   Drexel Hamilton analyst Cody Acree said South Korea s Dongbu could be a target as it would be immediately accretive to TowerJazz s earnings  German based X FAB and Taiwan s Vanguard also make sense as targets  he said  but trade at higher valuations  Ellwanger declined to

What s Next for Maxim 
While Maxim has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

181685,403201,MXIM,Year End Speculation In The Euro,opinion,"Foreign currencies are rarely top of mind for the average investor   This is not entirely surprising given some of the complexities involved   In all candor  currency conversions still kind of make my head spin at times 
Still  it is interesting to note that while the stock market trades roughly  200 billion dollars per day  the FOREX market trades roughly  5 trillion dollars per day  data source  dailyfx com    So  there must be something going on there 
In any event  this article is not intended to get you excited or interested in FOREX trading   We are going to go much narrower in our focus 





The Euro End Of Year Seasonal Tendency
Figure 1 displays the annual seasonal trend for the euro according to sentimentrader com  Figure 1   Euro Annual Seasonal Trend  Courtesy Sentimentrader com It is critical to understand that this is the  average  for what has happened in the past and should in no way be viewed as a  roadmap    Still  the point is pretty clear   if history proves and accurate guide this time around then the Euro may perform well between now and the end of the year Figure 2 displays the ETF ticker Guggenheim CurrencyShares Euro  NYSE FXE   which tracks the euro  with a completed 5 waves down Elliott Wave count  and a potential price target generated using the Range Projection tool from ProfitSource com

Finally  Figure 3 tells us that options on ticker FXE are presently dirt cheap   i e   implied option volatility  the black line in Figure 3  is extremely low   This tells us that little option premium is built into the prices of FXE options

Figures 4 and 5 display the particulars for one possible speculative play designed to make money IF FXE does in fact move higher by December 31 
Figure 4   FXE Jan calls  Courtesy OptionsAnalysis com 























One word of caution  Options on FXE are presently very thinly traded   Note that the bid ask spreads are fairly wide and that a trader may wish to use a limit order and try to split the difference   For purposes of this illustration we will assume that we simply  buy at the ask  price A few things to note  The risk curves are drawn through December 31 since that is when the  seasonally favorable  period ends  and we will not likely want to hold the position beyond that time  The cost to enter the trade   and the maximum risk is  102 per contract If FXE does in fact rally this trade can make money above the approximate Dec  31 breakeven price of  105 85 for FXE shares  current price    105 08   If FXE remains unchanged or declines this trade will absolutely lose moneyA pretty straightforward  speculative bet    be right  make money  be wrong  lose money 
Summary
As always  this example trade is not a  recommendation    It is intended to serve simply as an example of an opportunity that tries to put as many factors in its favor as possible 
 Favorable seasonal trend
 Potentially bullish Elliott Wave count
 Potentially bullish price projection
 Opportunity to buy cheap options
 Low dollar risk
 Limited risk and unlimited profit potential
Will this trade work out favorably   It beats me   But that is the nature of speculation   which also highlights the importance of  position sizing   i e   what percentage of one s capital will one risk on a given trade   In this example  maybe risking 1  to 5  of one s trading capital might make sense   But  betting the ranch    i e   risking a high percentage of one s capital on a random speculative bet   is an invitation to catastrophe 
So  let s wrap up with

GARP approach leads to identification of stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis Further  the strategy helps investors in gaining exposure to stocks that have impressive prospects and are trading at a discount  GARP stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow  revenues  earnings per share  EPS  and so on That means a portfolio

impressive earnings prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy  However  instead of super normal growth rates  pursuing stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is also a tactic of GARP investors  Hence  growth rates between 10  and 20  are considered ideal under the GARP strategy Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity  ROE   GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks  Moreover  stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan Value MetricsGARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics   price to earnings  P E  ratio  Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P E

181712,403228,MXIM,Earnings Preview  Maxim Integrated Products  MXIM  Q4 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"The market expects Maxim Integrated Products  NASDAQ MXIM  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 30  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This chipmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 57 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  21 9  
Revenues are expected to be  560 17 million  down 11 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 14  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Maxim 
For Maxim  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Maxim will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Maxim would post earnings of  0 52 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 52  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Maxim doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-maxim-integrated-products-mxim-q4-earnings-expected-to-decline-200443255,200443255

A quarter ago  it was expected that this chipmaker would post earnings of  0 52 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 52  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has not been able to surpass consensus EPS estimates 
Maxim  which belongs to the Zacks Semiconductor   Analog and Mixed industry  posted revenues of  556 55 million for the quarter ended June 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 65   This compares to year ago revenues of  633 15 million  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Maxim shares have added about 26 9  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 20 5  
What s Next for Maxim 
While Maxim has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Maxim was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  0 62 on  578 24 million in revenues for the coming quarter and  2 65 on  2 39 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

   End Market in DetailIndustrial  Maxim generated 27  of revenues from this market  Revenues declined 6  from the prior year quarter  primarily due to slow bookings and resales across most of the company s product lines Automotive  The company generated 24  of revenues from this market and revenues were up 8  on a year over year basis  This can primarily be attributed to strong performance of battery management systems for electric vehicles and driver assistance content  Additionally  Maxim is seeing increased opportunities in power management and point to point serial link data communication products Notably  the company won designs for GMSL 2 products with seven different original equipment manufacturers  OEMs  and expects to launch more products  Moreover  Maxim introduced high voltage automotive power solutions for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems  ADAS   The company also noted that the scale and reach of its battery management systems increased However  Maxim experienced softness in infotainment and auto body electronics business due to sluggish car sales Consumer  Maxim generated 28  of revenues from this market and revenues were up 7  year over year  driven by the company s solid momentum across wearables  tablets and peripheral markets  In the reported quarter  Maxim launched power management products and integrated battery chargers Communications and Data Center  Revenues in this market were down 13  from the year ago quarter  This was due to lower than expected demand of 100G optical products and sluggishness in communications infrastructure Lower demand for 100G laser products was due to technical issue with one of Maxim s customer products and reduced spending by cloud customers in the last few months  Notably  the company generated 3  of revenues from this market Computing  This market accounted for 3  of the total revenues in the quarter under review Operating DetailsNon GAAP gross profit decreased 9 7  year over year to  379 9 million and non GAAP gross margin contracted 170 basis points  bps  year over year to 65 9   The decrease can be attributed to higher inventory levels in the reported quarter and one time credits given in the fiscal first quarter 2019 Non GAAP operating expenses of  188 2 million decreased 6 5  year over year due to efficient cost control  However  as a percentage of revenues  the figure expanded 30 bps year over year to 32 6  GAAP research and development expenses declined 4 8  year over year to  110 3 million  Moreover  selling  general and administrative expenses

to  182 4 million and operating margin contracted 70 bps year over year to 31 6  due to lower revenues Balance Sheet   Cash FlowAs of Dec 29  2018  cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were  1 96 billion compared with  2 56 billion as of Sep 29  2018  The decrease was due to bond payments worth  500 million in the reported quarter and higher share buybacks  Notably  Maxim spent  208

pegged at 62 cents Management expects to retain its strong momentum in the automotive market in the fiscal third quarter  backed by the company s well performing battery management systems and ADAS  But this is expected to be offset by lower car sales However  management announced that industrial market will be down sequentially  primarily due to weakness in Automatic Test Equipment  ATE   Moreover  Communications and Data Center segment is expected to be significantly down due to lower demand for 100G laser shipments and  broad based of building block products  Further  seasonal

181738,403254,MXIM,Earnings Preview  Maxim Integrated Products  MXIM  Q3 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Maxim Integrated Products  NASDAQ MXIM  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 30  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This chipmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 52 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  28 8  
Revenues are expected to be  539 98 million  down 16 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 21  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Maxim 
For Maxim  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Maxim will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Maxim would post earnings of  0 62 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 60  delivering a surprise of  3 23  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Maxim doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-maxim-integrated-products-mxim-q3-earnings-expected-to-decline-200409453,200409453
181739,403255,MXIM,NXPI Vs  MXIM  Which Stock Should Value Investors Buy Now ,opinion,"Investors interested in stocks from the Semiconductor   Analog and Mixed sector have probably already heard of NXP Semiconductors  NXPI  and Maxim Integrated Products  NASDAQ MXIM   But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now  We ll need to take a closer look 
The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits 
NXP Semiconductors and Maxim Integrated Products are sporting Zacks Ranks of  2  Buy  and  3  Hold   respectively  right now  The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates  so investors should rest assured that NXPI has an improving earnings outlook  But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in 
Value investors analyze a variety of traditional  tried and true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics  including the tried and true P E ratio  the P S ratio  earnings yield  and cash flow per share  as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use 
NXPI currently has a forward P E ratio of 11 70  while MXIM has a forward P E of 21 84  We also note that NXPI has a PEG ratio of 0 94  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  MXIM currently has a PEG ratio of 1 87 
Another notable valuation metric for NXPI is its P B ratio of 3 04  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  MXIM has a P B of 8 77 
These metrics  and several others  help NXPI earn a Value grade of B  while MXIM has been given a Value grade of C
