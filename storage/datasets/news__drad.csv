1676,223191,DRAD,Digirad  DRAD  Sees Hammer Chart Pattern  Time To Buy ,opinion,"Digirad Corporation   NASDAQ DRAD   has been struggling lately  but the selling pressure may be coming to an end soon  That is because DRAD recently saw a Hammer Chart Pattern which can signal that the stock is nearing a bottom 
What is a Hammer Chart Pattern  
A hammer chart pattern is a popular technical indicator that is used in candlestick charting  The hammer appears when a stock tumbles during the day  but then finds strength at some point in the session to close near or above its opening price  This forms a candlestick that resembles a hammer  and it can suggest that the market has found a low point in the stock  and that better days are ahead 
Other Factors
Plus  earnings estimates have been rising for this company  even despite the sluggish trading lately  In the past 60 days alone 1 estimate has gone higher  compared to none lower  while the consensus estimate has also moved in the right direction 
Estimates have actually risen so much that the stock now has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  suggesting this relatively unloved stock could be due for a breakout soon  This will be especially true if DRAD stock can build momentum from here and find a way to continue higher of off this encouraging trading development ",2016-05-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/digirad-(drad)-sees-hammer-chart-pattern:-time-to-buy-200130420,200130420

1681,223196,DRAD,7 Medical Stocks To Buy With Market Beating Yields,opinion,Medical is one of the very few sectors that generally show great resilience during volatile phases in the market  It is also one of the few sectors that have reported earnings growth in the recently concluded first quarter of 2016  Both these features appeal to dividend loving investors This is because the dividend paying capacity of a stock is highly dependent on its earnings growth trend and the overall health of the sector to which it belongs  A regular flow of dividends ensures that a steady income flow is generated even if the market remains volatile  Moreover  regular dividend payments demonstrate a company s sound fundamentals as well as its underlying business strength Medical s Growth Prospects Support YieldWe note that expansion into emerging markets  positive demographic trends  product innovation and continuing consolidation are some of the key growth factors for the Medical sector  These aspects will continue to help companies generate steady earnings growth in the near term Additionally  the weakening of the U S  dollar against foreign currencies   which has been a drag on results for quite some time   will drive top and bottom line growth  Moreover  the recent suspension of the controversial 2 3  medical device excise tax for two years will boost profits for the entire medical device industry  which forms a major part of the Medical sector These encouraging factors will certainly help the companies in the Medical space sustain their market beating dividend yields  And investors with a penchant for high dividend yield stocks will naturally flock this sector  regardless of the sharp vicissitudes in the market Our PicksWe have narrowed down our search to the following medical stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and dividend yield of more than 2  New York based Bristol Myers Squibb Company   NYSE BMY   is a global specialty biopharmaceutical company  This Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stock flaunts a dividend yield of 2 06  and has a long term earnings growth rate of 21 5  Investors can also count on Pfizer Inc    NYSE PFE    another Zacks Rank  1 stock  This New York based company has a solid dividend yield of 3 44  and a long term earnings growth rate of 5 4  Another large cap Pharmaceutical stock   Johnson   Johnson   NYSE JNJ     is an attractive choice for dividend lovers  This Zacks Rank  2  Buy  sports a strong dividend yield of 2 77  and a long term earnings growth rate of 5 7 We also prefer Abbott Laboratories   NYSE ABT    another Zacks Rank  2 stock  Abbott Park  IL based Abbott has a dividend yield of 2 67  and a long term earnings growth rate of 10  Beyond large cap Pharmaceutical stocks  our search picks Digirad Corporation   NASDAQ DRAD    The Poway  CA based diagnostic nuclear and ultrasound imaging systems and services provider carries a Zacks Rank  2 and its current dividend yield of 3 88  is quite impressive Nursing Home operator and long term healthcare services provider Kindred Healthcare Inc    NYSE KND   is another good choice for investors  This Zacks Rank  2 stock has a dividend yield of 3 79  and a long term earnings growth rate of 8  Last but not least  HEALTHSOUTH Corp    NYSE HLS   is a provider of outpatient surgery and rehabilitative healthcare services  Birmingham  AL based HEALTHSOUTH has a Zacks Rank  2  with a dividend yield of 2 24  and a long term earnings growth rate of 12 5  ConclusionAlthough the sustainability of dividend yield is difficult to predict  we believe that the Medical sector s compelling prospects will shield it against the vagaries plaguing the market  The gradually improving U S  macro environment and the uptick in the overall stock market on the back of a reversal in oil prices bode well for the sector ,2016-06-08,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/7-medical-stocks-to-buy-with-market-beating-yields-200134987,200134987
1682,223197,DRAD,5 Medical Stocks To Buy With Great Dividend Yields,opinion,U S  stock markets are shrouded in uncertainty with the major indices stumbling yet again yesterday after hitting alarming lows last Friday  The S P 500 index dropped 1 8   losing 36 87 points while the Dow Jones industrial average fell 1 5   losing 260 51 points  The tech heavy Nasdaq Composite suffered an even greater fall of 2 4   slipping113 54 points Brexit  Other Commotion  What s in Store for U S  Investors Of course  the primary malefactor that recently rocked the stock market from Tokyo to Toronto  was Britain s confirmation that it will exit the European Union   a shocker that created a Black Friday on Jun 24  Analysts fear this undesirable Brexit affair to unleash a sell off worth  300 billion in the U S   as this nation is the largest single investor in Britain  This in turn might drag the U S  stock market once again into a prolonged period of volatility from which it recovered only a few months ago In the wake of this phenomenal Brexit event  the odds have taken a complete rebound with respect to the Fed s expected rate hike in next month s meeting  As per Bloomberg data  before the Brexit vote took place  the majority of analysts expected the Fed to raise interest rate at least once in 2016  even if not in July  But for now  Britain seems to have sealed the fate of Fed s policy tightening  Most investors fear that Brexit might have triggered too much macroeconomic turmoil  which will force the Fed to stay put once again Amid this widespread uncertainty  investors must be wondering where to park their money or whether to invest in the stock market at all  But market upheavals are part of the game and should not discourage investment decisions Instead  investors should now target safe bets rather than going for stocks with high earnings growth potential  only   as this might turn into a nightmare Dividend Stocks Offer Safety in VolatilityIn an erratic market  it is natural for investors to choose stocks that offer steady returns against their investment  Naturally  the spotlight falls on dividend stocks that offer stable income and are generally less volatile in nature  In unfavorable markets  these stocks shield investors  portfolio like none other Historically  dividend paying stocks have outperformed with respect to their long term returns  Moreover  in a low interest rate environment  dividend paying stocks offer substantial yields on a regular basis Why Medical Stocks are Preferred Picks NowThe Q2 earnings season is around the corner and only seven out of the 16 Zacks sectors are expected to report positive earnings growth  Notably  Medical is one of them  Inherently  this sector has delivered a stable performance and remains less sensitive to economic cycles In addition  the majority of the S P500 sectors with substantial revenue exposure in the U K  are expected to perform poorly on the Brexit decision  Medicalhas a high chance of escaping this onslaughttoo  Being one of the prime S P 500 sectors  Medical stands out as one of the few safe havens for investors  Currently  Medical is the third sector in the S P 500 cohort in terms of market cap  and has revenue exposure of only 2 6  in the U K   much less than the other primary sectors  as per Factsheet Data  Stocks to ConsiderIt is quite evident from the above discussion that in the prevailing volatility  a winning combination will be Medical stocks paying high dividends To add even more impetus to this strategy we shall also consider Zacks Rank as a criterion for effective stock selection  This is because stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy  indicate positive estimate revisions by brokers in recent times Here are five Medical stocks with a dividend yield of more than 2 1  and a solid Zacks Rank  1 or  2 Bristol Myers Squibb Company   NYSE BMY    This New York based biopharmaceutical company manufactures medicines that fight deadly
