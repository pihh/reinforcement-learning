118212,339727,CLX,Stock Market News  Alphabet Tells All  Clorox Cleans Up,news,"Tuesday morning looked like a celebration on Wall Street  as investors across the globe took comfort in the fact that Chinese stock markets didn t continue their precipitous plunge  Although the coronavirus outbreak continues to spread  market participants appear more confident of a favorable outcome despite short term disruptions  As of 11 a m  EST  the Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJINDICES  DJI  was up 444 points to 28 844  The S P 500  SNPINDEX  GSPC  rose 49 points to 3 298  and the Nasdaq Composite  NASDAQINDEX  IXIC  was higher by 152 points to 9 426 
Earnings reports continued to come in  and they produced mixed results for different stocks  Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL   NASDAQ GOOG  suffered declines after disappointing its shareholders  but Clorox  NYSE CLX  delivered a much cleaner report that made investors feel good about the consumer goods giant 
Investors learn more about Alphabet
Shares of Alphabet fell 4  Tuesday morning  following Monday night s release of fiscal fourth quarter earnings  The tech giant continued to see fundamental growth  but its disclosure of more specific information about some of its business units created some concerns among investors 

Alphabet s headline numbers were a mixed bag for those following the Google parent  Revenue climbed 17  year over year  but that was a couple percentage points less than most investors had hoped to see  A 20  gain in earnings per share surpassed expectations significantly  though  which some saw as softening the blow from the revenue shortfall 
More interesting were Alphabet s internal breakdowns across business lines  YouTube saw annual ad revenue climb 31  from the prior year period to  4 7 billion during the quarter  while Google s cloud business saw a 53  jump from year ago levels to  2 6 billion  Although those growth rates were solid  they raised concerns that Alphabet won t be able to catch up with its primary rivals  especially in cloud services 
Alphabet has plans to accelerate its future growth  including significant investment in its cloud platform  Yet for now  it ll be up to Alphabet to prove to its shareholders that it has what it takes to remain an important player in the industry s fastest growing areas 
A squeaky clean quarter for Clorox
Clorox saw its stock gain 4  after releasing a solid financial report for its fiscal second quarter  The bleach maker also saw even better times ahead 
Clorox s results did show some of the challenges that the consumer goods industry has gone through lately  Revenue was down 2   with organic sales coming in flat after adjusting for the downward impact of the strong U S  dollar on the currency markets  Household segment sales hit Clorox hard  with particularly significant losses related to the company s bag and wrap products 
However  there were many things to be excited about in Clorox s report  Earnings climbed 4  on a per share basis from the year ago period  and significant growth in the lifestyle segment showed increased popularity in brands like Burt s Bees and Brita  Looking ahead  Clorox boosted its full year outlook slightly  with organic sales expected to come in flat to up 2   Earnings projections of  6 10 to  6 25 per share reflected a  0 05 per share increase to the bottom end of the previous range 
Clorox has worked hard to cut costs and spur growth  and those efforts appear to be taking hold  It ll take more time to make a full turnaround  but shareholders are confident that Clorox is on the right path to restoring its track record of success ",2020-02-05,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pr052,2075841

looking statements With that I ll start by covering our top line commentary discussing highlights in each of our segments  Kevin will then address our financial results  as well as outlook for fiscal year 2020  Finally Benno will offer his perspective and we ll close with Q A For the total Company Q2 sales decreased 2   These results are on top of solid sales growth in the year ago period  Organic sales were flat  I ll now go through our results by segment In our Cleaning segment  Q2 sales were flat for the quarter  as gains in Professional Products and Home Care were offset by a decline in Laundry  In Home Care  sales were up behind strong volume growth across a number of product lines including Clorox disinfecting wipes  Clorox toilet bowl cleaners and Clorox Scentiva particularly in non tracked channels  Our Scentiva innovation platform continues to show robust growth even three years after initial launch  We remain focused on driving superior consumer value through meaningful innovations like our Scentiva wet mopping clothes which are doing well and continue to build distribution  A new scent across the platform Tahitian Grapefruit will start shipping this month Additionally  we were pleased to deliver record second quarter shipment growth of Clorox disinfecting wipes  However  our shares in this category continue to be down as a result of higher competitive merchandising activities  And we expect these activities to continue in the back half of the fiscal year  We re increasing our investments to support the long term health of our brands We re doing this in two ways  First  we re strengthening our merchandising plans with higher trade investments and  second  we are increasing our marketing investments behind Clorox compostable cleaning wipes which have had a positive early reception from both retailers and consumers Laundry sales were down for the quarter driven primarily by distribution losses among retailers    select retailers which continued from last quarter  We expect improvement going forward as we start rolling out a full line of compacted bleach product this month Our plans this fiscal year also include a new laundry sanitizing innovation platform which started shipping toward the end of 2019  We re supporting this innovation through strong marketing investments to drive awareness and trial Lastly  within the Cleaning segment  Professional products continued this momentum and delivered another quarter of robust sales growth with broad based growth across all channels and product lines supported by innovation Turning to the Household segment  Q2 sales were down 8  with declines in all businesses  In Bags and Wraps  Q2 sales were down due to ongoing distribution losses in select portions of the portfolio and increased competitive activity  While we continue to make progress and have seen sequential improvement in both volume and sales  we ve seen a further increase in competitive activity  consistent with what we ve seen in past periods when there was a pullback in resin price even on a temporary basis  We expect these competitive price reductions and higher promotional activities to continue in the back half of the fiscal year  With a keen focus on consumer value  we re further increasing our investments in Glad and coupling that with a number of innovation to drive long term profitable growth for our brand and the category As expected  Grilling sales were down double digits this quarter  While consumption was strong  it was more than offset by lower shipments as we finish working through high retail inventory from a weak 2019 grilling season  an effort that started in Q1  We expect to return to normal at retail inventory levels as we enter the new grilling season  As a reminder  Q2 is a relatively small quarter for this business representing about 10  of annual shipments Going forward  we remain focused on executing our strategy in three areas  One  enhancing the consumer experience  two  implementing the right trade and pricing structure and  three  investing in innovation including our core charcoal products and alternative fuels such as pellets  As noted in our press release  we ve changed the name of this strategic business unit from charcoal to grilling to reflect our broad and strategic view of the category In RenewLife  which represents about 1  of total Company sales  sales declined by double digits due to the continued category and competitive headwinds  However  we are encouraged by the early signs of progress we re seeing with two of our three biggest customers now showing growth  As a reminder  a full brand relaunch will occur in the first half of FY  21 Finally  our Cat Litter business was down slightly due to higher trade spending and lapping strong double digit sales growth in the year ago quarter  which benefited from price increases The Fresh Step Clean paws innovation platform  which saw a double digit increase in shipment this quarter continues to show promise and we re investing behind this momentum in the back half In our Lifestyle segment  sales grew 4  reflecting volume growth across all businesses Burt s Bees delivered a record quarter of sales  driven by continued strength in its core categories of Lip Care and Face Care  In Lip Care  Burt s Bees achieved a market leadership status in 2019 as the number one overall lip balm in the United States for the first time ever over a 52 week period  Burt s Bees Lip Balm has grown shares for 20 consecutive quarters or five years in a row  This success was fueled by a strong pipeline of innovation  such as the watermelon enhanced flavors In Face Care  Mask the restaged sensitive skin care line and core cleansers all had double digit consumption growth  Food sales were up again this quarter  supported by higher merchandising level driving strong shipments of Hidden Valley Ranch products  On the innovation side  our ready to eat dips platform is expanding to include French onion  Fiesta Ranch and a Deluxe Cheese and Ranch dips and while a new Hidden Valley Ranch secret sauce line  which was launched in January is continuing to help unlock new Hidden Valley Ranch eating occasion  Hidden Valley branch extended its streak of share growth to 20 quarters  Brita sales were up strongly behind higher shipments of our premium filtering models and long last filters and water filtration system  New products including large capacity plastics and stainless steel bottles are expected to enhance the filtering water bottle innovation platform even further building on consistent volume growth in Brita that now dates back more than a year Finally  sales for Nutranext were down slightly this quarter  reflecting double digit decrease in our non strategic brands  partially offset by solid growth in our strategic brands  We re encouraged by the success of our strategic brands  which was fueled by higher demand creation investments and we re increasing those investment further to drive additional awareness and trial in these emerging and fast growing categories The decrease in non strategic part of this portfolio was driven mainly by our decision to continue rationalizing the lower margin part of this business that came as part of the acquisition Lastly  turning to International  Sales were down 2  for the quarter  reflecting 8 points of foreign currency headwinds mainly from Argentina  partially offset by the benefits of price increases  Organic sales in the segment grew 6   consistent with our IGNITE strategy that aims to improve profitability in International  We re continuing to invest selectively in profitable markets and growth platforms to give yielding returns on businesses like Burt s Bees  Cat Litter and the Clorox equity Now let me turn it over to Kevin  who will discuss our Q2 financial performance and our updated outlook for FY  20 Kevin Jacobsen    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Lisa  And thank you everyone for joining us today  I m pleased with the progress we ve made in Q2 as we delivered sequential improvement in organic sales  our fifth consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion and another quarter of strong cash flow  I m also encouraged by our continued progress in bags and wraps and grilling business units and expect to see continued sequential improvement on these businesses in the back half of the fiscal year  As you saw in our press release i m updating our outlook  which I ll discuss in a moment Turning to our second quarter results  Sales decreased 2   reflecting 2 points of unfavorable foreign currency headwinds  On an organic sales basis  second quarter sales were flat  Gross margin for the quarter increased 40 basis points to 44 1  compared to 43 7  for the year ago quarter  Second quarter gross margin included the benefit of 150 basis points from cost savings and 100 basis points from pricing  These factors were partially offset by 90 basis points of higher trade spending and 80 basis points of higher manufacturing and logistics costs  Second quarter gross margin also reflected ongoing cost favorability in commodities  partially offset by the impact from foreign currency headwinds Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales came in slightly higher at 14 5  compared to 14 3  in the year ago quarter  due to reduced operating leverage  Year over year  selling and administrative spending for the quarter was relatively flat  Advertising and sales promotion investment levels as a percentage of sales came in at about 10  of sales are about equal to the year ago quarter  We re spending in our U S  retail business coming in at 11  of sales  Our Second quarter effective tax rate was 21  compared to about 19  in the year ago quarter  Net of all these factors  we delivered diluted net earnings per share of  1 46 versus  1 40 in the year ago quarter  an increase of 4  Turning to year to date cash flow  net cash provided by operations for the last six months of the fiscal year came in at  498 million versus  449 million in the year ago period  an increase of 11   The year over year increase was primarily due to lower working capital  partially offset by the timing of payments Now I will turn to our fiscal year 2020 outlook  As we mentioned in our press release  we ve confirmed our fiscal year sales outlook of down to low single digits to up 1   We are now projecting a lower devaluation of the Argentine peso  which we expect to be offset by increased competitive activity in the bags and wraps and wipes categories  partially driven by resin cost deflation  Our fiscal year organic sales outlook now assumes a range of about flat to 2  growth  Embedded in organic sales assumption is a more cautious near term view of our back half sales expectations for bags and wraps reflecting increased competitive activity  Importantly  we continue to expect our grilling business to return to growth in the second half of the fiscal year  As a reminder  we previously assumed devaluation of the Argentine peso at about 50  and now our expectation is closer to 40  devaluation over the course of the fiscal year Turning to gross margin  we now expect fiscal year gross margin to be up slightly reflecting our expectations for ongoing cost favorability in commodities and a slightly lower impact from foreign currencies  These factors are expected to be partially offset by a lower pricing benefit in the back half as we have now lapsed the majority of our fiscal year  19 pricing actions  Our fiscal year gross margin also reflects higher trade promotion spending to address increased competitive activity in select categories  In addition  our fiscal year gross margin outlook continues to anticipate additional supply chain investments to support long term value creation including the rollout of Clorox liquid bleach compaction  beginning this quarter We now expect fiscal year advertising and sales promotion investment levels to be slightly above 10  of sales  reflecting increased investments in support of a robust innovation pipeline in the back half of the fiscal year  We also continue to expect selling and administrative expenses to come in about 14  of sales  We now expect fiscal year EBIT margin to be about flat  Our outlook continues to anticipate our fiscal year tax rate to be in the range of 22  to 23   Net of all these factors  we now expect fiscal year 2020 diluted EPS to be in the range of  6 10 to  6 25  which raises the low end of our range by  0 05 Before I turn it over to Benno  I d like to reinforce that I m pleased with the progress we continue to make on our business  We delivered our fifth consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion with strong contributions from our cost savings program  We also delivered another quarter of strong cash flow  Importantly  we remain on track to return to organic sales growth in the back half of the fiscal year Looking ahead  I continue to believe Clorox is taking the right actions to deliver results that are more in line with our long term financial goals as we continue to focus on executing our IGNITE strategy to drive long term shareholder value  And with that  I ll turn it over to Benno Benno Dorer    Chair and Chief Executive OfficerHello  everyone  and thank you  Kevin  Here are my three key messages for the second quarter  First  while our topline performance is not yet where it needs to be  I m pleased with the progress we re making on our business  which is evident in our Q2 results  As I look at the results of our overall portfolio in the quarter  I do feel good about the growth we saw in a number of Clorox branded products in our Home Care business even as I fully expect stronger growth in the wipes category in the future  I m also pleased about the broad based strength in our Professional Products business  In Lifestyle  Burt s Bees continued its strong top line momentum with record quarterly sales and we saw sustained strength in our Food business behind increased merchandising support and also in water filtration behind innovation  And once again  our team in International continues to deliver very good results in currency neutral terms behind strong execution of our pricing initiatives I am also pleased to have delivered our fifth consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion  supported by our strong cost savings program  Importantly  we are continuing our focus on improving our bags and wraps and grilling businesses  On our grilling business  we are pleased to see solid consumption growth and we feel good about retailer reception to our go to market plans for the 2020 grilling season  Now that we ve finished working through retailer inventory from the year ago season  we continue to expect this business to grow in the second half Now as Kevin mentioned  we ve taken a somewhat more cautious near term view of our bags and wraps business  given our expectations for continued increased competitive activity Moving forward on Glad  we are focused on driving superior consumer value  We will do this with a consistent stream of unique innovations  leveraging our superior capabilities in technology and consumer insights backed by category leading advertising investments  We believe these focus areas will allow us to sustain our competitive advantage and help engage retailers  leading to strong in store position As I look at the other parts of our portfolio  generally  I feel good about our back half plans  which reflects our expectation for improved sales behind strong innovation and marketing plans  as well as progress on the distribution front  This brings me to my next message which is that we have strong consumer and retail plans for the second half of the fiscal year  fueled by increased investments that reflect confidence in our innovation program  Bringing value to our consumers and retailers is the key to returning to growth  Our second half plans emphasize this  and we re executing with a strong sense of urgency  yet also the right way  Our relentless focus on strengthening the value proposition of our brands through meaningful innovation continues with a strong pipeline of new products in the back half  including the compaction of Clorox liquid bleach as well as the introduction of Clorox compostable cleaning wipes  Clorox fabric sanitizers  Kingsford grilling pellets and several innovations in bags and wraps  food and natural personal care As you saw in our press release  we re leaning harder into supporting awareness and trial behind these new products  with plans to increase year over year advertising spending in the second half of the fiscal year  And of course  we ll continue to invest behind the momentum and significant upside opportunity in ongoing innovation platforms such as Clorox Scentiva  Fresh Step Clean paws  Brita Filtering Water Bottles and Hidden Valley ready to eat dips As I mentioned last quarter  we expect that our retailer engagement and the strength of our innovation programs contributes to better back half results  I m very encouraged by the strong retail receptions to our innovation so far  which is part of why we re stepping up our advertising investments And finally  I m pleased about our progress to improve distribution trends moving forward  We ll provide another update in Q3  once results are in market  but I do feel good about the constructive conversations with retailers overall  putting us in a position to earn meaningful net distribution gains across our portfolio in 2020 And for my last message  I d like to reinforce that I have the confidence that our IGNITE strategy will guide us in our ongoing pursuit of delivering long term shareholder value  The focus of IGNITE is to innovate across the entire Clorox value chain to earn people s enduring loyalty to our leading brands  We are innovating how we build brands and are on track to begin implementing purpose on all major U S  brands by the end of this fiscal year  which should significantly boost marketing ROI over time We are innovating shopping experiences and making good progress  engaging customers in strategies to grow their businesses through new and frictionless experiences that can help eliminate shopping barriers in our categories  We are innovating how we work by continuing to invest in digitizing our supply chain to drive productivity and we remain focused on achieving our new higher annual cost savings target of about 175 basis points And finally  we are driving our ESG commitments to create value for all our stakeholders  As we invest in major sustainability driven product innovations in the second half  we also are accelerating our goal of achieving 100  renewable electricity in the U S  and Canada to 2021  four years ahead of our original goal  We continue to view ESG as fundamental to long term value creation and I m pleased with our progress to integrate ESG even further in our business strategy  Operator  you may now open up the line for questions Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions  Your first question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank Steve Powers    Deutsche Bank    AnalystGreat  thanks  Hey  guys  Maybe first kind of just a quick cleanup and clarification on Argentina  Are you getting incremental pricing in that market  And I just asked because I think your October outlook presumed you would not  I just wanted to understand what the current state was Kevin Jacobsen    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Hi  Steve  Good morning  Yes  we are getting pricing better from Argentina  Maybe just a little more background there as you saw  we ve updated our expectations for devaluation  We had assumed 50   We ve seen the currency hold up pretty well in our second quarter and so we revised that to 40   But additionally we get out pretty early with pricing in Argentina  So we took a number of price increases in the first quarter that were certainly benefiting the overall profitability matching our International segment Steve Powers    Deutsche Bank    AnalystOkay  perfect  And then the second clarification  I think despite the competitive challenges  the flat organic result this quarter came in a little better than you telegraphed in October  Was there a particular driver there in the context of the full year coming down that implied second half reversal  Is that just bags  wraps and grilling staying weaker than planned for a bit longer  requiring more work or other areas showing less resilience versus what you hoped  Or is it    I think it s the former  but I just wanted to    want to clarify that Kevin Jacobsen    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSure  So on the first part of the question  yeah  It did come in a a little bit better than we anticipated  And there s really two areas  The first was FX  while it s still about a 2 point drag  that s a little bit better than we anticipated in the quarter and then the other area was our Lifestyle segment that was really strong performance and the performance is really broad based  We saw every business within that segment performed quite well and exceeded our expectations  And then as we look out over the full year  when I say the two areas that we ve highlighted is  we are seeing increased competitive activity in two categories  our wipes category and our bags and wraps category  So because of that  we will increase trade spending to defend share in those categories and specific maybe to bags and wraps I d tell you  not surprising  We ve seen this before  when we see the type of resin deflation  we typically see manufacturers invest more when that occurs  And so we re going to have to spend some money to defend there And then  Steve  on your question on grilling  We continue to feel very good about growing  it s on track with our expectations for the full year  we fully expect to return that business to growth  and so that business is very much on track Steve Powers    Deutsche Bank    AnalystOkay  And if I could  maybe for Benno  in addition to the promotional investment you re also as you discuss stepping up the A P investment  My guess is that that s targeted different businesses than the the promotional spend  So can you confirm that  And then I guess what s really motivating the uptick  Is it just that you have more funds given the    given the FX environment  So you    you feel like you have the flexibility to spend or is there s something you ve seen that s giving you more confidence in the ROI now versus three months ago  Thanks Benno Dorer    Chair and Chief Executive OfficerSteve  the step up in investments really reflects our confidence in our plans  That s a sole motivation  It certainly does include a strong retail reception to our innovations also in a few cases strong initial consumption results out of the gate on some of the innovations that we launched in January  which includes compostable wipes  So you know we are leaning into this innovation to lean into the momentum that we all see and  of course  three months ago  six months ago  we would have said that we re taking a more realistic view of our spending  given that we re still cycling through distribution losses and now  of course in the back half we are lapping those distribution losses  We expect  given the productive discussions that we have with retailers  solid results on the distribution fronts So it s really driven by the confidence that we have in our plans  the spending will go into innovations that we launched in the back half but also innovations from previous years and I mentioned some like Clorox Scentiva  which is still showing robust growth  Clean paws and Fresh Step which grew double digits last quarter  Brita Filtering Bottles which is showing nice continued progress  ready to eat dips on Hidden Valley which we re supporting with more innovation going to back half We feel really strongly and encouraged about all the back half  plans  and we re not afraid to invest behind it  A question that maybe could come up in the context of it that is maybe worthy of addressing upfront is  do we expect the change in our mid term outlook on how much we will spend in advertising and sales promotion  the answer to that is no  This is really an increase  that is really related to the back half of this fiscal year  We certainly commented in the past that we think that an average level of about 10  of sales per fiscal year is the right level and we continue to believe that Steve Powers    Deutsche Bank    AnalystPerfect  Thanks again OperatorNext question comes from Steve Strycula with UBS Steve Strycula    UBS    AnalystHi  good morning or good afternoon  So  Benno  just a very straightforward question  Wanted to understand the back half sales is a relatively wide range and just wanted to understand  based off your retail conversations would seem like they went well  What takes us to the low end versus the high end  whether it s the distribution clarity or maybe the consumer pull through and responsiveness to some of the innovation  Thank you Benno Dorer    Chair and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  it s a combination  Steve  Certainly what we    first of all  I have to say there s six months left in the    in the fiscal year  But several things can make up for the range  First of all  competitive activity  right  We cannot predict that and we have commented that certainly in two categories  we re seeing the promotional and merchandising environment increase as those categories tend to be more sensitive in spending toward the    in particular resin environments  which  as you know  is a little more favorable at this point  so cannot fully predict competitive activity  but that can have a major impact distribution outcomes So we know quite a bit  of course on what distribution outcomes are  but we don t know everything  We also know from the information that we have about decisions that retailers may have taken as it relates to our brands  but not competitive brands  That s still ahead of us  And then of course Coronavirus  cold and flu  you know that hasn t been a factor in Q2 and so far  we re not seeing an uptick but it s a rapidly evolving situation So we re certainly watching that and we re getting ready to be able to supply our customers and also our healthcare institutional customers with products  should they need that to help consumers combat the virus  So these are three pretty important swing items that could lead us to the lower or higher end But all in all  we feel like the midpoint of the range would point to a 3  sales growth in the back half on average  which of course is very much in line with our ongoing algorithm and because we are investing in items that don t just have a short term impact but drive our brand equities and have a long term impact  we feel like those investments also set us up nicely for a solid fiscal year  21 Steve Strycula    UBS    AnalystThank you OperatorNext question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JP Morgan Andrea Faria Teixeira    J P  Morgan    AnalystHi  thank you  So I understand you have  Technical Issues Lisah Burhan    Vice President  Investor RelationsAndrea  you breaking up quite a bit  Hey  operator maybe we move onto the next question and try to have Andrea call back OperatorYour next question comes from Wendy Nicholson with Citi Wendy Nicholson    Citi    AnalystHi  good afternoon  A couple of quick ones  First thing  Kevin  maybe just to clarify the trade spending in the quarter  I think you said it was 90 basis points of gross margin pressure but if my memory is right  I think it was 180 basis points in the first quarter  So is that just a timing issue  I would have expected higher spending this quarter as you try to regain distribution etc   etc  and see more gross margin pressure from that  But curious if there s any commentary on that Kevin Jacobsen    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Hi  Wendy  good afternoon  You re right on your memory  it was 90 basis points this quarter  it was a 180 basis point hit the margin last quarter  The biggest change from the first quarter is less investment in charcoal as we cycle through the bulk of the season  as I think  Lisa mentioned in her prepared remarks  Q2 is a very small quarter for us  So we have less investment in the category due to    and as we also said what we re really working on the trade spending is working through higher retail inventories as we had a poor season year  19 and we want to make sure we re set up for a strong season year  20  And so we ve been investing in trade in that business in both Q1 and to a lesser extent Q2 and we feel like we re in a good position as we head into season year  20 that we ve got retail inventories right and we re ready for a much stronger season Wendy Nicholson    Citi    AnalystGot it  got it  That makes sense  On the bleach compaction that I think you said were shipping this month  What s your expectation for competition  Do you think they follow the same degree of compaction  Do you think there s going to be incremental promotion  How much of a price increase are you embedding  Maybe if you could just talk a little bit more about that  that would be great Benno Dorer    Chair and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Wendy  So compaction is starting this month as you rightly said  and will take until the end of the fiscal year  There is no pricing  it s a straight conversion  Typically with    with initiation of retailers  we see a whole category move  So of course we have yet to see that because that s really well outside our control  But if this compaction wave mirrors previous compaction waves then what we re typically seeing is the whole category to move because this really is an initiative that s certainly good for all the manufacturers  it s good for retailers  it s good for the category  It s also good for the planet  So it s a win  win  win and there really isn t a reason for the category not to move  Consumers of course are getting a more convenient product and again there is no performance trade off for consumers either  So we are optimistic that this will be an initiative that will see the whole category move and we ll provide an update  after Q3 Wendy Nicholson    Citi    AnalystGot it  Fair enough  And then my very last question is just on trash bags  In the Nielsen data that we saw today and I know Nielsen doesn t tell the whole story or even    even close to the whole story  But still  you commented on a higher level of competitive activity in the bags category  On the trash side in particular  it looks like private label is the one who is actually doing more of the promotions but their market shares aren t increasing  So I wondered if you could just comment kind of on your read where the promotion is coming from  What do you see in the broader universe and whether you re more worried about the branded side of the competitive dynamic or the private label side  Thanks Benno Dorer    Chair and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  really varies by category  Wendy  On the Glad side  we see what you see that if I take us back a few months ago  what we said is that we are spending in trades to address price gaps that really works  We saw price gaps moves down and we saw significant increase in momentum on our business  What we ve seen more recently in a more benign resin environments is that  in particular from private label  we are seeing more activity and we see price gaps increase again  Now we also see what I think you hinted on and that is  that that s really not working for the category The category trends are softer  We ve always commented that people are not buying more trash bags  if they re cheaper and that s pretty much how it s playing out  And what that really does is give us optimism that in the long run  rational behavior will prevail and that we re going to see a continued balance in the category that will allow premium brands to grow behind innovation and delivering value that consumer see as superior and that s certainly our focus in this category Wendy Nicholson    Citi    AnalystGot it  Thank you very much OperatorNext question comes from Andrea Teixeira with JP Morgan Andrea Faria Teixeira    J P  Morgan    AnalystThank you for taking me back  Sorry for before  So I was hoping to go back to the cadence of the second half for organic  So I understand what you said in terms of    in the past of regaining distribution in trash to one    I believe one large customer  Is that something that we should be looking more into the fourth quarter building with what you mentioned to Wendy  And then on the gross margin  just a clarification in terms of the gross margin bridge  is that    Kevin was talking about is our commodity is actually getting better like for the second half for  I understand you re going to lap some of these    of these improvement by the fourth quarter  So I just want to know if embedded on that  you re actually having a better outlook for commodities than before  Thank you Kevin Jacobsen    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSure Hi  Andrea  It s Kevin  I can take both your questions  On organic progression  what you should assume is we continue to demonstrate sequential improvement as we move through the year  And so  as you recall  in Q1  organic was down about 2   It was flat in our most recent quarter and if you take a midpoint of our organic sales outlook  it would suggest 3 points of organic sales growth in the back half of the year and I would expect to continue to see sequential improvement as we move through the back half of the year Much of the distribution benefits will have a bigger impact in Q4 than they will in Q3  And so that s our expected progress  And then maybe just also  as we think about our organic sales goal for the year  the 0  to 2   I would just offer    I m much less concerned about the average for the year and much more focused on the momentum we re creating as we head into fiscal year  21  So I feel very good about the progress we re making and where I believe we ll end up in the fourth quarter as we head into  21 And then our gross margins on    in terms of the commodity environment  what I d tell you is  if I set resin aside  commodities are pretty much playing out as we expected  which is slightly inflationary  generally in line with broader inflation in the economy and that s pretty consistent with what we expected  What we are seeing is  while we expected resin to be deflationary  we certainly saw a bigger movement in the second quarter than we anticipated  I still think it will be down in the back half of the year  but to a lesser degree  Typically what we see is that manufacturers go down for planned maintenance in the spring and that usually puts a little upward pressure  Now  I think what we have to balance out right now is with what s going on with the Coronavirus and it s certainly reducing overall global productivity  We ll have to see what that does to global demand for resin but for right now  my expectation is that it continues to be favorable  but not to the same degree we saw in the front half Andrea Faria Teixeira    J P  Morgan    AnalystThank you  Appreciate it Kevin Jacobsen    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSure OperatorNext question comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays Lauren Rae Lieberman    Barclays    AnalystGreat  thanks  I just wanted to go back to distribution  Because  Benno I think the specific language you used was that  we re    we positioned ourselves well to earn back distribution  So I just wanted to get a sense for how much visibility you do have at this point for both things building in kind of the traditional reset timeline of this quarter and then even going into Q4 Benno Dorer    Chair and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  So  obviously wording carefully chosen because as always  and as all manufacturers  we have to earn distribution from retailers  right  Because they have to believe that our products are value added  said that  two things are going on  First of all  as you remember  there are a number of distribution losses post pricing that we re now lapping in the back half  So that should play in our favor  And then  realize that you d all like a very detailed updates but the reality is not all decisions are made by retailers requiring us to be respectful here  There are of course also competitive implications because this is all sensitive and  like I said earlier  we know quite a bit of our distribution results for the back half  but not all  This will play out with implementation in Q3 and Q4 But clearly I think as you also saw us talk about the conversations that we have  we feel good about them being constructive and productive  We have a lot of innovation  Innovation  generally is effective driving distribution and our sales outlook for the back half wouldn t be doable without generally a more favorable environment on distribution  So I think this is probably the appropriate way for us to characterize where we are  There ll be a further update in Q3  but the fact that we are investing more in our brands is based on confidence as we ve all said earlier and certainly how we feel about the conversations that we have with retailers  an indication that we may get  should they materialize the way we think they might  we feel positive about what we ll see in that environment and then more update in Q3 Lauren Rae Lieberman    Barclays    AnalystOkay  great  thanks  And then just continuing to another question on the bags and wraps category  So  one thing that s changed very recently is now your competitor  right  is public  So we ve got a lot more visibility into dynamics in that category  And I think many of us sort of understood in the past  So one of the things that was interesting to me in that process was seeing the innovation with  in particular with ultra strong rates sort of a bag  that s a real competitor to ForceFlex and that it s actually been on    it s been capacity constrained there  So it just    looking forward  is your thinking about competitive dynamics thinking about your branded competitor thinking about innovation there  thinking about that they were capacity constrained while you were losing distribution  Just anything more you can offer on this build back rate  Is there a lot of innovation in your plan  Is there adjustments in your pricing structure that kind of helps you regain leadership positions as a total in that business  Thanks Benno Dorer    Chair and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Lauren  of course  we are following that closely  even though I will tell you that many of the things that you quoted were news to us  I certainly don t want to speculate about what might happen  but there are two things  perhaps are most important here  The first one is that generally publicly traded companies care about the top line and also margin growth and what that does is drive productive and rational behaviors  So we just leave it there  And  second  we remain confident in our right to win in these categories  which really isn t affected by them going public  First of all  we have commented on a superior innovation capability that we continue to have with the joint venture that we maintain with Procter   Gamble  I d just point to the more than 100 patents and patent applications that we have over the last five years  and that compares to less than 10 for the said company And then as we think about our brand building efforts  the fact that we continue to be a leading investor in the consumer in this category  along with our commitment in superior consumer value  that s been a robust right to win for sure a decade and a half now since we ve had the joint venture  And the proof will be in our continued innovation and without getting into details  all I can say is that we have a lot of confidence in not just our back half innovation on this business and as you know  there is quite a bit  but in the long term innovation as we manage innovation with minimum three year timeframe  we know obviously about the innovation that we have are coming on to the business and we re pretty happy with the innovation platform that we have on Glad and we re pretty confident that we can get this business back on track once we ve cycled through the well documented issues  which we continue to characterize as short term Lauren Rae Lieberman    Barclays    AnalystOkay  thanks so much OperatorNext question comes from Olivia Tong with Bank of America Olivia Tong    Bank of America    AnalystGreat  thanks  Want to talk a little bit on your commentary around competition spends and why you think that about 10  is still the right number  because if competition is spending more and you feel good about your line up  why wouldn t you look to invest more heavily over a longer term period or is it just that you prefer to keep that flexibility in between trading support between promotion and advertising  Thanks Benno Dorer    Chair and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Olivia we ve always commented that we re not afraid to spend more  should there be an opportunity  and right now  certainly  there is an opportunity  And spending  of course is also broadly defined  right  whether that s in advertising  sales promotion or capital spending in initiatives that deliver growth  So we will always prioritize the long term health of our brands  We will always manage this business for the long term versus for the quarter  So all those things that    I know you re used to from Clorox  they remain true  said that  you know  we think that the overall spending level in advertising and sales promotion isn t going up So as a general rule of thumb  we like the 10   Part of why we re taking it up in the back half is that in the front half  we spend less than 10  because we have waited for our back half innovations to come on and certainly the fact that our margin situation is slightly more positive  It gives us a little bit of room to do so  But 10  continues to be the right number  we ll always take a look at that  but that s been the right number for a while and we don t see any reason why we should move off of that Olivia Tong    Bank of America    AnalystGot it  And then just on gross margin  Raw materials  obviously  we can see  has been a nice driver  But has there been any change in your expectations in other areas particularly either cost saves or manufacturing logistics  Last quarter you mentioned a delay in the litter plant  Any other changes in terms of the timing of project that might be helping this year  but the expenses will eventually come and the investments are just further down the line Kevin Jacobsen    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerHi  Olivia  Yeah  I would say  no real changes in timing or expectations for the year  As we mentioned  we have two large cost savings projects  bleach compaction  our new litter facility  those projects both continue to progress  As you know  obviously compaction  we re starting this quarter  litter we re probably 18 to 24 months out before we bring a new plant online  but those both continue on track Olivia Tong    Bank of America    AnalystThank you OperatorNext question comes from Nik Modi with RBC Nik Modi    RBC    AnalystYeah  good afternoon  everyone  Benno  can you just talk about what s going on in Laundry in terms of some of the distribution losses  I mean  is there a plan here  Can we build distribution or is it just cutting space overall of the aisle  And then on the compaction  how should we think about the margin implications of that as you guys kind of get the full scale of the distribution of that product Benno Dorer    Chair and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Thanks  Nik  Laundry was down for the quarter  certainly in volume and share and it s not our aspiration for the business and certainly not happy with that  The reason is mostly post pricing distribution losses sound like a broken record  perhaps  but that s  of course  been a known issue on several of the categories and something that we re cycling through  Said that  I ll also give the perspective that our past 13 weeks share through November is about 61  and that s well within the long term range and just to name three examples  it s higher than it was two years ago  or three years ago or four years ago  So maybe that s helpful for perspective Feeling good about back half plans  obviously on the distribution side  cannot say what will happen to the category  We have seen a little bit of a contraction in overall space that retailers dedicate to this category  which isn t necessarily a bad thing  And generally leading brands and importantly leading SKUs are benefiting from that because there is greater shelf clarity So we haven t seen a reduction in overall shelf space for the category leads to a reduction in sales or a reduction in market share It would be our expectation that among compaction  perhaps or after compaction perhaps distribution is about neutral versus what it is today  because all we re trying to do is convert the category  We re not using that as an opportunity to build distribution  We re really leveling the playing field with compaction  Margin impact on compaction  obviously is positive  What we ve commented on in the past  is that the last time we compacted  it was a 500 basis point margin improvement to the business  We d expect this one to be somewhat lower  but still meaningful to the business  So feeling good about compaction and feeling that this initiative is on track Also want to point in Laundry to fabric sanitizers which we re launching now and is off to a good start and that will be one of the initiatives that we re investing in quite significantly because it s a growing category that s become quite sizable and it s one  given the nature of the category  sanitization where we feel like the Clorox name has a strong equity with consumers and customers  for that matter  and we feel like our products can add meaningful value to that category and its momentum  So feel    feel good about the back half in Laundry and expect better results  Certainly not happy with the share losses and also the volume losses in Q2 Nik Modi    RBC    AnalystThank you  Very helpful OperatorNext question comes from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein Ali Dibadj    Bernstein    AnalystHi guys  I have a few  I would like first to just go back to Lauren s question  We ve seen Glad volatility based on commodities for a while  It just    it feels like the market share shifts have been a little bit more severe this time  particularly    I am tying bags and wraps specifically  sorry  particularly given the fact that you changed your portfolio on bags and wraps and gotten out of the kind of lower end stuff for the past few years  And so I struggle with Reynolds hasn t changed the dynamic of the industry  that margin dynamic for you that much  particularly because you guys will remember but I think a lot of people don t remember this when PakTech was public  it s not like things were easier  In fact  it sounds like they are harder than they were in the past few years  So I just want to go back to that question and really get a sense of whether you really think there is no impact or is even better that a big competitor is now public and and I d say that in the context of a category that just doesn t grow  so to grow your top line  you basically have to go to some market share Benno Dorer    Chair and Chief Executive OfficerYes  on profit  So all I d say is that I don t want to speculate at this point and what    all I did say is that for a publicly traded company buying growth and buying market share  it doesn t necessarily work  because the margins and profit growth matters  too  So we ll see how it all plays out  You and I have followed this category for a long time obviously  I don t remember it being easier or more difficult when PakTech was public  The reality is this is a very competitive category  there is no question  And we have lost some market share but if I unpack that a little bit  the market shares are mostly because of post pricing distribution losses  So it s our own doing and what I ve commented on in the past is that we have taken into account a very conscious trade off between short term and long term If you then look at where the distribution losses occur though and also the share losses occur  they are mainly in the less profitable base trash segment  as you know and also in food storage  As you know  we re very focused on trash  If I look at the indoor premium trash bag  which is the heart of our business and also the largest sub segment in trash and as you can imagine  one of the more profitable parts of the business  that part actually grew in Q2 So there is puts and takes on Glad  clearly we re taking a more cautious approach  Clearly  we are in a mode of defending this business and not everything is rosy while we re seeing green shoots  But what I d say is that we have confidence in our right to win in this category  The right to win in this category does not change and we re investing behind it which expresses our confidence going forward Ali Dibadj    Bernstein    AnalystNo  helpful context  I do want to go back to    you mentioned long term and short term and just ended on investments  You guys over the    over a while have looked at things like charcoal strategically and Brita strategically and other than I m sure you re not going to name strategically  I m sure Glad is in there as well  I guess if you take a step back  Why do you own Glad strategically Benno Dorer    Chair and Chief Executive OfficerFirst of all  I can t confirm that we ve looked at certain businesses that you ve mentioned Ali Dibadj    Bernstein    AnalystUnderstood  I get it Benno Dorer    Chair and Chief Executive OfficerSo  that would be speculation on your end  And I hope you can tolerate me saying that  Why do we own Glad  Why do we own Glad strategically is  first of all  it s very aligned with our capabilities  first of all  Second  over the long term it s added an enormous amount of shareholder value  So obviously we want each of the businesses that we own to add shareholder value in the long term  That does mean that every now and then there is a business that struggles in the short term  And you know whether that was Brita a year or two ago  which is now one of our strongest performing businesses or litter and charcoal certainly falls into that camp right now as well  That does happen in a highly diversified portfolio  So while we always look at whether and how we can be the highest value owner of our business  we like this business  we re confident in our plans forward and it s a very solid fit with our capabilities on multiple fronts Ali Dibadj    Bernstein    AnalystOkay  OK  And then last question maybe for Kevin on the gross margin drivers  If you look at kind of a net price  so price change and then subtract out the trade spend that you mentioned in the footnote went negative 60  negative 10 and really if you go back it was positive positive in  19 then negative 60  negative 10 for Q1  Q2  Well  maybe it was on  I think  Wendy s question earlier but like  what should we expect the gross margin impact of net pricing to be as we go forward Kevin Jacobsen    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerDefinitely  there is a pretty big inflection point that will start in Q3 as I m sure you ll recall most of the pricing we took last year was front loaded  And so it s driven very nice benefits to margin  You ll see a pretty material change starting in Q3  So if you think about the front half of this year  pricing generate about 110 benefit to gross margin  I expect in the back half of the year  you ll see that closer to 20  25 benefit as we now cycle through it  And so what I expect to see going forward is a smaller benefit from pricing  a little bit of International still to go  and then you ll have the impact of trade spending as we ve talked about some increased competitive activity that we ll address with increased trade spending and so trade spending will outpace the benefit from pricing as we think about the back half of the year Ali Dibadj    Bernstein    AnalystGot it  So it s like a negative 90 basis point we saw from higher trade promotion spend in that footnote number four will be even higher than 90 as the price changes will be closer to 20 to 25 Kevin Jacobsen    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I think in terms of the net benefit just because you will see less benefit from pricing  you ll see ongoing trade investment Ali Dibadj    Bernstein    AnalystGot it  OK  Thank you very much  Thanks again Kevin Jacobsen    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Ali OperatorNext question comes from Kaumil Gajrawala with Credit Suisse Kaumil Gajrawala    Credit Suisse     AnalystThank you  everybody  Benno  you mentioned that you re now happy with inventory levels  Can you give a little more context on the impact that decreasing inventory levels had on your top line over the past couple of quarters Kevin Jacobsen    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Kaumil  Hey  this is Kevin  I can address that one  And I would say we feel very good about the progress we re making on inventory  In fact  if you    if you saw in our prepared remarks  we had very nice growth in cash provided by operations over the first six months was up 11   That s primarily driven by some really good work we re doing on improvements in working capital and specifically  inventory  And I would highlight a number of areas  The first is on our Nutranext acquisition  We ve owned that business a little less than two years  And I think we continue to get better understanding the demand signal and managing inventory to meet demand  so we ve got more efficient on that business over time  The other two I d point to is on Brita  If you recall  we ve moved our supply chain  We re just finishing up moving our supply chain out of China to the Dominican Republic  We started to do that work because of the tariffs that were imposed  But we ve built up some additional safety stock inventory to manage that transition  which we re mostly through now And beyond doing the safety stock system  we also now have moved production much closer to the market and to allow us to keep less inventory going forward And then the last item I d point to is  we ve done some nice work in our Glad business  You know  as we recapitalize that client based on our new technology  if you recall  ForceFlex came off patent  a while back  We ve introduced our new patent protected technology and we ve invested manufacturing assets behind that technology and we brought some more in line recently that s allowed us to reduce overall inventory levels on Glad and has been very nice benefit that should continue  And so good work to date  What I d also tell you though is  as we look forward and Benno made this comment earlier  we do understand the Coronavirus is something we re thoughtful about  we ll see how that plays out with retailers  but we are taking up inventory levels to be prepared for the potential increase in demand for some of our bleach products  And so that s something you ll see in the back half of the year Kaumil Gajrawala    Credit Suisse     AnalystOkay  got it  And then you also mentioned in your    in the press release on cleaning some unfavorable mix effect from channel shift  Can you just talk a little bit about what you re talking about there  Is this product specific  Is it margin specific  What exactly is the difference there Benno Dorer    Chair and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Pretty simple  Kaumil  Thanks for allowing us to clarify  So there is some non tracked channels where the net sales for volume sold is lower  Right  So think about Klub  typically where products are sold at a discount  That shows up as a drag at the sales or at least in the volume to sales ratio and that s happened in cleaning  where we see certain parts of our portfolio in part of the non tracked channel perform particularly well Kaumil Gajrawala    Credit Suisse     AnalystGot it  Thank you OperatorNext question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs Jason English    Goldman Sachs    AnalystExcellent  Thank you guys for squeezing me in and I appreciate it  Two questions from me  First  a pretty simple one on compaction  You start shipping this quarter  should we expect a nice pipeline fill given the shelf holding capacity should accommodate many more bottles with the smaller size Benno Dorer    Chair and Chief Executive OfficerNot really  I don t think it s going to be very material  Jason Jason English    Goldman Sachs    AnalystOkay  like I said  that was a quick and easy one  Now stepping back  you ve mentioned a few times the    the broad based distribution losses that you ve suffered in the wake of the price increases  I step back and I rewind the clock to the time where you were taking these prices and you were very pleased then and you were very confident then like you are now in the strength of the relationships with the retailers and I think I remember you saying that cop the top  Phonetic   the conversations are strong  the message is one of support for you  Yeah in the wake  we ve seen a lot of negative ramifications for those actions  So what changed  Where    what did you sort of misjudge in that  that caused that derailment  And since all that s happened  what steps have you taken to kind of go the other way in mending those relationships and strengthen them to the point where you now have this resonating confidence in your ability to recover the distribution and drive the sharp inflection in the back half Benno Dorer    Chair and Chief Executive OfficerYes  if I rewind and what really happened was that  first of all  right after we took pricing  our consumption was very strong  as you will remember  That was prior to distribution losses but what we said then is that we expect significant bumpiness and a significant bumpiness would show up  for example in distribution losses and in merchandising losses  So that s exactly what happens and as a result  I don t really see any change  So you don t find me any more or less confident on this than I was six months ago or 18 months ago  The reality is that we are playing a long game here  We are protecting our ability to grow margins in the face of cost adversity with an eye on the long term and retailers understand that  but retailers certainly also didn t consistently like that as we had anticipated  Where the case is perhaps like on Glad that where it was more pronounced than we had anticipated  I would absolutely say that that s true in parts  because as we ve duly noted  like so many institutions and companies  we didn t necessarily get the resin forecast right  Right So if I look back  I would have liked to get more accuracy into our resin forecast because maybe our plan forward then would have been different and maybe distribution losses  if I speculate for a second  would have been more benign  But by and large  this is playing out exactly as we anticipated then  We ve always said that we re after good growth and good growth is profitable and sustainable and responsible and we don t like the distribution and the share losses either  at the same time  we do like our margin enhancements  which allows us to invest in the momentum of our brands in the back half and that s what we re focused on Jason English    Goldman Sachs    AnalystOkay  thank you  I ll pass it on Lisah Burhan    Vice President  Investor RelationsWe will take one more question after this OperatorAnd we have a question from Kevin Grundy with Jefferies  Please go ahead Kevin Grundy    Jefferies    AnalystHey  Hello  everyone  Thanks for squeezing me in  Two quick ones for me because we ve covered a lot of ground  Benno  I just want to make sure I m clear on the messaging with respect to the adequacy of the investment levels in your guidance for this year  So it sounds like the additional investment behind price and trade investment in advertising and marketing will position the company well to get back to its normal type of algorithm back half of this year and into next year  So both top line and from an earnings perspective as best we know sort of steady state commodities  if you could confirm that  I m just trying to handicap the risk that this is a multiyear necessity for higher investment levels  so maybe you could just comment on that  And then quickly on M A  given some of the challenges in some of your bigger businesses  are you any less inclined near term on the M A front  given the potential distraction and integration risk  Thank you Benno Dorer    Chair and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I ll take M A and then Kevin is going to take your good question on advertising sales force levels  Not anymore or less inclined to do M A  than we always are  As we always comment  we look at many things throughout the year  certainly continue to find desired valuations to be on the higher side and we ll continue to be disciplined  What we have said in the past is that our priority is to have a healthy core  So our focus right now is on just that and we like the progress  Said that  for a good acquisition that is on strategy and where we feel like we can add clear value to a business  we remain open  so that there is no change to what we ve talked about during our Investor Day in October Kevin Jacobsen    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerAnd Kevin  on your question about investment levels  I will make a couple of comments  First is  I m sure you can appreciate  I won t provide any outlook for fiscal year  21  We ll come back and do that at a later date  But what I would say is  as Benno mentioned  we do believe 10  about is the right investment level  sometimes a little bit more  sometimes a little bit less  but feel like that s the right level of investment long term  And we are working to get back to our IGNITE financial goals that we set back in October  if you recall  2  to 4  top line growth  We believe  we re taking the right actions to get back to those levels in the back half of the year and that certainly what we care about is that momentum going into fiscal year  21  that we get back to growing the top line  And since they are the long term goals  we re expanding margins  and we feel pretty good about our ability to do that Kevin Grundy    Jefferies    AnalystOkay  thank you  Good luck Benno Dorer    Chair and Chief Executive OfficerYes  thank you  Kevin OperatorThis concludes the question and answer session  Mr  Dorer  I would now like to turn the program over to you Benno Dorer    Chair and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Thank you all and all that s left is to say is that I look forward to talking with you again in May when we discuss our Q3 results  Thank you and have a

118251,339766,CLX,Clorox Earnings  3 Things to Watch,news,"Shareholders of Clorox  NYSE CLX  completely missed the stock market rally of 2019  with shares edging lower on the year compared with a 29  surge in the S P 500  That slump came courtesy of weak operating results  with sales declining even as the consumer staples giant notched financial wins in profitability and cash flow 
That mixed performance means investors will be watching for signs that Clorox s new rebound plan is delivering the turnaround that management predicted  Below  we ll look at a few of the metrics that might describe the shifting trend for this popular income investment  Here s what to watch when Clorox reports fiscal 2020 second quarter earnings on Tuesday  Feb  4 

1  Rebound trends
The clear takeaway from recent earnings reports is that Clorox is struggling to grow its broader portfolio  despite some bright spots among key franchises  The bags and wraps division has been the biggest challenge  with falling demand for Glad trash bags  baggies  and containers diving 14  in Q1 of fiscal 2020 following an 11  drop in the previous quarter  That decline ensured that Clorox s wider organic sales fell 2  in the fiscal first quarter despite a modest increase in its international segment 
CEO Benno Dorer and his executive team weren t surprised by the pullback  they predicted as much in their initial fiscal 2020 outlook  But to meet that forecast  Clorox will need to show improving growth results in the second half of the year  That means investors will be looking for better organic sales and for improving trends in the bags and wraps segment 
2  The finances
Clorox s rebound plan also calls for improving financial strength this year  The good news is that shareholders have more concrete support to go by in this department  Gross profit margin inched higher in fiscal 2019  and cost cuts helped preserve that momentum into early 2020  The company s cash generating abilities were clear  too  with net operating cash rising to  271 million from  259 million a year ago 
The consumer staples company will need more wins in both the cash flow and profit margin metrics this year in order to continue funding its growth initiatives while still returning cash to shareholders through dividend payments and stock buybacks  Look for management to put particular emphasis on efficiency if sales trends remain slow 
3  The big question
Clorox s first quarter report showed a 4  sales decline that called into question management s wider forecast of roughly flat revenue in 2020  Executives said at the time that they were confident that operating trends would improve over the next nine months  especially toward the end of the fiscal year 
On Tuesday  that optimistic forecast will be tested by Clorox s actual demand trends over the last few months  The stock s slump since early 2019 suggests investors have low expectations of a sales rebound this year  Still  a downgrade to the outlook could send shares lower if it suggests that management doesn t have the right rebound strategy to push the business back toward Clorox s long term growth targets of 3  in the context of a steadily rising operating margin ",2020-02-01,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pptt4,2073740

118309,339824,CLX,From Unilever to Ford  companies in Venezuela cling on by cutting products,news,"By Corina Pons and Tibisay Romero CARACAS VALENCIA  Venezuela  Reuters    Unilever s factory in the outskirts of the northern Venezuelan city of Valencia once bustled with activity as it produced everything from soap to toothpaste for one of South America s wealthiest economies   Now  with Venezuela struggling with a fifth year of recession and its economy wracked by hyperinflation  there are few signs of activity  A handful of workers loiter inside the compound with only the occasional truck passing through its gates   The Anglo Dutch conglomerate has quietly scaled back its output in the crisis stricken oil producing nation to a single product   Tio Rico ice cream   produced in Valencia and at another plant in Barquisimeto  some 90 miles  145 km  to the west  Production of Tio Rico ice cream halted at another factory in the sweltering city of Maracaibo in western Venezuela over a year ago   Until last year  we were producing 800 containers of 1 000 liters of ice cream per month   said one worker at the Valencia plant  who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to speak to the media   Now  we re sending out 40 per month   Slashing product portfolios has allowed the handful of multinationals that remain in Venezuela to survive shrinking demand and could pave the way for some to make an exit  according to a dozen advisors to large companies    Unilever  Plc  L ULVR  said it was staying in Venezuela and was focused on strengthening its ice cream unit  A spokesman for the company said its  production is in line with market demand   But the gradual exodus of companies  from cleaning products firm  Clorox Co   N CLX  to cereal maker Kellogg Co  N K   along with diminishing hope for political change  has led to speculation among company advisors that more will follow suit  That is true more than ever after President Nicolas Maduro announced this month higher corporate taxes and a 60 fold minimum wage increase  advisors say  On Monday  workers protested at the Venezuelan unit of tire maker Pirelli after they arrived to find the factory gates locked  It was not immediately clear if the plant was temporarily shut or closing for good    Transnational companies are not putting new money into Venezuela  And if they stay  it is because they found a financial balance to sustain themselves   said Luis Vicente Leon a well known pollster  economist and business adviser    But if this balance is severely disrupted  you will most likely see more companies leaving this market    SIGNIFICANT DECREASE  Some multinationals have stopped selling some of their best known products due to currency controls that left them struggling to import

July to a single model  one of its sport utility vehicles  said union leader Eliecer Cohen  Ford said in a statement it had no plans to leave Venezuela  but acknowledged that it had  faced a

sanitary napkins and Q tips  according to a union representative who asked not be identified   Johnson   Johnson did not respond to a request for comment  Companies have provided less advance notice about plans to shut down Venezuela operations  in part to minimize potential government blowback  according to business leaders and consultants interviewed by Reuters  When Clorox Co  N CLX  and

the job  With Venezuela s economy in shambles  Ford has furloughed Nunez and 1200 colleagues at its moribund plant here in Valencia  Venezuela s third largest city  The company said it wants to call

25 000 units in 2007 but only about 150 this year  About 60 percent of workers stay home  earning a fraction of their salaries  The rest come in but are confined to maintenance and administrative activities  employees and union leaders said  Despite the tough conditions  Fiat Chrysler has told employees it does not plan to close  said Henry Ospina of the Fiat Chrysler union    But there is anxiety   he said  A Fiat Chrysler spokesman said the company was making  its best efforts to keep production at levels adequate to the availability of inputs and components   The company declined further comment   PSEUDO EMPLOYEES   FREE FOOD  Though many multinational workers said they feel like  pseudo employees   they fare better than most unemployed Venezuelans  who struggle to buy food and medicine  Payments from state welfare programs lag the triple digit inflation  As of April 2016  half of Venezuela s working population was either jobless or employed only in part time   informal  jobs  like street vending  according to the last available official statistics   Compounding the pain  consumer spending slumped by 15 percent last year and is expected to decline by yet another 25 percent this year  according to local consulting group Ecoanalitica   Venezuelan businesses are enduring their worst moment in decades  with at least two in every 10 factories halted  according to a Conindustria  the country s main industry association  President Nicolas Maduro s government defends policies  like widely criticized currency controls  that many businesses say wrecked the economy  He blames the halving of international oil prices since 2014  which slashed Venezuela s revenues   Maduro also accuses foreign firms of intentionally limiting investment and production as part of an  economic war  waged by political opponents and the United States  The Information Ministry did not respond to a request for comment  At some multinationals  furloughed employees are still allowed to eat lunch at cafeterias of halted plants   a big perk at a time of increasing hunger   Fiat Chrysler serves up staples like chicken  rice  pasta and plantains daily to 60 of its 800 workers  A schedule prioritizes the neediest  Similar arrangements exist at Colgate Palmolive and Johnson   Johnson   It s one meal I don t have to pay for at home   said Pedro Rodriguez  44  who has worked just six days this year at Fiat Chrysler  his employer of two decades   There are colleagues who only eat half the meals and take the other half home because the situation is tough   TIRES AS SEVERANCE To get around strict layoff rules  many multinationals have offered voluntary buyouts      Ford launched a  voluntary separation program  in 2016 that about 800 employees  or 40 percent of its workforce  signed onto  Many use the severance payments to start businesses like bakeries or selling construction materials  workers said   But many of these ventures are now struggling  too  At Fiat Chrysler  a severance offer included four new tires  each of which is worth the equivalent of a monthly factory wage in Venezuela  As of August  23 workers had accepted  some planned to sell their tires and use the proceeds to emigrate   Elsewhere in Valencia  multinationals have struggled to adapt to other government rules  including strict price controls for some products like milk and soap  The prices rarely keep up with inflation   For instance  a Colgate Palmolive  N CL  soap plant has been shut since February  Workers there said company officials told them it could not cover costs if it sold soap at the mandated price  equal to less than  0 01 per soap bar at the black market exchange rate   Colgate Palmolive in Venezuela did not respond to requests for comment   Workers said Colgate recently restarted production of price controlled toothpaste  packaged in brown cardboard  The recycled boxes are cheaper than its usual red packaging   Earlier  it stopped producing children s flavors and toothpaste with whitener  reducing its portfolio of 300 products to less than a dozen  said union representative Felix Bello      Johnson   Johnson  which once sold everything from mouthwash to moisturizers  now only produces panty liners  a feminine hygiene product      Still  the U S  drugmaker agreed not to lay off any of its 157 Venezuelan factory employees   Only three of the factory s seven production lines are in operation  said union representative Jaime Guevara  Workers not on the production line do maintenance work

118341,339856,CLX,Many Catalysts Can Wreck The QE Inspired Bubble,opinion,"Does the stock market care about the after tax profits generated by corporations  Not in the era of Federal Reserve QE  a k a   quantitative easing    balance sheet expansion  or  electronic money printing   
Over the last five years  stock prices for the S P 500 have gained more than 50   Meanwhile  after tax profits at non financial companies have actually declined in the period  Is that sustainable 







Credit the Fed for its QE inspired wealth effect 
Some believe that the Fed stopped QE when they halted purchases with the creation of new electronic credits at the end of October 2014  However  a more nuanced explanation is that the Fed maintained QE levels above  4 trillion straight through the start of 2018  Maintaining an elevated balance sheet with the aid of trillions of reinvested dollar credits is still QE 
There was a small amount of tapering in 2017  Yet that was offset by corporate tax reform stimulus  In 2018  the Fed attempted to reduce its balance sheet in earnest  Then the S P 500 fell 19 9  in Q4 
What did the central bank of the U S  do to resurrect the wealth effect  It completely flip flopped on everything from interest rates to what it should do with its balance sheet 
Instead of raising rates four times in 2019  they slashed rates three times  And  not surprisingly  the Fed s  funny money  balance sheet has puffed back up to  4 1 trillion 







Without a doubt  the Fed s easy money liquidity has been the driver for 2019 s stock market recovery and subsequent record highs  Profits  Earnings per share  EPS  actually decreased in 2019 
Granted  there have been stretches in history when financial markets disregard profit trends  When it has happened  though  stock valuations became bubbly 
Objective measures for asset price valuations   price to earnings  P E   P E 10  market cap to GDP  price to sales  Q Ratio  regression to trend   have been pointing to extremely overvalued conditions for years  Circumstances may not be as fizzy as they were in the year 2000  though they are frothier than they were in 1929 and 2008 







The uninformed response to the data is that traditional valuations do not account for  ultra low  interest rates  On the other hand  one can easily debunk the myth that low interest rates alone justify extreme valuations 
Consider the fact that the U S  experienced a similar low interest rate regime for 20 years from 1935 1954  Traditional valuation metrics did not reach the extraordinary heights of 1929  2000  2008 or 2019 during the 20 year period from 1935 1954   See the chart above  
There s more 
Economic growth was far greater during the 1935 1954 period than it has been in this decade  Nevertheless  the ultra low rates in those years still did not derail bear markets from occurring in 1937 1938   49 1    1938 1939   23 3    1939 1942   40 4    or 1946 1947   23 2   







Investors need to see the current environment for what it is   a QE fueled wealth effect 
Think about it  How does the Fed hope to stimulate job growth and achieve stable inflationary targets  The members of its voting committee look to push up asset prices to make consumers and businesses feel wealthier and  subsequently  spend money 
Businesses did some spending  of course  Yet less had been allocated to human resources and capital expenditures than to stock buybacks  Now those corporations have some of the worst debt ratios in their history 







Consumers have been the true saviors  They still have jobs  so they keep on spending 
Still  the signs that consumers may spend less are evident  Job growth is waning  year over year retail sales are slowing and expectations about the economic future are falling  In fact  the gap between present circumstances and future expectations is worse than it was in 2008 and nearly as bad as it was in 2000 







If the economy stagnates  or if the bond market sniffs out ongoing weakness  the Fed will continue to increase its balance sheet and cut overnight lending rates even more  Voting members have no other plan 
Many wonder what the catalyst for a wealth effect reversal might be  Yet a catalyst may not be easily identifiable  and it may not be singular 
Keep in mind  there is no agreed upon catalyst for the bursting of 2000 s tech bubble  The Fed was too loose with policy in the late 1990s  Then hiked rates too far  Then cut too slowly  That s part of the story 
It follows that a combination of factors can come together to produce a rapid unwinding  Here are a handful of potential contributors  in no particular order  
1  Fed Policy Error  Asset prices may fall because the markets become dissatisfied with the pace of QE or the amount of QE or any other aspect of policy  e g   rates  forward guidance  inadequacy of a new tool  etc   
2  Market Uneasiness Over Unsustainable Borrowing Cost Path  Clear across the world  inflation adjusted interest rates are negative  That which led to over borrowing could serve as a direct or indirect catalyst  particularly as it relates to the possibility of a fallout from a downgrading of BBB rated corporates and or a crisis in the leveraged loan arena 







3  Fewer and Fewer Share Buybacks  Corporations borrowed by the boat load to shovel the money back into their stock shares  That support is already slowing  with share buybacks 30  lower in 2019 than in 2018 
4  Complete Loss of Faith in Global Trade  The global manufacturing recession may become contagious  Tariff removal and trade deals may come along too late  or never amount to anything meaningful  Four consecutive ISM readings below 50 raises the risk of a pile up in layoffs 







5  A 4 1  U 2 Unemployment Rate   Are you nuts  Gary  4 1  is remarkably low in the history of this country   That may be true  yet it also represents a 0 5  rise above the cyclical low of 3 6   Every recession since 1970 occurred when the three month average unemployment rate rose at least 0 5  from its 12 month low 
None of the aforementioned contributors have occurred  yet  Any or all of them could occur in 2020 
One of the ways that an investor can still participate in market upside with less fear about a bearish wipe out is with a  Defined Outcome ETF   For example  December s incarnation of the Innovator S P 500 Power Buffer ETF  PDEC  seeks to track the return of the S P 500 Price Return Index up to 8 92   12 04 19  at a price of 26 33  while buffering investors against 14 56  of losses through 11 30 2020 
Income oriented investors may be more inclined to stick with dividend aristocrats that have raised their dividends for 40 plus years  Talk about reliability through thin and thick

118342,339857,CLX,Clorox Stock Can Lose 25  If A Recession Hits In 2020,opinion,"As a consumer products manufacturer  Clorox Co    NYSE CLX  is one of the so called  defensive  companies  whose sales are generally not dependent on the state of the economy  However  this doesn t mean Clorox stock cannot fall during a general market decline or a recession 






For instance  it lost 57  in the 1999 2000 rout and over 34  during the Great Recession  And while Clorox stock is up 230  since March 2009  numerous recession indicators flashed red in 2019  Can investors expect a decline in 2020  Let s see what the  has to say on the subject 
The weekly chart above reveals that Clorox s uptrend from the bottom at  28 38 in December 2000 is a five wave   It is labeled  1   2   3   4   5   where the sub waves of  1  and  3  are visible  as well  The guideline of alternation has also been taken into account  Wave  2  was a sharp decline  while wave  4    a

Clorox stock went practically nowhere in 2019 and if this count is correct  we re not optimistic about 2020 either  Corrections typically erase all of the fifth wave s progress  Here  this means the bears can drag the price down to the  of wave  4  near  110 a share  Besides  Clorox is a no growth company trading at a high growth P E multiple of 24  Unless  it is different this time   the stock can lose a quarter of its market value over the next year or two ",2019-12-06,EWM Interactive,https://www.investing.com/analysis/clorox-stock-can-lose-25-if-a-recession-hits-in-2020-200490610,200490610
118343,339858,CLX,Earnings Preview  Clorox  CLX  Q2 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Clorox  CLX  reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 4  2020  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This consumer products maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 31 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  6 4  
Revenues are expected to be  1 43 billion  down 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 52  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Clorox 
For Clorox  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 86  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Clorox will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Clorox would post earnings of  1 54 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 59  delivering a surprise of  3 25  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Clorox doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-01-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-clorox-clx-q2-earnings-expected-to-decline-200502315,200502315

While Clorox has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Clorox was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

118378,339893,CLX,Clorox  CLX  Up 1 3  Since Last Earnings Report  Can It Continue ,opinion,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Clorox  CLX   Shares have added about 1 3  in that time frame  outperforming the S P 500 
Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is Clorox due for a pullback  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers  Clorox Q4 Earnings Top Estimates  Soft View Clorox reported mixed fourth quarter fiscal 2019 results  wherein earnings beat estimates while sales lagged the same  Further  the company provided a soft view for fiscal 2020  based on continued headwinds in Charcoal  Bags and Wraps businesses Quarterly earnings from continuing operations of  1 88 per share grew 13  year over year and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 85  The bottom line improvement was mainly backed by lower tax rate  stemming from the U S  Tax Reform and higher gross margin  partly negated by soft sales and increased expenses for advertising and sales promotion Net sales of  1 627 million declined 4  year over year and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 691 million  The soft top line result was caused by lower volume and unfavorable currency rates  particularly in Argentina  This was partially offset by gains from price increases  net of trade spending  Soft volume and currency headwinds hurt sales by 3 and 2 percentage points  respectively Gaining from recent price increases and cost savings  Clorox witnessed gross margin expansion of 110 bps to 45 1  in the fiscal fourth quarter  However  the aforementioned gains were partly negated by elevated trade spending  and manufacturing and logistics expenses Segmental DiscussionSales of the Cleaning segment rose 3  to  530 million  driven by robust performance across all businesses  The Professional Products business registered double digit sales growth  backed by continued innovation  The Home Care business benefited from robust shipments of Clorox disinfecting wipes The Household segment s sales declined 11  to  546 million mainly due to a fall in Charcoal  and Bags and Wraps businesses  Bags and Wraps sales were impacted by larger price gaps compared with the year ago quarter as well as distribution losses  Further  the Charcoal business delivered soft sales on distribution losses and lower merchandising activity Sales at the Lifestyle segment were flat with the year ago period at  312 million  Sales gains mainly reflected strong shipments of Brut s Bees products  with continued momentum in core Lip Care and Face Care categories  These gains were backed by product innovation  Further  strength in Nutranext dietary supplement brands aided segmental sales  However  these gains were negated by lower sales in Brita At the International segment  sales dropped 4  to  239 million as gains from price increases and higher shipments across many regions were more than offset by 15 points of negative impact of unfavorable currency FinancialsClorox ended fiscal 2019 with cash and cash equivalents of  111 million  and long term debt of  2 287 million  In fiscal 2019  the company generated  992 million of net cash from continuing operations Fiscal 2020 GuidanceAfter witnessing continued softness in Charcoal  and Bags and Wraps categories in the fiscal fourth quarter  Clorox outlined cautious guidance for fiscal 2020  The company projects sales to be flat to up 2  in fiscal 2020  driven by gains from continued innovation  offset by currency headwinds With regard to Charcoal  and Bags and Wraps businesses  the company expects to lay down stronger business plans throughout the year  These efforts are likely to bring these categories back on growth path in the second half of fiscal 2020  Consequently  the company projects sales in the first half of fiscal 2020 to be at the low end of the range provided for the fiscal year  Further  sales are expected to decline in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 as the company works to restore growth in the aforementioned categories Nevertheless  sales for the second half of fiscal 2020 are anticipated to be at the higher end of the range provided for the fiscal year  as these two businesses are likely to return to growth during this period Gross margin is estimated to be flat to slightly down in fiscal 2020  The company expects nearly flat gross margin for the fiscal year  excluding investments made on two strategic initiatives that should generate long term value  This will include the rollout of compaction of Clorox liquid bleach in the second half of fiscal 2020 Advertising and sales promotion spending is anticipated to be roughly 10  of sales  Selling and administrative expenses are projected to be nearly 14  of sales  The company envisions effective tax rate of 22 23  for fiscal 2020 Consequently  for fiscal 2020  management anticipates earnings per share of  6 30  6 50 from continuing operations  Notably  the company expects earnings to be more muted in the first half compared with the second half as it continues to work toward returning Charcoal  Bags and Wraps businesses to growth

118379,339894,CLX,Clorox  CLX  Declines Post Soft FY20 View  Is This Temporary ,opinion,"Shares of The Clorox Company   NYSE CLX   have displayed a dismal run since reporting soft top line results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 on Aug 1 and providing a dull outlook for fiscal 2020  Most of the softness in the company s top line was due to the ongoing headwinds in the Charcoal  and Bags and Wraps businesses  The headwinds not only dented its sales in the last three quarters but also formed the basis of its soft outlook for fiscal 2020 Clearly  the Clorox stock has declined 0 4  since its earnings release  lagging the  s growth of 4 9   Additionally  headwinds in the aforementioned businesses have led to sluggish stock performance in the year to date period  Notably  this Zacks Rank  Hold  company has gained 5 1  year to date while the industry has grown 26 1  
 

The company has been witnessing operational headwinds in the Charcoal  and Bags and Wraps businesses  which are hurting the top line of the Household segment as well as the overall company  Notably  sales for the Bags and Wraps business continued to be hurt by larger price gaps as well as distribution losses  Further  the Charcoal category delivered soft sales on distribution losses and lower merchandising activity Although Clorox registered gross margin expansion in the fiscal fourth quarter  growth was partly negated by elevated trade spending  and manufacturing and logistics expenses  Additionally  increased spending for advertising and sales promotion partly hurt pretax earnings of its Cleaning and Household segments Moreover  net sales for the fiscal fourth quarter included 2 percentage points of negative impacts of foreign currency mainly due to the devaluation of the Argentine peso  Unfavorable currency marred sales for the International segment  which dropped 4    including 15 points of negative impact of foreign currency  The company expects currency to remain a headwind in fiscal 2020 Soft Fiscal 2020 ViewBased on the continued softness in Charcoal  and Bags and Wraps categories  Clorox outlined cautious guidance for fiscal 2020  The company projects sales to be flat to up 2  in fiscal 2020  driven by gains from continued innovation  offset by currency headwinds  Driven by the likeliness that the Charcoal  and Bags and Wraps businesses will return to growth in the second half  the company projected sales in the first half of fiscal 2020 to be at the low end of the range provided for the fiscal year  Further  sales are expected to decline in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 as Clorox works to restore growth in the aforementioned categories Nevertheless  sales for the second half of fiscal 2020 are anticipated to be at the higher end of the range provided for the fiscal year  Meanwhile  management anticipates earnings per share of  6 30  6 50 from continuing operations for fiscal 2020  Notably  the company expects earnings to be more muted in the first half compared with the second half as it continues to work toward improving the performance of the aforementioned businesses In fiscal 2020  it expects gross margin to be flat to slightly down  Excluding investments made on two strategic initiatives that should generate long term value  gross margin is likely to be flat with the fiscal 2019 level  These investments will include the rollout of compaction of Clorox liquid bleach  beginning the second half of fiscal 2020  Further  the company expects advertising and sales promotion spending to be roughly 10  of sales  Selling and administrative expenses are projected to be nearly 14  of sales  driven by ongoing acquisition related investments and technology transformation investments to support long term growth and cost savings Long Term Growth Prospects IntactDespite the aforementioned headwinds  Clorox s sound fundamentals  growth efforts and robust earnings trend speak well of its long term prospects  It is working to turnaround the troubled Charcoal  and Bags and Wraps businesses by the second half of fiscal 2020  The company expects to lay down stronger business plans throughout fiscal 2020 to help achieve its target Further  Clorox s diversified brand portfolio positions it well ahead of peers to generate above average industry growth and sustain it in the currently challenging environment  The company remains committed to investing in product and brand differentiation to safeguard value proposition through the introduction of consumer driven innovations  It generated significant consumer value in fiscal 2019 through innovations like Hidden Valley Ready to Eat Dips  Brita Filtering Water Bottles  and several new Burt s Bees lip and face care products Its pricing and cost saving initiatives along with investments in innovations have been aiding gross margin and earnings growth in recent quarters  In fiscal 2019  it garnered more than  120 million in cost savings  marking the 12th consecutive year of generating more than  100 million in annual cost savings  Further  the company s cost based pricing strategy enabled it to address the inflationary environment that persisted for over three years  These cost saving and pricing actions should continue to support its investment in long term brand and category growth Moreover  the Go Lean Strategy enabled the International segment to deliver profits despite currency woes  Though sales for the segment declined year over year  the results reflected strength with gains from price increases and volume growth across many regions  Europe and China recorded double digit volume growth  driven by strong performance of Cat Litter and Burt s Bees  Further  in the fiscal fourth quarter  the Go Lean Strategy helped deliver six consecutive quarters of profit growth for the segment Wrapping UpThe above discussion clearly shows that Clorox has balanced risk reward  with long term growth efforts likely to offset near term hurdles  Further  the company s expected long term earnings growth rate of 5  and a  of A speak well of its

118380,339895,CLX,Analysts Estimate Clorox  CLX  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"The market expects Clorox  CLX  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on October 31  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This consumer products maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 54 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  4 9  
Revenues are expected to be  1 51 billion  down 3 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3 77  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Clorox 
For Clorox  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Clorox will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Clorox would post earnings of  1 85 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 88  delivering a surprise of  1 62  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Clorox doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-clorox-clx-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200477614,200477614

118390,339905,CLX,Clorox warns of safety concerns after Venezuelan takeover of plants ,news," Reuters    U S  cleaning products maker Clorox Co  N CLX  said the Venezuelan government s takeover of two of its plants after the company pulled out of the country raised  grave concerns  about the safety of workers and surrounding communities 
Venezuela announced on Friday the  temporary  takeover of the two plants owned by Clorox  which said it left the country because of difficult economic conditions 
After Clorox management s departure  many of the firm s 400 workers occupied two plants in the Valles del Tuy district south of Caracas and in central Carabobo district 
Clorox said the production of cleaning products  in particular bleach  was  a highly specialized and technical process   The company said it had safely secured the plants before its exit  including removing all the chlorine 
 The Venezuelan government s actions raise grave concerns  and Clorox and its affiliates cannot be responsible for the safety of workers and the surrounding communities or any liability or damages resulting from this occupation   Clorox said in a statement on Friday 
The Oakland  California based company added it was prepared to discuss with the government  prompt  adequate and effective compensation  for the takeover of the plants 
Venezuelan Vice President Jorge Arreaza visited the Valles del Tuy plant on Friday evening and said the facility would be reactivated  He gave no further details of the government s plans for the plants 
Clorox announced its exit on Monday  saying its business was not viable and that it would sell its assets 
It is the latest sign of dissatisfaction from private businesses with President Nicolas Maduro s running of the South American OPEC nation s economy 
Clorox said operating restrictions imposed by the government  economic uncertainty and supply disruptions would have led to considerable operating losses 
Its share price rose on the announcement  despite the company saying it expected to incur after tax exit costs of  60 million to  65 million  or 46 cents to 50 cents a share  in fiscal 2015 

Various multinationals  from Colgate Palmolive Co  N CL  to Avon Products Inc  N AVP   have been warning of hits to their balance sheets and are scaling back operations in Venezuela  citing Byzantine currency controls and a slowing economy

Unilever PLC has a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy   while Clorox has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold  right now  The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates  so investors should rest assured that UL has an improving earnings outlook  But this is only part of the picture for value investors 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics  These include the long favored P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company s fair value

partnerships with retail customers and evolving capabilities in both physical world and online  As a result  Clorox witnessed an improvement in digital capabilities leading to a strong performance in e commerce  which is now a significant revenue contributor  Notably  the company is ahead of its plan to achieve  500 million from e commerce sales by 2020 Clorox also has a diversified brand portfolio  which positions it well to deliver growth and sustain in the challenging macro landscape  The company s approach toward brand management allows each of its brands to develop further through rigorous research and development  marketing strategies  financial control and operating leverage  In addition  management is focused on making investments in demand building including digital marketing  e commerce and product innovation pipeline Furthermore  Clorox s price increases and cost savings are providing a boost to gross margin  However  the margin growth was somewhat hurt by elevated commodity  and manufacturing and logistics expenses  In fiscal 2019  management expects gross margin to remain flat as gains from higher prices and cost saving efforts are expected to be offset by increased costs and adverse foreign currency exchange rates Although Clorox continues to anticipate gross margin expansion in the second half of the fiscal year  it expects a muted growth due to the shift in supply chain spending toward the back half  Moreover  the company expects EBIT margin to decline on flat gross margin expectations  and plans to complete the Nutranext integration and invest strongly in advertising to support the strong back half innovation plans Nevertheless  gains from product innovations and buyouts are expected to drive Clorox s top and bottom lines  Management projects sales growth of 2 4  from the fiscal 2018 level  Innovations are likely to deliver about 3 percentage points of additional sales  The top line is also likely to reflect the combined positive effect of the Nutranext acquisition and the Aplicare divestiture to the tune of 3 percentage points  Also  fiscal 2019 earnings per share of  6 20  6 40 from continuing operations  includes nearly 8 12 cents benefit from the Nutranext acquisition  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal year is currently pegged at  6 33 Bottom LineAlthough issues related to higher costs and

The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits 
Currently  Unilever NV has a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy   while Clorox has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   Investors should feel comfortable knowing that UN likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than CLX has recently  But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in 
Value investors analyze a variety of traditional  tried and true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
UN currently has a forward P E ratio of 19 62  while CLX has a forward P E of 24 64  We also note that UN has a PEG ratio of 3 20  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  CLX currently has a PEG ratio of 3 87 
Another notable valuation metric for UN is its P B ratio of 6 56  The P B ratio is used to compare a stock s market value with its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  CLX has a P B of 26 95 
Based on these metrics and many more  UN holds a Value grade of B  while CLX has a Value grade of D

We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions  while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits 
Unilever PLC has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Clorox has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold  right now  This means that UL s earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive  so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook  But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in 
Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
UL currently has a forward P E ratio of 19 92  while CLX has a forward P E of 25 70  We also note that UL has a PEG ratio of 3 46  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  CLX currently has a PEG ratio of 3 98

These metrics  and several others  help UL earn a Value grade of B  while CLX has been given a Value grade of D

118488,340003,CLX,Clorox  CLX  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Clorox  CLX  reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 4  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This consumer products maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 32 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  7 3  
Revenues are expected to be  1 48 billion  up 4 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 01  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Clorox 
For Clorox  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 14  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Clorox will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Clorox would post earnings of  1 59 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 62  delivering a surprise of  1 89  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Clorox doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-27,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/clorox-clx-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200380102,200380102

118490,340005,CLX,UN Vs  CLX  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors looking for stocks in the Soap and Cleaning Materials sector might want to consider either Unilever  LON ULVR  NV  UN  or Clorox  CLX   But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks  Let s take a closer look 
Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities  but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank  The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits 
Currently  Unilever NV has a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy   while Clorox has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates  so investors should rest assured that UN has an improving earnings outlook  But this is only part of the picture for value investors 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics  These include the long favored P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company s fair value 
UN currently has a forward P E ratio of 19 15  while CLX has a forward P E of 23 48  We also note that UN has a PEG ratio of 3 12  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  CLX currently has a PEG ratio of 3 71 
Another notable valuation metric for UN is its P B ratio of 6 25  The P B ratio pits a stock s market value against its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  CLX has a P B of 27 98 
Based on these metrics and many more  UN holds a Value grade of B  while CLX has a Value grade of D 
UN is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook  which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model  And  based on the above valuation metrics  we feel that UN is likely the superior value option right now ",2019-01-31,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/un-vs-clx-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200382601,200382601

anticipated to improve 22 6  year over year on revenue growth of 8 4   In fourth quarter 2017  earnings and revenues rose 13 4  and 8 6   respectively A Look at Consumer StaplesThe performance of the index is determined by all 16 Zacks sectors  out of which 15 are expected to witness year over year earnings growth this season  The  sector being one of them is expected to record earnings growth of 6 8  and revenue increase of 3 1  The Consumer Staples sector is currently placed at the bottom 6   15 of 16  of all Zacks sectors  thanks to several bottlenecks  The sector has long been grappling with rising input costs as well as intense competition  This  in turn  has created significant pricing pressure  compelling companies to undertake aggressive promotional activities  Owing to such deterrents  the sector has lost 5 9  in a year  while the S P 500 market gained 11 7  Amid such challenges  companies operating in the segment have been trying to keep afloat through innovation  strategic buyouts and restructuring efforts in sync with a changing consumer landscape  Additionally  the recent tax cuts are expected to favor Consumer Staples companies Considering the diverse

PlacedMolson Coors Brewing Company   NYSE TAP   is expected to witness year over decline in revenues in first quarter 2018  owing to soft sales volumes in the United States  For the quarter under review  analysts polled by Zacks expect net sales of  2 436 million  down from  2 449 million in the year ago quarter  Also  input cost inflation is a concern as management expects input cost inflation in 2018 to be nearly  50 million greater than 2017  on account of aluminum and diesel fuel among other inputs  To top it  Molson Coors has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  and Earnings ESP of  0 21   which dim the possibility of an earnings beat  You can see  Nevertheless  the company is focused on strengthening its above premium category along with expanding its portfolio through innovation  It has also been undertaking several restructuring initiatives to reduce costs and boost profits  Given these factors  along with expected gains from tax reforms  Zacks analysts expect earnings in the quarter to grow 5 3  year over year to 80 cents  However  the estimate has gone down by 4 cents over the past 30 days   Read More   The Kraft Heinz Company   NASDAQ KHC   has been experiencing top

performance through savings initiatives  innovations and strategic investments to enhance brand performance  However  such efforts are less likely to reflect in the results this season  Further  owing

the improvement of categories and overall market share  In the light of such factors  analysts polled by Zacks expect quarterly revenues of  1 511 billion  up 2 3  from the year ago quarter However  Clorox witnessed significant pressure on gross margin in the fiscal second quarter  which is likely to continue  Margin was strained by escalated input costs for commodities and tightening of the transportation market  Also  results were hurt by strategic investments in growth and cost saving initiatives  which might continue to drive expenses and hurt profits  As a result  the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 30 for the quarter under review moved south by a penny over the last 30 days and reflects a decline of 0 8  year over year  Further  Clorox s Earnings ESP of  0 33  and a Zacks Rank  4

and Too Faced  to enhance its portfolio  It also boasts a strong online business and expects it to be a major growth catalyst in the years to come  Estee Lauder continues to focus on enhancing travel retail business  which has lately emerged as a major sales driver  Management stated that growth in this category is majorly fueled by continued investments in emerging markets  particularly Asia  along with double digit increase in five of its biggest brands in the travel retail network Buoyed by such factors  the company expects adjusted earnings per share in the range of  1 02  1 04 for the third quarter  which marks a considerable increase from the prior projection of 91 cents  On a constant currency basis  adjusted earnings are expected to improve 7 9   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at  1 07  Moreover  the company s Earnings ESP of  0 67  combined with a Zacks Rank  3 makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat this season   Further  analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of  3 234 million  up 13 2  from the prior year  Also  management forecasts sales growth of 12 13  in the third quarter However  management anticipates lower sales from North

118525,340040,CLX,Spirit Week  Sentiment Turns Positive After Care Package From China  Wal Mart,opinion," Thursday Market Open  After Wednesday s plunge  investors needed a little something to lift their spirits  They received two care packages early Thursday  one from China and the other from Walmart  NYSE WMT  
Solid earnings from the world s biggest retailer and word that a Chinese delegation is set to visit Washington later this month to talk trade might help fade the Turkey related fears that sank the market earlier in the week  Stocks rose sharply in pre market trading as good earnings seem to be overshadowing the Turkish situation at least for the moment 
Double Digit Jump For WMT Shares
WMT easily beat Wall Street analysts  earnings estimates and reported a 40  rise in online sales during the most recent quarter  The huge retailer s results might be another indication of a healthy U S  consumer  and shares leaped more than 10  before the opening bell 
WMT earned  1 29 a share in Q2  beating estimates by 8 cents  and revenue of  128 03 billion also topped forecasts  U S  same store sales rose 4 5   above forecasts for 2 3   The company also looked very impressive in raising earnings guidance for the full fiscal year to between  4 90 and  5 05  from previous guidance of  4 75 to  5 
After the disappointing sales results yesterday from Macy s  M   see more below   WMT s earnings could give investors new faith in the retail sector 
There was other positive news on the earnings front late Wednesday  when Cisco Systems  NASDAQ CSCO  beat Wall Street analysts  estimates and raised guidance  citing higher revenue from subscriptions in its software and services business  Shares were up more than 6  in pre market trading  CSCO has put up good results pretty consistently and did so again 
The retail earnings parade marches on after the close today when Nordstrom  NYSE JWN  reports  There s also scheduled to be another signal from the semiconductor industry this afternoon with results from NVIDIA  NASDAQ NVDA   Even though the industry has been on a tear these past few years  some analysts and investors are starting to question whether or not high growth rates can be maintained going forward  Perhaps NVDA s fresh results can shed additional light 
 Sell Off   No  Buyers Just Seemed To Stay Home
It s easy to glance at the recent market action with stocks dropping Wednesday for the fifth time in the last six days and call it a  sell off   That isn t necessarily accurate  however  Instead  what we might be witnessing is a retreat from buyers 
Though some of the traditional  defensive  market areas like Treasury notes and volatility are on the rise amid trade war  tariff and currency concerns  gold continues to track lower  This could mean the recent stock market action is less about aggressive selling and possibly more about a lack of buying  This isn t too surprising  if you step back  Wall Street is just below all time highs  and it looks like some investors might be waiting for things to level off before they get back in 
As for Turkey  it s not as if the situation has gone away just because it retreated into the background this morning  It s probably going to be like the European bank crisis we saw a few years ago  At first it s an everyday headline  then every week  then every month  But it doesn t necessarily vanish  Turkey is one of several places in the world where economic concern could rear its head at any time 
Staples Find A Bid
Some of the more  defensive  regions of the stock market like consumer staples and telecom generated interest Wednesday  One reason for staples doing better might be signs of improved pricing power for some companies in the industry  Look at Kimberly Clark  NYSE KMB   for instance  On Wednesday it announced it s raising prices for two popular consumer products Huggies and Kleenex by the mid to high single digits  Earlier this quarter  on its earnings call  Clorox  NYSE CLX  announced price increases for a few of its consumer products  and this week announced positive trial results for a sensitive skin product from its Burt s Bees subsidiary 
New products and pricing power can often be a formula for success  and shares of both CLX and KMB rose sharply Wednesday  They ve both talked about increasing prices and they re leading the way in a down market 
Another shiny spot on the consumer side is the restaurant industry  which seems to be rolling right along  Shares of Darden Restaurants  NYSE DRI  owner of Olive Garden and other chains nearly hit a 52 week high Wednesday  Improved restaurant sales played a large part in July s 0 5  rise in U S  retail sales reported Wednesday  Healthy consumers often mean more people going out to eat  something you probably don t need an economics degree to understand 
One more possible ray of sunshine despite recent losses is that the major indices mostly clawed back at the end of the day Wednesday to finish well off their lows  The S P 500 Index  SPX  fell 0 76   but once again bounced after nearing psychological support near the 2800 level  Some analysts have said a drop below that might generate additional selling pressure  but we ll have to wait and see if that happens 
On a negative note  July housing starts and building permits released early Thursday both came in below analysts  estimates 
The slumping crude market advanced a bit early Thursday but remains near two month lows  See Figure 1 below   U S  crude inventories rose 6 8 million barrels in the week leading up to Aug  10  compared with analysts  expectations for a decrease of 2 5 million barrels  Reuters reported  citing government data  Normally  this is a time of year when crude supplies tend to decline amid heavy use

Return Policy  Macy s  NYSE M  earnings yesterday and the market s response arguably could serve as another example of how some investors want more than results that simply  beat  Wall Street  Yes  M s earnings and revenue did surpass the average analyst expectation  and the stock initially inched up in pre market trading  However  by the time the market opened for the day s session  the stock was off 5   and by day s end it was down nearly 16   Why  Well  it seems some investors were unhappy that M once again had sales fall year over year 
This could be a good lesson for long term investors out there  With the market still near all time highs and earnings growing more than 20  on average for S P 500 companies in Q2  many investors seem to have a  what have you done for me lately   approach  and might be ready to punish a company s stock for stuff that shows up deeper down in an earnings report  That happened a lot earlier this year and it hasn t gone away  Looking specifically at M  we saw a company with falling year over year sales and lower margins in an environment where the average consumer appears to be quite healthy  That might be making some investors ask what s going on 
Tariff Impact  Depending on the ultimate size of the U S  tariffs against China  there could be small price increases for U S  consumers  a negative impact on U S  corporate profits  and a drop in China s GDP  the CME Group said in a research paper this week  It calculated that a 25  tariff on  200 billion of Chinese goods could cause U S  corporate profits to fall by 1 25  to 1 5   assuming impacts of the trade dispute were fully absorbed by lower profit margins  However  some of the costs would likely be passed along to consumers   Under a worst case scenario that a 25  tariff is applied to all Chinese goods  one could see a 0 3  rise in U S  CPI  consumer price index   a similar fall in corporate profits as a percentage of GDP  so about a 3 3  drop in overall corporate profits  and a 0 8  hit to Chinese GDP   the report noted   On the other hand  if one sticks to the Administration s original proposal of 10  tariffs on  34 billion of goods  then the impact of the trade dispute is negligible  
 64 Question  U S  crude oil futures are now down more than  10 from highs in the mid  70s a barrel back in the late spring  Prices spent part of Wednesday below  65 a barrel  Which sets up an interesting technical picture  The front month U S  crude contract hasn t been below  64 a barrel since early April  and has tested that mark a couple times since and bounced off  see Figure 1 above   Sometimes  though not always  a dive below such a support level can bring additional selling as longs abandon their positions  Another point to consider  The crude contract came within a hair of its 200 day moving average of around Wednesday  a level now near  65 and seen by some as a key technical point  Trade war fears  slumping stock markets  and a strong dollar have all helped combine to gang up on oil lately

Will there be a message from Jackson Hole  
Last Week Recap
In my last edition of WTWA I warned that there were many efforts to hijack the financial news agenda   and your ears and eyeballs along the way  In particular  I barely mentioned the Turkey non story  which I described as a headline lacking substance  Just as I suspected  Turkey was the focal point of every market blip   but only for a few hours  What would be the  contagion   intoned some newly created Turkey experts  who looked up a few facts in an almanac  I was prepared to write the entire summary  before I put  mute  back on  but Bill Kort did such a clever and humorous version  we should just read his post  He recounts the various media flashes and stories  Here is an example 

Contagion is a favorite word the media uses when brewing up a crisis in your mind  Yes  there could be other countries that could be swept up in the current frenzy over Turkey s finances  This  too  would not be the end of the world  Since this run in stocks began over 9 years ago  the S P 500 has almost quadrupled  there have been multiple potential contagion stories   Greece  2 or 3 times   the PIIGS  Portugal  Ireland  Italy  Greece and Spain  and Cyprus  CNBC even takes this into account in the headline for an August 13  post   What happens in Turkey won t stay in Turkey   Why this debt crisis could be different  They just won t let this story go  Here is another post from this AM    Charts of past currency crises show Turkey may have a lot more pain to face  

This is exactly why I warned people not to fall victim to those framing the news  Usually I focus on what to watch  Last week it was about what to ignore 
The Story in One Chart
I always start my personal review of the week by looking at a great chart  I especially like the version updated each week by Jill Mislinski  She includes a lot of valuable information in a single visual  The full post has even more charts and analysis  including commentary on volume  Check it out 

The market gained 0 59  on the week and is less than one percent from the all time highs  The chart reflects opening gaps from news events while US markets were closed  The range for the week was about 1 9   I summarize actual and implied volatility each week in our Indicator Snapshot section below  Volatility remains well below the long term range 
The News
Each week I break down events into good and bad  For our purposes   good  has two components  The news must be market friendly and better than expectations  I avoid using my personal preferences in evaluating news   and you should  too  
When relevant  I include expectations  E  and the prior reading  P  
The Good 

Mortgage delinquencies at multi decade lows  Bespoke  



Small Business Optimism as measured by the NFIB Index up ticked again to 107 9  Supply side economist Scott Grannis notes the crucial role business investment plays in moving economic growth to a higher level  While he does not mention my  delicate balance  terminology  he does acknowledge tariffs as a current but temporary roadblock  Instead of showing the entire index  let s look at the hiring plans component 



Initial jobless claims declined to 212K  although the four week moving average edged higher  Bespoke has several great charts and historical perspective  Here is a look at the non seasonally adjusted series  The most recent report was the lowest on record for this week of the year 



Retail sales increased 0 5   E 0 1  P 0 2  but revised down from 0 5  
Productivity increased 2 9   E 2 0  P 0 3  
Leading indicators from the Conference Board increased 0 6  E and P both 0 5    Jill Mislinski 


The Bad 

Industrial production increased only 0 1   E 0 4  P 1  revised up from 0 6   Capacity utilization continues to run at about 78   To the casual observer  this may seem just fine  I have not seen recent research  but typically I have associated this level with inflationary pressures  Something new for the research agenda 
Housing starts grew by only 1168K  SAAR   E 1256K P 1158K  Building permits were in line  Calculated Risk notes the second consecutive disappointment and the relative strength of the single family data  Bill still expects a continuing sideways move with a general increase over the next two or more years  His post has charts  links to key data  and his recent summaries  This is a great place to catch up if you are concerned about the housing market 



New Deal Democrat s regular weekly review of high frequency indicators remains positive overall but has turned negative for those in the long term forecast  This is the first such reading since 2009  but not enough to start a recession watch  he reports 
Michigan sentiment registered only 95 3 on the August preliminary reading  E 97 8 P 97 9  Jill Mislinski has charts and details 

The Ugly 
What about the chances for hacking the electrical grid  FiveThirtyEight describes the difficulties faced by hackers as well as the advances in current security measures 
The Week Ahead 
We would all like to know the direction of the market in advance  Good luck with that  Second best is planning what to look for and how to react 
The Calendar 
The calendar is even lighter than those of the last few weeks  Earnings season is ending  Many are on vacation  By mid week we can confidently expect a focus on Fed policy  Until then we must depend upon tweets and soap opera style news 
Briefing com has a good U S  economic calendar for the week  and many other good features which I monitor each day   Here are the main U S  releases 

Next Week s Theme 
The fact that there is little to talk about does not mean that there will be little talking  Weeks like this are a field day for the punditry  Stories that would not get published or appear on the air in most weeks are suddenly candidates for your eyeballs 
It is easiest to hijack the agenda when there is little competition  It is fruitless to guess what will claim attention during the first part of the week  but things will change beginning on Wednesday 
The FOMC minutes from the last meeting will be released  On Thursday the KC Fed will release the schedule for the annual Jackson Hole Symposium   speakers and titles  At the moment  we know only the general topics  which are so broad that they could be about anything  Friday morning will see the presentation by Fed Chairman Powell  While more will follow  market participants will start checking train schedules  as Art Cashin often says 
As the week wears on  the punditry will be asking 
Will there be a message from Jackson Hole  
The timing is clear  The implications are not  Expect some variant of the following and be prepared for some newly minted Fed experts 

The Fed has been too soft for too long 

It is now too late to catch up since high levels of inflation are now  baked in  
It is too late to catch up since the economy has weakened  The Fed  missed its chance to hike back when we pundits said they should 


The Fed will not be able to unwind the balance sheet 

No one wants to buy US bonds and trade wars increase the vulnerability 
Quantitative tightening will flood the market with unwanted paper 


The Fed is increasing rates too quickly  threatening economic growth and Administration policy successes 
The Fed  by not raising rates quickly enough  has no room to ease during the next recession   which might happen any day now 
The Fed will create a recession by inverting the yield curve  Haven t they followed all the news on this subject 
And of course  the all time favorites   in a box  painted into a corner  rock and hard place or some other variant 
While we may not be sure of the reasons  we can be pretty sure that this will all end badly 



I could publish a party bingo card based on this list  You will hear it all  And everyone will be interested in Powell s first Jackson Hole speech as Chairman 
I have some personal observations and an alternative approach in today s Final Thought  Feel free to join in with suggestions of more species of framers

Insight for Traders 
Check out our weekly Stock Exchange post  We combine links to important posts about trading  themes of current interest  and ideas from our trading models   This week I suggested a theme that WTWA readers should recognize  What happens when you are leaning the wrong way  It was a good question for traders  and we incorporated the expected expert commentary  Our ringleader and editor  Blue Harbinger  provided data about many funds that might be caught offside   Mrs  OldProf prefers the latter analogy   As always  we described a few of the current ideas from the models  Felix highlighted the Russell 2000 and Oscar ranked the high liquidity ETFs 
While the series emphasizes trading  investors might profit from a look  The methods reduce risk through diversity and  for most people  are appropriate for those needing a boost in returns in their IRA  This week s theme will soon be featured again on WTWA  this time with an investor emphasis 
Insight for Investors 
Investors should have a long term horizon  They can often exploit trading volatility 
Best of the Week 
If I had to pick a single most important source for investors to read this week it would be Marc Gerstein s post on small cap value stocks  This may seem like an unlikely subject for this recognition  so let me elaborate my reasons  I hope you will then read the post carefully and add Marc to those whom you follow 

Marc combines great intelligence with creativity  experience  and a disciplined approach  While I have not met him personally  I have participated in some advisor conference calls with him  as well as reading his work for years  He is the real deal 
Marc s work is never data mining  where you can prove nearly anything  He always includes the following

An initial hypothesis
Reasonable investigatory criteria
Understanding of fundamental precepts
Suspicious skepticism of initial results 


This post begins with the analysis of value investing   cast aside by those who are avoiding the  cold  factor  He writes 

Value investing works  It always worked in the past  It works now  It will always work in the future  To suggest otherwise would be to deny human nature  the tendency to buy something at a lower price and to bypass an offer from one who sells the exact same product or service at a higher price  A rational buyer will pay a higher price for something only if there is a particular reason to do so  better service  more convenient method of shopping  better buying experience  better warranty  not knowing of a cheaper alternative  etc   


He builds on a foundation of prior work with large cap value stocks  highlighting both similarities and differences 
He concludes with a list of candidates   and they are just that  Marc understands that screens are usually the basis for building watch lists and doing further work  They are a source of ideas  not a list of conclusions 

Even the astute WTWA reader will need to take a little more time with this post  You need to understand why it is good before reading it  and then read it a second time 
Stock Ideas 
The FANG stocks are a hot topic  both in terms of attractiveness as individual investments and in the continuing role in current markets  Chuck Carnevale provides a valuable take on this controversy via his wise  data based analysis  Some of the points are covered in this post  but watching the video is even better  Here is a key theme 

Furthermore  it s important to consider and recognize the difference between justifying historical valuations versus justifying current and future valuations  Historical information   if garnered from a credible source   is typically accurate and reliable  Future information requires making forecasts into the unknown and  therefore  less likely to be accurate and or reliable  This is a real conundrum for investors  because we can only invest in the future  We can learn from the past  but we cannot purchase it retroactively 

Synaptics   SYNA  A low valuation in the face of current smartphone and IoT challenges  Shareholders Unite expects shares to recover 
General Dynamics   GD  William Stamm cites the big defense stock as a solid choice in the terms of his interesting portfolio guidelines 
Oil stocks  Kirk Spano sees oil prices as at or near the bottom of a trading range  offering  a strong intermediate term outlook for oil stocks   An attractive feature of his analysis is that he looks at the whole picture  beginning with the economics of supply and demand  instead of just making a list of possible influences 

Personal Finance 
Seeking Alpha Senior Editor Gil Weinreich s Asset Allocation Daily considers a wide range of sources as well as his own take on an important issue  It is interesting to financial advisors as well as the DIY investor  This week he highlights possible retirement disaster scenarios  There is discussion of the choices involved in two posts this week he considers the trade offs in purchasing an annuity or long term care insurance  Read the entire series for more great discussions 
Abnormal Returns is an important daily source for all of us following investment news  His Wednesday Personal Finance Post is especially helpful for individual investors  This week and an array of great articles  featuring important retirement questions  Among this list of winners  my favorite was Ten Commandments from Richard Quinn of Humble Dollar  There is a lot of practical advice in this post  If you are personally weak on any item  make a note and check back in a few months 
I also recommend Ben Carlson s careful analysis of real estate investing  Like Ben  I see many investors tempted by apparent steady cash flows and risks that are poorly recognized 
Watch out for  
Walmart  NYSE WMT   A great quarter  but big challenges remain  Valuentum does a nice job analyzing both strengths and weaknesses  Also worth reading is their post on Clorox  Clorox Company  NYSE CLX     a fantastic company with solid brands   Yes  there is a  but  coming  
Brokers who pay unfair rates on cash  Seeking Alpha CEO and Editor in Chief Eli Hoffman analyzes the wide variation in payments by brokers  some of whom are giving you 0 1  while collecting 1 9   Since we will all sometimes have cash  this question is of widespread interest  Read the entire post for Eli s full analysis  Hint  Pick the right broker  His choice  and ours  is Interactive Brokers 
Leveraged loans  WSJ   Most do not understand the relationship with junk rated bonds  Nearly every  reach for yield  requires very careful investigation 
Final Thoughts 
Fed punditry is a great employment opportunity  No experience is required  Everyone understands about money  of course  so you can speak to the masses  The very language of the Fed process   money printing  massive debt  bloated balance sheets   lends itself to connecting with a mass audience  In 2013  Using the Fed as a Fig Leaf  I described how the Fed was being used as an excuse by everyone who had been wrong about the market  The new arguments  listed in that post  proved no more accurate 
There is an interesting post election change  Many of the loudest critics have switched sides  now cheering for a very different monetary policy  Any party in power wants low interest rates  The  out s  always find Fed policy fertile ground for economic posturing 
Regular readers know that I think the Fed has done well  both in reacting to the Great Recession  the willingness to use innovative policies  and the measured withdrawal of stimulus  Like everyone else  I am interested in whether changed leadership will imply changed policy 
My biggest disappointment with the  modern  Fed has been the effect of greater transparency  Neither Bernanke nor Yellen were great with the press conferences  Providing more information for the markets seems only to provide more grist for critics  Providing more explanation  showing more forecasts and dot plots  and earlier release of minutes has increased neither confidence nor understanding  Why not 
Market participants always seek a business like analogy  They want to see leadership  consensus on forecasts  accountability for missed projections  and a single voice in support of agreed policy  They will never get that from the Fed  The issues are inherently complex  A range of viewpoints is very healthy  especially when made public 
There could be plenty of news from Jackson Hole  but it is unlikely to provide the policy buzz most observers seek  The best move for investors is to ignore the Fed blame game and enjoy some family time  
 This is a crucial time for investment decisions  If you are flying solo  you might want to request my papers on risk or the top pitfalls for individual investors  If you are concerned that you do not have a good risk reward portfolio  or one suited to your needs  feel free to ask us for an analysis  For any of these just email main at newarc dot com   
I m more worried about  

Impeachment turmoil  Newsweek has a lead article on the changing odds  This is another example of concerns that are difficult to quantify  in terms of both probability and impact

118629,340144,CLX,Est e Lauder s CEO Just Sold  30 Million Worth Of Stock,opinion,"Fabrizio Freda  President and Chief Executive Officer of the Estee Lauder Companies  NYSE EL  sold 300 000 shares of the company s stock worth a total of  30 1 million on Tuesday  August 22nd  In fact  insiders have sold more than  43 8 million worth of stock since June according to   The company s shares last traded at  105 17 as of Wednesday  August 23  approximately 99 5  of its 52 week high  While the stock is near highs  could the recent insider transactions signal a troubling road ahead for shareholders 

The Est e Lauder Company manufactures and markets skin care  makeup  fragrance  and hair care products worldwide  The company sells its products through department stores  specialty multi brand retailers  upscale perfumeries  pharmacies  salons  and spas 
Analysts covering the stock often compare the company to a peer group that includes Kimberly Clark  NYSE  NYSE KMB   Colgate Palmolive Company  NYSE  NYSE CL   Avon Products  NYSE AVP  and Clorox  NYSE CLX   Analyzing Est e Lauder s valuation metrics and ratios provides further insight into why insiders are selling their shares Potential Reasons Why Insiders Are Selling SharesWe define fundamental metrics and present charts below that may help explain why insiders are selling their shares 
Return on Invested Capital  ROIC  is used to evaluate the ability of a company to create value for all its stakeholders  debt and equity  The company s ROIC of 14 2  is slightly above AVP  12 6   and well below KMB  25 0    CL  36 2   and CLX  24 6   

 or Earnings before Interest  Taxes  Depreciation and Amortization margin measures the portion of revenue a company converts to earnings  It is a strong measure of a company s pricing power and capital efficiency 
Again  Est e Lauder s EBITDA margin of 17 7  is only above comparable company AVP  8 0   and below KMB  22 3    CL  28 3   and CLX  20 9   
EBITDA Multiple is calculated by dividing Enterprise Value by EBITDA and is often used to benchmark the fair market value of a company  Its key benefit over the P E Multiple is that it s capital structure neutral  and  therefore  better at comparing companies with different levels of debt 
All else equal  companies with higher returns and EBITDA margins command higher valuation multiples and vice versa  However  this doesn t appear to be the case with Est e Lauder  The company s LTM EBITDA multiple of 19 5x is above all of its selected comparable public companies  KMB  12 2x   CL  15 7x   AVP  6 4x  and CLX  16 0x   Similarly  its forward EBITDA multiple of 17 6x is also above the entire peer group  KMB  12 1x   CL  15 1x   AVP  5 7x  and CLX  15 4x 
 
The company s valuation multiples trade at a premium to its peer group even while its margins and returns are below the majority of this same group  This provides support that shares of Est e Lauder are beginning to become overvalued 
 represents cash returned to shareholders for each dollar invested  Dividend yield plus the change in stock price  capital gain  represents the total return on investment for shareholders Est e Lauder s dividend yield of 1 3  is below all of its peers  KMB  3 2    CL  2 2    CLX  2 4    This also provides support that shares becoming overvalued  Note that AVP does not yet pay a dividend 
The fundamental charts above indicate that the company s stock may be trading at a premium and helps explain why insiders have been selling shares  Value investors long Est e Lauder may want to re evaluate their positions ",2017-08-23,Finbox io,https://www.investing.com/analysis/estee-lauders-ceo-just-sold-30-million-worth-of-stock-200209094,200209094

and food stocks form part of the  sector  Markedly  the sector is on growth trajectory since the beginning of 2017  supported by buoyant economy and improving consumer confidence despite a competitive landscape and geopolitical turmoil In fact  we note that the performance of the index depends upon all 16 Zacks sectors  out of which nine sectors are expected to witness an earnings decline in the

earnings estimates in the first quarter of fiscal 2018  This is because the company has an Earnings ESP of  0 29  with a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   consequently making the surprise prediction difficult Further  revenues are expected to be  1 478 million in the quarter  up 2 4  from the year ago quarter  Per the analysts polled by Zacks  sales at the Cleaning segment are expected to come in at  542 million  up 1 5  year over year  while for Household the same is projected to be  436 million  up 3 3    Sales at the Lifestyle segment are envisioned to be  245 million  up 1 2   while for the

118649,340164,CLX,Molson Coors  TAP  Q2 Earnings  Is A Beat In The Cards ,opinion,"Molson Coors Brewing Co    NYSE TAP   is set to report second quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Aug 2  The question lingering in investors  minds is  whether this beverage company will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the to be reported quarter  It should be noted that the company has posted three negative earnings surprises in the last four quarters  resulting in an average negative surprise of 22 6  
Let s see how things are shaping up prior to the announcement 
What Does the Zacks Model Unveil 
Our proven model shows that Molson Coors is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients 
Zacks Earnings ESP    which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is  4 90   This is because the Most Accurate estimate is  2 14  while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at  2 04  A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise   You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Zacks Rank  Molson Coors currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Note that stocks with Zacks Ranks  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  and 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings  Conversely  the Sell rated stocks   Zacks Rank  4 or 5  should never be considered going into an earnings announcement 
The combination of Molson Coors  Zacks Rank  3 and an Earnings ESP of  4 90  makes us very optimistic about a possible earnings beat 
Which Way Are Estimates Trending 
Let s look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company right before earnings release  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter and 2017 has been declining over the last seven days  However  the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 04 per share and  6 45 for the second quarter and full year 2017 reflect year over year growth of 83 8  and 103 4   respectively 
Further  analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of  3 08 billion for the said quarter  up 212 7  from the year ago period  For 2017  Zacks consensus revenue is pegged at  11 1 billion  reflecting a 127 6  year over year increase Molson Coors Brewing Company Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
    Factors to Consider 
Molson Coors has been struggling with weak sales volume trend of late  While the acquisition of the Miller global brands helped improving sales in the International regions  sales volume continued to decline in Canada and Europe  A difficult economy  unfavorable currency and competitive pressure remained the major deterrents  The company s dismal performance is reflected in its share price  Molson Coors  shares have fallen 12 3  in the last one year  in comparison to the  s growth of 2 4   In order to revive its performance  Molson Coors has been focusing on expanding its foothold through strategic agreements and targeting above premium brands to help grow its market share 

The recent agreement with Hornell Brewing Co   Inc   an affiliate of AriZona Beverages  is in line with Molson Coors  current business expansion initiatives  The deal will give Molson Coors the license to market and distribute a new Flavored Malt Beverage  FMB  brand  Arnold Palmer Spiked Half   Half  through its U S  division MillerCoors  This would aid Molson Coors to capture the momentum of ready to drink teas  both alcoholic and non alcoholic  in the U S 
In regard to its cost savings target  the company exceeded its 2016 goal by achieving more than  165 million of in year cost reductions  The acquisition of the remaining 58  stake in MillerCoors will also drive substantial cost synergies in the next three years and continues to expect this transaction to be significantly accretive to underlying earnings in the first full year of operations  This will also help the company to drive top line growth  profit  cash generation  debt pay down and total shareholder returns in the years ahead  The company expects cost savings of  550 million over the next three years till 2019 
Stocks to Consider
Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat

Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
What s Driving the Stock 
The Anglo Dutch company Unilever has been trending higher on the back of its recent strategic business reviews  aiming to deliver profits and boost shareholders value amid sluggish growth and increasing competition in the global packaged goods industry

118678,340193,CLX,SUPERVALU  SVU  To Report Q1 Earnings  What s In The Cards ,opinion,SUPERVALU Inc    NYSE SVU   is scheduled to report first quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jul 25  before the market opens The question lingering in investors  minds is  whether this leading grocery dealer will be able to deliver positive earnings surprise in the to be reported quarter  Its earnings have lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters  with an average miss of 6 7  Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement What Does the Zacks Model Unveil Our proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for SUPERVALU this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  and a positive  for this to happen SuperValu Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    SUPERVALU has an Earnings ESP of 0 00  as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 10 cents  The company has a Zacks Rank  2  which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  its ESP of 0 00  makes surprise prediction difficult  You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Which Way are Estimates Treading Let s look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company right before earnings release  The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 10 cents for the fiscal first quarter has been stable in the last 30 days and reflects year over year decline of 47 4  from 19 cents posted in the year ago quarter  However  the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 35 cents for fiscal 2018 shows growth from 29 cents delivered in fiscal 2017 Further  analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of  3 98 billion and  12 85 billion for the impending quarter and fiscal 2018  which are 23 5  and 14 2  lower than the respective year ago periods Factors at PlayWe note that SUPERVALU has been witnessing difficulties in delivering growth  of late  In fact  the company has been reporting lower than expected sales for the last few quarters  primarily due to soft comparable store sales  Evidently  its top line has lagged estimates for seven of the last nine quarters In addition  this leading grocery dealer is witnessing sluggish sales in the retail business due to tough competitive pressure  lower store traffic and deflationary environment in the food industry  Notably  in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017  retail sales fell 3 2  year over year with same store sales remaining negative at 5 8   thereby marking the eighth consecutive quarter of decline We note that the food grocery industry is grappling with a number of headwinds of late  Shift in consumer purchase decisions  evolving shopping behavior and increasing presence of small firms continue to plague the industry  Moreover  the fact that SUPERVALU is not completely immune to the industry s headwinds  have been denting its financial results Nonetheless  management at SUPERVALU is striving hard to spark a turnaround and return to its growth trajectory  The company is also geared to expand its retail banners in order to boost sales  along with the intent to capitalize on the private brands portfolio among the retail banners  Moreover  it is trying all means to rejuvenate its retail segment  reduce costs and increase operating efficiency We commend SUPERVALU s efforts to develop the wholesale operations  primarily through adding new customers  retaining and developing business with existing customers and acquisitions  In fact  the recent acquisition of Unified Grocers is expected to radically boost the company s wholesale segment  alongside offering new growth opportunities across multiple geographies  Its wholesale business will drive the momentum further and boost its near term results Notably  SUPERVALU s shares have rallied 10  in the last one month against the Zacks categorized  industry s decline of 2 8   Meanwhile  the broader  sector fell 0 3  Per the latest   total second quarter 2017 earnings for the sector are expected to rise 3 9   while revenues are projected to improve 1 5   In fact  we observed that the

fluctuations On an organic basis  excluding foreign exchange  acquisitions and divestitures   the company s sales were flat with last year  The flat results were due to the persistence of softness in North America and challenges in Asia Pacific  This was considerably mitigated by strong organic sales growth in Latin America and the return to positive organic sales growth in Hill s Pet Nutrition Adjusted gross profit margin was 60 7   up 50 basis points  bps   driven by benefits of cost saving initiatives under the company s funding the growth and 2012 Restructuring Program  along with better

Colgate anticipates the backdrop to remain challenging due to uncertain global markets and slowing category growth worldwide  Consequently  the company reiterated net sales projection for 2017 anticipating low single digits growth  However  on account of the soft first half 2017  management now envisions organic sales growth for 2017 to be in the low single digit range  compared with the

118686,340201,CLX,Will Comps Drive Companhia Brasileira  CBD  Q2 Earnings ,opinion,"Companhia Brasileira de Distribuicao   NYSE CBD   is set to report second quarter 2017 results on Jul 25  The company posted a positive earnings surprise of 30  in the preceding quarter 
A glimpse at CBD s stock performance shows that it has been gaining ground over the last six months  Shares of this Zacks Rank  2  Buy  stock have gained 12 4  over the said time frame  outperforming the  s 8 7  gain  Notably  the industry is part of the top 41  of the Zacks Classified industries  108 out of the 256  

Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Which Way Are the Estimates Headed 
Let s look at the estimate revision trend in order to get a clear picture of what analysts expect from the company right before the earnings release  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second quarter and 2017 earnings has been stable over the last 30 days Companhia Brasileira de Distribuicao Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
    What Does the Zacks Model Unveil 
Our proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for CBD this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  and a positive  for this to happen 
CBD has an Earnings ESP of 0 00  as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 6 cents  Although the company s Zacks Rank  2 increases the predictive power of ESP  we need a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise  You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum 
Factors at Play
On Jul 12  the company announced sales results for the second quarter  wherein it reported net growth of 9 0  driven by strength at Assai and the Extra banner  Both Multivarejo and Assai continued to gain market traction in the quarter  However  sales growth was lower than the preceding quarter s 9 5  hike on a year over year basis  Comparable store sales grew 13 5  in the quarter  with strong customer traffic expansion and increase in sales volume offsetting the effect of the slowdown in food inflation  Inflation levels declined from 5 2  in the first quarter to 2 3  in the second 
During the second quarter  the company opened three stores  of which two were in the Minuto Pao de Acucar format and one in Assai  another four are under construction  
We note that this Brazilian company has been showing strong improvement in Extra Hiper markets and consistent growth at Assai Store openings and conversion of Extra Hiper stores to Assai is also boosting sales  The conversions will help accelerate expansion of GPA s cash and carry banner into new cities and states across Brazil  We are also encouraged by the company s operating efficiency and productivity projects  Further  a higher gross margin and a decline in selling  general and administrative expenses at Multivarejo boosted the EBITDA margin 
However  CBD has been witnessing margin compression over the past many quarters  It is struggling to keep prices in check in the face of inflation in Brazil  which is hurting gross margin  Also  strong growth in the Assai business  though helping sales growth  is impacting margins as this business is characterized by low prices  A challenging economic scenario in Brazil has also dampened demand and consumer confidence

118740,340255,CLX,Clorox  CLX  Q1 Earnings Miss  Updates View  Stock Dips,opinion,The Clorox Company   NYSE CLX   released first quarter fiscal 2017 results  wherein the bottom line marked its second consecutive miss  Also  the company tweaked its earnings guidance for fiscal 2017  including the ASU 2016 09 benefit   which seemed to have upset investors  as is reflected by a 2 1  decline in its stock price during the pre market trading hours  The top line  however  remained strong  thanks to robust volume growth across all segments Quarterly earnings from continuing operations of  1 36 per share jumped 3  year over year  but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 42 as benefits from solid sales and cost savings were more than offset by currency headwinds and higher manufacturing and logistics expenses  Also  the bottom line includes a benefit of 4 cents related to the adoption of the Accounting Standards Update  ASU  2016 09  as revealed earlier  On the positive side  however  net sales of  1 443 million advanced nearly 4  year over year  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 433 million  Notably  this marked the company s third consecutive sales beat During the quarter  gains from 8  volume growth  higher pricing at the International business and benefits from RenewLife  acquired in May 2016  were somewhat negated by unfavorable mix and about 2  impact from unfavorable currency effects  On a currency neutral basis  revenues increased 6  in the reported quarter However  Clorox s gross margin contracted 60 basis points  bps  to 44 4  in the quarter  as greater manufacturing and logistics expenses  unfavorable mix and adverse currency movements more than offset the gains from efficient cost savings  lower commodity costs and improved pricing Revenue by SegmentSales in the Cleaning segment improved 7  to  534 million  with a 13  jump in volumes  Volumes mainly benefited from the strength in Home Care brands  particularly Clorox disinfecting wipes coupled with strong volumes at the Professional Products  cleaning brands Household sales grew 3  to  422 million  with volumes rising 6   Volumes were mainly aided by the RenewLife acquisition  somewhat negated by lower shipments at Charcoal Sales at the Lifestyle segment rose 2  to  236 million  driven by 1  advancement in volumes  which in turn benefited from growth witnessed in Natural Personal Care In the International business segment  Clorox s sales remained flat at  251 million  reflecting the negative impact of currency  On a currency neutral basis  sales jumped 10  year over year  Volumes at the segment improved 4   mainly driven by gains in Canada  including benefits from Renew Life s buyout  and Asia  partly offset by weakness noted in some Latin American nations like Argentina FinancialsClorox ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  408 million  and long term debt of  1 789 million  During the first quarter  the company generated  170 million of net cash from continuing operations compared with  135 million in the year ago period  CLOROX CO Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise     Looking AheadManagement remains pleased with the strong start to fiscal 2017  which witnessed solid sales and volume growth across most segments  alongside delivering impressive gross margin   reflecting its focus on its 2020 Strategy  This strategy has been helping the company achieve cost savings and productivity enhancements  Going forward  the company remains on track to keep this momentum going  That said  management remains positive about the remainder of fiscal 2017 given its constant focus on its core business strategies However  management s fiscal 2017 guidance takes into account a challenging macroeconomic environment and adverse currency movements  which may pose concerns Clorox continues to expect fiscal 2017 sales growth in a range of 2  4   including a positive impact from the RenewLife buyout of nearly 2 points and adverse currency impact of nearly the same amount  On a currency neutral basis  sales growth is still anticipated to range from 4  6  in the fiscal Further  EBIT margin is still estimated to expand in a band of 25 50 bps  mainly backed by lower selling and administrative costs However  given the adoption of ASU 2016 09  the company now anticipates effective tax rate for the fiscal in the range of 32  33   compared with 30  31  projected earlier Management further stated that the ASU 2016 09 benefit is now expected to boost fiscal 2017 earnings by 10 15 cents per share compared with a gain of 25 30 cents per share expected earlier  Consequently  the company lowered its earnings forecast for fiscal 2017 to  5 23  5 43 per share  including ASU benefit  from  5 38  5 58 expected earlier However  excluding the benefit from the new accounting standard  the company reiterated its earnings per share guidance range of  5 13  5 28 for fiscal 2017 Zacks RankClorox currently carries a Zacks

118741,340256,CLX,Consumer Staples Are About To Run,opinion,"Consumer staples have been a workhorse for the market since the depths of the financial crisis  These are the stocks of the things you need and use every day  cereal  toilet paper  toothpaste  laundry detergent  While many of these companies are very low margin  their business is steady  They also tend to pay good dividends  Nothing exciting 
But in investing  exciting is not what you look for  A steady rise in price over time with dividends along the way can be a home run  For example   1 000 invested in Clorox  NYSE CLX   the bleach company  25 years ago has grown to  2 380 if you reinvested the dividends along the way  That s better than 9  return every year for 25 years    for bleach  You would probably do well just buying the consumer staples ETF XLP and sitting on it for a few years  The chart below suggests that now may be a good time to buy the ETF 

The chart shows XLP since it crossed over its 100 week moving average in October 2009  The first thing that jumps out is how that 100 week SMA has acted as support ever since  Starting with the touch in 2010  every time since it has touched that line  the price has rebounded  You can also see that the price does not stray too far from that line before a correction    either through a pullback or sideways through time 
It so happens that XLP s price just started a move up off of that 100 week SMA again  It is now sitting just above it with improving momentum  The RSI at the top of the chart is running higher toward the bullish zone and the MACD is headed toward a cross up  which is a buy signal  It s as if this ETF is on sale  The last thing to note is the falling trend resistance  A push over this line would give confirmation that a move higher has begun and is not just another short term bounce  An intermediate term trader might wait for that  A long term holder should see the value now ",2016-12-13,Gregory W.

118753,340268,CLX,4 Companies That Came Out On Top After Brexit,opinion,"Almost a week removed from Brexit  the markets are rallying after the historic downturn late last week into early this week  We saw high beta stocks from financials to airlines plunge on the increased volatility surrounding the vote 
However  it wasn t bad for everyone with gold and volatility indexes making significant gains  As for single equities we saw Walmart  NYSE WMT   Verizon Communications Inc  NYSE VZ   Altria Group  NYSE MO   Clorox Company  NYSE CLX  and Unilever PLC  NYSE UL  unscathed and in fact make marginal gains  With earnings season on the horizon these companies should stay resilient with future earnings largely unaffected from the Brexit vote

Verizon was one of the few companies to persevere amid the global market sell off of the last 2 days  The U S  telecommunication industry has very little exposure to Europe so any future currency headwinds and macro volatility won t impact forward earnings  However  Verizon s biggest concern this quarter was how earnings will be impacted from the labor strikes  The strike lasted almost 3 months with nearly 40 000 landline workers walking off the job 
Instead of hiring temporary replacements  Verizon used corporate employees  at their current salaries  to do the work  This in itself should take its toll on earnings and margins for Q2 but shouldn t have a long lasting effect  Verizon was also in the news after many believed it was the frontrunner to acquire the beleaguered Yahoo  NASDAQ YHOO   Verizon s efforts to buy outdated media companies appears to be a bad idea  but only time will tell 
Competition has also started to ramp up  Verizon remains the industry leading service in the U S   but Sprint  Tmobile and AT T  NYSE T  aren t too far behind  The Estimize community is calling for earnings per share of 99 cents on  31 45 billion this quarter  marking negative growth for the first time in nearly 2 years  Fortunately  investors won t need to speculate about Brexit aftermath when buying or selling this company 
Walmart    Consumer Staples   Food and Staples Retailing
For all the flack Walmart gets  this was another company that managed to surprise investors and make gains in the past 2 days  The discount retailer has been adamant that it would continue to lower prices and expand its omnichannel capabilities to keep up with Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   This hasn t come at the cost of its employees either  After heavy scrutiny for unfair wages  Walmart has raised compensation for its employees across the board 
Other initiatives include opening new stores in strategic locations  domestic and globally  while closing or relocating stores in struggling locations  Considering its size  Walmart has made significant strides in the past few years  The Estimize community is confident that Walmart will continue its gains with estimates seeing moderate upward revisions  The consensus data is looking for earnings per share of  1 03 on  120 billion in revenue  Shares are now up 5  over the past 3 months 
Altria Group    Consumer Staples   Tobacco
Just as gun stocks soar on mass shooting  drug and alcohol manufacturer s rise during bear markets  Shares of the tobacco maker soared these past two days as investors sought safe haven investments  Consumers often turn to cigarettes and liquor during market volatility so these stocks typically do well 
Altria Group was one of the big winners in this space  Between Friday and Monday shares of the tobacco maker were up nearly 3  and have just tailed off as the rest of the market begins to rally  If Brexit does lead to devastation like mainstream news would like us to believe  then Altria could see shares rise even further from here 
Clorox Corporation    Consumer Staples   Household and Personal Products
Consumer goods were one of the standouts in the aftermath of the Brexit Vote  We saw names like Unilever and Clorox make significant gains in the past 2 days while many of its peers stumbled  Untimely events and market volatility aren t the only things driving these stocks  particularly Clorox 
Clorox has exceeded earnings expectations in each of the past 4 quarters with shares now up 30   In that same time earnings have grown by double digits while revenue increases by low single digits  The 103 year old company has seen strength across all its brands such as Burt s Bees  Glad Trash Bags and Brita  Clorox also regained distribution of its products at Costco  NASDAQ COST  after conceding the business to Reckitt Benckiser nearly two years ago 
Clorox also recently acquired organic supplements company  Renew Life  for  295 million in cash  Renew Life s products can be found at stores such as Whole Foods  Sprouts and Vitamin Shoppe  Investor s probably don t mind that Clorox isn t the most glamorous company given the way has performed

118762,340277,CLX,Lantheus Holdings  POSCO  Tempur Sealy International  Tyson Foods And Clorox Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,"For Immediate Release

Chicago  IL   August 29  2016    highlights Lantheus Holdings    as the Bull of the Day and POSCO     as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on   Tempur Sealy International     Tyson Foods  NYSE TSN       and Clorox Company  NYSE CLX     

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks  

  

Lantheus Holdings    isn t exactly a household name  In fact  I am betting that this stock is flying well under the radar for most investors  There are a few things that stick out to me for this play as a good long term investment and there are a few that are more short term in nature  Either way you cut it LNTH is looking good to me 

First let me list the positives I see with this stock and then we can go over the normal attributes that have made this Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stock the Bull of the Day 

Why I Like It

This is a small cap stock in a  risk on  environment 

Small cap stocks have been out performing of late 

Revenue trends are pointing to continued sequential growth 

5 straight beats of the Zacks Consensus Estimate 

Room for multiple expansion  trades at 14x forward earnings as compared to 22x industry average  

Follow Brian Bolan  and on  at the same address  

The Recent Numbers

LNTH beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 06 when it reported  0 24 in the first week of August  This  0 18 beat was good for a 300  positive earnings surprise 

The topline was also impressive with the company delivering  78M in sales when the Zacks Consensus Estimate was looking for  73M  That  5M beat was good for a 7 25  positive revenue surprise 

I mentioned the idea of sequential revenue growth as one of the reasons I like this stock  Last year the company recorded revenues of  75M in the March quarter and then posted  73M in the June quarter  That isn t what gets me excited and isn t growth  it is contraction  This year the March quarter saw  76M while the June quarter was  78M  So where there was contraction last year  this year we have expansion 

Description

LNTH is in the medical products industry and they sell products in the diagnostic imaging space  Roughly half the sales come from DEFINITY which helps doctors when looking at echocardiograms  The basic idea is the aging population is going to the doctor s office a lot more and this helps identify problems  or rather  show that there aren t health problems  hopefully  

  

POSCO    is formerly known as Pohang Iron   Steel Company and is now a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  and is the Bear of the Day 

Description

POSCO  formerly known as Pohang Iron   Steel Company Ltd   manufactures hot and cold rolled steel products  heavy plate and other steel products for the construction and shipbuilding industries 

Estimates

The Zacks Consensus Estimate has been falling over the last few months  The FY16 estimate stood at  3 59 in June and dropped in July to  3 24 

Next year has also seen a move lower in estimates with the 2017 Zacks Consensus Estimate moving from  5 33 in June to the current level of  4 83

3  Boring  Stocks to Buy Right Now

Part of the reason why we always seem to be talking about certain companies is the excitement that comes from their innovation and design  However  these factors simply don t guarantee performance  Sometimes the best stocks are the boring ones 

With that said  I set out to find some of these boring stocks on the Zacks Stock Screener  I wanted to find stocks with strong Zacks Ranks  strong Style Scores  and other signs of being able to outperform the market soon  Unfortunately  our Stock Screener doesn t have a  Boring  filter  but I used my own judgement while parsing through the results 

Using this technique  I was able to find a few stocks with solid metrics that wouldn t typically get investors riled up  Check out these three  boring  stocks below 

1  Tempur Sealy International    

I wanted to put this one first because it s the easiest of the boring related jokes to make  Tempur Sealy  a leading developer of mattresses and bedding products  is so boring it will literally put you to sleep  In all seriousness  I mean no disrespect to Tempur Sealy  This Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  crushed our earnings estimate by over 35  last quarter  and analysts have been scrambling to adjust their future estimates upwards 

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Tempur Sealy s current quarter earnings has gained eight cents in the past 30 days  With a VGM score of  B  and a position in the top 30  of the Zacks Industry Rank  this stock promises to provide excitement by way of profits 

2  Tyson Foods    

Tyson Foods is the world s largest fully integrated producer of chicken and poultry based food products  Although I am personally a big chicken eater  I will be the first to admit that there are very few foods less exciting than bland  white chicken  Nevertheless  Tyson Foods currently holds a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and the company is potentially looking at earnings growth of 43  this year 

This stock has been on fire lately  with shares gaining over 41  on the year  On top of this  Tyson has a VGM score of  A  and it falls into a category of food producers that currently sits in the top 6  of the Zacks Industry Rank 

3  Clorox Company    

Although the Clorox Company is one of the most recognizable names in its industry  at its core it s still basically a soap company  Clorox is best known for its namesake bleach and cleaning products  and the company owns other household brands such as Pine Sol  Burt s Bees  and Formula 409 

Nevertheless  Clorox should be exciting to investors right now  It is currently a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  after seeing eight positive earnings estimate revisions within the past 30 days  In that time  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its full year earnings has gained 23 cents and currently reflects growth of 12  year over year 

Bottom Line

Yes  I know  gizmos and gadgets and crazy technology is fun  That s why we all want to invest in self driving cars and whatever the next Silicon Valley startup is  Sometimes  however  we have to invest in the boring stuff because it s going to make us money  Regardless of what these companies do  they are doing it well right now  and all of these stocks could very well be headed for further success

118786,340301,CLX,CLX  A Reliable Dividend Aristocrat For Any Economic Environment,opinion,"Clorox  N CLX  has increased its dividend for nearly 40 straight years and owns some of the most well known and recession resistant consumer brands in the country  The company is a fraction of the size of P G and has numerous growth opportunities to pursue over the coming years 
While the stock might not be a bargain today  it shares many characteristics with some of the holdings in our Top 20 Dividend Stocks portfolio Business OverviewCLX started in 1913 with five people and one product in Clorox bleach  In fact  CLX remained a one product company for its first 56 years  Today  the company has over 7 700 employees  sells its products in more than 100 countries  and boasts a brand portfolio spanning numerous product categories including home care  laundry  charcoal  food  water filtration  cat litter  and more  Some of the company s famous brands are Clorox  Pine Sol  Glad  Kingsford  Hidden Valley  Brita  and Burt s Bees 
CLX generates about 32  of its sales from cleaning products  32  from household products  and 17  from lifestyle products and derives 19  of its revenue from faster growing international markets Business AnalysisAs a consumer products company  CLX s primary competitive advantages are its strong portfolio of brands  shelf space with retailers  marketing expertise  and product innovation 
With the Clorox brand dating back more than 100 years  CLX has benefited from being one of the first brands in consumers  minds for most of its key product categories  When you walk down the aisle of your favorite retailer and see CLX s main household brands  you know they will deliver quality 
As a result  over 80  of CLX s sales are generated from brands with a number one or number two market share position  Overall  Clorox has 23  market share and is three times the size of its next largest branded competitor  The company focuses on attaining large market shares in mid sized categories  which also helps it avoid going head to head as much with giants such as P G 
The non food consumer products space is very sticky and generally less subject to change  According to IRI Market Advantage  85  of American household needs are consistently filled with the same 150 items  and 60 80  of new product launches fail 
In other words  CLX maintains a durable and sticky market position  and new entrants really struggle to win over consumers who are happy with incumbents  offerings 
To stay relevant  the company is constantly conducting consumer research to help it launch innovative products and sharpen its marketing campaigns  CLX spent  523 million on advertising  9 2  of sales  and invested  136 million on R D  2 4  of sales  during its last fiscal year 
Smaller competitors and new entrants don t have the financial firepower to build up their brand recognition with consumers and retailers 
CLX s extensive distribution networks around the world are another major strength  CLX can expand the types of products under its brands or acquire new products and sell them throughout the world very efficiently  For example  the company launched the Burt s Bees Renewal face care line last fiscal year to enter the fast growing  24 billion anti aging face care category  Since consumers are already very familiar with the Burt s Bees brand  CLX can more easily grow its business in new areas 
Finally  CLX s vertical integration and efficiency initiatives help keep its product costs very competitive  The company s cost savings program has delivered about  100 million or more in annual savings since 2003  and CLX operates 37 manufacturing facilities around the world 
Overall  the company expects to grow sales by 3 5  per year and improve operating margins by 25 to 50 basis points per year  With strong brands  extensive distribution channels  relevant marketing campaigns  and large and fragmented markets  CLX has plenty of opportunity ahead of it Key RisksIn our opinion  one of the biggest uncertainties surrounding CLX s business is whether or not the company can continue growing at such a high level of profitability 
CLX s operating margin hit an all time high of 20 6  last quarter  The company has benefited from several quarters of strong market share gains  lower raw material costs  and excellent pricing power 
However  management expects  heightened competitive activity in the second half of the fiscal year  as competitors respond to CLX s share gains 
Furthermore  Walmart  N WMT  accounted for 26  of CLX s revenue last year  The company is struggling to find sources of sustainable profit growth  Walmart certainly sees CLX s 20   operating margin and has to wonder if it can squeeze more pricing concessions out of the company 
Private label is always a threat as well  Consumers are getting smarter about how they shop and what products they can trust  Information is more available than ever before  CLX has noted that private label products account for about 20  of the market  If more consumers trade down  demand for CLX s higher priced branded goods could slow 
The consumer packaged goods industry is also a fairly mature market  With low growth rates  large incumbents can quickly find themselves treading water   some brands are growing  others are shrinking  This is what P G is struggling with right now  While CLX is much smaller than P G  it s possible that some of its larger product categories eventually find themselves in similar situations  especially considering the company s concentration in the slower growing U S  market  80  of revenue  
For now  CLX is showing no signs of weakness  The company continues putting up low single digit volume growth across its entire portfolio and has done an excellent job expanding into adjacent product categories and geographies while delivering effective marketing campaigns Dividend AnalysisWe analyze 25  years of dividend data and 10  years of fundamental data to understand the safety and growth prospects of a dividend Dividend Safety ScoreOur Safety Score answers the question   Is the current dividend payment safe   We look at factors such as current and historical EPS and FCF payout ratios  debt levels  free cash flow generation  industry cyclicality  ROIC trends  and more  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
CLX s dividend is about as safe as they come  The company s dividend Safety Score is an excellent 94  suggesting that its dividend is safer than 94  of all other dividend paying stocks in the market 
Over the last four quarters  CLX s dividend has consumed 60  of its earnings and 61  of its free cash flow  As seen below  the company s payout ratio has nearly doubled over the last decade  which means that CLX s dividend was growing faster than its earnings  Going forward  dividend growth will likely be more in line with earnings growth  mid  to upper single digits  Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Source  Simply Safe Dividends
If CLX was very cyclical  its payout ratio would be a concern  For example  if the company s earnings were cut in half during a recession  the company would need to dip into its cash reserves  take on debt  or issue shares to keep funding the dividend 
However  we can see that CLX s business is remarkably stable  Sales fell by just 2  during fiscal year 2009  and its earnings actually grew  The stock also outperformed the S P 500 by 25  during 2008  Consumers still need many of the company s products regardless of how well the economy is doing  although some of them will be more likely to trade down to cheaper private label products Source  Simply Safe Dividends
CLX s strong pricing power and efficient operations have allowed it to earn extremely high returns on invested capital  This is often the sign of an economic moat  and the company s portfolio of well known brands is no exception Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Not surprisingly  CLX generates very consistent free cash flow and even targets a 10 12  free cash flow margin as part of its strategy  Throwing off reliable amounts of free cash flow keeps the dividend very safe and allows CLX to opportunistically acquire other brands that it can leverage across its distribution channels  geographies  and adjacent product categories Source  Simply Safe Dividends
CLX maintains about  2 1 billion in debt compared to  383 million in cash on its balance sheet  but its reliable free cash flow eliminates any financial concern  Morningstar has also assigned an  A   credit rating to the company Source  Simply Safe Dividends
CLX s dividend is very safe  It sells recession resistant products that will be used by consumers for many years to come  its strong brands generate reliable free cash flow  and the company s payout ratios are also very reasonable Dividend Growth ScoreOur Growth Score answers the question   How fast is the dividend likely to grow   It considers many of the same fundamental factors as the Safety Score but places more weight on growth centric metrics like sales and earnings growth and payout ratios  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
CLX s dividend growth potential is about average with a dividend Growth Score of 57  The company has increased its dividend every year since 1977 and is a member of the S P Dividend Aristocrats Index  CLX most recently raised its dividend by 4  in 2015  and we can see that its rate of dividend growth has decelerated over the last 10 years Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Going forward  we would expect CLX to continue increasing its dividend at a mid single digit rate  essentially in line with earnings growth  This would allow the company to maintain a healthy payout ratio around 60  ValuationCLX trades at 26x forward earnings and offers a dividend yield of 2 4   which is meaningfully lower than its five year average dividend yield of 3 1  
Simply put  the stock looks expensive  To put CLX s current earnings multiple in perspective  Carl Icahn  an activist investor  became involved with the stock during the summer of 2011  He believed the stock was cheap and ultimately bid  80 per share to acquire the company 
Icahn s bid price represented an earnings multiple of about 18 5  CLX ended 2011 trading at roughly 16 times forward earnings   Today  the stock s earnings multiple is 40  higher than Icahn s target price 
With expected sales growth between 3  and 5  per year  the company s earnings growth seems unlikely to exceed a mid  to upper single digit annual rate  Over the last five years  CLX s free cash flow per share has compounded at 5 3  per year  If more of the same growth trends were to continue  the stock s total return potential would appear to be 7 9  per year   far from a bargain

118791,340306,CLX,Clean Up Your Portfolio With Clorox,opinion,"Clean and simple can be a good thing  even for investing  Take a look at Clorox Company  NYSE CLX  for example  This company makes bleach  That is it  Oh  it packages bleach in many ways but it makes bleach  Simple  Yet with one thing this company s stock price is up 7290  since it debuted in August 1968 
It is making a new all time high as I write this and with that it looks like a great opportunity to get involved  if you have missed the first 48 years  The chart below explains why  The 40 week SMA  same as 200 day SMA  has acted as support for the stock over the 6 year period shown  You can also see many periods of sideways price action followed by extended pushes higher 

The last touch at that 40 week SMA can just 3 weeks ago  It had followed a 6 month sideways consolidation in the stock  And today it is breaking that consolidation to the upside  Momentum is strong as well  The RSI is in the bullish zone and rising  It has also built a technical pattern  a Positive RSI Reversal  that gives a target to the upside of about  149  The MACD is about to cross up as well  giving its own buy signal  To top it off this stock sports a 2 36  dividend yield  Shouldn t you consider it to help clean up your portfolio

118825,340340,CLX,Clorox s Diversified Brand Sustains Itself In A Challenging Enviornment,opinion,"The Clorox Company  NYSE CLX  will release fourth quarter fiscal 2014 financial results on Aug 1  before the market opens  Last quarter  this consumer products company posted an earnings surprise of approximately 9 26   Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Why a Likely Positive Surprise 
Our proven model shows that Clorox is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of key factors 
Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is  1 49   This is a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise 
Zacks Rank  Clorox carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   The stocks with Zacks Ranks of  1  2 and 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings  The Sell rated stocks   4 and 5  should never be considered going into an earnings announcement 
The combination of Clorox s Zacks Rank  3 and  1 49  ESP makes us confident of earnings beat this release 
What is Driving Better than Expected Earnings 
Although  Clorox concluded its last reported quarter on a strong note  it projected a bleak fiscal 2014 and 2015 due to pressure from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates and rising commodity costs  However  we are constructive about the stock s performance given its unique strategy of expanding global footprint and brand management 
Where other competitors are investing in the rapidly emerging markets of Brazil  Russia  India and China  Clorox has decided to tap the opportunities available in the Middle East and other booming Asian economies  We believe that with less competition and penetration  along with healthy population sizes and rising incomes  these countries provide huge growth potential 
Further  Clorox s diversified brand portfolio positions it well above its peers to generate above average industry growth and sustain itself in the currently challenging environment in the quarter to be reported  The company s approach to brand management allows each of its brands to develop further  through rigorous research and development  marketing strategies  financial control and operating leverage  Given the strength of many of its brands coupled with opportunities in distribution  we believe that the company is set for significant growth 
Other Stocks to Consider
Here are some other companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements

118827,340342,CLX,Consumer Staples With Compelling Dividend Growth,opinion,"I can virtually guarantee that you ve used a product made by either Colgate Palmolive  NYSE CL  or Clorox  NYSE CLX  in the past 24 hours 
These two companies produce some of the most popular household goods on the planet  including Irish Spring soap  Colgate toothpaste  Speed Stick deodorant  Palmolive dish detergent  Brita water filters  Glad garbage bags  Fresh Step kitty litter  and Tilex bathroom cleaner 
And given the ubiquity of their brands  it s no surprise that investors feel comfortable owning the companies  stocks  On top of that  Colgate Palmolive and Clorox are both S P 500 Dividend Aristocrats 
So what s not to like about these consumer staples giants 
Plenty  as it turns out 

As you can see in the table above  CLX has a solid dividend yield of 2 8   However  the company has increased its shares outstanding by 2  over the past 12 months  giving it a measly total yield  dividend yield plus one year net buyback percentage  of 0 8   CL s total yield is also lackluster 
Making matters worse  the dividend payout growth rates for both of these Dividend Aristocrats are very low  The median S P 500 one year dividend growth rate is 10 4  
Yet  perhaps the most unattractive qualities of these stocks are their valuations  As I explained last week  many dividend paying stocks have become expensive due to their popularity  CL and CLX are perfect examples 
Clorox s enterprise value to EBITDA ratio of 14 0x is higher than the S P 500 median of 12 2x  I also like to compare current valuations to their historical averages  Clorox s EV EBITDA is 24  above its 10 year average of 11 3x 
Colgate Palmolive s EV EBITDA is a dizzying 15 8x  which is 20  above its 10 year average 
Basically  these household products companies may have nice underlying businesses  but their paltry dividend growth and expensive valuations render them unappealing investment choices 
Now  let s compare these metrics to those of two agricultural products companies 
Cheaper Agriculture Stocks
Archer Daniels Midland  NYSE ADM  and Bunge  NYSE BG  specialize in agribusiness and food ingredients  Basically  they transport  store  and process agricultural commodities  which are then sold to companies that produce the food we eat  or feed for the animals we eat   Both companies also have ethanol businesses 

At first glance  these stocks may seem underwhelming due to their average dividend yields  But upon further examination  there s a lot to like 
Both ADM and BG have respectable total yields  since they ve both decreased their shares outstanding through modest buybacks over the past year 
Furthermore  their dividend growth rates are higher than the median rate among S P 500 companies  ADM also happens to be an S P 500 Dividend Aristocrat  And despite narrow profit margins  both of these firms are generating plenty of free cash flow  operating cash flow minus capital expenditures  to cover those dividends 
Yet  the most alluring aspects of these stocks are their valuations 
Archer Daniels Midland s EV EBITDA ratio is 9 4x  which is a discount to the market and only a slight premium to its 10 year average  Bunge s EV EBITDA ratio is 25  below its 10 year average  offering compelling value with relatively low leverage 
The data in the first table goes to show that we shouldn t blindly buy Dividend Aristocrats without doing any research  We also shouldn t assume that consumer staples stocks will hold up well when the broader market declines  Many stocks traditionally considered to be defensive in nature have simply become too expensive to offer safety 
Conversely  both ADM and BG qualify as cheap dividend growers  which are exactly what we re looking for as investors 
Safe  and high yield  investing

Competitive Advantage
Clorox  competitive advantage is derived from its strong brands  The company has a long history of building  strengthening  and acquiring consumer branded products 
The company has dominant market share in the United States over several product categories  including 

 60  market share in bleach  Clorox brand 
 75  market share in charcoal  Kingsford brand 
 60  market share in water filtration  Brita brand 

The company supports its brands by investing heavily in advertising  Clorox  advertising budget over the company s last 3 full fiscal years is shown below 

2015 advertising spend of  523 million
2014 advertising spend of  503 million
2013 advertising spend of  498 million

Clorox spends around 9  of its total sales a year directly on advertising  The company s large advertising budget helps it to sell its products for premium prices by highlighting the specific benefits of its products 
In addition to build up brand equity through advertising spending  Clorox also spends significantly on research and development  The company is constantly attempting to improve its products to better serve its customers  Clorox has spent about  130 million a year on research and development over the last 3 years 
Clorox  full competitive advantage is a combination of its well known brands  economies of scale and efficient supply chain  and its focus on product improvement through research and development 
Clorox  competitive advantage gives it excellent margins relative to competitors  The image below shows Clorox  return on invested capital  abbreviated as ROIC  relative to its peers

Growth Prospects
Clorox has grown its earnings per share at just 5 2  a year over the last decade  Dividends have grown much faster   at 11 3  a year   as the company has nearly doubled its payout ratio over the last decade 
Over the long run  Clorox  dividend payments can only grow as fast as earnings per share 
Clorox  earnings per share growth over the last decade is from 

Sales growth of  2  a year
Share count reductions of  2  a year
Net profit margin gains of  1 5  a year  from 9 5  to 10 7  

As you can see  Clorox  has only managed to grow its sales at around the pace of inflation over the last decade  This  of course  is not preferable 
Going forward  Clorox management is expecting 3  to 5  sales growth a year  The company realized 5  constant currency sales growth in its most recent full fiscal year 
Factoring in the company s 10 year history of 2  sales growth  I estimate future sales growth for Clorox at between 2  and 5  a year 
Share repurchases have helped increase earnings per share for Clorox over the last decade  Unfortunately  the company cannot keep repurchasing 2  of shares outstanding every year at current prices 
Clorox has a shareholder yield  dividend yield   share repurchases  of 4 5   The company has an earnings yield  earnings dividend by price  of 4 0   A company can t keep paying out more than it makes for long 
I expect total returns of 7  to 11  a year going forward for Clorox shareholders  from the following sources 

Dividend yield of 2 5 
Sales growth of 2  to 5  a year
Share count reductions of 1 5  a year
Net profit margin gains of 1  to 2  a year

Recession Performance
Clorox performed exceptionally well through the recession of 2007 to 2009  The company managed to grow earnings per share each year of the Great Recession 
Clorox  earnings per share from 2007 to 2010 are listed below 

EPS of  3 23 in 2007
EPS of  3 24 in 2008
EPS of  3 81 in 2009
EPS of  4 24 in 2010

The company s excellent performance through the recession shows that consumers continue to buy the company s branded products in times of economic hardship 
If the last recession is any indication  Clorox  underlying business will perform well through the next recession  whenever that may be  
Valuation and Final Thoughts
Clorox is currently trading for a price to earnings ratio of 25  The company is trading well above its historical average price to earnings ratio of 19 7  A fair price to earnings ratio range for the company is between 18 and 20 given the company s excellent performance over a wide variety of economic conditions and extremely low stock price standard deviation of just 18 5  
There s no question that Clorox is a high quality shareholder friendly business with a strong competitive advantage  The company s low stock price standard deviation makes holding Clorox relatively easy  versus more volatile stocks 
Unfortunately  the company s stock is very likely overvalued at current prices  As a result Clorox is a hold at current prices using The 8 Rules of Dividend Investing ",2015-10-26,Ben Reynolds,https://www.investing.com/analysis/dividend-aristocrats-part-14-of-52:-clorox-269206,269206
