21238,242753,ASTE,Sector ETFs   Stocks To Buy Or Avoid Post Fed Meeting ,opinion,"In its latest FOMC meeting that concluded yesterday  the Fed left interest rates unchanged as widely expected within its target range of 2 25 2 5  but hinted at future rate cuts  if needed  to protect the economy from trade conflicts and other threats The central bank has dropped the word  patient  in favor of language promising to  closely monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook   Fed also said that it would  act as appropriate to sustain the expansion  because  uncertainties  have increased  read    A survey of the 17 Fed officials showed that nearly half expect at least one rate cut this year  with seven projecting two cuts  According to the CME FedWatch tool  chances for a cut at the Fed s July meeting rose to 100  compared with 84  before the meeting concludes  Fed funds futures also show a 100  chance of at least a 25 bps rate cut at the Fed s July meeting  Futures also show 80  odds of rates being cut by 50 bps between now and September 
Rate Cuts  Boon and BaneIn a lower rate environment  high dividend yield sectors such as utilities and real estate will be the biggest beneficiaries given their sensitivity to interest rates  This is especially true as these offer higher returns due to their outsized yields  Additionally  securities in capital intensive sectors like telecom would also be benefited by lower rates  Further  lower interest rates will keep borrowing cost down  thereby resulting in higher consumer spending and rise in economic activities  This will in turn increase profitability across various segments  Businesses will also face lower loan rates over time  read    However  decline in rates will weigh on the U S  dollar against the basket of other currencies  thereby pulling out capital from the country  Sectors like financials  industrials  technology and consumer discretionary will be severely impacted  In fact  banks are in the most disadvantageous position as they seek to borrow money at short term rates and lend at long term rates  If interest rates drop  banks would be able to earn less on lending and pay higher on deposits  This would compress net margins and banks  profits  Also  insurance companies are able to earn lower returns on their investment portfolio of longer duration bonds Given this  we have highlighted ETFs   stocks from sectors that will benefit from lower rates and some that will be badly impacted Sectors to BuyReal EstateSchwab U S  REIT ETF   having AUM of  5 6 billion and average daily trading volume of 883 000 shares  offers broad exposure to the real estate sector  It has a Zacks ETF Rank  3  Hold  with a Medium risk outlook With market cap of  13 8 billion  Host Hotels   Resorts Inc    NYSE HST   is the largest lodging real estate investment trust  REIT  and one of the largest owners of luxury and upper upscale hotels  This  2  Buy  Ranked stock is expected to post earnings decline of 2 82  for this year UtilitiesThis Zacks  3 Ranked Utilities Select Sector SPDR  provides exposure to companies from the electric utility  gas utility  multi utility  and independent power producer and energy trader industries  It has amassed  9 9 billion in its asset base and trades in volume of 17 8 million shares per day on average  read    Brookfield Renewable Partners L P    NYSE BEP    an operator of renewable power platform  is expected to post earnings growth of 261 5  for this year  It has a Zacks Rank  2 and a market cap of  6 1 billion Consumer StaplesVanguard Consumer Staples ETF   carrying a Zacks ETF Rank  3  offers broad exposure to the U S  consumer staples segment  It has managed assets worth  5 1 billion and sees volume of 187 000 shares a day on average  read    With a market cap of  6 4 billion  Pilgrim s Pride Corporation   NASDAQ PPC   is one of the largest chicken companies in the United States  Mexico and Puerto Rico  The stock is expected to see earnings growth of 43  year over year this year and has a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see  Sectors to AvoidFinancialsSPDR S P Regional Banking ETF   CSE KRE    with AUM of  2 2 billion and average daily volume of 8 3 million shares  offers broad exposure to the regional banks segment  The fund charges 35 bps in annual fees and has a Zacks ETF Rank  3 With a market cap of  20 6 billion  State Street Corporation   NYSE STT   is one of the world s leading providers of financial services to institutional investors  including investment servicing  investment management and investment research and trading  The stock is expected to post earnings decline of 14 5  for this year  It carries a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  IndustrialsZacks  3 Ranked Invesco S P 500 Equal Weight Industrials ETF   ASX RGI   offers exposure to the broad industrial sector with equal weight exposure  It has AUM of  204 6 million and trades in an average daily volume of nearly 22 000 shares  read    Astec Industries Inc    NASDAQ ASTE   is a manufacturer of specialized equipment for building and restoring the world s infrastructure  It has a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  and market cap of  684 7 million  Its earnings are expected to decline 19 9  for this year Consumer DiscretionaryInvesco DWA Consumer Cyclicals Momentum ETF  provides exposure to consumer discretionary companies that are showing relative strength  momentum   With AUM of  50 8 million and average daily volume of 13 000 shares  the fund carries a Zacks ETF Rank  3 Sony Corporation   NYSE SNE    which develops and manufactures consumer and industrial electronic equipment  has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  and a market cap of  66 billion  It is expected to see earnings decline of 41 4  for this fiscal year  ending March 2020  Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox Zacks  free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis  as well as top performing ETFs  each week ",2019-06-19,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/sector-etfs--stocks-to-buy-or-avoid-post-fed-meeting-200433305,200433305

21284,242799,ASTE,Astec  ASTE  Up 35  YTD After 48  Drop In 2018  What s Next ,opinion,Astec Industries Inc    NASDAQ ASTE   has been performing well so far this year with the stock gaining on the back of upbeat results and favorable markets  The stock had suffered a setback in 2018 primarily owing to the incremental input costs as a result of the imposition of tariffs on steel imports Shares of the company had tanked 48  in 2018  compared with the  s decline of 21   However  the stock staged a comeback this year  having rallied 35  year to date  outperforming the industry s growth of 11  What Weighed on the Stock in 2018 The announcement of tariffs on steel imports into the United States last year was a big blow to the manufacturing sector  Given that steel is one of the primary raw materials  every manufacturing     company bore the brunt of rising steel prices owing to the tariffs  and Astec was no exception  Further  a stronger dollar impacted Astec s international sales Factors Favoring the Stock in 2019The stock has recovered so far this year driven by Astec s upbeat guidance for 2019 and solid order activity  The company s focus on generating savings from strategic sourcing improvement is also working in its favor Astec reported adjusted earnings per share of  2 92 in 2018  up 17  from the prior year  Adjusted sales grew 6  year over year to  1 25 billion  For 2019  sales are expected to grow between 4  and 7  from 2018  Earnings per share for the year are anticipated to range in between  3 00 and  3 50  The mid point of the guidance represents an annual growth of 11   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share is currently pegged at  3 22  reflecting year over year growth of 10 3   While the consensus estimates for revenues is pegged at  1 29 billion  a projected growth of 10 5  from 2017 Favorable end markets bode well for Astec  The company is witnessing strong order intake in the Aggregate and Mining Group as well as in the Energy Group  Higher infrastructure spending and favorable commodity prices are likely drive demand in mining industry  The current long term Highway Bill  steady state in local government infrastructure spending and improving construction markets is likely to bolster revenues  Astec remains well poised in the long term backed by the global population growth  increased urbanization and the need to repair the ageing infrastructure The company is analyzing all areas of its business for opportunities of operational improvement  Astec anticipates savings from strategic sourcing improvement to add approximately 2  to gross margin in 2019 and free up  25 million in cash as a result of better inventory management Astec is pursuing a potential sale of the Georgia pellet plant  The company had forayed into the wood pellet industry in 2012 in order to diversify into new areas at a time when road building and aggregate industries were at a low  However  it was a prudent move to exit from pellet industry owing to size  complexity and time frames associated with the fabrication  installation and commissioning of wood pellet plants Astec decided to discontinue operations at its subsidiary in Germany  Astec Mobile Machinery  as it did not generate expected results  The company reported a restructuring charge of  1 8 million in the fourth quarter and expects the wind down of this business to be completed in 2019  Going forward  this will lead to an annual saving of  1 million  Astec has also consolidated its Dillman operation into Astec Incorporated  Driven by these initiatives  the infrastructure group is likely to bolster growth  moving forward Astec already has a dominant share of the asphalt plant market in North America and plans to introduce two new entry level asphalt plants in 2019 that are designed to better meet the needs of the international market and improve competitiveness  Additionally  it will be introducing new paving equipment for both the domestic and international markets  The launch of new products from this group in 2019 will drive the segment s revenues Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderAstec currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  Meanwhile  investors interested in the Industrial Products sector can consider better ranked players like Mueller Industries  Inc    NYSE MLI    Sun Hydraulics Corporation   NASDAQ SNHY   and Zebra

have rallied 38  year to date  Sun Hydraulics Corporation has projected earnings growth rate of 13  for the current year  The stock has appreciated 51  year to date  Zebra Technologieshas estimated

21285,242800,ASTE,Is Astec Industries  ASTE  A Good Pick For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Astec Industries  Inc    NASDAQ ASTE   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Astec Industries has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14 5  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 18 23  However  if we focus on the long term PE trend  Astec Industries  current PE level puts it way below its midpoint of 26 05 over the past five years Also  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Industrial Products Market s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 17 64  This indicates that the stock is undervalued right now  compared to its peers Further  Astec Industries has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 12 65  which is lower than the current level  So  it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Astec Industries stock P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Astec Industries has a P S ratio of just 0 79  This is quite lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 31 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this stands below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Astec Industries currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Astec Industries a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Astec Industries might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of C  This gives ASTE a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen no upward revisions versus two downward revisions in the past sixty days  while the full year estimate has seen two upward versus one downward revision in the same time period This has had a mixed impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has dipped 9 9  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has climbed 4 5   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Astec Industries  Inc  Price and Consensus   This mixed trend is why the stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineAstec Industries is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Though  a strong industry rank  among Top 17  of more than 250 industries  further supports the growth potential of the stock  with a Zacks Rank  3 it is hard to get too excited about this company overall However  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly outperformed the market at large  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Is Your Investment Advisor Fumbling Your Financial Future See how you

21329,242844,ASTE,Astec  ASTE  Rides On Solid Backlog Despite Recent Headwinds,opinion,On Mar 9  we issued an updated research report on Astec Industries  Inc    NASDAQ ASTE    The manufacturer of road building equipment is poised to gain from strong backlog  progress in product sales activity  improvement in the Energy group as well as the U S  tax reform  However  uncertainty in government funding for federal highway projects  strong U S  dollar and steel tariffs are expected to dent its performance in the near future Let s illustrate the factors in detail Strong Backlog to Fuel Astec s SalesAstec s total backlog improved 13 7  year over year in 2017  Backlog improved across all its segments during fourth quarter 2017  The company s Infrastructure group won a number of orders during the quarter  The Energy group backlog also experienced increased quoting activity for oil and gas drilling products  Astec s Brazil facility continues to record growth in quoting activity  For 2018  the company expects revenues to grow on this robust backlog Rising Orders to Assist Energy GroupAstec s Energy group experienced strong sales activity during the recently reported quarter for products targeted at infrastructure  oil  chemical and food industries  The company has built concrete plants in the Energy group and the quoting activity remains promising for these plants  Further  it witnessed huge number of customers in the World of Concrete Show held this January  as its RexCon and CEI subsidiaries displayed the latest innovative products  Both subsidiaries secured orders in the show  Being the second major supplier  RexCon and SEI teams are working together on Astec s strategy to become the largest supplier concrete plant in the United States Tax Reform to Aid EarningsAstec expects its annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 25 26  in 2018 compared to 41  recorded in the prior year  This reduced tax rate due to the tax reform will substantially benefit the company s earnings Product Sales Activity Remains a CatalystAstec stated that 2017 was a year of transition as the company rolled out an extraordinary amount of products at the ConExpo show last March  The company also worked through installation and startup issues for customers  Thus  it will definitely win contracts from more consumers who were interested in innovative products at the ConExpo Adverse Impact of Strong U S  dollarFrom mid 2012 through 2017  the strong U S  dollar has dampened pricing in certain foreign markets the company serves  Astec predicts the U S  dollar to remain strong as compared to historical rates in the near term relative to most foreign currencies  Escalating domestic interest rates or weakening economic conditions abroad might cause the U S  dollar to strengthen further  which will impact Astec s international sales Uncertain Government Funding Remains a ConcernAstec will be affected by uncertainty in the level of government funding for federal highway projects  The Fixing America s Surface Transportation Act  FAST Act   enacted in December 2015  approved funding for highways of approximately  205 billion and funding for transit projects of approximately  48 billion for the five year period ending Sep 30  2020  Although continued funding is anticipated under the FAST Act  it might be at lower levels than originally approved  This could lead to a slowdown in infrastructure equipment spending which will impact Astec s performance Steel Tariffs to Impede Near Term ProfitAstec uses steel as a major raw material to manufacture products  Therefore  steel surcharges remain a concern  As a result  Trump s recent announcement to impose a 25  tariff on the imports of steel will thwart the company s performance Share Price PerformanceAstec

21406,242921,ASTE,Machinery Stocks Earnings Slated For Jul 26  CAT  JBT   More,opinion,The performance of machinery stocks last year was nothing worth writing home about due to adverse currency movements  weakening economic conditions  particularly in China  and multi year low commodity prices plaguing the industry  Even in the last quarter  this industry  which is broadly grouped under the Industrial Products sector  one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors   suffered an unceremonious 22 2  drop in earnings The second quarter does not paint an impressive picture either  Only 23 8  of the companies have reported so far  clocking a 3  improvement in earnings for the quarter  However  it s still too early to rejoice  In fact  considering all the companies that are yet to report  the sector s earnings are expected to record an 8  drop this quarter The second quarter projections for the 374 yet to report companies show that total S P 500 earnings will be down 3 4  due to 0 5  lower revenues  This means we are looking toward the fifth consecutive quarter of an earnings decline  In fact  9 of the 16 Zacks sectors are expected to be in the negative territory  with the Energy sector accounting for the maximum drag  For a detailed account  please read our  report Meanwhile  weak industrial production numbers  which comprise the output of the manufacturing  mining and utility sectors  add to the woes  Per the latest Federal Reserve report  industrial production inched up 0 6  in June  after declining 0 3  in May  In the second quarter  industrial production suffered the third consecutive quarter of decline  reflecting an annual rate of decline of 1   Industrial demand remained soft in the quarter due to the weak global oil   gas markets  Moreover  capacity utilization has been decreasing  indicating sluggish industrial capex spending While residential and commercial construction continue to be a source of strength  key markets for the machinery industry   oil and gas  agriculture  and mining   are pulling the industry down  with no possibility of an improvement any time soon  The U S  rig count currently stands at 414  down 47 3  from a year ago  The rig count is likely to dwindle even further  in tandem with falling oil prices  Moreover  the U S  Department of Agriculture estimates farm income to decline further this year  Persistent economic weakness in China has sucked the mining machinery industry into its vortex Keeping these headwinds in mind  it will be interesting to see how some of the machinery stocks fare in their upcoming releases next week  Apart from beats and misses  focus will also be on steps taken to overcome the headwinds as well as on their outlook Caterpillar  Inc  s   NYSE CAT   results  which are slated to be announced before the opening bell on Jul 26  is a much awaited event as the world s largest manufacturer of construction and mining equipment is often considered an economic bellwether  As results during the past few quarters have reflected a weak mining industry  low oil prices  a stronger U S  dollar and China s economic woes  investors must be looking forward to see whether this quarter will be any different Last quarter  Caterpillar s earnings came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  The stock beat estimates in three of the four trailing quarters  with a positive average surprise of 2 21  CATERPILLAR INC Price and EPS Surprise   Even though the effect of weak mining and agriculture will be reflected in Caterpillar s results  perked up restructuring actions should lead to significant cost savings  Another ray of hope is in the pickup in construction related activity  which might mitigate the headwinds  We expect Caterpillar to come up with a positive earnings surprise this season backed by the combination of its Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and  of  2 08    Read more    Astec Industries  Inc    NASDAQ ASTE    the manufacturer and marketer of road building equipment  will also report second quarter fiscal 2016 results on Jul 26  before the opening bell In the prior quarter  Astec Industries posted a positive surprise of 5 48   However  the stock missed earnings thrice in the trailing four quarters  with an average negative surprise of 33 69  ASTEC INDS INC Price and EPS Surprise   Astec is poised to benefit from acquisitions and the launch of new products  Extension of the long term highway bill  further opportunity from pellet plants and strong infrastructure sales activity will also augment growth  However  Energy Group sales are expected to remain under pressure as lower oil prices have had a negative impact on oil production and exploration  Astec has a Zacks Rank  4  which along with a 0 00  ESP  makes an earnings beat unlikely this season John Bean Technologies Corporation   NYSE JBT    which primarily deals with providing solutions to the food processing and air transportation industries  will report second quarter results on Jul 26 Last quarter  John Bean Technologies delivered a positive earnings surprise of 13 33   The company has outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the last four quarters  with an average positive surprise of 12 16  JOHN BEAN TECH Price and EPS Surprise   John Bean Technologies has been benefiting from favorable market trends  with rising global demand for food equipment  The company has also been witnessing incremental consumer spending on both mobile and fixed equipment John Bean Technologies  Zacks Rank  3 and Earnings ESP of  1 72  makes surprise prediction difficult for this quarter Tennant Company   NYSE TNC   will report its second quarter fiscal 2016 results on Jul 26  before the market opens In the last reported quarter  Tennant Company posted a positive earnings surprise of 11 54   Notably  the company has delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 10 62  over the last four quarters TENNANT CO Price and EPS Surprise   Tennant will benefit from the strong product and technology pipeline  continued gains in emerging markets  return to growth in Europe  focus on strategic accounts and an enhanced go to market strategy designed to significantly expand Tennant s worldwide market coverage and customer base  However  unfavorable foreign currency and global economic volatility will remain headwinds We believe Tennant is likely to beat earnings given its Zacks

21408,242923,ASTE,Ride The Solid Price Momentum Of These 5 Stocks,opinion,When value or growth investing fails to fetch sustained profits  one should explore another time tested winning strategy that simply bets on the frontrunner stocks In other words  one of the most successful strategies today is to get in on momentum stocks at the right time Momentum is basically the tendency of winning stocks  i e  stocks that have outperformed the market in recent times  to keep winning and losing stocks to keep losing  It is based on the idea that once a stock establishes a trend  it is more likely to continue in that direction instead of moving against the drift At the core  momentum investing calls for investors to  Buy High  Sell Higher  Momentum versus Other StylesIt is worth pondering over how the momentum strategy compares to the other styles of investing over time  Recent research indicates that the size premium for small cap stocks has shrunk dramatically since the 1980s  value premium has also declined dramatically since the1990s Academics are of the opinion that once research on factor premiums  like size and value  become known to public  the investment world catches on and the premium gradually erodes However  unlike other investment styles  momentum premium has stood the test of time  remaining remarkably robust and persistentever since it was identified by financial academics in the 1990s But Why Does Momentum Strategy Work There is a simple reason to this  It works because we are humans There s a whole laundry list of behavioral biases that most investors exhibit  and these emotional responses and mistakes are the very reason that momentum strategy works  For instance  we all know of investors who are afraid to book losses  and hence hold onto losing stocks for too long  hoping that they will come back to their original prices  On the other hand  investors sell their winners way too early Furthermore  investors initially tend to under react to news  events or data releases  However  once things become clear  they tend to go with the herd and overreact  causing dramatic price reactions These behavioral issues extend trends  and thusopen up a huge opportunity for momentum players to make profits  So basically  it s a way to profit from the general human tendency to extrapolate current trends into the future Momentum investing is based on that gap in time that exists before the mean reversion occurs  i e  before prices become rational again Chase the AlphaMomentum strategies have been known to be alpha generative over long periods of time and across markets  So obviously  this strategy is quite tricky to implement  as detecting these trends is no child s play Here  we have created a strategy that will help investors get in on these fast movers and make handsome gains  Our screen will help you to take advantage of both long term price momentum and a short term pullback in price  which would reflect some profit taking in the
