Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group  David Wichmann  Please go ahead David S  Wichmann    Chief Executive OfficerGood morning and thank you for joining us  Six weeks ago  we had the privilege of spending the day with many of you at our annual Investor Conference  providing an in depth look at the accelerating opportunities we see to serve more people  more deeply and to grow strongly into 2020 and well beyond As we conclude 2019 and step into the New Year  the performance of our business strengthens our confidence in the themes  opportunities  and outlooks of that day  as evidenced by today s results  We remain highly focused on driving affordability  innovating with consumer and customer response to products and services  improving operating performance and advancing NPS Full year 2019 adjusted earnings per share were stronger than our Investor Conference outlook  growing 17  for the year to  15 11 per share  Full year revenues exceeded  242 billion  growing  16 billion over 2018 with notable gains in our Medicare  care delivery and pharmacy care services businesses  Full year cash flows were  18 5 billion dollars or 1 3 times net income We finished the year encouraged by continued performance improvement in Medicaid  Early market interest in our new innovative line of employer sponsored benefit offerings and 2020 individual Medicare Advantage annual enrollment results  which were our strongest ever  Within our Medicare Advantage offerings  including dual eligible growth we expect to serve nearly 700 000 more people in 2020  the upper end of the range of performance offered at our Investor Conference Our fourth quarter medical and operating cost positions continued to improve meaningfully enterprise wide with ample opportunity for further progress on both of these fronts  And our NPS improved nicely in 2019 across our businesses  particularly with network care providers  enrollees in Medicare Advantage and dual special needs plans as well as patients served by our OptumCare and pharmacy care services businesses Improved cost and higher satisfaction propelled by meaningful innovation allow us to contribute more comprehensively to the development and deployment of the kind of next generation health system needed in the US and globally  A more forward looking modern health system built around the people we serve seamlessly woven into their lives  simple  convenient  transparent and compassionate  a health system that is more affordable creates a better experience for both patients and physicians and improves health outcomes The health system we are helping to build will better meet the personalized needs of people  it leverages the next generation data analytics  such as the individual health record to empower patients and their doctors with actionable Intelligence that drive next best actions to improve decision making in real time  We are committed to a future where every person has access to high quality  affordable healthcare that meets their unique healthcare needs and financial means  We are employing specific actions to help achieve this  driving better health outcomes and aiming ultimately to reduce the healthcare cost trend to general inflation levels even with an ageing more chronically ill population Notably the bipartisan repeal of the ACA taxes in December was a strong step toward improving affordability for Americans  It will greatly assist those who have been most affected by the cost of those taxes  especially seniors  small employers  and those who are individually insured  As we continue to do better for those we serve  we will grow helping improve the health system one person at a time  intensely focused on driving improved consumer and physician experiences Looking to the years ahead  our strengthening capabilities and diversified complementary businesses operating in a large growing healthcare market position us well to achieve our long term adjusted earnings per share growth rate objective of 13  to 16   while we continue as always to invest in the future for sustainable market leading performance and advancing shareholder returns With that  let me turn it to UnitedHealth Group President and Optum s Chief Executive Officer  Andrew Witty to discuss Optum s results and momentum heading into the New Year Andrew Witty    Chief Executive Officer  OptumThank you  Dave  At Optum  we re encouraged on humbled by the expanding opportunities to grow and serve more people  more deeply  There s a distinct energy and eagerness across all businesses as we enter 2020 In 2019  Optum revenues reached  113 billion  growing 12  year over year  Total operating earnings grew 14  to  9 4 billion  OptumHealth revenues reached  30 3 billion in 2019  up 26  led by OptumCare  our care delivery business  We re steadily expanding into new geographies and expanding the depth and breadth of services in existing regions to better provide patients with the highest quality convenient and affordable health services  One measure that help    that will illustrate how we are serving people more comprehensively is revenue per consumer served  which grew 26  in the quarter  This measure will continue strongly advancing as we further build out our integrated care delivery network Turning to OptumRx  revenues of  74 3 billion grew 7   even with the previously discussed impact of a single large customer transition  The 2020 selling season for core pharmacy benefit services has now mostly concluded and it was our strongest ever  Through our other pharmacy care and specialty drug businesses  given our current positions we see significant opportunity to more fully serve patients pharmacy needs in their communities and drive better adherence and clinical outcome At OptumInsight  revenues of  10 billion grew 11  and the revenue backlog was up 14  to  19 3 billion  OptumInsight perhaps more than any of our other businesses has a dual role  it has both unmatched capabilities to help distinguish our other businesses and serves as a profitable growing externally facing business on its own I d like to spend a few extra minutes this morning on how we view OptumInsight and why we are encouraged by its potential  I ll start with the foundations  First  deep data and advanced analytics are at the core supporting modern technologies and platforms to make the health system more interoperable  transparent and efficient  Second  research  consulting and large scale managed services enabled by data analytics and digital and operational innovations made the consumer experience simpler  smarter  and more compassionate  And third  clinical expertise combined with rich data and analytics drive measurably better patient care and outcomes reduce its friction while lowering the total cost of care We are connecting the health system to deliver better outcomes  lower costs and improved experience for patients and their clinicians  This includes developing the connective infrastructure that integrates clinical systems  revenue management platform  and administrative claims transactions to enable critical bidirectional data exchange  Our solutions are harmonizing and organizing billions of transactions  while applying considerable intelligence through our advanced technology  clinical ontology  and data analytics capabilities We want to ensure critical decision support information gets to the right people at the right time  with rigorous protocols to protect patient privacy  all while offering full transparency of health system performance on both quality and cost  Our Optum360 business helps health systems and hospitals improved revenue performance and patient experience  We deploy natural language processing for computer assisted coding and documentation and provide data interchange and information exchange solutions as well as patient access services  Optum360 now manages about  70 billion in annual billings for unaffiliated customers  More than 5 billion pages of clinical documents are processed annually by our natural language processing engines  These are used in a variety of other applications and customer basis to help inform clinical actions and create administrative efficiencies from the more than 80  of the clinical record that is essentially free text such as physician notes and discharge summary Payment integrity is among OptumInsight s strongest growing businesses  We provide compliance and cost containment solutions both prior to and following the payment of a claim  We offer a comprehensive portfolio of services for data mining and predictive modeling to help over 250 national  state and local health plans and others ensure appropriate payments for services  saving billions annually Within OptumInsight technology businesses  we apply advanced analytics and deep learning models to healthcare    to healthcare data covering nearly 240 million people to help optimize clinical outcomes and reduce the cost of care  Key offerings include population health  risk analytics and technology support And our research and consulting businesses provide thought leadership and expertise that reaches more than 200 000 leaders across the sector  Importantly  this business keeps us at the forefront of how health systems and providers are thinking about and approaching the future and drives deeper more integrated customer relationships across the broader Optum businesses As we turn into the new decade  we stand at potentially formative moment where the application of leading 21st century technology and machine powered analytical protocols will open up for the first time the opportunity to create ever more precise predictions of individual and system health status and risk  This will accelerate a much more focused set of interventions to improve outcomes  I have no doubt  this will be an increasingly critical element of our Optum wide goal of improving clinical outcomes  quality and affordability Now I ll turn the call over to Dirk McMahon  UnitedHealthcare s Chief Executive Officer Dirk McMahon    Chief Executive Officer  UnitedHealthcareThank you Andrew  UnitedHealthcare is deeply embedded in every aspect of the health system  from how to finance and pay for healthcare to engaging people and aligning incentives to promote healthier behaviors and better medicine to improve overall health at lower costs UnitedHealthcare revenues grew by more than  10 billion to  194 billion in 2019  Operating earnings increased by 13  or  1 2 billion to  10 3 billion  led by the strength in our Medicare and dual special needs businesses  As Dave noted  we re off to a strong start in Medicare Advantage this year  I d like to quickly share how we are helping to build a better health system  First  improving affordability  second  engaging and serving people  third  advancing product innovation  and fourth  sorting through hands on data driven clinical care Let s start with affordability  because that is the gating factor for greater access to care and improving the consumer experience  One of our goals is to engage more deeply with the highest performing physicians and other clinicians to advance both quality and affordability  We know these high performing providers achieve considerably better health outcomes  while lowering the total cost of care  Our medical cost trend over the last five years has strongly outperformed the national average  We are committed to driving significantly lower rates of healthcare spending growth than the industry  We see billions of additional dollars in potential savings for consumers and customers from areas such as our site of service initiatives and more deeply embedding digital tools to reduce the administrative burden for physicians We are also using digital and physical strategies to engage consumers in new ways to simplify their experience  reduce their financial burden  and lower the total cost of care  For example  for the nearly 0 5 million people enrolled in our Motion program  We offer incentives for increased individual mobility  People can earn more than  1000 a year when they achieve defined walking frequency and intensity targets  People enrolled in Motion are achieving better health at a meaningfully lower costs  that is why we re expanding this program and extending product designs that reward stronger consumer engagement and align incentives with their doctor A third area is product innovation  We are seeing early signs of customer interest in our innovative new offerings and consumer centric products that better align to the unique needs and financial means of people  while engaging them in managing their health  Some examples are Harmony  a new collaboration with OptumCare providers unites high quality care and coverage  creating a more integrative and effective consumer experience with as much as 20  savings for our fully insured customers  All Savers offer small employers with highly flexible affordable health plans and reduces employee out of pocket costs  with low or no preventative and primary care coverage  NexusACO enables large employers to offer a single ACO    ACO based plan nationwide  incentivizing employees to choose high performing providers and driving better outcomes through care coordination Bind  provides first dollar coverage and allows people to add coverage on demand for planned procedures offered by high value providers following rigorous care pathways based on best known science  while costing approximately 15  less than comparable plans  And finally  our virtual first product is attractive to the digital first generation  This new product offers zero dollar copay  24 by 7 virtual care support at a lower price than traditional products  These are some examples of our innovation focus and health benefits and you should expect more as we redouble our efforts to engage consumers in more impactful ways and accelerate our growth in this category Lastly  we are deploying relevant information at the point of care to improve the way care is received and managed  Point of care assist is a tool that puts real time patient information at the fingertips of doctors and their EMRs  providing a seamless clinical workflow experience  This improves adherence to clinical protocols  facilitates real time authorization approvals  and helps refer the patient to premium designated specialists  Utility of this tool is significant for all as doctors save time and money  consumers avoid cost surprises  and most importantly health outcomes are improved  As we look to 2020 and beyond  there is a  900 billion untapped managed care market opportunity and health benefits  much of it in government programs where we have grown strongly and we look to serve more people more deeply across the system Now  I ll turn it over to John Rex  CFO of UnitedHealth Group John Rex    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you Dirk  This morning we reported full year revenues of  242 billion  up  15 9 billion or 7  year over year  driven by double digit revenue growth in Medicare and across Optum  Fourth quarter adjusted net earnings of  3 90 per share grew 19  and brought full year earnings to  15 11  growth of 17   Cash flows from operations of  18 5 billion  grew 18  over 2018 to 1 3 times net income  better than anticipated  partly due to timing factors Our balance sheet and return metrics remain strong  with return on equity of almost 26   We ended the year with a debt to capital ratio of around 40   even with over  10 billion of deployment for business combinations and capex   5 5 billion in share repurchases and a 20  dividend increase Medical reserves developed favorably in the fourth quarter by  270 million  including  150 million from 2019  Overall  medical costs were well managed  resulting in an 82 5  medical care ratio for full year 2019  We continue to be highly attentive to operating costs as part of our overall affordability agenda  In 2019  our operating cost ratio of 14 5  improved 50 basis points  reflecting 60 basis points of operating cost productivity and the deferral of the health insurance tax  partially offset by the effect of business mix changes and continued investments in innovation  service  and growth We enter 2020 with diversified growth momentum  balance sheet strength and financial flexibility  On earnings progression  we continue to expect 47  to 48  of full year earnings per share to be realized in the first half of the year  A point to keep in mind on the quarterly progression  2019 first quarter has one fewer workday than 2018  resulting in a higher earnings level  This year the first quarter has a more normal mix  but then adds an extra day due to leap year  Taken together  the day count shifting has a year over year impact on the medical care ratio of about 80 basis points  this will result in the first quarter 2020 MCR running higher than the second quarter and earnings per share progressing accordingly  with just under 55  of the first half earnings expected to be realized in the second  Phonetic  quarter  These impacts of course were fully contemplated in the 2020 outlook we provided at the beginning of December For full year 2020  we continue to expect revenues to approach  262 billion and adjusted net earnings per share in a range of  16 25 to  16 55  Consistent with our prior practices  we will more formally address these and other expectations after the first quarter With that  I ll turn it back to Dave David S  Wichmann    Chief Executive OfficerThank you  John  As you can tell  we are confident in the outlook for our diversified and growing enterprise for 2020 and beyond  Our businesses remain strong and well positioned for continued balanced growth by delivering even higher levels of societal value  We remain committed to our mission and an intense focus on serving one person at a time at increasing levels of value  more affordable  better outcomes  and improved experiences while generating strong returns for you  our shareholders Operator  let s open it up for questions  One per caller  please Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions  We ll take our first question from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research  Please go ahead Justin Lake    Wolfe Research    AnalystThanks  good morning  Wanted to ask about the quarter in terms of medical cost  looks like it came in better than you expected versus the update at the Investor Day any color there specifically  if you can expand on what s    how you re seeing kind of Medicaid progress from a cost and risk pool rate perspective as you kind of come into 2020 that would be really helpful as well  Thanks David S  Wichmann    Chief Executive OfficerJohn Rex John Rex    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerHey Justin  good morning  Yeah  I think I d point out a few things here  You re correct  we did come in just a little bit better than our guidance at the Investor Conference  And if you think that    first I d call it broadly across the businesses as we continue to see the impact of the affordability initiatives that we ve been very focused on  having traction and having impact  So broadly across that I think it s fair to say also that we certainly did see some continued improvement in our Medicaid businesses  It s a place that we ve been  that we ve been focused on for a while here and that was also contributor  But broadly  I d say across our businesses as we saw those affordability initiatives having traction David S  Wichmann    Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Justin  Next question please OperatorOur next question from A J  Rice with Credit Suisse  Please go ahead A J  Rice    Credit Suisse    AnalystYeah  it s just    it sounds like on the call today you are reaffirming your expectations around Medicare Advantage enrollment  Obviously CMS has come out with their January numbers  it looks like in terms of the percentage enrolled in January  you re little bit lighter than you were a year ago  I don t know if that s a fair comparison  but I wondered is there anything in the data that s    I don t know if you have looked at what they put out that is missing from your perspective  I know it shows you down in group MA and maybe you re going to pick up and group MA  But just flesh out a little further what group MA over the course of the year would anything to reassure us about your expectations around MA for this year David S  Wichmann    Chief Executive OfficerThanks A J  You know we re very pleased with our AEP results and I d say is by far it s our strongest year ever in individual Medicare  We did reaffirm the guidance but near to the upper end of that guidance today  So we feel pretty strongly on    with respect to our overall performance Tim Noel  can you add some color on some of the other questions Tim Noel    Chief Executive Officer  UnitedHealthcare Medicare   RetirementYeah  good morning A J  Thanks for the question  In first half  some of that CMS partial AEP reporting can be a little bit misleading  And Dave said you know first and foremost  want to reiterate the confidence in our full year enrollment growth that we shared at Investor Conference for MA  And just to revisit that briefly  we said 500 to 550 000 in Medicare Advantage growth in the M R  Phonetic  business  which includes both group and individual MA  And we also said that it d be up to 700 000 in MA growth including duals within our community and state business  So when AEP completes  we ll have grown by 370 000 in individual MA including the duals better in CMS  and that s up 140  over last year s AEP and is our strongest performance ever in the annual enrollment period  We expect this to drive full year results about 700 000 member growth in individual MA and that split on January net growth versus the rest of the year is roughly 50 50 and that s consistent with historical pacing and also full year supported by the momentum that we ve seen in AEP With respect to Group  you re right Group MA contracted modestly in the CMS reporting  When January all settles out  we expect that to be down about 65  but that will strengthen to flat to down 25 as the year closes out  And finally  all told  really great start to the year  strong signal of confidence for the full year in our growth guidance shared at Investor Conference David S  Wichmann    Chief Executive OfficerThank you A J  Next question  Next question please OperatorWe ll go next to Scott Fidel with Stephens  Please go ahead your line is open Scott Fidel    Stephens    AnalystThanks  Just sticking on the membership updates for 2020 and obviously you just gave some good detail on Medicare  Just interested if there is anything to call out in terms of either the commercial business or the Medicaid business  in terms of expectations on membership relative to the ranges that you had provided at Investor Day  Then also just specifically within that just interested in how you are sort of approaching the North Carolina Medicaid situation  just given the budget situation there in terms of what you re assuming for timing implementation of that and how many lives you have factored in around North Carolina  Thanks David S  Wichmann    Chief Executive OfficerGood question  Scott  Thank you  Dirk McMahon will start and then Heather Cianfrocco can discuss Medicaid Dirk McMahon    Chief Executive Officer  UnitedHealthcareYeah  on the    thanks  thanks for the question Scott  So we ll be down a little bit in enrollment for 01 01 20  Phonetic  in both the fully insured and ASO areas  But as the    throughout the course of the year we expect to gain membership in both areas  as we previously guided in December  As we look at 2020  we re going to continue with the pricing discipline that I previously talked about as we balance enrollment growth with our margin expectations  We remain    we remain focused on delivering a unique value proposition for our customers and consumers Hard to tell you where I m optimistic for next year  in fully insured  expect strength in individual products and their middle market  As I look at our ASO block  I look at our all favors and I look at our middle market as well  With that  turn over to Heather Heather Cianfrocco    Chief Executive Officer  UnitedHealthcare Community   StateThanks  Yeah  so good question with respect to    start with membership and talk a little bit about North Carolina  So in our membership for this year  we do    we do expect growth in Medicaid this year  And that s coming from a couple of places  North Carolina is in our 2020 guidance right now  We ve got some other things in there  We ve got some increases from    to markets like our Washington win last year  Texas win  recent Texas win  we are going to see some Nebraska expansion and then we see another strong year of  Indecipherable  as Tim just talked about for 2020  We can    really well positioned there with new county expansion  service their expansion and our AEP is off to a really  really strong start  so really excited about that Pressure is obviously North Carolina  So it s in our 2020 membership outlook and our revenue outlook and we assume it right now to come in about mid year  We re really honored  we were selected  we re ready for implementation and we re eager to start serving North Carolinians despite the budget situation there  There is strong support for the program and for managed care there  So we re continuing to monitor the implementation date  We ll keep you posted on that and you all watch that as well  In the meantime  we ve got    we re excited about the opportunity  It s in our outlook and we look forward to hopefully getting that on track here as close to mid year as possible David S  Wichmann    Chief Executive OfficerAnd just to add on to that a little bit  Scott  we won also in Kentucky  we were pleased to win  Obviously that s being rebid now  but we ll hopefully prevail in the end there as well  And it s a strong RFP season for Medicaid broadly and I see the business having come around to being positioned with its turnaround  just in time to compete ferociously for that business  So  we re pretty bullish about the opportunity that exists in Medicaid and I think we re well positioned to grow Thanks for the question Scott  Next question please OperatorAnd we ll go next to Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities  please go ahead Peter Costa    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystGood morning  everyone  Nice quarter  I d like to take it up a little bit in terms of looking at sort of the longer term picture for Medicare  Couple of changes in the Medicare program  I m curious what you think of as being the biggest risks to you in terms of your business  And those are paying for social determinants of health  which is something new for this year  allowing ESRD patients to join next year and Medicare fee for service  direct contracting by providers is starting  Can you talk about those three items and if they are risks to you David S  Wichmann    Chief Executive OfficerSure  We d be happy to discuss all three of those  Tim Tim Noel    Chief Executive Officer  UnitedHealthcare Medicare   RetirementYeah thanks  Peter  So I think I ll take ESRD first  but also want to caution you know the long term outlook  especially with respect to 2021  and really any year it s a little bit premature to get into some of the nuts and bolts of how we see the landscape shaping out  But on ESRD we re very supportive of the change that goes into effect on 2021 and encouraged by the opportunity to serve more people  We re not concerned with some of the unknown elements around the reimbursement in payment models  We ll learn those details very soon  We remain confident expecting that those models will be fair  adequate and importantly  we believe that these people will be better served in Medicare Advantage  Also important to keep in mind  we serve 40 000 Medicare Advantage enrollees with ESRD today  Adults develop the disease post enrollment and our focus that these members is both on prevention and also on treatment  So we re pleased to have the opportunity to expand our reach and impact with patients that have the disease at the timing of enrollment With respect to source of determinants  we continue to have a key focus of our business  Consistently referring folks inside of programs where appropriate and some of the additional flexibility to apply social determinants and plan design are elements that we re leveraging in some of our demonstration projects in 2020  We re excited to learn a little bit more about this  soon as the year progresses and look for more opportunities to do things in this area in 2021 David S  Wichmann    Chief Executive Officer Speech Overlap  Pardon me Peter Costa    Wells Fargo Securities    AnalystThe last one was physician direct contracting  Fee for service Medicare Brian Thompson    Chief Executive Officer  UnitedHealthcare Government ProgramsHey Peter  Brian Thompson here  We re encouraged by that as well  I think similar to what we ve done with the bundled payment program  it s a good opportunity to work on advancing traditional Medicare and we re encouraged by that thinking and creativity and look forward to participate David S  Wichmann    Chief Executive OfficerAnd I might add overall Peter that we re bullish obviously overall on the outlook for both Medicare Advantage  but also the dual special needs marketplace as well  They re both very large today and growing end markets  MA is clearly outperforming fee for service in terms of overall benefit coverages and the quality of outcomes and the returns that people are getting in terms of their overall satisfaction  And so no surprise that it is performing as well and it seems to be gaining some momentum  So we look forward to continuing to compete hopefully growing at these levels  if not higher going forward Next question please OperatorAnd we ll take our next question from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research  Please go ahead Josh Raskin    Nephron Research    AnalystThanks  good morning  Question around the sort of broad space that s growing around physician enablement and I m curious it seems like there s been a lot of interest  a lot of new competitors that are kind of focused on that  I know Optum has been very early  do you think of Optum as sort of the market leader and it s just broad movement of physicians taking more risk  is this positive for UnitedHealth Group Andrew Witty    Chief Executive Officer  OptumJosh  thanks so much for the questions  it is Andrew  Yeah  we absolutely see physicians very much as a central element of improving care delivery  quality  and cost  It is what really driving OptumCare  which is clearly the central part of OptumHealth  As we see physicians move toward taking more risk  we see improvements across the board in terms of resource allocation  prevention focus  ensuring clinical outcome is maximized  We re very encouraged by that trend  This year alone we d expect about 150 000 more patients to go into our physician risk managed programs across OptumCare  We continue to see that trend accelerate  It s very much  something that we then anchor the build out of the rest of our OptumHealth portfolio around  So in a sense is that thoughtfulness around how can we then create services  insight  data analytics  which help the physician make the best possible judgment to manage that overall risk profile of the patient  You see that then reflected in the relentless growth of the revenue per patient served across OptumHealth that s really been driven by this shift And so you re absolutely right  very important element for us  And it essentially becomes the core around  which we then envision and build our Support Services  our interventions and our analytics to empower the physicians to make the best possible decision on behalf of the patient  Thank you David S  Wichmann    Chief Executive OfficerI just add to that just slightly Josh  that UnitedHealthcare is working on physician enablement as well  This is what the core of Dirk s commentary this morning was around point of care assist  This is why we built and deploy the IHR and this is why we focus essentially in our Investor Conference around the way in which we engage both the digital and physical rounds to AI enable people to be able to operate much more effectively and serve their patients So thanks for the question  Next question please OperatorAnd we ll go next to Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America  Please go ahead Kevin Fischbeck    Bank of America    AnalystGreat  thanks  Just want to go back to Medicaid for a minute  Can you talk a little bit about  I think you mentioned that in Q4 maybe you saw some improvement on Medicaid  but can you talk about the expectation for the year  I guess in particular  I guess two things  one is the implication of redeterminations and the rate updates you will get relative to that  how are the rate updates going and do you    are you modeling additional redeterminations as the year goes on  And the second  just quickly going back North Carolina  if North Carolina got delayed into 2021 would that impact your EPS guidance or is it more of a revenue number at this point  Thanks David S  Wichmann    Chief Executive OfficerI say we re making progress on    across all dimensions of Medicaid right now on rate cost and quality  Heather  do you want to take those questions Heather Cianfrocco    Chief Executive Officer  UnitedHealthcare Community   StateSure  So maybe I ll start with the Medicaid performance  So we were pleased with the Q4 results  And when I say that I really mean there it s marching along right within expectations  was what we really executed on our affordability agenda  We see strong partnerships with our states to address what was for a period of time due to redeterminations or other underfunding issues  just acuity related underfunding  So as we look into 2020 I feel good about the progress made through all of  19  in particularly in the second half of  19 with respect to rates and with respect to affordability  And so as we come into 2020  we ve got a view into our Q1 rate renewals  they re right in line with our expectations  They are top above what they were at the same time in  19  We ve got a    we ve delivered on our clinical programs  We re seeing strong NPS  customer service scores and quality  So  I feel good about that  as I say that you still expect us to hit our target margin by the end of the year  So that just gives us renewed confidence in what was committed to you already  So expect our Medicaid business to continue to perform along that track and we ll be hard at work on it With respect to North Carolina  yeah I guess I ll just say again  we re monitoring it every day right now  I was going to say that we re continuing to push and it is a big component of our opportunity in 2020 from revenue and a membership perspective  But that being said  there is a lot of other growth opportunities that we re measuring to  We didn t have Kentucky in our guidance  but we also didn t    and that got pushed  but we also didn t have the  Indecipherable  bid that we just won  So we re going to be monitoring all those things  And right now we re going to kind of work for a mid year or close there too implementation and we ll keep you posted David S  Wichmann    Chief Executive OfficerKevin  Dave again  If I could just add  so if North Carolina where to get pushed to 2021  it would not affect our expectations for the year  Our guidance would stay the same  it is as it comes out of the chute it s a relatively modest margin product  Our market as is often the case so we wouldn t expect any material impact on our expectations for the year Thank you  Next question please OperatorAnd we ll go next to Lance Wilkes with Bernstein  Please go ahead Lance Wilkes    Bernstein    AnalystYeah  could you talk a little bit about PBM margin for the    for the quarter  Interested in  I mean the improvement there  how much of that is driven by just the mix shift from the transition of large client and how much is other initiatives like cross sales or sourcing initiatives David S  Wichmann    Chief Executive OfficerPrince John Prince    Chief Executive Officer  OptumRxHi Lance  John Prince  Thanks for the question  As you looked at the fourth quarter  the margin was elevated as expected  So when we gave our guidance at Investor Day  we were expecting the operating earnings margin around 6 3   6 4   So it is exactly what we expected  Why it was elevated  It is exactly what you mentioned was the loss of the large client where we lost the revenue  but it didn t really impact our operating earnings  The second driver was the supply chain strength in terms of our    continuing to negotiate with pharma manufacturers as well as the supply chain to get value to pass on to our clients  and so that was the other key driver As we look to 2020 guidance  you should expect our operating margin to fall back to where we have guided at Investor Day with 5 1  to 5 2  so that should be your expectation  It was more of an anomaly what happened in Q4 as expected David S  Wichmann    Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Lance  Next question please OperatorWe will go next to Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley  Please go ahead Ricky Goldwasser    Morgan Stanley    AnalystYeah  hi  good morning  So  you reiterated guidance this morning for 2020  Just wanted to clarify if the guidance already includes any impact from retail and mid year renewals and also the benefit from the Diplomat acquisition  And then    follow up on the    on the dual growth  I mean obviously 15  to 20  is what    is the implied growth  which is strong and above market  but when we think about that  Can you just kind of like help us think through the Part D dynamics and how that would flow through the P L  if it s going to have any impact on OptumRx throughout the year David S  Wichmann    Chief Executive OfficerWe ll have John Rex start and then shift to Tim Wicks or John Prince John Rex    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerHey Ricky  John Rex here  So in terms of those elements  you mentioned I say both immaterial in the scope of our company  You re correct  when we guided to 2020 initially the repeal of the hit was    the health insurance tax have not yet occurred  but I would call that immaterial to us  Yes  there is some impact but not material in terms of modest headwind in the scheme of our company  Not  not something that we would  we would call out  Also in terms of the Diplomat  the pending Diplomat acquisition also I d call that immaterial  really no impact  it will be neutral in terms of our 2020 outlook  John Prince John Prince    Chief Executive Officer  OptumRxThanks Ricky  John Prince  In terms of the other pieces on Part D component that is expected  So I think we re not changing our guidance for 2020  What we expect in terms of Part D and Diplomat is built into our guidance  And so  we re comfortable with our expectations David S  Wichmann    Chief Executive OfficerGreat  thank you Ricky  Next question please OperatorWe ll go next to Stephen Tanal with Goldman Sachs  Please go ahead Stephen Tanal    Goldman Sachs    AnalystGood Morning guys  thanks for the question  I guess  at this stage  I was just wondering if you could kindly give us a sense of what    HIT repeal  how we should be start to be thinking about modeling that in whether you commit the sort of at least the non tax deductibility of it going away kind of flowing to the bottom line or if it s still too early  And then maybe just could you comment on OptumHealth  just given the risk taking nature of what you guys are doing  I thought it d be interesting to hear from you all how the flu impacted the economics of that business in Q4  again sort of revenue  earnings  margin  Thanks David S  Wichmann    Chief Executive OfficerGreat  I ll touch on the HIT and then Wyatt Decker will comment on OptumHealth  So overall  the HIT  we are as I said in the prepared remarks  we are pleased as if this would weigh  obviously it s great for seniors  families of small businesses  and individual insurers as well on average for couple    senior couples it is  500 to  600 it pretty much carries out the same for a family of four that s sponsored by a small business  And so obviously this has a strong economic impact on these families and individuals  So it s terrific to see it get repealed The other thing about it is  it removes the excessive volatility  I m sure you re fatigued with it as we are  it s in  it s out and but more importantly in all of that is  is that it affects the volatility of pricing in the marketplace as well  So  hopefully you will see that stabilize as we get through 2020 and into 2021 as well  This    we re not going to discuss 2021 and what our strategies may be with respect to how we handle this  Obviously it s important that the tax value gets back into the hands of people that s what it was intended to do and that s what we intend to accomplish overall  And as John already indicated  while it has a drag on earnings for 2020  we re not changing our outlook as a result of that  that is small item in the broad scheme of themes And Wyatt Decker to discuss flu at OptumHealth Wyatt W  Decker    Chief Executive Officer  OptumHealthStephen thank you for the question  At OptumHealth and OptumCare we follow the usual flu modeling and we have not seen a material impact deviating from that in Q4 and we do not anticipate significant impact in Q1  As you may know it s been a reasonably robust flu season  but it s mostly the b strain  which is not as severe  So we also have a fee for service MedExpress practice  which tends to offset any hit we might take on the risk side  Thank you David S  Wichmann    Chief Executive OfficerThank you Wyatt  Just I want to clarify one thing that Ricky asked and I m not so sure we answered it correctly  It is really about whether not Diplomat  the proposed transaction is in our numbers for 2021 and our 2020  And the answer to that s no  It would not be in there  We don t include transactions in our forecasts until they close  So that is not included in there and as soon as it does close  quarter following we ll update our forecast accordingly  This is one of the reasons why we talked about the impact of capital deployment on our growth rate and how it can advance during the year because of transactions  In this case it will be very  very modest  but nonetheless I just wanted to make sure we have that clarification Thank you  Next question please OperatorWe ll go next to Steven Valiquette with Barclays  Please go ahead Steven Valiquette    Barclays    AnalystThanks  good morning everybody  Actually  not to beat the diplomat pharmacy acquisition topic to death  but I know it s not a huge acquisition for you financially  but despite that I do have to believe they were just almost immediately be a ton of operational synergies when folding that book of business into your existing PBM and specialty pharmacy operations  probably in reimbursement and also in pharmacy network contracts  So I guess I was hoping to hear more color around what you see is the biggest area of synergy at this stage  And then just conceptually could this deal move the needle for UNH overall in 2021  obviously you can make it a sound probably in 2020 not much  but could it move the needle for the company overall in 2021  Thanks David S  Wichmann    Chief Executive OfficerIt ll be nicely accretive to us  Unfortunately it also comes with a great deal of integration costs  most of which will hit 2020 as well  Would you touch on that John John Prince    Chief Executive Officer  OptumRxSure Steven it s John Prince just maybe talk a little more why we re doing the deal  because I think that s really at the core of it  which is to better serve individuals that have complex diseases like oncology  immunology and specialized infusion therapy  When you look at the capabilities of Diplomat around specialty pharmacy and infusion it fits well with the strategy of OptumRx focused on these unique populations that need better volume  helping improve their drug costs  improving health outcomes and overall value of care and doing it in a compassionate way  So we think it is a good fit of our two businesses that come together to better serve the key needs in the market  And so as we ve talked about before  strategically especially drug cost is a key focus for the future is polyclinics  I think that strategically fit very well  We re obviously still away from closing the transaction  we are actively doing our planning for that and we ll be ready to start that as we conclude the transaction in the first quarter Steven Valiquette    Barclays    AnalystI appreciate the color  Thanks David S  Wichmann    Chief Executive OfficerYeah  no problem  Next question please OperatorAnd we ll go next to Michael Newshel with Evercore ISI  Please go ahead Michael Newshel    Evercore ISI    AnalystThanks  Maybe just going back to the flu  I just wanted to confirm that those earlier comments also apply to the UnitedHealthcare side as well  You ve seen high outpatient activity  but severity in hospitalizations just don t appear to be that high at least to published yet David S  Wichmann    Chief Executive OfficerJeff Putnam Jeff Putnam    Chief Financial Officer  UnitedHealthcareYeah  thanks for the question  Yeah on the UnitedHealthcare side similar dynamics  The flu season as you see in the CDC data started early and we are having elevated incident levels on the outpatient side  but overall severity as was mentioned is lower there and in patient admits have been close to normal  So very modest impact in the fourth quarter David S  Wichmann    Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Michael  Next question please OperatorWe ll go next to Ralph Giacobbe with Citi  Please go ahead Ralph Giacobbe    Citi    AnalystThanks  good morning  You rolling out certain initiatives and benefit design changes to your fully insured book around site of service initiatives and prior off along with preferred lab network  etc  and it sounded like that actually benefited some    to some degree in the fourth quarter  Can you give us maybe a little bit of a sense of what proportion of the ASO book has adopted these initiatives may be for 2020 and or how we should think about sort of the uptake over time  Thanks David S  Wichmann    Chief Executive OfficerI don t think we ll talk about adoption rates in the large national accounts business  but Dirk you want to talk a little bit about your overall efforts around containing medical costs Dirk McMahon    Chief Executive Officer  UnitedHealthcareYeah  As we think about medical costs you mentioned very effectively site of service being rolled that out to a lot more codes in November  knees and procedures like that  We re also very focused on our network negotiations to try to drive unit costs lower in many areas  I look at our trend  two thirds of unit costs  the network is at the start of that  We re doing a lot of work in terms of increasing consumer engagement providing them with effective decision tools to rally in our other apps portal to other digital property to drive the right movements  And also got to thank Optum  a lot of work with our clinical models driving savings as well as payment integrity  as Andrew mentioned in his remarks  So we really have a full forward press on affordability  We think that is a primary driver of our ability to price effectively in the market and actually provide access for consumers and employers and everyone  So a lot of work on the affordability front David S  Wichmann    Chief Executive OfficerDirk and team at UnitedHealthcare doing a wonderful job on affordability broadly in medical cost obviously they re interested in getting healthcare to be much more affordable  And the collaboration between Optum UnitedHealthcare has never been stronger in that front  Optum has really stepped in as they do with all the third party health plans as well  It s really assist in driving this broad based agenda across the company We have time for two more questions  Next question please OperatorAnd we will go next to Gary Taylor with JP Morgan  Please go ahead Gary Taylor    JP Morgan    AnalystGreat  does that mean to ask two questions  No David S  Wichmann    Chief Executive OfficerPardon me Gary Taylor    JP Morgan    AnalystI was going to say  great  Does that mean I get to ask two questions David S  Wichmann    Chief Executive OfficerYou can  we ll answer the first one Gary Taylor    JP Morgan    AnalystI will ask just my question  My one question is I do appreciate the earnings cadence commentary given the leap year  but thinking since reported MLR such an outsized impact on the near term stock volatility  wondering if you d be willing to give us first quarter MLR range  I mean there are a few other moving parts in the quarter besides leap year that was pretty high March seasonality with extra Monday  Tuesday and then obviously with dilutive impact of the HIT reinstatement David S  Wichmann    Chief Executive OfficerJohn Rex you  maybe just  I know that was pretty complex in terms of the quarterly progression and we expected that    John you just want to make sure that everybody understands that well John Rex    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSure Gary  Good morning  Let me give you a little more color in terms of the impact that occurs as we go into that  I described kind of some of the impact with workdays content and how that flows  And just in terms of thinking about that  So when value different days with different medical costs  weekend versus weekdays  even versus different days of the week  In terms of what I was describing there  it actually comes out  it s a little    it s not two days  it is more than one day  it is 1 3 days of impact in terms of the workday content is where it fall then to when you flow into a leap year like that and that pattern  typically of course repeats  So that s kind of the element that flows into that Then if you consider the other elements we talked about at    when we talk to our full year MCR progression and year over year progression  we talked about the impact of the health insurance tax  the 140 basis points and that impact  And then we talked about mix impacts also that occur over the course of the year  So those are really kind of the core that are as we consider  as we consider where we d expect the medical care ratio to be lining up here as we you look at the first half of the year  I hope that gives you a little extra color Gary Taylor    JP Morgan    AnalystSo you don t want to give us a 1Q range today John Rex    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSorry  What s that  Gary Gary Taylor    JP Morgan    AnalystYou don t    you don t want to give us the first quarter     Speech Overlap John Rex    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerFirst quarter pick    I think I kind of just described it actually pretty  pretty hopefully fairly clearly there in terms of the roll forward and how you would approach that  So if you take the components of the math that I just gave you  I think that should get you to a first quarter pick David S  Wichmann    Chief Executive OfficerSo there is no change to full year guidance  John tried to lay out for you our first half last half would be and then within the first half  what the proportions would be as well  So you should be able to get a pretty good sense of things from all of that recognizing often times things don t shoot quite that straight  So plus or minus would probably be a worthwhile range to put around whatever point estimate you come up with Thank you very much Gary  Next question please OperatorAnd we ll go next to Sarah James with Piper Sandler  Please go ahead Sarah James    Piper Sandler    AnalystThanks for squeezing me in  Now that there is some bipartisan support for spread pricing though  Can you talk about the exposure in  19 you said it was about 25  of the book so did that needle mover for  20  what is the mix look like in your commercial book of spread versus pass through  And does this bill impact the value proposition that you see for OptumRx at all  Thanks David S  Wichmann    Chief Executive OfficerJohn John Rex    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSarah  thanks for the question  As you know  we are committed to driving to a strategy around negotiating with the clients of a transparent model where more and more of our services are coming from administrative fees and value based arrangements  Our clients decide how they want to pay for our services  So when we bid on a deal and for our client  we give them an opportunity either to pay through administrative fee or with spread or traditional  So it s the client choice  So as you look at it  we don t have a preference about where we want to go up in business model  We re in different on how a client wanted to choose it In terms of the commercial market  the trend in the market hasn t changed in the last several years  So actually the client is not going to move one way or the other in terms of spread versus administrative fee  As you look at the Medicaid market  there has been a trend over the last three years where more and more of the state organizations and have been moving to administrative fees  So if you looked at our client base three years ago  majority would have been spread  If you look at it today  less than a quarter is in spread and actually we expect that to almost disappear as you look out to next year or two years  So from us when they actually impact our financials  I won t speculate about what will happen in Washington  but we re well positioned from a business standpoint David S  Wichmann    Chief Executive OfficerGreat question  Sarah  Thank you so much I ll go ahead and close now  Thank you all for your questions  Sorry  we can t get to everyone today  As you heard this morning  we remain confident in our outlook for 2020 and beyond  Our diversified in complementary businesses are strong and well positioned for continued balanced growth by delivering even higher levels of societal value  while generating strong returns for you  our shareholders

187483,408999,UNH,UnitedHealth Finishes 2019 Strong,news,"UnitedHealth Group  NYSE UNH  has been through some challenging times over the past several years  With politicians in Washington searching for ways to make healthcare more affordable for average Americans  many investors have feared that the health insurance giant could end up facing costly new regulations that would eat into its profits  So far  though  UnitedHealth has navigated the changing regulatory landscape well  while still trying to capitalize on growth opportunities along the way 
Coming into Tuesday s fourth quarter financial report  UnitedHealth investors believed that the company would continue to perform well  and the numbers UnitedHealth posted largely lived up to those expectations  Even with the 2020 presidential election set to revive past debates about the healthcare sector  UnitedHealth has an ambitious agenda to keep itself moving in the right direction 
How UnitedHealth keeps on growing
UnitedHealth s fourth quarter results were consistent with the company s track record of steady success  Sales climbed 4  to  60 9 billion  which was only a little bit shy of what most investors had expected  Net income attributable to shareholders picked up 16  to  3 54 billion  and the resulting adjusted earnings of  3 90 per share was  0 12 better than the consensus forecast among those following the stock  For the full year  revenue of  242 2 billion was up 7  from 2018 s levels  and adjusted earnings of  15 11 per share picked up 17  year over year 

Looking at the company s two main segments  the UnitedHealthcare insurance business kept posting solid results  with segment revenue climbing 4  on a 15  jump in operating income  Within the business  UnitedHealthcare s Medicare and retirement unit saw the strongest growth  with the employer and individual division also seeing strong performance  Weakness in the company s global business held UnitedHealth back  as did declines in the community and state division  UnitedHealthcare picked up 845 000 more commercial customers in the employer and individual business along with 325 000 new Medicare Advantage policyholders 
Meanwhile  the Optum health services business saw stronger top line growth  Sales jumped 8   and operating income was higher by 12  year over year  driven largely by gains from the OptumHealth wellness and health management services division  The smaller OptumInsight data analytics business saw even faster 14  growth in its sales  but the OptumRx pharmacy benefit business saw its top line rise by less than 1  to hold back the Optum segment s overall performance 
What s ahead at UnitedHealth 
CEO David Wichmann homed in on his company s efforts to match up with what many politicians are looking for   The dedicated women and men of UnitedHealth Group work together each day to improve outcomes and the patient and physician experience   Wichmann said   while making healthcare more affordable  enabling us to serve more people better   The CEO also predicted more growth for 2020 
UnitedHealth specifically believes it ll be able to deliver more bottom line gains for shareholders in the coming year  The healthcare giant repeated its recent guidance for the full 2020 year  including calls for adjusted earnings to be between  16 25 and  16 55 per share  That d be around 8  to 10  higher than 2019 s final number  and although that d be a marked slowdown from the rate of growth in 2019  it would still keep UnitedHealth on an upward trajectory 
Yet there are still regulatory threats to UnitedHealth s business  The Supreme Court will likely review a case that looks at the rights of state governments to regulate pharmacy benefit managers and the amounts they reimburse pharmacies for prescription drugs  If state regulators have the ability to limit the markups PBMs can charge  it could put UnitedHealth on the defensive in justifying its practices 
UnitedHealth s investors seemed generally pleased by the report  acknowledging that growth might slow going into 2020  Shareholders appear comfortable with how the healthcare company is handling a volatile situation in Washington  but they ll be keeping a close eye on things to make aren t surprised by anything unexpected in the future ",2020-01-15,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pidcy,2060087

187539,409055,UNH,U S  healthcare shares pick up steam as some political worries abate,news,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK  Reuters    U S  healthcare stocks  led by health insurers  have gained strength in recent weeks  buoyed by solid third quarter earnings and investor comfort that political risks to the sector have eased  Wednesday s Democratic presidential debate could test their momentum 
The S P 500 healthcare sector  SPXHC  has climbed 11  since hitting a recent low on Oct  2  outperforming an 8  rise for the overall benchmark S P 500  SPX  over that time 
Still  healthcare remains a stark underperformer so far in 2019  rising 13  against a 24  gain for the broader market 
Investor worries that a Democratic president might usher in a Medicare for All health program that would decimate the role of private insurance and otherwise undermine the sector have clouded the stocks for most of the year  But some of those worst case fears have been lifting  analysts said 
Healthcare investors have been  coming to grips with  you know what  we re probably not going to get the radical changes initially thought or feared   and there s just way too much negativity priced in   said Sahak Manuelian  head of equity trading at Wedbush Securities 
Shares of health insurers have had a particularly strong run with the S P 500 managed healthcare index  jumping some 26  since early October  when the sector closed at its lowest point since the start of June 
Graphic  U S  healthcare shares lag broader market  
Healthcare stocks rallied sharply on Friday after U S  Senator Elizabeth Warren  one of the top Democratic presidential contenders and a Medicare for All proponent  revealed how she would implement her healthcare plan  It included a timeline that would initially retain many aspects of the current system  including employer based private insurance  while transitioning Americans to the government health plan that currently primarily covers individuals 65 and older 
The overall healthcare sector rose 2 2  on Friday  its biggest one day gain since January  with shares of insurers UnitedHealth Group Inc  N UNH  and Anthem Inc  N ANTM  both climbing more than 5  
 You took the worst case off the table that you d put them out of business   Jeff Jonas  a healthcare portfolio manager with Gabelli Funds  said of the insurers 
A key for the stocks from Wednesday night s debate  Jonas said  is how prominent healthcare is as a topic and which candidate is perceived as likely to gain momentum in polls following the event 
Although worries about Warren s plan have receded  she and fellow progressive U S  Senator Bernie Sanders are still seen as more negative for healthcare stocks than more moderate candidates 
 A lot of people still in the short term trade just based off those poll numbers   Jonas said 
Healthcare companies also are wrapping up a strong earnings season  with the sector overall posting earnings growth of 9 5  and revenue growth of 15 4   both the highest rates of any S P 500 sector  according to Refinitiv data 
Shares of biotech companies have been strong of late  fueled by dealmaking and promising clinical trial results  Manuelian said

187622,409138,UNH,Teladoc  TDOC  Hits 52 Week High  Will Momentum Sustain ,opinion,"On Jan 21  Teladoc Health  Inc    NYSE TDOC   hit a 52 week high of  101 28 before ending the session at  98 25  The surge can be attributed to the company s announcement of acquiring InTouch Health and positive earnings pre announcement 
The stock has gained 62 4  over the past year against its  s decline of 7 4  

 
Investors seem to have taken the acquisition news positively since the deal will expand Teladoc s presence in the virtual healthcare industry  Via InTouch Health  Teladoc will be able to provide healthcare solutions ranging from critical to chronic to everyday care  The deal will expand total addressable market  TAM  for Teladoc and open up another avenue for growth 
Through InTouch Health  Teladoc will be able to provide care at sites such as Hospital  ED   Ambulance  Post Acute  Physician Office  Retail Clinic  Pharmacy  Worksite as well as Home 
Teladoc s positive earnings pre announcement also aided the surge in shares  The company raised its 2019 revenue expectation to  552  553 million  up from its earlier guidance of  546  550 million  Also  total visits are expected to be more than 4 1 million compared with previous estimate of 3 9 4 1 million   
For the fourth quarter of 2019  Teldoc revised its revenue guidance to  155  156 million  up from the previous estimate of  149  153 million  It now expects visits to be more than 1 2 million  up from the previous estimate of 1 1 2 million 
Notably  huge market opportunity is expected to aid the company s long term growth 
Teladoc currently serves  54 million of U S  population and has nearly 75 million potential members within existing clients 
The company posted a positive EBITDA for the first time in 2018  which impressed investors  In 2019  the progress on EBITDA was impressive 
The differentiating factor for Teladoc is its scale  breadth of clinical offerings and its programmatic efforts to drive utilization  It is the largest provider of telemedicine services globally 
Recent regulatory changes  which now allow telehealth benefits to be part of Medicare Advantage plans is a positive for Teladoc  Effective 2020  telemedicine services will be eligible for reimbursement under MA  This is believed to increase the company s market share as nearly 20 million of individuals  currently insured under MA  moves to telehealth services 
Teladoc is on track to deliver an integrated virtual care experience across platforms supporting acute complex and chronic care needs and addressing the mental health and physical health challenges in 2020  In this vein  the company made an investment in Vida Health  Teladoc Health will be the exclusive virtual care partner of Vida Health  collaborating to deliver chronic care solutions with increasing digital and clinical integration 
Teladoc has integrated with UnitedHealth Group  NYSE UNH   Inc    which has given the former company access to 15 million of its customers  This should accrue to Teladoc s revenues in 2020 and beyond 
Recently  the company launched Teladoc Medical experts in the U S  market  onboarding more than 100 000 employees from UPS and Nationwide Insurance  leveraging insights and capabilities from its Advanced Medical and Best Doctors acquisitions into one single experience  The Teladoc medical expert service creates a virtual center of excellence for individuals grappling with the challenges of complex physical and mental conditions

187634,409150,UNH,UnitedHealth Earnings Preview  Will Profit Growth Compensate For Political Risk ,opinion,"Reports Q4 2019 results on Wednesday  Jan  15  before the open


Revenue expectation   60 93 billion


EPS expectation   3 77

The past three months have produced a remarkable turnaround for the world s biggest health insurer  UnitedHealth Group  NYSE UNH   After languishing in a bearish spell for the most part of last year  its shares have jumped more than 30  during the last quarter  Can this rally continue  or should we be looking for signs that the stock is losing its momentum 
Two factors  in our view  have contributed to this sharp recovery that occurred even though the political environment remains hostile to healthcare providers in the U S 
First  UnitedHealth has been consistently showing that its sales are strong and it s well on track to improve the bottom line profitability  In its previous earnings report  the company boosted its profit guidance for 2020 as revenue growth from its health services and insurance units brightened its outlook 
UnitedHealth Chief Executive David Wichmann suggested on a call with analysts in October that adjusted earnings per share growth could hit between 13  to 16   That implied midpoint of Wichmann s profit range met investors  expectations  especially after solid 2019 results 
Political Risks
Amid this strong earnings momentum  investors have started to ignore the political risks associated with the 2020 Presidential campaign  UnitedHealth stock suffered badly in the first half of last year as some leading Democratic candidates campaigned for a comprehensive overhaul of the U S  health system 
The  Medicare for All  campaign could eliminate most private insurance in favor of a government plan and create price pressure throughout the health care sector  It seems to be a very ambitious undertaking and doesn t have much chance at passing anytime soon  but it could keep investors away and the stock depressed 
It s the preferred policy of Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren  who is one of the Democrats  front runners  at least for now  Even the comparatively moderate public options proposed by candidates such as former Vice President Joe Biden would take market share from insurers and put pressure on profits  according to a Bloomberg analysis 
But in the past quarter  investors started to ignore this political and health policy uncertainty as they shifted their focus to the company s cash generation and its defensive nature  In our view  the move higher has probably run its course unless the healthcare provider produces another blowout quarter on Wednesday  After massive gains in the past three months  the analyst community doesn t see much upside in UNH stock from here  The shares  which were trading at  285 85 at yesterday s close  after falling more than 3  through the session  is close to analysts  12 month price target of  322 52 
Bottom Line
UnitedHealth stock is offering investors a high risk reward equation where a strong business making a boatload of cash could come under pressure if the Democrats win the U S  elections and push for healthcare reforms  Investors who bought UNH stock during the October dip are in a good position to hold on to their positions  but for those wondering whether to buy now  waiting on the sidelines is probably a better strategy at this point  unless the stock weakens again and offers a good entry point ",2020-01-14,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/unitedhealth-earnings-preview-will-profit-growth-compensate-for-political-risk-200498481,200498481
187636,409152,UNH,UnitedHealth Group  UNH  Q4 Earnings Top Estimates,opinion,"UnitedHealth Group  UNH  came out with quarterly earnings of  3 90 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 77 per share  This compares to earnings of  3 28 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 3 45   A quarter ago  it was expected that this largest U S  health insurer would post earnings of  3 75 per share when it actually produced earnings of  3 88  delivering a surprise of 3 47  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
UnitedHealth  which belongs to the Zacks Medical   HMOs industry  posted revenues of  60 90 billion for the quarter ended December 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 12   This compares to year ago revenues of  58 42 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
UnitedHealth shares have lost about 2  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 1 6  
What s Next for UnitedHealth 
While UnitedHealth has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for UnitedHealth was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  4 05 on  63 94 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  16 45 on  261 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Medical   HMOs is currently in the top 27  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2020-01-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/unitedhealth-group-unh-q4-earnings-top-estimates-200498865,200498865

187658,409174,UNH,Chart Of The Day  UnitedHealth Shares Raise Red Flags Ahead Of Earnings,opinion,"UnitedHealth Group  NYSE UNH  is scheduled to release corporate results on Wednesday Jan  15 before the market open  Analysts forecast EPS of  3 77 vs  3 21 and revenue of  60 93 billion vs  57 98B for the same quarter last year  That s an improvement in EPS of roughly 15  and around 5  growth in earnings per share 
In the last 27 quarters  EPS beat forecasts 26 times and met expectations once in 2013  Revenues however  disappointed three times in the same period 
Providing health coverage for over 49 million people  the company is the biggest U S  insurer  Its shares have gained over 30  since October   hitting an all time high   after beating expectations in its third quarter earnings and hiking its growth forecast for this year 
While most analysts expect these trends to continue  we note some warning signs 

The price dropped below its uptrend line since Oct  3  falling away from the record  While  in itself that is a natural downward correction after a momentous gain  as investors lock in profits  the MACD and RSI   both   provide negative divergences 
While the price rose between Nov  25 and Dec  20  both the MACD and RSI fell  The first demonstrates that despite the increase  the price still slowed its ascent compared to other periods  while the RSI shows that momentum wasn t backing up the incline for prices  suggesting the climb could lose steam 
Either of these indicators   each of which provide a signal of negative divergence   should give investors pause  Both doing so simultaneously should put traders on alert  seeing that both are structured differently  That is why they rarely confirm each other 
Not only did both indicators provide negative divergences  but they both completed H S tops  further increasing the likelihood of a price reversal 
It s noteworthy that the Dec  20 all time high was  300 00 on the nose  underscoring just how important the psychological association to whole numbers is  Emphasizing this point is the fact that the price fell away from its record high and closed at the very bottom of the session   and then proceeded to descend below the uptrend line 
Trading Strategies
Conservative traders would wait for the price to reverse  which may take place if the price falls below the Dec  10 low of  274 01  dotted red line  
Moderate traders may short with a close below the  283 level  whose support on Jan  3 demonstrated its significance  after having been a resistance from Nov  25 through Dec 6 
Aggressive traders may short now

187686,409202,UNH,6 Trade Proof Sector ETFs To Follow If No Deal Is Cracked ,opinion,"Almost two long years  U S  China trade tensions have reached a tipping point as the deadline for the interim  phase one  deal is fast approaching  A  worth of  imported from China will be enacted on Dec 15  unless a deal is cracked 
Amid such a scenario  investors might be interested in trade proof sectors  if the U S  China trade deal fails to materialize   in this regard  which have less exposure to the development in U S  China trade  Here are a few 
Telecom
Cramer s top pick was telecom  particularly Verizon   NYSE VZ    AT T   NYSE T   and CenturyLink  NYSE CTL    NYSE T    These stocks mostly have domestic exposure and are likely to benefit from a dovish Fed  Investors should also note that these stocks generate solid yields and should prove to be great buys if there is no trade deal and the resultant decline in bond yields  Telecom fund iShares U S  Telecommunications ETF  should thus be in focus 
Health Insurers and Hospitals
This segment is almost totally domestic focused  Companies likeUnitedHealth Group   NYSE UNH   and HCA Healthcare Inc    NYSE HCA   have good exposure to iShares U S  Healthcare Providers ETF   while Tenet   NYSE T   and Centene   NYSE CNC   have a place in SPDR S P Health Care Services  NYSE XHS  ETF   Investors can also consider funds likeiShares Evolved U S  Healthcare Staples ETF  
Oil Refiners
Per the source  oil refining companies at Permian Basin have  no exposure to China  and thus these are tariff proof  Moreover  still low oil prices are good for refining companies as these use crude as their input  VanEck Vectors Oil Refiners ETF  emerges as a good pick in this regard 
Cyber Security 
 The cybersecurity stocks are   the big three state sponsors of cyberterrorism   Analysts  favorite cybersecurity companies are Fortinet   NASDAQ FTNT    Proofpoint   NYSE T   and Palo Alto Networks   NYSE PANW    ETFMG Prime Cyber Security ETF  looks to win from this trend 
Homebuilders
According to the NAHB  the U S  China trade war has affected  used in the homebuilding industry  While this will likely hurt the pace of homebuilding  the impact is probably not that severe 
U S  homebuilding bounced back in October and permits for future home construction soared beyond   Apart from costs  the homebuilding sector is not that dependent on China  A low interest rate environment arising out of a no deal situation will also work wonders for the space  SPDR S P Homebuilders  NYSE XHB  ETF  thus appears almost trade resistant 
Utilities 
U S  utility companies have less to do with China  And these are also good bets amid an edgy operating backdrop  Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund  draws attention in this regard

187700,409216,UNH,Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Friday,news,"Investing com   Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Friday  June 21 
1  Stocks pause as U S  Iran tensions rise
The stock rally that followed the Federal Reserve s signal of interest rate cuts this year faded on Friday as escalating tensions between the U S  and Iran hit risk appetite 
U S  President Donald Trump had approved military strikes against Iran on Friday in retaliation for the downing of a U S  surveillance drone  but called off the attacks at the last minute  according to a New York Times report 
U S  futures pointed to a lower open after the S P 500 closed at a record high on Thursday  Dow futures fell 28 points  or 0 1   by 5 42 AM ET  9 42 GMT   S P 500 futures dropped 5 points  or 0 2   while Nasdaq 100 futures traded down 20 points  or 0 3

European stocks also paused for breath with the pan European Stoxx 600 slightly lower  pulling back from a weekly gain of nearly 5  
Asian shares were also mostly lower at the close  though China s Shanghai Composite bucked the general trend  ending 0 5  higher after signs of more liquidity support from the People s Bank of China 
2  Gold pops above  1 400 to 6 year high 
Spot gold surged past  1 400 overnight to its highest level since September 2013  reaching a weekly gain of nearly 5  before the rally began to fade in early morning trade on Friday 
Gold futures saw a similar price move past the  1 400 level to reach prices not seen July 2014 
The yellow metal has primarily benefited this week from the Fed s change in outlook  which has fostered expectations of up to three rate cuts this year and driven the dollar nearly 1  lower 
Signs that central banks from Europe  Japan and Australia are also willing to ease policy to support a slowing economic outlook  geopolitical tensions between the U S  and Iran and the unresolved U S  China trade dispute have increased demand for the safe haven metal 
3  Oil on track for 9  weekly surge
U S  crude oil futures extended gains on Friday  bringing their weekly gain close to 9   amid growing fears that supply out of the Persian Gulf could be disrupted by the standoff between the U S  and Iran  Any disruptions would further tighten global supply  given that OPEC and its allies plan to extend their existing agreement on output restraint at the beginning of July 
At the same time  concerns over the global demand outlook have receded a little on hopes for looser monetary policy  and on hopes that the U S  and China will move closer to a trade agreement when the two leaders meet next week at the G20 summit 
U S  crude oil futures gained 12 cents  or 0 2   to  57 19 by 5 43 AM ET  9 43 GMT   while Brent oil traded up 33 cents  or 0 5   to  64 78 
4  Global manufacturing strength shows mixed signs ahead of U S  data
Global readings of manufacturing activity showed mixed signs in data released Friday as investors waited for the latest readings from the U S 
Manufacturing activity in Japan underwent a third straight month of contraction 
Despite a continuing downturn in the euro zone s manufacturing sector  the overall reading of business activity managed to reach a seven month high  Still  the IHS Markit research showed that companies remained at their least optimistic levels in nearly five years due concerns over slowing global growth and the impact of trade conflicts 
Markets will have preliminary readings for June on both the U S  manufacturing and services sectors when IHS Markit releases its data Friday at 9 45 AM ET  13 45 GMT   The more widely followed manufacturing report from the Institute of Supply Management will be released on Monday 
5  UnitedHealth buys Equian  Slack surges on debut
The parent of the largest U S  health insurer  UnitedHealth  NYSE UNH   has agreed to buy health care payments firm Equian for  3 2 billion  according to The Wall Street Journal  The deal would be the latest in a flurry of mergers and acquisitions in the sector this year that now tops  260 billion in deals  according to Dealogic 
Elsewhere  investors will be looking to see if messaging app Slack Technologies  NYSE WORK  can add to gains of nearly 50  that it made on its stock market debut Thursday  The share s closing price valued the company at over  20 billion  underlining that the market still has a relatively high degree of tolerance for loss making unicorn startups if the business model is compelling enough  Slack debuted through a direct listing  rather than a traditional IPO  As such  there are no underwriters to smooth out any potential volatility in the immediate aftermath of the listing

187713,409229,UNH,Teladoc  TDOC  Up 73  Year To Date  Will The Rally Continue ,opinion,"Teladoc Health  Inc    NYSE TDOC   has been in favor with investors given clear visibility of business growth in a rapidly growing telehealth services industry 
Teladoc has impressed its investors with rise of 34  and 63  in revenues and visits  respectively  in the first nine months of 2019  This growth has been achieved on the back of its inorganic and organic endeavors 
The company s strong performance has led the stock to surge 73  against its  s decline of 5 8  

 
The company holds a first mover advantage in the telehealth industry with no other player having the scale and size of business that it commands What looks furthermore impressive is the company s ability to keep growing on the back of its recent deals and efforts on expansion in international markets  the aging U S  population  which is likely to drive demand for telehealth services and its efforts to grow in Medicare advantage business   
Factors to Drive Growth
Teladoc posted a positive EBITDA for the first time in 2018  In 2019  the progress on EBITDA was impressive 
The differentiating factor for Teladoc is its scale  breadth of clinical offerings and its programmatic efforts to drive utilization  It is the largest provider of telemedicine services globally 
Recent regulatory changes  which now allow telehealth benefits to be part of Medicare Advantage  MA  plans is a positive for Teladoc  This should open up new opportunities for the company  Effective 2020  telemedicine services will be eligible for reimbursement under MA  This is believed to increase the company s market share as nearly 20 million of individuals  currently insured under MA  moves to telehealth services 
Teladoc is on track to deliver an integrated virtual care experience across platforms supporting acute complex and chronic care needs and addressing the mental health and physical health challenges in 2020  In this vein  the company made an investment in Vida Health  Teladoc Health will be the exclusive virtual care partner of Vida Health  collaborating to deliver chronic care solutions with increasing digital and clinical integration 
Teladoc has integrated with UnitedHealth Group  NYSE UNH   Inc   which has given the former company access to 15 million of its customers  This should accrue to Teladoc s revenues in 2020 and beyond 
Recently  the company launched Teladoc Medical experts in the U S  market onboarding more than 100 000 employees from UPS and Nationwide Insurance  leveraging insights and capabilities from its Advanced Medical and Best Doctors acquisitions into one single experience  The Teladoc medical expert service creates a virtual center of excellence for individuals grappling with the challenges of complex physical and mental conditions 
We believe Behavioral Health market presents a great opportunity for Teladoc given 168 million annual visits for the same  as reported by The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality  Teladoc estimates 80  or 131 million could be treated via telehealth  This presents a huge revenue growth opportunity for the company 
Zacks Rank and Stocks to Consider
Teladoc carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  
Some better ranked stocks in the same space are Apollo Medical Holdings  Inc    NASDAQ AMEH    HealthEquity  Inc    NASDAQ HQY   and LHC Group  Inc    NASDAQ LHCG     Each of these stocks carries a Zacks Rank  2   Buy   You can see

have outperformed the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry year to date  44 2  vs  38 2    The Zacks analyst believes that the company s revenues are gaining from higher switched transactions  increase in cross border volume and gross dollar volume Numerous acquisitions made over the years have fueled its inorganic growth  Its solid capital position enables investment in business  However  escalating costs might put pressure on margins  In order to gain customers and new business  Mastercard has been incurring high levels of costs under rebates and incentives  which remains a concern Shares of UnitedHealth have gained 7  in the past six months against Zacks Medical Insurance industry s rise of 8 3   The Zacks analyst believes that company stands apart in the industry by virtue of healthcare services  technology and innovations offered by its unit  Optum Numerous acquisitions made by the company have led to inorganic growth  Its solid balance sheet and consistent cash flow generation enable investment in business  Also  capital management by dividend payout and share buyback is another positive  Strong earnings guidance by the company instills investors  confidence The company s third quarter earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 5  and grew 13 8  year over year  on the back of higher revenues  and strength in both segments  UnitedHealthcare and Optum

Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry s rise of 3 8   The Zacks analyst believes that products like Keytruda  Lynparza and Bridion are driving sales  Keytruda sales are gaining from continued uptake in lung cancer and increasing usage in other cancer indications Keytruda has strong growth prospects based on increased utilization  recent approvals for new indications and potential additional approvals worldwide  Animal health and vaccine products are also performing strongly and remain core growth drivers for Merck However  generic competition for several drugs and pricing pressure will

187798,409314,UNH,Blue Chip Bubbles Up To Bearish Trendline Before Quarterly Report,opinion,"Blue chip UnitedHealth Group Incorporated  NYSE UNH  is 0 4  higher on the charts this afternoon  with traders cautiously optimistic ahead of earnings  The healthcare name is slated to report third quarter earnings before the open tomorrow  Oct  15  Let s take a closer look at what the options market may be expecting for the equity s post earnings moves  as well as how UNH could be flashing a short term warning signal 

UNH stock has struggled on the charts over the past few months  The shares have been stuck in a downward spiral since peaking above  265 in July  but recently found support in the  215 area    home to their April lows  Amid the October rebound  though  UNH recently ran into its descending 40 day moving average 
Per Schaeffer s Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White  the security is trading within one standard deviation of its 40 day moving average  after spending significant time below this trendline over the past two months  Similar tests of 40 day resistance have occurred five times in the past three years  resulting in an average five day loss of 3 07   with 80  of the returns negative  With the stock now trading at  222 46  a similar drop would put UNH back near  215 soon 
Despite its long term negative price action  short term options traders have preferred calls  In particular  the Schaeffer s put call  ratio  SOIR  of 0 73 ranks in the 16th annual percentile  showing that it s rare for near term call open interest to outweigh put open interest by such a wide margin  The aforementioned 215 strike is home to both peak call and put open interest in the October series of options  which expire at the close this Friday  Oct  18 
Echoing this  UNH is now sporting a 50 day call put volume ratio of 2 56 at International Securities Exchange  ISE   Cboe Options Exchange  CBOE   and NASDAQ OMX PHLX  PHLX   This ratio ranks just 2 percentage points from an annual high  indicating a heavy preference for  over puts during the past 10 weeks of trading 

Looking at the security s earnings history  UNH stock has closed lower the day after reporting in three of the past five quarters  including the last two in a row  Over the past eight quarters  the equity has served up an average post earnings swing of 3 5   regardless of direction  However  this time around  the options market is anticipating a larger than usual 5 7  move ",2019-10-15,Schaeffer's Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/blue-chip-bubbles-up-to-bearish-trendline-before-quarterly-report-200473358,200473358
187799,409315,UNH,UnitedHealth Group  UNH  Beats Q3 Earnings And Revenue Estimates,opinion,"UnitedHealth Group  UNH  came out with quarterly earnings of  3 88 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 75 per share  This compares to earnings of  3 41 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 3 47   A quarter ago  it was expected that this largest U S  health insurer would post earnings of  3 46 per share when it actually produced earnings of  3 60  delivering a surprise of 4 05  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
UnitedHealth  which belongs to the Zacks Medical   HMOs industry  posted revenues of  60 35 billion for the quarter ended September 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 22   This compares to year ago revenues of  56 56 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
UnitedHealth shares have lost about 11 5  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 18 3  
What s Next for UnitedHealth 
While UnitedHealth has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for UnitedHealth was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  3 75 on  61 27 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  14 84 on  241 18 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Medical   HMOs is currently in the top 36  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2019-10-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/unitedhealth-group-unh-beats-q3-earnings-and-revenue-estimates-200473667,200473667
187800,409316,UNH,Find Strong Stocks During Q3 Earnings Season With New Analyst Coverage ,opinion,"U S  stocks climbed Tuesday after the busy part of third quarter earnings season officially got underway with big banks like JPMorgan Chase  JPM  and other giants such as UnitedHealth  UNH   As investors and Wall Street prepare for Q3 earnings season and the fourth quarter of 2019  one way to find solid investments ideas  with potential for big returns  is to search for stocks that more analysts have started to cover recently 
New Analyst Coverage
Broker recommendations play their part no matter how investors feel about them  And we seemingly all take a look no matter what  Individual investors  large institutional portfolio managers  and everyone in between are likely pleased to see one of their stocks get an upgraded rating or a new analyst cover the company 
Right off the bat  investor interest can generate more analyst coverage  This helps explain why analysts jump on young  much hyped and talked about tech companies  Then  as new coverage is initiated  the company and the stock become more visible  which in turn often leads to more demand potential and therefore the possibility of higher prices  
Plus  analysts almost always initiate coverage with a positive recommendation  And the logic follows because why spend all the time and write a research report on a company not widely tracked only to say it s not good 
When it comes to companies with little to no analyst coverage  one new recommendation can sometimes give portfolio managers the validation they need to build a position  And the more money they can invest  the more they can potentially influence prices 
The best way to use this information is to search for companies with analyst coverage that has increased over the last 4 weeks  We just look at the number of analyst recommendations today and compare it to the number of analyst recommendations 4 weeks ago 
The rule of thumb here is that an increase in coverage leans bullish and a decrease signals bearish behavior  It is also worth pointing out that  in general  the change in the average broker recommendation is a better indicator than the actual recommendation itself 
On top of that  it is typically more bullish if the increase went from none to one or if the coverage was minimal to begin with   As the number of analysts climbs the addition of new coverage isn t earth shattering   In the end  increased coverage is still better than decreased coverage  unless the coverage is heading in the wrong direction  
Now let s try this screen 
  Number of Broker Ratings now greater than the Number of Broker Ratings four weeks ago
 This shows stocks where new coverage has recently been added  
  Average Broker Rating less than Average Broker Rating four weeks ago
 By  less than   we mean  better than  four weeks ago  
  Prices greater than or equal to 5
 We re applying all of the above parameters to stocks above  5 a share since many money managers won t even look at stocks under  5 
  Average Daily Volume greater than or equal to 100 000 shares
 If there s not enough volume  even individual investors won t want it  
Here are 3 of the 9 stocks that came through the screen this week 
Gates Industrial Corporation PLC  GTES     from 2 analysts four weeks ago to 4 
Opera Limited  OPRA     from 2 analysts four weeks ago to 3 
Huron Consulting Group Inc   HURN     from 2 analysts four weeks ago to 3 
Many screeners won t let you search for the number of analysts covering a stock  let alone comparing the amount of coverage they had weeks or even months ago  But you can with the Research Wizard  And you can backtest it all  Find out how to pick the right stocks right now by taking a free trial to the Research Wizard stock picking and backtesting program

187830,409346,UNH,UnitedHealth Shares Finding Their Mojo Again,news,"Investing com   UnitedHealth Group  NYSE UNH  has been a big reason why the Dow has held its own lately 
The world s largest health insurance company was the Dow s best performer last week  up 6 73  adding 108 points to the index by itself  It was up another 1  today 
UnitedHealth s rebound came after falling 3 6  two weeks ago in a crummy week for stocks generally  The Dow  S P 500 and Nasdaq Composite all fell for five straight days 
The UnitedHealth rally is part of the easing of recent selling pressure on health stocks generally 
The Health Care Select Sector SPDR  NYSE XLV  ETF was up 1 7  last week after falling 3 8  the week before  UnitedHealth represents nearly 7  of the Health Care ETFs assets  third largest after Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  and  Pfizer   NYSE PFE  
The selling in health stocks seemed prompted by investor panic over the push by Democrats on health care for all plans  But many analysts noted that  even if a plan was passed by the House of Representatives  it would face intense industry opposition  with UnitedHealth a big leader  and will get nowhere in a GOP ruled Senate 
The company serves some 115 million customers with its various coverage plans  In addition  it has a large pharmacy benefit management business that negotiates substantial rebates from drug companies and passes the rebates on to customers 
Analysts love the stock 
Twenty four of 25 analysts tracked by Investing com rate UnitedHealth a buy  The consensus is that the stock could top  307 in the next 12 months  a 22  gain from current levels  Technical measures also tracked by Investing com rate the stock a strong buy 
UnitedHealth has been a star performer among the 30 Dow stocks in recent years as earnings and revenue routinely beat estimates  In 2017  it soared nearly 38   In 2018  the stock rose just 13   but that included a 6 4  drubbing in last fall s selloff 
An aging population is a big reason health insurance stocks have been strong in recent years  Add to that the ability to add acquisitions to complement their core offerings 
Critics say their premiums are rising too fast and operating pharmacy benefit plans just adds to the companies  bottom lines at the expense of consumers 
UnitedHealth made a stab at addressing that issue last week  It said Tuesday that  starting in 2020  new corporate customers will have to pass their drug rebates on to consumers ",2019-03-18,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/unitedhealth-shares-finding-their-mojo-again-1806687,1806687

187858,409374,UNH,MarketPulse  Mylan Bleeds After Q4 Results  Guidance Fall Short,news,"Investing com   Mylan slumped Wednesday  sending healthcare stocks into the red after the pharma giant delivered earnings and guidance that fell short of estimates 
Mylan  NASDAQ MYL  reported fourth quarter earnings of  1 30 a share  missing estimates from Investing com for earnings of  1 35 a share  Revenue of  3 08 billion beat estimates of  3 07 billion  but shares fell more than 11  
The earnings miss was driven by a 16  decline in the drugmaker s North America segment  which accounts for 36  of total sales  on lower volumes and lower prices of biosimilar drugs 
Biosimilar drugs are generic versions of expensive biologic drugs  which treat diseases like cancer  multiple sclerosis and diabetes 
Mylan this month launched its generic version of GlaxoSmithKline s  NYSE GSK  blockbuster asthma treatment Advair at a price 70  lower than the branded medicine 
Regulators in the U S  have been calling on drugmakers to speed up the pace of developing biosimilar drugs in hopes that increased competition will lead to lower drug prices 
For 2019  Mylan said it expects revenue in a range of  11 5 billion to  12 5 billion and adjusted earnings of  3 80 to  4 80  Current consensus expectations were for revenue of  11 87 billion and earnings of  5 02 a share

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 4 05   A quarter ago  it was expected that this largest U S  health insurer would post earnings of  3 60 per share when it actually produced earnings of  3 73  delivering a surprise of 3 61  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
UnitedHealth  which belongs to the Zacks Medical   HMOs industry  posted revenues of  60 60 billion for the quarter ended June 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0 12   This compares to year ago revenues of  56 09 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
UnitedHealth shares have added about 7  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 19 1  
What s Next for UnitedHealth 
While UnitedHealth has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for UnitedHealth was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  3 81 on  60 90 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  14 70 on  243 88 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

187902,409418,UNH,Is UnitedHealth  UNH  Stock A Buy Heading Into Q2 2019 Earnings ,opinion,"Shares of UnitedHealth Group   NYSE UNH   popped Friday after they surged Thursday to help spur the Dow Jones Industrial Average s rally that saw it close over 27 000 for the first time ever  The health care provider climbed after the White House said that the Trump administration will not continue with its plan to try to eliminate rebates from government drug plans 
Now  let s see if investors should consider buying UNH stock ahead of the release of its Q2 fiscal 2019 financial results  which are due out Thursday  July 18 
Overview 
UnitedHealth is a health care firm that operates both UnitedHealthcare and Optum  UnitedHealthcare is the largest U S  health insurer  while Optum is a quickly expanding health services provider  UNH in late June bought PatientsLikeMe  which helps connect people with similar health conditions and refers to itself as the  world s largest personalized health network  
This came after UnitedHealth agreed earlier last month to buy health care payments firm Equian LLC for roughly  3 2 billion  Equian s health care and insurance focused payment processing services aim to reduce mistakes 
The two recent acquisitions are part of a growing arms race in the industry to bolster patient data technology and payment offerings  UnitedHealth  which brought in  226 3 billion in revenue in 2018  has also started to experiment with blockchain technology 
Shares of UNH were up 1 64  to  265 43 through morning trading Friday  roughly 8  off their 52 week week intraday highs of  287 94  UnitedHealth stock had been hit recently by growing concerns about Democratic presidential candidates pushing so called  Medicare for All  plans  along with other overarching government coverage plans 
Despite these worries  UnitedHealth posted stronger than projected Q1 2019 results and upped its profit targets 
Q2 Outlook   Earnings Trends 
Looking ahead  our current Zacks Consensus Estimate calls for the company s adjusted second quarter 2019 earnings figure to climb 10 2  to  3 46 per share  This would mark a slowdown compared to Q1 s 23  bottom line expansion  which topped our projection  UNH almost always beats quarterly earnings estimates and has posted a 3 3  average surprise over the trailing four periods 
UnitedHealth has seen its longer term earnings estimates revisions trend upward recently  With that said  UNH s Q2 estimates have moved in the wrong direction in the last seven days  Of course  analysts could provide updated guidance as we get closer to the firm s actual release date 
At the top of the income statement  UNH s Q2 revenue is expected to jump 8 2  to  60 67 billion  Last quarter  the company s top line jumped roughly 9  to  60 3 billion to top our estimate  UnitedHealth has now surpassed our consensus revenue estimates in three out of the last four quarters 
 
 
Bottom Line 
UnitedHealth is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  right now  based in large part on its longer term positive earnings estimate revision activity  On top of that  the company full year fiscal 2019 EPS figure is projected to jump 14 13  on 7 7  higher revenue  Peeking further head  the firm s 2020 top and bottom lines are expected to climb at nearly the exact same clips above our current year estimates in a sign of continued strength 
UNH also boasts an  A  grade for Value and a  B  for Growth in our Style Scores system  and is a dividend payer with a 1 65  yield at the moment  In the end  it seems like UnitedHealth might be worth considering heading into earnings  especially when taking into account its overall outlook through fiscal 2020

187915,409431,UNH,UnitedHealth Group  UNH  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"UnitedHealth Group  UNH  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 18  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This largest U S  health insurer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  3 47 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  10 5  
Revenues are expected to be  60 67 billion  up 8 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for UnitedHealth 
For UnitedHealth  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that UnitedHealth will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that UnitedHealth would post earnings of  3 60 per share when it actually produced earnings of  3 73  delivering a surprise of  3 61  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
UnitedHealth doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/unitedhealth-group-unh-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200438986,200438986

187936,409452,UNH,UnitedHealth To Buy Equian   Foray Into Healthcare Payments,opinion,"UnitedHealth Group  Inc    NYSE UNH    the leading U S  health insurer  might buy the healthcare payments company Equian for nearly  3 2 billion  per multiple sources 
Equian delivers payment integrity solutions through proprietary content  enabling technology and highly responsive customer service  The company analyzes healthcare and insurance data to ensure that payments are fair  accurate  and paid by the correct party resulting in billions of dollars in savings 
This buyout will allow UnitedHealth to add a new niche business to its health services segment  Optum  which deals in health management and engagement  health financial services  health IT  benefit operations  care operations and pharmacy care services  Over the years  Optum has grown to contribute an increasing proportion of total revenues 
UnitedHealth anticipates huge growth opportunity in the healthcare payments space  which is still dominated by manual functions leading to billions of waste in administration  thus calling for an urgent need of an overhaul 
The digital age has brought new spending habits for consumers  giving rise to the on demand economy and overall growth in eCommerce spending  But healthcare has lagged in its adoption of technological advances of the digital age  thus causing consumer payments experience to suffer 
Although payment responsibility has increased dramatically in the recent years  healthcare organizations have continued to communicate with consumers  as they did half a century ago  through mailed paper statements  The content and layout of those statements have not changed much either 
To put this into perspective  nearly 90  of providers leverage paper and manual processes for collections  53  of payers still deliver checks to providers and 93  of consumers were surprised by a medical bill in 2018 
The opportunity in this space has come to the notice of players outside the healthcare industry as well  An example of this is the recent agreement by J P  Morgan Chase   Co    NYSE JPM    to buy Philadelphia based InstaMed  a healthcare payment processor 
Equian handles nearly  500 billion in healthcare payments annually for nine out of the 10 healthcare companies  It would allow UnitedHealth to foray into the expanding healthcare payments industry  whose growth is directly linked to the increasing health spending in the United States  The Centre for Medicaid and Medicare Services projects healthcare spending in the United States to grow at an average rate of 5 5  annually to  6 trillion by 2027 
Alongside its proprietary use of Equian payments systems  UnitedHealth can also offer payment services to other insurers as the former currently serves almost 90  of the healthcare companies  UnitedHealth will also be able to serve Equian s clients  which are insurers outside the healthcare space 
UnitedHealth has been a bellwether in the industry  staying proactive in the face of continuous challenges and changes that are imposed from regulations  Now that the Trump administration has signed an executive order to make the contracts pricing between insurers and hospitals open to patients and Bernie Sanders campaign on  Medicare for  All  proposal  to reform Healthcare  a continuous overhang remains on the health insurance business 
In order to decrease its dependency on this heavily regulated business and to diverse its revenue sources from less or non regulated business like Optum  UnitedHealth has made several acquisitions over the years in this segment  The Equian deal also falls in the same line

187937,409453,UNH,Magellan Health Mulls Over Possible Sale To Centerbridge,opinion,"Magellan Health  Inc    NASDAQ MGLN   is in talks for a possible sale to private equity firm Centerbridge Partners  per reports 
Due to its prolonged underperformance  Magellan Heath  in February  came under pressure from activist hedge fund Starboard Value  which owns nearly 10  stakes in the company 
In a year s time  the stock has lost 25  compared with the  s decline of 1 3  

 
Until recently  UnitedHealth Group  Inc    NYSE UNH   and Anthem Inc    NYSE ANTM   were the two top companies competing to acquire Magellan  But UnitedHealth s recent acquisition of Davita s Medical Group and Anthem s buyout of Beacon Options got these players off the table 
Reasons Behind the Company s Sale
Slowing Down of Top line Growth  The company has been witnessing a slowdown in its revenues  For 2019  it assumes total revenues to be in the band of  7 billion to  7 2 billion  down from the earlier guidance of  7 2  7 5 billion   implying year over year decline of 3   calculated at the mid point   This decline in revenues growth can be attributed to challenges in the company s Complete Care business and stiff competition in the Pharmacy Benefit Management business 
Pharmacy Management Earnings Under Pressure  This segment s profit declined 25  year over year in 2018 and further down 47   in the first quarter of 2019  driven by specialty formulary management contract losses  non recurring items  and lower PBM membership  Owing to contract terminations and aggressive pricing in the segment  the company expects revenues and earnings to be lower in 2019 as well 
Profitability  Magellan Heath s return on equity  ROE  undermines its growth potential  The company s trailing 12 month ROE of 3 9  compared with the industry s average of 23   indicates that it is less efficient in using shareholders  funds The sale of Magellan Health seems to be as a viable option now to provide returns to its shareholders The deal  if closed  will further consolidate the health insurance industry  which is concentrated in the hands of a few big players  Another deal in the process is that of the acquisition of WellCare Health Plans by Centene Corp    NYSE CNC   In the recent years  the healthcare industry has witnessed a flurry of mergers and acquisitions  as players aim to boost their growth and diversify operations in the wake of continued uncertainty posed by the changing regulatory policies Magellan Health sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  You can see

187955,409471,UNH,Medicare Advantage plans get unfair push from U S  government  critics,news,By Mark Miller CHICAGO  Reuters    Insurance companies do not need any help marketing Medicare Advantage plans   just ask anyone over age 65 about the pitches that clog their mailboxes every year during the fall enrollment period  or check out the television ads that flood cable channels  So why is the federal government giving these private all in one plans an extra marketing push  That is the question raised by two consumer advocacy groups  who charge that the Centers for Medicare   Medicaid Services  CMS  is improperly urging enrollees to pick Advantage plans in ways that tip the scales against traditional fee for service Medicare   Medicare Advantage plans roll together coverage for hospitalization  outpatient services and prescription drugs that are provided through separate parts of traditional Medicare  In  a letter sent last month to CMS Administrator Seema Verma  the Medicare Rights Center and the Center for Medicare Advocacy criticize a suite of online tools on the Medicare website that aim to help consumers decide between Advantage and traditional Medicare  The tools make  overly broad suggestions  that encourage Advantage enrollment when  more nuance is required  and by failing to present individuals with the full array of Medicare coverage options   the letter states  The consumer groups also say that a CMS email campaign during fall enrollment  which ends on Dec  7  is improperly biased toward Advantage plans  The campaign includes messages with subject lines such as  Could Medicare Advantage be right for you   and  Get more benefits for your money   and contain messages such as  check out Medicare Advantage   CMS did not respond to requests for comment on perceptions that its Advantage promotions lack balance  or who it regards as the target audience  This is not the first time CMS has been accused of bias in favor of Advantage  Earlier this year  advocacy groups called foul over language contained in a draft of the 2019 Medicare handbook that CMS sends to enrollees every year     CMS later responded by fixing the language in the final draft of its handbook  Medicare   You   Advantage plans differ from traditional fee for service Medicare in several ways  They receive capped per enrollee payments from the federal government  rather than the fee for service model used in the traditional program  Advantage plans must cap enrollees  out of pocket expenses  and most wrap in prescription drug coverage  Beneficiaries typically must use a network of providers  while enrollees in traditional Medicare can see any healthcare provider that accepts Medicare   and most do  Advantage plans often save money for enrollees on premiums  since most pay no additional fee for prescription drug coverage and do not need Medigap supplemental policies  which cap out of pocket costs  And the business is doing just fine without cheerleading by CMS  Enrollment has more than tripled since 2005 to 20 million beneficiaries  according to the Kaiser Family Foundation  The Congressional Budget Office projects enrollment will rise from 34 percent to 42 percent of the Medicare population by 2028   The companies running plans are enjoying a boom in revenue   for example  UnitedHealth Group Inc  NYSE UNH   the nation s largest seller of Medicare Advantage plans  reported a 15 2 percent revenue jump in its Medicare business during the third quarter compared with the year earlier period  to  18 8 billion  LOUDER CHEERLEADING  The Trump administration is not the first to play the role of Advantage booster   The past few administrations have been very much in favor of private plans   said Gretchen Jacobson  associate director with the Kaiser Family Foundation s Program on Medicare Policy  She notes that the administrations of Barack Obama and George W  Bush  as well as Congress  have encouraged growth of the program through rulemaking and legislation that made it possible for Advantage plans to add benefits such as vision care and gym memberships  and to cap patient out of pocket costs  At the same time  regulators have given Advantage plans greater latitude to set their own rules for certain types of coverage  But the current round of government support for Advantage plans is louder than anything seen in earlier administrations  said Joe Baker  president of the Medicare Rights Center   I ve been involved in Medicare since 1994  and I can t remember this kind of government promotion for a particular part of the program   he said   Baker adds that his group has no problem with CMS providing education to consumers   but only if it is balanced   People have two options  and CMS should be communicating about the advantages and disadvantages of both   this approach is lopsided   The motivations are not clear  Jacobson said  A research paper she co authored recently in the New England Journal of Medicine  https    concludes that evidence is mixed as to whether Advantage saves the government money or is actually increasing government spending   The jury also is out on the quality of care provided by Advantage plans  Jacobson s study found  especially for people with serious chronic conditions  These patients are disenrolling from Advantage plans at high rates  according to numerous rigorous research studies   That is a real concern as Advantage enrollment grows   she said    Reporting and writing by Mark Miller in Chicago  Editing by Matthew Lewis

engineering startup founded by former SpaceX engineers  sells ready to use kits that let people experiment with the cutting edge   On Tuesday  Synthego received  110 million from Peter Thiel s Founders Fund and two other Silicon Valley venture firms  bringing the company s total funding to  160 million  Crispr holds massive promise for a field known as   which involves modifying someone s DNA to treat a genetic disease  Synthego sells its Crispr kits primarily to researchers in roughly 50 countries  In the US  clients include the Mayo Clinic and two high profile labs at Stanford and the University of California at Berkeley  On Tuesday  a little known startup founded by two former SpaceX engineers became one of the best funded life science startups using the blockbuster gene editing tool  for genome engineering  Called Synthego  the company sells easy to use  kits to scientists  who use the tool to perform tasks as varied as creating designer crops and finding new cures for rare diseases  Recently  the company has been focusing on diseases  with an emphasis on how Synthego could help make its tools more useful and accessible to researchers aiming to create a revolutionary new class of treatments known as   Despite decades of being touted as having the potential to cure dozens of diseases  gene therapies remain difficult to access  Few have been approved by federal regulators  those that have can cost roughly  1 million to receive and even more to develop  Synthego aims to help reduce that cost and speed up the development process  While a handful of startups are doing gene editing work with Crispr  Synthego is the only one selling ready to use kits  Its kits  open up a whole new world  to researchers  Synthego cofounder and CEO Paul Dabrowski told Business Insider  And the new funds   a combined  110 million from the tech mogul Peter Thiel s Founders Fund as well as 8VC and Menlo Ventures   will help expand the company s reach even further  Dabrowski said  For the first time  the company is beginning to make kits intended for use in the clinic  a goal he said the company aimed to achieve by next year  In a statement  Thiel said Synthego s platform would  ultimately unlock the full potential of genome engineering    A future where cell and gene therapies are as accessible as vaccines  Few patients have had the chance to get a revolutionary type of treatment long touted as having the potential to cure dozens of diseases  Called gene therapy  the approach involves modifying a person s DNA to address the underlying cause of an inherited disease  Doctors take a sample of someone s diseased cells  correct the errors in the code  and return the corrected cells to the person s body  Over time  the healthy cells outnumber the diseased ones  and the illness disappears for good  the thinking goes  The Western world s first gene therapy  a drug called Glybera that was designed to treat a rare disease in which patients can t properly process fat  was  after being approved in the European Union in 2012  After lackluster demand  the manufacturer uniQure  in 2017  The first gene therapy to be approved in the US  Luxturna  promises to cure a rare inherited form of blindness  Its price tag is   Crispr is a  that makes it easier and cheaper to modify genomes and  usher in new gene therapies  But few researchers have fully embraced Crispr  the technique is new and can take months of practice to feel comfortable using  That s where Synthego wants to help  Synthego s core product helps scientists study potential cures by packaging Crispr in an easy to use format  As part of its latest funding round  the company is   for the first time   starting to make products that are ready to use in a clinical setting   One of the things we re doing with our Crispr platform is making it clinical grade ready   Dabrowski said  Dabrowski says his company s Crispr editing kits significantly shrink the time and the cost of research and development  If the company can make products that are ready to use in the clinic   there s an ability    eventually    to actually make the medicines for our customers   Dabrowski said   We believe it s going to be possible to make cell and gene therapies that are as accessible as vaccines   Dabrowski said  A star studded advisory board Synthego sells two types of Crispr kits in roughly 50 countries  In the US  clients include the Mayo Clinic and two high profile labs at Stanford and the University of California at Berkeley  where scientists use the kits to carry out research and development on potential new treatments  Jennifer Doudna  one of the  and a UC Berkeley geneticist  uses Synthego s products in her lab  Dabrowski said  Doudna also joined Synthego  in March and invested in the company during its second stage  or series B  round last year  As part of the latest funding round  another high profile researcher  the   joined Synthego s advisory board  Porteus has been working on gene and cell therapies for half a decade and cofounded Crispr Therapeutics  one of several public companies working on developing gene editing based treatments  Sir Andrew Witty  the CEO of the technology and services division of UnitedHealth Group  NYSE UNH  who once served as CEO of the pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline  is also on Synthego s advisory board  Both of Synthego s kits are designed to make working with Crispr easier  The first  called Crisprevolution  is designed for researchers who already have experience working with the tool and costs as little as  225  As part of the latest funding round  Synthego will be expanding that product line so that by next year it could offer clinical grade materials with the potential to help make therapeutics for patients  Synthego s other product  called Engineered Cells  was designed for non Crispr experts in mind and costs nonacademics  3 500  or  2 500 for researchers   You come to the website  tell us what you want

188007,409523,UNH,Tech Stocks Made New All Time High  S P 500 Almost There,opinion,"The S P 500 continuously gaps up and sells off during the day  Meanwhile  the Nasdaq 100 has made a new all time high 
Let s determine the stock market s most probable medium term direction by objectively quantifying technical analysis  For reference  here s the random probability of the U S  stock market going up on any given day 

 Probability   certainty  Past performance   future performance  But if you don t use the past as a guide  you are blindly  guessing  the future 
NASDAQ 100 new high
The NASDAQ 100  tech  has made a new all time high for the first time in more than 6 months 

Historically  the S P s and NASDAQ s forward returns upon doing so were mostly bullish 1 year later 
 Data from 1985   present

Outside reversal day
The S P 500  looks like  it made an outside reversal day 
An outside reversal day is when today s HIGH exceeds yesterday s HIGH  and today s LOW exceeds yesterday s low 
Why is it seen as a reversal pattern 
Textbook technical analysis logic   buyers don t have enough strength to sustain the market during the day when trading volume is heavier than at night 

The magnitude of this reversal is quite rare  Not only did today s HIGH and LOW exceed yesterday s HIGH and LOW  it exceeded the HIGHs and LOWs of the previous 3 days 
Moreover  each of the past 3 days saw the S P selloff from the OPEN to CLOSE 
Must be a bearish sign  right  Surely this means that  buyers can t sustain momentum  
Here s the actual data 

Somewhat short term bearish 
A real weak point
Small caps continue to lag significantly  While the S P  NASDAQ  and Dow all push higher  the Russell 2000  small caps  remains indecisive around its 200 day moving average  The Russell 2000 fell below its 200 DMA again today 

Here s what happens next to the Russell when it swung above and below its 200 DMA at least 8 times in the past 50 days 

Here s what happens next to the S P

Short term bearish signs 
It s 2008 2009 all over again
XLV  healthcare  has significantly underperformed the S P in the past 2 days  In fact  XLV has underperformed the S P by the most since 2008  cue the scary music  

Before you panic from recency bias  please consider what has caused XLV s underperformance  From CNN 

The sector wide slump came after UnitedHealth  NYSE UNH  CEO David Wichmann said  Medicare for All  policies  as proposed by some politicians and presumed candidates for the 2020 presidential election  would hurt the industry 

So this is more of an industry specific issue than a systematic problem 
Here s what happens next to the S P and XLV when XLV underperforms the S P by more than  4 6  over the past 2 days 

Why did all the historical cases occur during bear markets  2000 2002  2007 2009  
Because bear markets are extremely volatile  It is very easy for the market to go up and down 5  in a day  which means that many sectors will diverge significantly from each other on a multi day basis 
Currency Volatility

Let s look at the JPMorgan  NYSE JPM  Global Currency Volatility Index more closely 

As you can see  currency volatility is very low right now  Here s what happens next to the USD Index when the JPMorgan Global Currency Volatility Index is at a multi year low 
Herein lies the problem  you only know that currency volatility is at a multi year low with 20 20 hindsight  In real time  you have no idea if volatility will go even lower 
Here s a more objective  real time study  Here s what happens next to the USD Index when the JPMorgan Global Currency Volatility Index is more than  25  below its 200 dma 

Quite bullish 9 12 months later 
Here s what happens next to the S P
Contrary to popular belief  a rising USD isn t a consistent drag on the S P 
Low volatility index
The S P 500 Low Volatility Index is on fire  making new highs before the S P and NASDAQ 

As a result  the S P 500 Low Volatility Index is quite overbought  Its 14 weekly RSI now exceeds 68 
Here s what happens next to the S P Low Volatility Index when its weekly RSI is this high 

The S P Low Volatility Index  which moves closely with the S P  has a slight short term bearish lean 
One more thing 
And lastly  here s the most curve fitted  data mined trading model of all time 
This is what happens when you only buy the S P during the first 5 and last 2 trading days of each month 
As you can see  this model beats buy and hold  Would I use this No 
Data mined
There s no fundamental reason as to why this should outperform
This curve fitted strategy has gone nowhere since 2008
Conclusion
Here is our discretionary market outlook 
The U S  stock market s long term risk reward is no longer bullish  In a most optimistic scenario  the bull market probably has 1 year left  Long term risk reward is more important than trying to predict exact tops and bottoms 
The medium term direction  e g  next 6 9 months  is mostly mixed  although there is a bullish lean 
We don t predict the short term because the short term is always extremely random  At the moment  the short term does seem to have a slight bearish lean 
In summary  12 24 months   bearish  12 months   neutral  6 9 months   slightly bullish

188008,409524,UNH,Health Care Stocks Sell Off On Medicare Policy Concerns,opinion,"Suddenly it s a tough time to own health care stocks  What s changed  In a word  politics 
Earlier this week  UnitedHealth Group  NYSE UNH  CEO David Wichmann took the rare step of weighing into political terrain and warned that the  Medicare for All  proposals favored by Democratic lawmakers and candidates running for president would lead to challenges for the U S  health care industry in more than trivial degrees  Speaking to Wall Street analysts he said 

The wholesale disruption of American health care being discussed in some of these proposals would surely jeopardize the relationship people have with their doctors  destabilize the nation s health system and limit the ability of clinicians to practice medicine at their best  And the inherent cost burden would surely have a severe impact on the economy and jobs all without fundamentally increasing access to care 

Hyperbole  Maybe  but Mr  Market is selling first and asking questions later 
Indeed  health care stocks are now the outlier in an otherwise across the board rally for U S  equity sectors in 2019  based on a set of exchange traded funds  Health Care Select Sector SPDR  XLV  is down fractionally so far this year  shedding 0 5  year to date through yesterday s close  Apr  17   That s a trivial loss  although it speaks volumes when compared with the solid increases in the other major sectors of the U S  equity market 

Excluding XLV  the sector gains so far in 2019 range from 9 0  for utilities   Utilities Select Sector SPDR  XLU    to a sizzling 25 6  advance for tech via Technology Select Sector SPDR  XLK  
The U S  stock market overall is up a healthy 9 2  this year  based on SPDR S P 500 ETF  NYSE SPY  
UnitedHealth s Wichman also noted that  we continue to see the chances that  Medicare for All  becomes a reality as slim  but recognize that while the conversation remains in the spotlight payors  among other subsectors  will likely remain under pressure   he predicted 
To be fair  health care stocks have been treading water for the past month or so  based on XLV  and so it s hardly a shock to find that this slice of the equity market is lagging the market and the other sectors  Expected or not  the latest round of selling may be a buying opportunity  according to some analysts 
 We believe the sell off in health care services is overblown  as concerns around  Medicare For All   the pharma regulatory environment and persistent  Affordable Care Act  noise have triggered panic selling across the universe   advised Oppenheimer analysts in a research note 
Perhaps  but in the meantime  it seems that the health care sector may be a barometer of election prospects for Democratic presidential candidates generally and Bernie Sanders  who embraces the most progressive changes in health care policy  in particular  The deeper the slide in health care shares  it s tempting to reason that the market s giving higher odds that a Democrat will retake the White House in 2020 ",2019-04-18,James Picerno,https://www.investing.com/analysis/politics-takes-a-bite-out-of-health-care-stocks-200408131,200408131
188023,409539,UNH,UnitedHealth Group  UNH  Tops Q1 Earnings And Revenue Estimates,opinion,"UnitedHealth Group  UNH  came out with quarterly earnings of  3 73 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 60 per share  This compares to earnings of  3 04 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 3 61   A quarter ago  it was expected that this largest U S  health insurer would post earnings of  3 20 per share when it actually produced earnings of  3 28  delivering a surprise of 2 50  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
UnitedHealth  which belongs to the Zacks Medical   HMOs industry  posted revenues of  60 31 billion for the quarter ended March 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 05   This compares to year ago revenues of  55 19 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
UnitedHealth shares have lost about 7 6  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 15 9  
What s Next for UnitedHealth 
While UnitedHealth has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for UnitedHealth was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  3 45 on  60 67 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  14 63 on  244 09 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

188034,409550,UNH,UnitedHealth Group  UNH  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when UnitedHealth Group  UNH  reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 16  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This largest U S  health insurer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  3 59 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  18 1  
Revenues are expected to be  59 66 billion  up 8 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 54  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for UnitedHealth 
For UnitedHealth  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that UnitedHealth will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that UnitedHealth would post earnings of  3 20 per share when it actually produced earnings of  3 28  delivering a surprise of  2 50  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
UnitedHealth doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-08,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/unitedhealth-group-unh-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200405130,200405130
188035,409551,UNH,S P Streak Ends As Stocks Step Back,opinion,"After two straight weeks of gains and with earnings season right around the corner  stocks took a step back on Tuesday with losses in each of the major indices 
	Unfortunately  that means the S P s eight session winning streak is over  as the index slipped 0 61  to 2878 20 
	The NASDAQ had the smallest loss with a decline of only 0 56  to 7909 28  while the Dow had the steepest with a slip of 0 72   or about 190 points  to 26 150 58  it was off more than 230 points at its worst of the session  
	Financial companies were among the harder hit on Tuesday  which makes sense since the big banks will be kicking off earnings season later this week  J P  Morgan and Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC  get the party started on Friday  but today they were off 0 74  and 1 5   respectively  And their counterparts scheduled for next week didn t do much better 
	In the aftermath of a strong jobs report and with no trade talks to give us headlines  the attention turns toward earnings season  Believe it or not  the market is rather nervous about it  As Sheraz Mian said in his most recent Earnings Preview  total earnings for the S P are expected to be down approximately 4  in Q1 from last year  which would be the first negative result since 2016 
	And there were other factors impacting stocks on Tuesday  including the IMF downgrading the global economy and President Trump talking tough on trade with the EU due to subsidies for Airbus 
	But for the most part  it was just time for the major indices to take a break  Let s get ready for a busy few weeks  as earnings season gets underway and  hopefully  a trade agreement is signed with China  Even though we ve been drifting mostly higher of late  it s still going to take a catalyst to lift stocks to the next level and past their all time highs  Some good news on these fronts would be just what the doctor ordered

188039,409555,UNH,U S  health secretary says agency can eliminate drug rebates,news,"By Yasmeen Abutaleb WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said it was within his agency s power to eliminate rebates on prescription drug purchases  a key element of the Trump administration s plan to lower prescription medicine costs   Such rebates are negotiated in the United States by pharmacy benefits managers  PBMs  to lower the cost of medicines for their clients  including large employers and health plans that cover tens of millions of Americans   Drugmakers say they are under pressure to provide rebates to the few PBMs that dominate the market  which include CVS  N CVS   Express Scripts  O ESRX  and UnitedHealth s Optum  N UNH   and that those payers do not pass on enough of those savings to patients   a contention the PBMs dispute  The drugmakers say the rebates force them to raise the price of their therapies over time to preserve their business  The Trump administration has been receptive to that argument  Azar  in an interview with Reuters on Friday  said rebates created a perverse incentive to continuously raise drug prices  Azar  a former top executive at drugmaker Eli Lilly   Co  is trying to deliver on President Donald Trump s promises to lower the cost of prescription drugs for Americans  which Trump made a major priority during his 2016 presidential campaign  The Department of Health and Human Services last month proposed regulations that would scale back protections for rebates that might otherwise be illegal under a federal anti kickback law  The PBM industry has challenged that move  saying HHS cannot eliminate rebates on its own and would need Congress to change the federal statute  The ultimate responsibility for high drug prices  those companies say  lies with the manufacturers who set those prices  The Pharmaceutical Care Management Association  PCMA   which represents pharmacy benefit managers  has said the administration s proposal to scale back protections for rebates raises  troubling questions   but did not comment on Azar s latest remarks  The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America  PhRMA  did not respond to a request for comment  Azar contends that the current rebates are a product of previous HHS regulation   What one has created by regulation  one could address by regulation   he added  He did not say when such new regulations  which are being reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget  might take effect   The question of rebates may very well be fundamental to the issue of how you reverse these constant incentives to higher list prices  for medicines    CAMPAIGN ISSUE The cost of healthcare  and prescription drugs specifically  is expected to be a major campaign issue ahead of November elections  in which Democrats are seeking to take control of the U S  House of Representatives and Senate from Trump s Republicans  In May  Trump unveiled a  blueprint  comprising dozens of proposed policies to give the government greater leverage over drug prices  but did not support changes to give the federal government s Medicare health plan for seniors direct negotiating power with drugmakers  Critics say that has spared the pharmaceutical industry any real challenge to its pricing practices  Azar defended the administration s actions  noting that more than a dozen leading drugmakers  including  Pfizer  Inc  N PFE   Merck   Co  N MRK  and  Celgene Corp   O CELG   had pledged to hold off on further price increases this year   They are seeing where this is going  they are seeing that we are ticking off the blueprint items one by one   Azar said   We are not dependent on the voluntary action of pharmaceutical companies  We are not counting on their goodwill or their altruism      They re just changing because they see that s the future   Critics say the drug price pledges by major drugmakers are largely window dressing  Since May  HHS has given Medicare Advantage health plans  which are administered by private sector health insurers  new tools to lower prescription drug costs  The agency s Food and Drug Administration has unveiled a plan to boost the use of biosimilars  which are cheaper versions of expensive biotech medicines  Azar has directed the FDA to establish a working group to study how to import drugs safely from other countries if a drugmaker dramatically raises prices  The actions have already sparked concerns  Last week  a leading group of rheumatologists met with Azar to discuss concerns over changes to Medicare Advantage that could force some patients to try a less effective  cheaper medication for a period of time before their health plan would cover a more expensive therapy  HHS said Azar emphasized the agency s interest in lowering drug prices but expressed openness to alleviating burdens that could be placed on physicians as a result of the new rule   Azar said he spoke with Trump every few days  either in person or over the phone and that in every conversation  the president wanted to hear about progress on lowering prescription medicine costs  
 I have never once had a meeting or phone call with the president where we have not talked about drug pricing   Azar said ",2018-08-20,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/us-health-secretary-says-agency-has-power-to-eliminate-drug-rebates-1579872,1579872
188040,409556,UNH,Inside the progressive movement roiling the Democratic Party,news,"By Letitia Stein  Susan Cornwell and Joseph Tanfani MIAMI  Reuters    In another year  Donna Shalala might have had an easy ride to Washington  Running to become a first time congresswoman in a Miami seat at age 77  Shalala has long been a member of the Democratic Party elite  with a deep resume that includes supervising U S  health policy for former President Bill Clinton  Her slogan  printed on the back of her staff s t shirts  could have come from Hillary Clinton s 2016 presidential campaign playbook   Ready on Day One   But this season  Shalala s record has put her at odds with the surging progressive wing of the Democratic Party  Once derided as the most liberal member of the Clinton administration  Shalala now faces attacks from challengers who contend she is not nearly progressive enough  Taking nothing for granted  Shalala delivered hot dogs to voters at a campaign barbeque on a recent steamy Saturday   I m running like I m 20 points behind   she said  Less than three months before the midterm elections  a rising progressive movement is roiling the Democratic Party   fueled by fury at Republican President Donald Trump s administration  a growing populism among voters impatient for seismic change  and resentment of party leaders who have presided over a losing streak in national elections  Republicans disparage Democratic progressives as wild eyed radicals led by a 28 year old political neophyte  Alexandria Ocasio Cortez  whose take down of senior Democratic leader and 10 term incumbent Congressman Joe Crowley in a June 26 New York contest rocked Washington   We have a Democratic party that s lurching far to the left   said Representative Steve Stivers  chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee  Michael Byerly  a spokesman for the Congressional Leadership Fund  another Republican group  predicted Democrats   ultra progressive views  will be a hard sell with middle class voters  Yet Ocasio Cortez is only the most visible symbol of a grassroots insurgency that has sprung up across the country  including in spots far from deep blue Democratic strongholds  Most embracing the progressive label share a disdain for corporate money in politics and favor more government run healthcare  subsidies for college tuition and wage hikes for laborers  Progressives have a mixed record in early nominating contests  more often than not losing to more mainstream Democrats  But they have moved the party sharply to the left  particularly on expanding the government role in healthcare  a Reuters review of Democratic positions in the most competitive congressional races found  Across 41 battleground House of Representatives districts  two thirds of Democratic nominees want to expand the government s role in healthcare  the review shows  About a dozen support  Medicare for All   for many a reference to a single payer system that would largely replace private insurance  In Congress  most House Democrats support a Medicare for All bill  with six members of the Blue Dog caucus of fiscally conservative Democrats signing on as co sponsors  Much of the progressive movement has its roots in the nationwide volunteer network built by Bernie Sanders  2016 presidential run  Several groups that sprang from the failed Sanders campaign are now pushing for progressive candidates in the midterms   including Brand New Congress  formed two years ago on the dream of running hundreds of progressive political newcomers to oust establishment incumbents  Democrats and Republicans alike  In some ways  the splintering in the Democratic Party is simply a new round in the 2016 fight between Clinton and Sanders supporters  Progressive insurgents believe Clinton s defeat  on top of losing control of Congress and most state governments  proved them right  They aspire to overthrow conventional wisdom that Democrats must stay safely in the middle to compete   Democrats have been fixated for 20 years on this elusive  independent  mythical middle of the road voter that did not exist   said Crystal Rhoades  head of the Democratic Party in Nebraska s Douglas County  where a progressive candidate  Kara Eastman  is trying to wrest a competitive congressional district from a Republican   We re going to try bold ideas   THE MOVEMENT S BEGINNINGS The push for a progressive takeover of Congress began long before Trump won office  One audacious plan began to take hold in early 2016  as a crew of organizers for Sanders  presidential campaign traveled the country  staging revival style rallies  The crew included Zack Exley  a veteran political and tech consultant who cut his teeth as an organizer in union fights in Detroit  Saikat Chakrabarti  a technology consultant who started as a volunteer in an online group called Coders for Sanders  Alexandra Rojas  a just turned 21 year old college student who was working three jobs  and Corbin Trent  who was selling gourmet burgers in Morristown  Tennessee   I asked the wife if I could sell the food truck and go to work for Bernie   Trent said  A month and a half later  he was hired on  When it became clear Sanders would lose  supporters shifted to a new mission   What if we could do exactly the same thing  not only for president  but Congress  all at once   asked Chakrabarti   Brand New Congress was launched in April 2016 with a goal of recruiting 400 candidates  all political outsiders with a record of community activism who would run on a single populist platform  Scornful of the Democratic Party hierarchy and the influence of big money donors  the founders vowed to stay independent of any party   even if it meant finding progressives willing to run as Republicans   We have to think big or go home   said Isra Allison  a Sanders volunteer from Charlotte  North Carolina  They toured the country and put out a call for nominations of candidates  more than 10 000 poured in  One name that surfaced  Ocasio Cortez  a bartender from the Bronx nominated by her brother  Allison called her the day after Christmas  and a couple months later Exley and Chakrabarti met the fledgling candidate over a Thai dinner in lower Manhattan   I wasn t sure what to make of her   Chakrabarti said   She was too articulate  I think is exactly what I told Zack   But the advocates quickly realized they were sharing a meal with a potential game changer  They looked for others  At weekend  boot camps   candidates were coached in the basics of electioneering  and thrashed out a platform including Medicare for All  a  15 per hour minimum wage and free college tuition  Another bold idea  to abolish U S  Immigration and Customs Enforcement  ICE  surfaced at a Brand New Congress event in 2017  Soon the group was swamped by the challenge of vetting so many candidates   and convincing promising aspirants they could win  There were other problems  After Trump s polarizing election  the notion that progressives could transcend partisan politics faded  and Brand New Congress began to struggle with fundraising  The group was told it couldn t use ActBlue  the popular Democratic fundraising platform  if it backed candidates running as Republicans  Trent said   It was like pushing a rock up a hill   Trent said  Many of the original BNC people  including Exley  Trent  Chakrabarti and Rojas  abandoned the nonpartisan idea to join Justice Democrats  formed in early 2017 with a mission to rebuild the party to align with a progressive agenda  Others stayed behind at the BNC   I didn t want to work with any organization that had a political affiliation   said Allison  The two organizations tried sharing a political action committee  but separated entirely last October  Trent and Chakrabarti now work for Ocasio Cortez  campaign  Overall  Justice Democrats endorsed 68 House candidates  including some originally recruited by the BNC  21 won primaries or made it to the general election  37 lost  two dropped out and eight are in races yet to be decided  Still  the BNC founders cite the Ocasio Cortez breakthrough as a sign of what is possible   I think now when we approach people for 2020  they re going to think we re a little less nuts   Trent said  MULTIPLE MOVEMENTS Brand New Congress and Justice Democrats are just two players in a movement where different groups with different agendas jostle for donations and influence in the midterms  Some  like Democracy for America and the Progressive Change Campaign Committee  were in place years before the Sanders campaign  California billionaire Tom Steyer  the Democrats  largest donor  has spent millions of his own money on NextGen America  a group that aims to mobilize young voters  The hedge fund manager turned activist vows to build the largest progressive operation in America   The overwhelming number of people whatever their particular affiliation   whether Republican or Democrat or independent   feel as if the political establishment is not hearing them   he said  The result  he says  is low turnout   particularly by young people who lean toward Democrats  With his fiery calls to impeach Trump  Steyer is among the progressives butting heads with leaders of the Democratic Party s establishment  who fear turning off moderate voters  This year  progressives have complained about the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee  which recruits candidates  fundraises and helps plan campaigns for Democrats vying for House seats  In some competitive districts  the DCCC has intervened to back more centrist candidates  ones they consider more electable  The DCCC focuses on finding candidates with records that fit their districts  a spokeswoman said   The DCCC has long valued the unprecedented influence that the grassroots have in these races   said communications director Meredith Kelly  Leon Panetta  who served 16 years in Congress and then as a top official in the Clinton and Obama administrations  said Democrats are  going through turmoil  trying to settle on a vision   Very frankly  it s a party of a lot of very different voices right now   Panetta said  Others downplay the notion of a civil war  Elaine Kamarck  among the founders of the New Democrat movement that helped move the party away from liberal policies in the 1990s  now analyzes the midterms as a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution  She found most primaries in competitive districts were captured by centrist candidates  Kamarck  who also served as a super delegate for Clinton in 2016  says Democrats need to appeal to moderate voters if they hope to retake Congress  She calls the idea that unabashed progressivism can win in Republican tilting districts the political equivalent of  repealing the laws of physics    I find myself doing a lot of eye rolling   she said   There s always the argument in the Democratic Party  if only we had really liberal candidates  we would do better  It has never been true before   Could this year be different   We ll see   THE RACE IN NEBRASKA One race that may help answer the question is in Omaha  where Eastman will try to unseat a Republican incumbent  Don Bacon  in a district with 13 000 more Republicans than Democrats  Unlike the rest of deeply Republican Nebraska  though  Democrats have been able to win in this district  which stretches from the gentrifying neighborhoods of Omaha  now attracting a surge of millennials  to conservative leaning suburban neighborhoods near Offutt Air Force Base  where Bacon once served as commanding officer  Obama narrowly won the district in 2008  Trump took it by two points in 2016  Eastman  a nonprofit executive  was considered by the party establishment as far too liberal for Nebraska  She supported a single payer healthcare system that would replace private insurance  and a list of other progressive causes  tough gun rules  support for abortion rights  a  15 minimum wage  Democratic state and national party leaders mostly lined up behind Brad Ashford  a moderate one time Republican who already represented the district for one term  Thanks in part to backing from the DCCC and other national groups  Ashford had far more money  The Eastman campaign said it knocked on 60 000 doors  On May 15  she won by 3 percentage points  After the primary  the DCCC added her to its  Red to Blue  list  along with other progressives who beat establishment candidates  Seeking to pummel Eastman  the Congressional Leadership Fund  a group working in swing districts to protect the GOP majority  has opened a field office in Omaha and already purchased  1 6 million worth of ads  while the Republican National Committee calls her an  out of touch  single payer touting radical   One CLF ad chides Eastman for her teenage membership in a band with an obscene name   Pieces of Fuck  Eastman s positions  might work in some districts in California  but it s not representative of Nebraska 2   said Courtney Alexander  CLF communications director  Eastman says Omaha voters are not scared by  pragmatic and common sense  ideas to remake the healthcare system  She believes the key to winning districts like hers is inspiring more Democrats to turn out   not running as a  Republican light  moderate   When they lose  we say   See  Democrats can t win here     she said   We have to get people inspired to vote  and just running against Donald Trump is not enough   THE FIGHT IN MIAMI The same debate is playing out this summer in South Florida  where the progressive insurgency has touched off a raucous fight between Democratic hopefuls in Florida s Congressional District 27  which includes trendy Miami Beach  affluent Coral Gables and Little Havana s Hispanic immigrants  Represented for three decades by a retiring Cuban American Republican  Ileana Ros Lehtinen  the district favored Hillary Clinton by nearly 20 percentage points in 2016  It s considered perhaps the easiest takeover target for Democrats in the country  though nine Republicans are running  including former Miami Dade County Commissioner Bruno Barreiro and television journalist Maria Elvira Salazar  Four Democrats have challenged Shalala in the August 28 primary  One  David Richardson  has attacked Shalala as a  corporate  Democrat who  sold out progressive values   running ads slamming her for serving on the board of UnitedHealth Group  NYSE UNH  and for once telling a comedian she opposed universal healthcare  Shalala says it was a joke  A state representative  Richardson has won the endorsement of progressive groups including Our Revolution 305 in Miami and the Congressional Progressive Caucus   caucus co chair Wisconsin Representative Mark Pocan campaigned with him Friday   and boasts of raising more than  900 000 in small dollar donations  Progressive support has helped him match Shalala in fundraising   although both are wealthy and each pumped  500 000 into their campaigns  Matt Haggman  a former Miami Herald reporter who also is running  broadcast a TV commercial calling for the abolishment of ICE  the federal agency under fire for separating immigrant children from their parents on the U S  Mexico border   This is a moment when our politics are fundamentally broken  and this must be a moment of renewal   he said  That idea has begun to catch on with Democratic voters across the country  who are now evenly split on whether to abolish the border control agency formed after the September 11  2001  attacks  a Reuters Ipsos poll found  The same poll shows how the idea of expanding Medicare has won wide support among Democratic voters   and even many Republicans  The Democrats  best known contender is Shalala  the former University of Miami president who once ran the Clinton Foundation  Some voters say they view her establishment ties with suspicion   I am definitely looking for more of a new guard   said Scott Silverman  a 37 year old actuary who met Haggman during a canvassing session in Palmetto Bay  a neighborhood of spacious ranch homes with lush yards and the occasional peacock in the road  Silverman blames the party s leaders for Trump   The fact that they couldn t beat him says something about the establishment of the Democratic Party   The first Democrat to enter the race was Michael Hepburn  another of the original candidates recruited by Brand New Congress  Hepburn left his job as a college adviser to campaign full time  He hoped to raise money together with his fellow candidates  but that idea didn t work out  and his latest campaign report showed him down to his last  434  Most days  he takes public transportation to working class neighborhoods to knock on doors  During a recent debate  he donned boxing gloves   Everybody sounds bold  Everybody sounds progressive now   Hepburn said  Even Shalala is claiming the label  calling herself a  pragmatic progressive   She said she supports a version of  Medicare for All   allowing people of all ages the option to buy into an improved model of the government program currently available to older Americans  or keep private insurance  The idea would have seemed a liberal pipe dream in the 1990s  when she helped lead Clinton s doomed effort to pass healthcare reform  
 I m just pragmatic  because I have run a health care system and because I have seen politics at the national level   she said   It doesn t mean that I am not a progressive or don t want to see the system evolve    But we have to get there  ",2018-08-23,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/inside-the-progressive-movement-roiling-the-democratic-party-1584614,1584614

188073,409589,UNH,Here Are 5 Stocks With Remarkable Interest Coverage Ratio,opinion,A layman can end up losing bucks if he decides to pick a stock only on the basis of numbers flashing on a real time stock screen  A critical analysis of a company s financial background is essential for a better investment decision Often investors evaluate a company s performance by simply looking at its sales and earnings  which sometimes do not reveal the real picture  To be more precise  they do not tell whether a company s fundamentals are sound enough to meet its financial obligations  Here  the role of coverage ratios comes into play   the higher these are the more efficient an enterprise will be in meeting its financial obligations Why Interest Coverage Ratio Interest Coverage Ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charges on its debt Debt  which is crucial to financing operations for the majority of companies  comes at a cost called interest  Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company  And the company s creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets its interest obligations  Therefore  Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision Interest Coverage Ratio   Earnings before Interest   Taxes  EBIT  divided by Interest Expense Interest Coverage Ratio suggests how many times the interest could be paid from earnings and gauges the margin of safety a firm has for paying interest An interest coverage ratio lower than one suggests that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt  A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardships  One should also track the company s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time The Winning StrategyApart from having an Interest Coverage ratio that is more than the industry average  adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a  of A or B to your search criteria should lead to better results Interest Coverage Ratio greater than X Industry MedianPrice greater than or equal to 5  The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher 5 Year Historical EPS Growth     greater than X Industry Median  Stocks that have a strong EPS growth history Projected EPS Growth     greater than X Industry Median  This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years  This shows that the stock has near term earnings growth

Coverage Ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charged on its debt Debt  which is crucial for most of the companies to finance operations  comes at a cost called interest  Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company and the company s creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets its interest obligations  Therefore  Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision Interest Coverage Ratio suggests the number of times the interest could be paid from earnings and also gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest An interest coverage ratio lower than 1 0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt  A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardship  Definitely  one should also track the company s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time What s the Strategy Apart from having an Interest Coverage Ratio that is more than the industry average  adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a  of A or B to your search criteria should lead to better results Interest Coverage Ratio greater than X Industry MedianPrice greater than or equal to 5  The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher 5 Year Historical EPS Growth     greater than X Industry Median  Stocks that have a strong EPS growth history Projected EPS Growth     greater than X Industry Median  This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years  This shows that the stock has near term earnings growth potential Average 20 Day Volume greater than 100 000  A

188152,409668,UNH,Bull Of The Day  UnitedHealth Group  UNH ,opinion,"Earnings season is an exciting time for investors  as a plethora of new information presents a fresh opportunity to buy strong stocks  One example of a stock that still has room to run higher in the wake of its earnings announcement is UnitedHealth Group  UNH  
UnitedHealth is a managed health care company  Through its Optum segment  UNH provides health analytics  billing solutions  pharmacy benefits management  care delivery services  and other technology forward offerings  The company s UnitedHealthcare unit provides benefit plans  UNH is one of the largest companies in the United States and the world s largest healthcare company in terms of revenue 
UnitedHealth reported earnings on January 15  The company posted quarterly earnings of  3 28 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate and improving 27  year over year  Revenue for the period was  58 4 billion  ahead of estimates and about 12  higher than the year ago quarter thanks to healthy growth across both segments 
Revenue at UnitedHealthcare improved 11  year over year  Optum revenue surged 13   Total operating costs across the whole company were up 12   but UNH offset this through a 10 basis point improvement to operating margin  Management reaffirmed its 2019 EPS guidance and said that it expects full year revenue in the range of  243 to  245 billion 
UNH s positive quarter and strong outlook naturally led to upward earnings estimate revisions for the company 
The Zacks Rank is founded on a belief that share prices and earnings estimate revisions are inherently related  Since UNH has witnessed positive estimate revisions  it has earned a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  rating  This is a one to three month indicator of direction and should help extend UNH s post earnings momentum  The stock is currently up about 8  since its report was posted 
There are several other things to like about UNH in addition to this earnings optimism  For one  the company s growth rates deserve more praise  UNH has witnessed a CAGR of 12  from 2006 to 2018  underscoring its strong market position and core business  UNH sports an  A  grade in the Growth category of our Style Scores system 
Optum has been one of the primary drivers of growth in recent years  This has been led by growth in pharmacy care services  care delivery  technology  government services  and international operations  From 2014 to 2018  Optum s contribution to operating earnings has increased from 25  to 47  
There s also a decent value case to be made for the stock right now  Shares are trading at about 18x earnings  which is a slight premium to the industry s average of 16x  but certainly within reason for a market leader  UNH also sports respectable PEG and P S ratios of 1 4 and 1 1  respectively  The stock has earned a  B  grade for Value in our Style Scores system 
This leads to a closer examination of UNH s strong balance sheet  The company has generated mostly increased cash flows from 2009 through 2018  only declining in 2013  For 2019  UNH expects cash flow in the range of  17 3 to  17 8 billion  which would represent year over year growth of 12  at the midpoint  This cash flow strength allows the company to repurchase shares and increase the dividend 
UNH simply has the ideal combination of industry leadership and recent earnings momentum  This is a stock that should continue to climb in this type of market

What s Next for UnitedHealth 
While UnitedHealth has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for UnitedHealth was favorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

188194,409710,UNH,Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Tuesday,news,"Investing com   Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Tuesday  January 16 
1  Cryptocurrencies Plunge as Bitcoin Suffers Double Digit Selloff
The prices of major cryptocurrencies plunged sharply  with Bitcoin  Ethereum and Ripple all suffering severe double digit percentage losses amid a broad based selloff 
Declining Japanese and South Korean trading volumes as well as fears over rising scrutiny from global regulators were blamed for spooking the market 
Bitcoin was down around 18  at  11 276  It fell by more than 20  to a six week low of  10 891 at one point  It is now down more than 40  from the record high in mid December 
Ethereum  the world s second largest cryptocurrency by market cap  was down 22  at  1 039  well below a lifetime high of  1 423 20 reached on Saturday 
Meanwhile  Ripple s XRP token was trading at  1 2527  down around 31  for the day 
2018 has not started well for cryptocurrencies  with last week marking the second week in a row of poor performances 
2  Dow Futures Point to Big Open Ahead of  Citigroup  Earnings
Wall Street futures traded significantly higher  pointing to another record session when traders return from the long holiday weekend 
The blue chip Dow futures were up 256 points  or around 1   to a fresh record of 26 058 ahead of markets stateside re opening following Martin Luther King Jr  Day 
S P 500 futures rose 14 points  or around 0 5   while the tech heavy Nasdaq 100 futures added 34 points  or roughly 0 5  
This week marks the first big week of the fourth quarter earnings season  with Citigroup  NYSE C  and UnitedHealth  NYSE UNH  the big names on the docket today 
3  Dollar Licks Its Wounds
The U S  dollar languished near three year lows  weighed by rising expectations that central banks in Japan and the euro zone could pare their monetary stimulus sooner than expected 
The dollar index  which gauges the U S  currency against a basket of six major rivals  was last at 90 40  after dropping as low as 90 05 on Monday  when U S  markets were closed  That was its deepest nadir since December 2014 
Against the yen  the dollar was at 110 62  after slumping to a four month low at 110 33 on Monday 
The euro was at 1 2230  not far from a three year peak of 1 2296 reached a day earlier 
The dollar has weakened broadly recently amid the view that the global economic recovery will outpace U S  growth and prompt other major central banks  led by the ECB to begin unwinding loose monetary policy at a faster pace than has been expected 
4  Oil Falls From 2014 Highs on Rising U S  Rig Count
Crude prices edged away from their strongest level since late 2014  as the market weighed rising U S  drilling activity against ongoing efforts by major producers to cut output to reduce a global glut 
U S  West Texas Intermediate crude futures dipped 0 1  to  64 28 per barrel  while Brent futures shed 0 7  to  69 75 per barrel 
Both benchmarks reached their best levels since Dec  2014 in the prior session 
Analysts and traders have recently warned that U S  shale oil producers could ramp up production in the coming weeks as they look to take advantage of higher prices  potentially derailing an OPEC led effort to curb excess supply 
5  UK Inflation Posts First Decline in 6 Months 
British inflation eased for the first time in six months in December  thanks to the cost of air fares as well as games and toys 
The decline took the rate to 3 0  from 3 1  in November  which was the fastest in more than five years  A core measure of consumer price growth slipped to a five month low of 2 5  
The Office for National Statistics said it s too early to say if the move is the  start of any longer term reduction in the rate

188204,409720,UNH,UnitedHealth Group  UNH  Gains But Lags Market  What You Should Know,opinion,"UnitedHealth Group  UNH  closed at  239 62 in the latest trading session  marking a  1 17  move from the prior day  The stock lagged the S P 500 s daily gain of 3 43   At the same time  the Dow added 3 29   and the tech heavy Nasdaq gained 4 26  
Coming into today  shares of the largest U S  health insurer had lost 14 45  in the past month  In that same time  the Medical sector lost 11 69   while the S P 500 lost 12 15  
UNH will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release  which is expected to be January 15  2019  On that day  UNH is projected to report earnings of  3 22 per share  which would represent year over year growth of 24 32   Meanwhile  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of  57 94 billion  up 11 29  from the year ago period 
It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for UNH  These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short term business trends  With this in mind  we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company s business outlook 
Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near term share price momentum  To benefit from this  we have developed the Zacks Rank  a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system 
Ranging from  1  Strong Buy  to  5  Strong Sell   the Zacks Rank system has a proven  outside audited track record of outperformance  with  1 stocks returning an average of  25  annually since 1988  Over the past month  the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant  UNH is currently a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  
Investors should also note UNH s current valuation metrics  including its Forward P E ratio of 16 2  Its industry sports an average Forward P E of 13 61  so we one might conclude that UNH is trading at a premium comparatively 
Also  we should mention that UNH has a PEG ratio of 1 2  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  The Medical   HMOs industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 1 05 as of yesterday s close 
The Medical   HMOs industry is part of the Medical sector  This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 63  putting it in the top 25  of all 250  industries 
The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups  Our research shows that the top 50  rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1

188205,409721,UNH,UnitedHealth Group  UNH  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"UnitedHealth Group  UNH  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 15  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This largest U S  health insurer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  3 22 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  24 3  
Revenues are expected to be  57 94 billion  up 11 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for UnitedHealth 
For UnitedHealth  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that UnitedHealth will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that UnitedHealth would post earnings of  3 30 per share when it actually produced earnings of  3 41  delivering a surprise of  3 33  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
UnitedHealth doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-07,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/unitedhealth-group-unh-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200373680,200373680

188218,409734,UNH,Why The Earnings Surprise Streak Could Continue For UnitedHealth  UNH ,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering UnitedHealth Group  UNH   which belongs to the Zacks Medical   HMOs industry 
This largest U S  health insurer has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 3 48  
For the most recent quarter  UnitedHealth was expected to post earnings of  3 30 per share  but it reported  3 41 per share instead  representing a surprise of 3 33   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  3 03 per share  while it actually produced  3 14 per share  a surprise of 3 63  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for UnitedHealth  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
UnitedHealth currently has an Earnings ESP of  1 33   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on January 15  2019 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate

188238,409754,UNH,Did Trump Just Save The Stock Market ,opinion,"Yesterday s surge of the S P 500 and the Dow was viewed as one of the best post midterm recoveries since 1982  This trend has been observed for the past 36 years wherein the market jumps following a midterm election 
The outlook was not good in the days preceding the results  with many analysts predicting a slump should the Democrats take the House  Others expected a full on crash were they to take the Senate  In light of the new  bipartisan Congress  equities leveled out and shareholders saw a good time to dive back in to the market 
And while the mid term elections certainly contributed to the recent surge  the majority of the credit goes to President Trump  who s words gave several major indexes the lift they needed  In a world of  covfefe  you might be wondering what on earth our president said this time  It turns out he is willing to support the Democratic party on many policies  fostering good feelings between the parties and clearing the path for a truly bipartisan government 
In addition  he revoked Jim Acosta  the CNN White House Correspondent s press pass after the journalist accosted an intern  As far as days go  this was certainly one of Trump s best 
There were several companies who managed to have an even better Wednesday than the President as their daily gains surpassed all others 
Rounding the day out 545 points above the previous day  The Dow s success could largely be attributed to Apple s resounding success that same day 
Another winner Wednesday was UnitedHealth  NYSE UNH   which soared upon the opening of the market  closing with a 4 21  gain 
The post midterms allowed for a sigh of relief from the bulls   many of whom anxiously await the market s seemingly inevitable fall  despite Trump s stock motivating words 
The S P averaged about 0 7  in gains in the day immediately following the elections  a number that seems small in comparison to Thursday s gains 
Looking at the cold hard numbers  one can t deny that the good bipartisan feelings that the President presented at a timely press conference gave the market a much needed boost 
 Hopefully we can all work together next year to continue delivering for the American people  including on economic growth  infrastructure  trade  lowering the cost of prescription drugs   President Trump said   the Democrats will come to us with a plan for infrastructure  a plan for health care  a plan for whatever they re looking at and we ll negotiate  
Midterm stock recoveries are as much an American tradition as fourth of July fireworks or apple pie  Historical data would suggest that we can look forward to a slight recovery of the market which is easy to get excited about and the bulls are rearing to go 
2018 s midterms are unlike the traditional recovery  not just because of the political climate  but also because the Fed s interest hike down the road in December 
The Fed Chairman  Jerome Powell  is keen on keeping to schedule with his proposed rate increase and  based on the market s reaction at getting the news this past October  the initiation of such a rate increase could cause things to crash  What s worse is that the over eager investors who dove back in post midterms may exacerbate the drop 
Am I saying that a crash is inevitable  No  And I wouldn t go so far as to say a long term downtrend is on the horizon  It s simply too early to make those sort of predictions  All I ask is that you look both ways before jumping into the busy intersection that is the stock market  Investors are hoping to see inflated equities that will heal the portfolios burned in the October Effect before jumping ship 
That only spells trouble for the current  but apparently temporary stability we are seeing in the market  With such a volatile time in our economy I could hardly recommend re entering the market at this time ",2018-11-08,Bill Poulos,https://www.investing.com/analysis/did-trump-just-save-the-stock-market-200357144,200357144

188248,409764,UNH,Counting the costs  U S  hospitals feeling the pain of physician burnout,news,"By Julie Steenhuysen
ANN ARBOR  Mich   Reuters    Dr  Brian Halloran  a vascular surgeon at St  Joseph Mercy Ann Arbor  starts planning his garden long before spring arrives in southeast Michigan 
His tiny plot  located in the shadow of the 537 bed teaching hospital  helps Halloran cope with burnout from long hours and the stress of surgery on gravely ill patients 
 You really have to find the balance to put it a little more in perspective   he said 
Hospitals such as St  Joseph Mercy Ann Arbor have been investing in programs ranging from yoga classes to personal coaches designed to help doctors become more resilient  But national burnout rates keep rising  with up to 54 percent of doctors affected 
Some leading healthcare executives now say the way medicine is practiced in the United States is to blame  fueled in part by growing clerical demands that have doctors spending two hours on the computer for every one hour they spend seeing patients 
What s more  burnout is not just bad for doctors  it s bad for patients and bad for business  according to interviews with more than 20 healthcare executives  doctors and burnout experts 
 This really isn t just about exercise and getting enough sleep and having a life outside the hospital   said Dr  Tait Shanafelt  a former Mayo Clinic researcher who became Stanford Medicine s first chief physician wellness officer in September 
 It has at least as much or more to do with the environment in which these folks are practicing   he said 
Shanafelt and other researchers have shown that burnout erodes job performance  increases medical errors and leads doctors to leave a profession they once loved 
For a graphic  click 
Hospitals can ill afford these added expenses in an era of tight margins  costly nursing shortages and uncertainty over the fate of the Affordable Care Act  which has put capital projects and payment reform efforts on hold 
 Burnout decreases productivity and increases errors  It s a big deal   said Cleveland Clinic Chief Executive Dr  Toby Cosgrove  one of 10 U S  healthcare CEOs who earlier this year declared physician burnout a public health crisis 
 
WHAT TO DO 
Hospitals are just beginning to recognize the toll of burnout on their operations 
Experts estimate  for example  that it can cost more than a  1 million to recruit and train a replacement for a doctor who leaves because of burnout 
But no broad calculation of burnout costs exists  Shanafelt said  Stanford  Harvard Business School  Mayo and the American Medical Association are working on that  They have put together a comprehensive estimate of the costs of burnout at the organizational and societal level  which has been submitted to a journal for review 
In July  the National Academy of Medicine  NAM  called on researchers to identify interventions that ease burnout  Meanwhile  some hospitals and health insurers are already trying to lighten the load 
Cleveland Clinic last year increased the number of nurse practitioners and other highly trained providers by 25 percent to 1 600 to handle more routine tasks for its 3 600 physicians  It hired eight pharmacists to help with prescription refills 
Atrius Health  Massachusetts  largest independent physicians group  is diverting unnecessary email traffic away from doctors to other staffers and simplifying medical records  aiming to cut 1 5 million mouse  clicks  per year 
Insurer UnitedHealth Group  NYSE UNH   which operates physician practices for more than 20 000 doctors through its Optum subsidiary  launched a program to help doctors quickly determine whether drugs are covered by a patient s insurance plan during the patient visit  It is also running a pilot program for Medicare plans in eight states to shrink the number of procedures that require prior authorization 
Similarly   Aetna Inc   NYSE AET  this year began a behavioral health program that eliminates prior authorization requirements for admission to some high performing hospitals 
DOCTOR OVERLOAD
Experts define burnout as a syndrome marked by emotional exhaustion  cynicism and decreased effectiveness  Many burned out doctors cut back their hours to cope  and a disturbing number commit suicide 
A landmark 2015 Mayo Clinic study found that more than 7 percent of nearly 7 000 doctors had considered suicide within the prior 12 months  compared with 4 percent of other workers  About 400 a year go through with it 
Driving the burnout symptoms is the burden of data entry on clumsy electronic medical records systems that doctors must use to prove the quality of their care  said Dr  Christine Sinsky  vice president of professional satisfaction at the American Medical Association 
Sinsky recently conducted an experiment in her own internal medicine practice in Dubuque  Iowa  She asked a staff member how many mouse clicks it takes to order and record a single patient s flu shot in their electronic medical record  The answer  32 
She has visited some practices where a doctor had to record flu shots for more than 1 000 patients because only the doctor was allowed to enter the order 
Such mandates reflect an overly strict interpretation of federal health reforms designed to encourage doctors to use electronic medical records  such as the 2009 Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act that required doctors to demonstrate  meaningful use  of the systems 
 We have to recognize the exacting toll that the first generation of electronic health records have had on physicians   Sinsky said   I would identify it as one of the most important drivers of physician burnout  
Pre approval requirements from health insurers for many services and quality metrics built into Obamacare have added to doctors  administrative duties 
 We ve got this measurement mania  We ve got to back off of that   said Dr  Paul Harkaway  chief accountable care officer for Michigan s St  Joseph Mercy Health System  a part of Trinity Health  a national not for profit Catholic healthcare system 
As a result of these requirements  primary care physicians spend more than half of their 11 4 hour workday performing data entry and other tasks  according to a September AMA University of Wisconsin study published in the Annals of Family Medicine 
To manage  doctors often finish work at home in the evening  a part of the day known as  pajama time     
COSTS TO THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM
Doctors  suffering can take a direct toll on patients  In a 2010 study  Shanafelt and colleagues found that the more burned out a surgeon was  the more likely he or she was to report a major medical error  Other studies have shown that burnout drives up rates of unnecessary testing  referrals to specialists and hospital admissions 
When doctors quit  it costs an estimated  800 000 to  1 3 million in recruitment  training and productivity costs  depending on the specialty 
Even when physicians don t leave  they can contribute thousands of dollars in costs each year  just as a matter of inefficient functioning   said Dr  Colin West of the Mayo Clinic 
The trend has medical malpractice experts concerned  CRICO  the malpractice carrier for Harvard University s two dozen affiliated hospitals  recently had to settle a handful of cases because doctors were too burned out to fight  even though CRICO believed it could win 
 The clinician just wanted it to go away   said Dr  Luke Sato  CRICO s chief medical officer  Sato estimates that an average breast or colorectal cancer malpractice case might cost  750 000 to  1 million to settle 
The crisis has Harkaway worried for his colleagues in Michigan  and for his profession

188319,409835,UNH,As clock ticks  Republicans try to move ahead on Obamacare repeal,news,By Susan Cornwell and Amanda Becker WASHINGTON  Reuters    The Trump administration and top U S  Senate Republicans pushed on Tuesday for action on a bill to dismantle Obamacare  but time was running out and they were still hunting for the votes needed to pass their latest attempt to gut the 2010 healthcare law   Vice President Mike Pence lunched with Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill to urge them to approve the legislation introduced last week by Republican Senators Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy  Pence said President Donald Trump backs the bill   Now is the time  We have 12 days  to pass it  Pence said before the lunch  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  who fell a single vote short of securing passage of another healthcare overhaul bill in July  said the Graham Cassidy legislation  has a great deal of support   but would not commit to bringing it to the Senate floor for consideration  After Sept  30  the last day of the fiscal year  procedural rules will make it much more difficult for Republicans  The bill after Oct  1 would need 60 votes in the 100 seat Senate to be brought up for consideration  rather than a simple majority until the end of the month  Despite controlling both chambers of Congress and the White House  Republicans this year have failed to make good on their seven year effort to dismantle a law that was the top legislative achievement of Trump s Democratic predecessor Barack Obama  Having suffered the humiliating failure in July  Republican congressional leaders only want to hold a vote on legislation they know can pass   At the end of the day  I really believe we re going to get 50 Republican votes   Graham told reporters  but he would not say how many committed votes he has now in a Senate that his party controls 52 48  Dismantling the Affordable Care Act  known informally as Obamacare  was a central campaign promise last year by Trump  Republicans call that law a government overreach into the healthcare system  Democrats point out that it has expanded health insurance coverage to some 20 million more people  The new bill could give Republicans one last shot this year on healthcare  It proposes to replace Obamacare with a system giving states money in block grants to run their own healthcare programs  It would allow states to opt out of certain Obamacare protections for consumers and waive regulations requiring insurers to cover certain health benefits  It also would end the Obamacare expansion of the Medicaid insurance program for the poor and disabled   Similar to proposals that were considered in the Senate in July  we believe the Graham Cassidy amendment would result in millions of Americans losing their health insurance coverage  destabilize health insurance markets  and decrease access to affordable coverage and care   said James Madara  chief executive of the American Medical Association  Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said Republicans were  grossly irresponsible  to consider the Cassidy Graham legislation before getting a full assessment of its effects from the non partisan Congressional Budget Office  UNDECIDED SENATORS Several Republicans  including the same three senators whose  no  votes blocked the earlier bill in July  are still undecided  including Graham s close friend John McCain  A bipartisan group of 10 governors wrote a letter to Senate leaders asking them not to consider the Cassidy Graham bill  and instead urged support for bipartisan talks on healthcare legislation now going on in the Senate health committee  Alaska Governor Bill Walker was among those who signed the letter  One of his state s two senators  Republican Lisa Murkowski  is among those undecided on the Cassidy Graham bill  Meanwhile the clock is ticking  The Senate will not be in session Wednesday through Sunday  The Senate Finance Committee said it will hold a hearing on the bill next Monday  Graham said House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan has told him that if the Senate passes the Cassidy Graham bill  the House will  too  Ryan has told McConnell that the separate bipartisan healthcare effort in the Senate that aims to protect some subsidies being paid to insurance companies to help people buy insurance policies would not be viable in the House  according to a source familiar with the discussion who asked not to be identified  Trump s administration has repeatedly threatened to cut off payments made directly to insurers  called cost sharing reductions  that help cover out of pocket medical expenses for low income consumers  It faced a deadline on Wednesday to make the payments for the month of September  and insurers expected to receive the payments   If the bill were to go through  it would likely affect revenue at most insurers  including small companies like  Centene  Corp  N CNC  and Molina Healthcare  N MOH  that focus on Medicaid  and larger more diversified companies like Anthem Inc  N ANTM    Aetna Inc   N AET  and UnitedHealth Group  N UNH   Wall Street analysts said  Aetna shares were off 2 8 percent on Tuesday

188341,409857,UNH,UnitedHealth names Wichmann CEO  Helmsley executive chairman,news,"By Michael Erman
NEW YORK  Reuters    UnitedHealth Group Inc  N UNH  said on Wednesday president David Wichmann will become the company s chief executive  succeeding Stephen Hemsley  who is moving to the newly created role of executive chairman after more than a decade at the helm of the largest U S  health insurer 
Wichmann  54  was widely viewed inside and outside of the company as Hemsley s likely successor  although the timing of the change was sooner than some had expected 
Under 65 year old Hemsley  UnitedHealth became one of the biggest sellers of insurance plans on the exchanges created as part of former President Barack Obama s national healthcare law 
However  mounting losses from the programme prompted the company to largely exit from Obamacare plans in 2017 
Current Chairman Richard Burke will become UnitedHealth s lead independent chairman  UnitedHealth said  The changes are all effective Sept  1 
Wichmann has spent nearly 20 years with the company and was previously its chief financial officer  He has long
been in charge of the insurer s mergers and acquisitions 
 Management is the single most important factor in our view of UnitedHealth   and with Hemsley staying in a very important operating strategic role  we are very comfortable with this change   Mizuho Securities analyst Sheryl Skolnick wrote in a research note 
As founder  Burke also remains on the board   The guardians of the UNH galaxy are firmly in place   Skolnick said 
The insurer reported a higher than expected quarterly profit last month  helped by its decision to abandon the Obamacare individual insurance market  amid uncertainty over the fate of the law under President Donald Trump s administration

188382,409898,UNH,As Obamacare repeal falters  insurers start to press on subsidies,news,"By Caroline Humer and Yasmeen Abutaleb NEW YORK WASHINGTON  Reuters    A failed Republican effort to replace Obamacare raised new concerns on Tuesday for U S  health insurers over whether the government will continue to fund billions of dollars in medical benefit subsidies  The healthcare bill under consideration in the U S  Senate would have settled the funding question  but was scrapped after Republican leaders were unable to rally enough party members to win approval   Its demise will test the ability of Republicans and Democrats to stabilize an insurance market serving some 10 million Americans in time for 2018   Republican President Donald Trump has suggested several times that he could eliminate the so called cost sharing reduction subsidies  which help pay for consumers  out of pocket healthcare expenses   The administration could do so as early as August  Insurers have braced for an end to these payments  in many cases raising proposed premium prices for 2018 more than 20 percent to make up for the lost funding  Insurers said on Tuesday they would like Congress to appropriate the funds for these payments  If that does not happen  and the Trump administration takes further measures to undermine Democratic former President Barack Obama s healthcare law  more insurers may pull out of markets for next year ahead of a late September deadline   That could force consumers to change plans or insurers   or leave them with no options at all   Our members and all Americans need the certainty and security of knowing coverage will be available and affordable for them   said Justine Handelman  senior vice president in the Office of Policy and Representation at the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association  which represents insurers nationwide    We have consistently urged that there be immediate  certain funding for the cost sharing reduction program  which helps those most in need with out of pocket costs when they access medical care    Molina Healthcare Inc   N MOH   which provides Obamacare health plans to more than 1 million people  said the fate of cost sharing subsidies is one of its top concerns  The Trump administration could take other steps on its own to undermine Obamacare  including refusing to enforce the individual mandate  which requires Americans to have health insurance or pay a fine   Trump has repeatedly said Obamacare  formally known as the Affordable Care Act  is collapsing  and on Tuesday suggested letting it  fail  to force Democrats to work on a healthcare fix  Earlier this year  the administration backed off more strictly enforcing the individual mandate and pulled ads that encouraged people to sign up for health insurance  Uncertainty over the government s next steps on Obamacare weighed on insurer shares on Tuesday  with Anthem Inc  N ANTM  down 1 4 percent and  Aetna Inc   N AET  off 1 1 percent  UnitedHealth Group  N UNH   which pulled out of the Obamacare individual insurance business  rose 0 3 percent after reporting a better than expected quarterly profit  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Senate would vote in the coming days on a full repeal of Obamacare with no replacement  but he did not appear to have the necessary support to push it through  Some Republicans and Democrats say they should attempt a joint fix  but the deep divisions between the two parties were on display over the subsidies on Tuesday  Democratic Senator Patty Murray said that bipartisan work can begin by having Congress fund the cost sharing subsidies   We know that s what needs to be done   she said in an interview   It would send a very strong message to the market   Several Republican senators were quick to deride the payments

188383,409899,UNH,Healthcare ETFs In Focus After Johnson   Johnson Q1 Earnings,opinion,"Shares of    NYSE JNJ   decreased 1 2  at market close on Apr 17  2018 despite beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both earnings and revenues  This was primarily due to the fact that its top  selling drug  Remicade witnessed a 17  decline in sales  owing to recent competition in the United States 
The company s revenues increased 12 9  on a year over year basis to  20 1 billion in first quarter 2018 and came ahead of the consensus mark of  19 5 billion 
Increase in sales was driven primarily by strong sales of cancer drugs  favorable foreign exchange trends and recent acquisition activity  In June 2017  JNJ in its biggest ever acquisition bought Swiss biopharmaceutical company  Actelion for  30 billion 
Johnson   Johnson reported non GAAP earnings per share  EPS  of  2 06 for first quarter 2018  up 12 6  year over year and 18 4  on a sequential basis  It beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 01 
Segment Sales and Outlook
The company reported increase in sales by geographical segments  U S  sales increased 6 1  to  10 0 billion from  9 4 billion in the year ago quarter  while International sales increased 10 9  to  10 1 billion from  8 4 billion 
Moreover  on a business segment basis  the company reported improvements in all the three segments  Consumer  Pharmaceutical and Medical devices revenues increased 5 3   19 4  and 7 5  respectively 
Although the company is facing headwinds related to sales of some of its key drugs like Remicade and Zytiga  certain new drugs are expected to make up for the loss  Its blood cancer drugs Darzalex and Imbruvica delivered strong sales growth in the quarter  However  the company s high dependence on the pharma segment is a concern  as the consumer and medical devices segment failed to register attractive growth 
Although J J still expects 2018 adjusted earnings per share in the range of  8 00  8 20  it increased its revenue guidance to a range of  81 0  81 8 billion from  80 6  81 4 billion expected earlier

188482,409998,UNH,How Republicans can hobble Obamacare even without repeal,news,"By Julie Steenhuysen CHICAGO  Reuters    Republicans may have failed to overthrow Obamacare this week  but there are plenty of ways they can chip away at it  The Trump administration has already begun using its regulatory authority to water down less prominent aspects of the 2010 healthcare law   Earlier this week  newly confirmed Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price stalled the rollout of mandatory Medicare payment reform programs for heart attack treatment  bypass surgery and joint replacements finalized by the Obama administration in December  The delays offer a glimpse at how President Donald Trump can use his administrative power to undercut aspects of the Affordable Care Act  ACA   including the insurance exchanges and Medicaid expansion that Republicans had sought to overturn  The Republicans  failure to repeal Obamacare  at least for now  means it remains federal law  Price s power resides in how to interpret that law  and which programs to emphasize and fund  Hospitals and physician groups have been counting on support from Medicare   the federal insurance program for the elderly and disabled   to continue driving payment reform policies built into Obamacare that reward doctors and hospitals for providing high quality care at a lower cost  The Obama Administration had committed to shifting half of all Medicare payments to these alternative payment models by 2018  Although he has voiced general support for innovative payment programs  Price has been a loud critic of mandatory federal programs that dictate how doctors should deliver healthcare  Providers such as Dr  Richard Gilfillan  chief executive of Trinity Healthcare  a  15 9 billion Catholic health system  say they will press on with these alternative payment plans with or without the government s blessing  But they have been actively lobbying Trump officials for support  according to interviews with more than a dozen hospital executives  physicians and policy experts  Without the backing of Medicare  the biggest payer in the U S  healthcare system which Price now oversees  the nascent payment reform movement could lose momentum  sidelining a transformation many experts believe is vital to reining in runaway U S  healthcare spending  Price  can t change the legislation  but of course he s supposed to implement it  He could impact it   said John Rother  chief executive of the National Coalition on Health Care  a broad alliance of healthcare stakeholders that has been lobbying the new administration for support of value based care  The move Friday to pull the Republican bill only reinforces the risk to the existing law  which Trump said on Friday  will soon explode     It seems that the Trump Administration now faces a choice whether to actively undermine the ACA or reshape it administratively   Larry Levitt  senior vice president at Kaiser Family Foundation  wrote on Twitter   The ACA marketplaces weren t collapsing  but they could be made to collapse through administrative actions   he added  NEW PAYMENT PLANS AT RISK  The United States spends  3 trillion a year on healthcare   more by far than 10 other wealthy countries   yet has the lowest life expectancy and the highest infant mortality rate  according to a 2013 Commonwealth Fund report  Link to Graphic    Health costs have soared thanks in part to the traditional way doctors and hospitals get paid  namely by receiving a fee for each service they provide  So the more advanced imaging tests a doctor orders or pricey procedures they perform  the more money he or she makes  regardless of whether the patient s health improves   We have a completely broken economy in healthcare   said Blair Childs  senior vice president at hospital purchasing group Premier Inc   Literally  all of the incentives in fee for service are for higher cost   Alternative payment models are designed to remove incentives that reward overtreatment of patients  Private insurers are on board  with  Aetna Inc   NYSE AET   Anthem Inc  UnitedHealth Group  NYSE UNH  and most Blue Cross insurers announcing plans to shift half of their reimbursement to alternative payment models to control costs  To promote the shift to alternative payments  the ACA created an incubator program at the Centers for Medicare   Medicaid Services  CMS   The CMS innovation center is funded by  10 billion over 10 years to test payment schemes aimed at improving quality and cutting the cost of care   The Obama administration s decision to make some of these payment programs mandatory has drawn the ire of Price  a former U S  senator and orthopedic surgeon  In response to a mandatory payment program for joint replacements last September  for example  Price charged that the CMS innovation center was  experimenting with Americans  health   In his January 17 confirmation  Price said he was a  strong supporter of innovation   but said he believed the CMS innovation center  has gotten a bit off track   TRUMP SETS WHEELS IN MOTION ON DAY 1 President Trump has already signed an executive order directing the HHS to begin unraveling Obamacare  In the early hours of his presidency  Trump directed government agencies to freeze regulations and take steps to weaken the healthcare law  The order directed departments to  waive  defer  grant exemptions from  or delay the implementation  of provisions that imposed fiscal burdens on states  companies or individuals  These moves were meant to minimize the costs and regulatory burdens imposed on states  private entities and individuals  David Cutler  the Harvard health economist who helped the Obama Administration shape the ACA  said Price could do all sorts of things to undermine the law  
 If he wants to blow it up  he can   Cutler said in an email  But if they do  he added   they alone will own the failure  ",2017-03-27,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/how-republicans-can-hobble-obamacare-even-without-repeal-468883,468883
188485,410001,UNH,WellCare Health  WCG  2018 Guidance  What s In The Cards ,opinion,"WellCare Health Plans  Inc    NYSE WCG   has issued guidance for 2018 and kept it intact for 2017  The company has retained its practice of providing outlook conservatively and beating estimates to surprise investors 
The company s interesting surprise history shows that it has surpassed estimates in 21 of 28 reported quarters in the past 
What the Recent Guidance Includes
Bottom Line Higher Year Over Year  For 2018  the company expects its adjusted earnings per share  EPS  at  8 40  8 65  reflecting a year over year increase of 2 4   The bottom line growth will be driven by accretion from the Universal American acquisition  Medicare Advantage organic growth  maturation of new Medicaid business  PBM contract renegotiation and selling  general and administrative cost leverage  However  these will be partially offset by the ACA industry fee reinstatement and a decrease in Florida Medicaid rate  The Zacks Consensus Estimate calls for EPS of  8 63        
Stronger Top Line  Adjusted premium revenues are expected in the range of  17 95 billion   18 475 billion  representing an 8 4  rise year over year  This upside will be backed by organic growth across all three businesses of Medicaid  Medicare Advantage and MA Part D  The acquisition of Universal American Corp  will further accrue to the top line   
Improvement in Medical Costs  The company also projected an improvement in MLR  Medical Loss Ratio  across all three business lines on the back of a continued momentum from clinical and operational initiatives and the HIPF reinstatement 
Though earnings will be supported by the above factors  the following might hurt the bottom line 
Rise in Interest Expenses  The health insurer estimates interest expenses of  69  72 million for 2018  comparing unfavorably with its 2017 forecast of  68  70 million 
Other Charges  Medicaid premium taxes of  120  125 million plus  51  56 million of acquisition related amortization expenses 
Higher Effective Tax Rate  Effective tax rate for 2018 is predicted in the band of 51 53   up from 32 5 33  for 2017  However  we consider this as a conservative outlook and expect the tax rate to benefit from the corporate tax reform 
Share Price Performance
In the last 12 months  the stock has gained 41   in line with the  s growth 

Our Take
All in all  the issued view upholds the company s strong fundamentals and its ability to perform in an industry confronting stiff competition  rising medical costs and high regulatory uncertainty 
Recently other health insurers namely  UnitedHealth Group Inc    NYSE UNH   and Centene Corp    NYSE CNC   came out with their respective earnings guidance for 2018 
UnitedHealth expects adjusted EPS of  10 55  10 85  up 7  year over year calculated at the midpoint 
Centene estimates adjusted EPS in the range of  5 47  5 87  This new guidance is also 14  higher than the midpoint of the range projected for 2017 adjusted EPS

Magellan Health beat estimates in three of the four reported quarters with an average positive surprise of 0 9

188492,410008,UNH,U S  stocks lower with Kraft Heinz and UnitedHealth in spotlight,news,"Investing com   Wall Street traded lower on Friday as a recent rally ran out of steam and investors focused on company headlines 
At 11 10AM ET  16 10GMT   the Dow Jones fell 58 points  or 0 28   the S P 500 lost 5 points  or 0 22   while the Nasdaq Composite traded down 3 points  or 0 05  
Losses in the Dow were attributed mainly to the fact that while Donald Trump gave his first solo press conference as President late on Thursday  he concentrated his remarks on defense of his administration and attacks on journalistic coverage 
The appearance offered no further details of his planned fiscal policies and tax cuts  leaving investors concerned about the fact that the President will still need to get approval from the U S  Congress for any action he plans to take to spur the economy 
In a session with no macro data ahead of a long weekend with markets closed next Monday for Washington s Birthday  investors found few excuses to continue pushing U S  stocks higher 
In company news  UnitedHealth Group  NYSE UNH  led the Dow lower with losses of more than 4  as the U S  Justice Department joined a lawsuit against the country s largest health insurer claiming that the firm and its units and affiliates overcharged Medicare hundreds of millions of dollars 
Also catching headlines  eyes were on Kraft Heinz  NASDAQ KHC  as  Unilever   LON ULVR  rejected its  143billion merger offer 
In big moves on earnings  Nu Skin Enterprises  NYSE NUS  tumbled nearly 12  as the beauty and nutritional care products maker missed estimates and released a lower than expected guidance 
On the upside  Truecar  NASDAQ TRUE  jumped nearly 9  as the car buying website operator beat consensus and gave an upbeat forecast for the current quarter 
Meanwhile  oil prices traded lower on Friday  extending losses in what looked to be its first weekly decline in five weeks 
Crude chalked up losses this week as the Energy Information Administration said Wednesday that U S  stockpiles of crude and gasoline hit record highs 
Oil prices have been stuck in a narrow range around the lower to mid  50s over the past two months as investors weigh the impact of cuts in supply from the historic OPEC non OPEC agreement against record stockpiles of crude and increased drilling activity in the United States 
On that last note  investors also looked ahead to the Baker Hughes U S  rig count data for the latest week that will be released later on Friday

188509,410025,UNH,Health insurers quietly shape Obamacare replacement with fewer risks,news,"By Caroline Humer and Susan Cornwell NEW YORK WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  health insurers are making their case to Republican lawmakers over how Americans sign up for individual insurance and pushing for other changes to shape the replacement of former President Barack Obama s national healthcare law   The health insurers  including Independence Blue Cross and Molina Healthcare Inc  are also recommending ways to put more control over insurance in the hands of states as the federal oversight of Obamacare is dismantled  They emphasize that it is crucial to keep government subsidies for low income people  These changes  described by executives  high level officials in the health insurance sector and lawmakers in nearly a dozen interviews with Reuters  include pushing for more strict enforcement of eligibility for these plans   Because Republicans are just starting to work with the new Trump administration and the debate is fluid  it is not clear ultimately what changes will take hold  But some of these ideas have started to surface in early Republican legislation  such as a co sponsored bill from Maine Senator Susan Collins that would keep subsidies   The moves underscore that private insurers are quietly working on how to benefit under the Trump administration  which is focusing on deregulation in healthcare  energy and manufacturing  And they show that insurers want to save aspects of Obamacare individual plans  but cut down on the risk to their own bottom lines and any hikes in premiums that threaten the viability of this insurance market  This market for individual insurance covers about 10 million people and is small compared to the employer based system that covers more than 160 million Americans and the government paid programs for over 120 million people   But it is one that insurers have described as having growth potential  While Obamacare cut the uninsured rate to 11 percent  there are still millions of uninsured Americans  The largest U S  insurer UnitedHealth Group Inc  NYSE UNH  told investors recently that it sees opportunities in new state based markets and is talking to policymakers   Many investors believe that the Republican deregulation push with Trump will benefit insurers   Clearly they support the private insurers and the role that they are going to play in any sort of new market   said Jeff Jonas  a portfolio manager at Gamco Investors in Rye  New York  which he said owns the publicly traded insurers  INFLUENCING WHAT  REPLACE  LOOKS LIKE President Donald Trump campaigned on a promise to repeal Obama s national healthcare law on his first day in office  He and Republicans have not presented an agreed upon replacement plan  but key issues they are expected to address include the law s requirements for individuals to have insurance  Insurers  main  ask  takes into account replacement plans under discussion in Congress  and largely assumes that government funds will continue to subsidize health benefits  at least for the next two to three years   Daniel Hilferty  CEO of Independence Blue Cross in Pennsylvania  told Reuters that he advocated tightening the rules around signing up for insurance outside of the open enrollment period  and tight control of which third parties are allowed to pay premiums for patients   Independence is part of a nationwide network of Blue Cross Blue Shield licensees such as Anthem Inc and has enrolled more than 300 000 consumers in individual plans   Hilferty s requests  echoed by other people in the industry who did not want to be named  are similar to demands the industry made of Obama  Enrollment outside of the regular period   and third party groups that keep poorer  sicker patients in the private market by paying their premiums   has helped lead to hundreds of millions of dollars in losses for insurers and pushed three of the nation s largest players out of the Obamacare market  In addition  Independence is also asking for a bigger role in signing up new customers who want to buy individual plans  Insurers sell plans both on the exchanges and off the exchanges  but subsidized plans are currently mostly sold on the government run HealthCare gov and on state run websites in a dozen states   It would be really helpful if we in the industry played a more significant role in the actual enrollment process   Hilferty said  Trump signed an executive order on Friday directing the federal government to scale back regulations  taxes and penalties related to the law  But the directive did not change the priorities outlined to Reuters by the insurers and industry sources  they said   FOCUS ON THE MANDATE  COST SHARING Insurers have built their list of top priorities assuming in part that Republicans will try to overturn the existing individual mandate  which requires Americans to pay a fee if they do not have insurance  A replacement plan would need to include some type of bonus to entice healthy people to get insurance   That  they say  would be a step towards a good mix of sick and healthy people that will keep the plans profitable  Ideas include creating high risk pools to keep the very sick in a separate market and offering low prices to the young and healthy   Without a punishment for not buying insurance that is like the individual mandate  the market can t survive  according to Dr  J  Mario Molina  Chief Executive Officer of Molina Healthcare Inc  a company that provides Medicaid for the poor and individual insurance plans on the exchanges    It probably needs to be a combination of both an incentive and a penalty   Molina said   Insurers also want to keep the cost sharing subsidies that have made healthcare costs affordable for millions of people as well as the premium subsidies that help to reduce the monthly cost for people with low incomes  Those subsidies are part of a court case filed last year that is on hold    If it s free or close to free  you are more likely to sign up in the absence of the mandate   said Dan Mendelson  CEO of Avalere Health  a research group and consultant that advises health insurers and is part of Inovalon Holdings  Insurers also want continued premium subsidies  skewed to keep up enrollment of younger people   
 I think if you don t have the subsidies  then the whole thing falls apart   said Molina ",2017-01-25,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/health-insurers-quietly-shape-obamacare-replacement-with-fewer-risks-455637,455637

188511,410027,UNH,Will Aetna Be Acquired By CVS Health To Rest Speculations  ,opinion,"Rumors are rife that CVS Health Corp  NYSE CVS    is in advanced stages to acquire the health insurer Aetna Inc    NYSE AET   for  66 billion 
Pharmacy benefit managers work primarily for insurers and employers and seek to negotiate the drug prices with pharmaceutical companies and drugstores to reduce the pocket pinch for consumers  This in turn lowers the medical cost for insurers 
This news drove the shares of Aetna to a new 52 week high of  192 37  The stock has surged 45  year to date  in line with the  s growth 

 
We believe  this deal has a greater probability of getting a nod from the regulators since it will be a vertical integration as compared to the horizontal combination  which was feared to create a monopoly in the market and stifle healthy competition among rivals  if passed through  of Aetna Humana deal  which was blocked earlier in the year 
The deal seems a good complement  given that it would lead to a deadly combination of Aetna s strong position and its expertise in the health benefits space with CVS  deep knowledge of the consumers and its leading position in the pharmacy benefits market 
This combined entity would create a mammoth healthcare set up with wide ranging operations from sale of drug to insurance cover 
What s in the Offing for Aetna 
The deal will add to Aetna s scale and size and equip it to negotiate with drug manufacturers and pharmacies better  This would as a result lower the cost of acquiring prescription drugs  enabling the company to share the savings in with its consumers by way of more customer friendly insurance plans like enhanced frills or lower premium  thus ultimately leading to market share gain 
Consolidation in the Health Care Space
Mergers and acquisition  both horizontal and vertical  in the space is rife  given the necessity of the players to gain in scale and size to weather the changes taking place within the industry  Such deals  pharmacy benefit managers with insurance companies  are the need of the hour at the backdrop of a changing industry  which is rapidly seeing a rise in consumerism 
Also  the increased incidence of specialty drugs that are paid through medical and not pharmacy benefit organizations  necessitates the coming together of medical and pharmacy benefit companies 
The takeover of Catamaran by UnitedHealth Group Inc    NYSE UNH   also falls under this category

188532,410048,UNH,Exhibit A for Republican Obamacare repeal challenge  people with HIV,news,"By Julie Steenhuysen CHICAGO  Reuters    Scientists have shown conclusively that treatment not only improves the health of people infected with HIV  it also stops transmission of the virus that causes AIDS      That public health issue is just one of the challenges Republicans face as they attempt to overhaul the Affordable Care Act  a law that brought health insurance coverage to some 20 million people   including tens of thousands of Americans living with HIV  Lawmakers are currently considering repealing the massive 2010 U S  health reform law known as Obamacare as soon as this month   But the roadmap is tentative  and complicated  it would keep the Medicaid expansion and the new individual insurance plans in place and delay major changes for up to three years  This would give Republicans more time to craft a replacement plan  but it is not clear if individual insurance prices would skyrocket during the delay or what the new coverage will look like   HIV experts are among the groups  including insurers and hospitals  that have started lobbying lawmakers  They want to keep the current level of insurance coverage in place and say that even  repeal and delay  would disrupt care  put patients in jeopardy and increase the risk of transmission of a deadly communicable disease      Republicans will have the added worry of reducing coverage for an infectious disease that once represented certain death  but now can be controlled with daily medications that also keep the disease from spreading   The evidence is iron clad that when people with HIV are treated and their viral load is suppressed  their likelihood of transmitting HIV goes down to almost zero   said John Peller of the AIDS Foundation of Chicago   So  any kind of interruption in care is going to result in more cases of HIV   In Illinois  one in three people with HIV gained coverage through Medicaid expansion or the new individual insurance plans created under the ACA  according to an analysis compiled for Reuters by the AIDS Foundation of Chicago      The number of HIV positive individuals covered by Medicaid in Illinois rose by more than 50 percent between 2013   the year before the new healthcare coverage went into place   and 2016  when 13 694 people with HIV were enrolled  HIV experts in Republican states have already been wrestling with the issue of caring for patients with HIV  Earlier this year  North Carolina became the 48th U S  state to permit the use of federal grant money via the Ryan White HIV AIDS program to pay insurance premiums for people with HIV        We re late to the party  and now the party may be over   said Allison Rice  director of the Health Justice Clinic at Duke University School of Law in Durham      Insurers  including UnitedHealth Group  N UNH  and Aetna  N AET   pulled out of Obamacare exchanges for 2017  The plans are offered to everyone regardless of their health and cover everything from routine check ups and emergency room visits to organ failure and cancer  and insurers said costs of doing that were higher than expected  Policy experts say the delay to an Obamacare replacement may give insurance companies little incentive to stick with the Obamacare individual insurance plans  Insurance companies have asked lawmakers to keep subsidies in place and make changes they hope will help stabilize the market  such as delaying deadlines for 2018 plan submissions    It creates a really difficult environment for insurers to commit to the market   said Carmel Shachar of the Center for Health Law   Policy Innovation at Harvard  Shachar co wrote a letter signed by 174 national  state and local HIV organizations urging members of the senate not to repeal or modify the Affordable Care Act without a clearly defined replacement plan  That was followed by a letter on Tuesday sent by more than 950 HIV medical professionals urging Congressional members not to repeal the Affordable Care Act without a viable replacement plan  and to sustain the federal commitment to the Medicaid program   In most states  prior to the ACA  low income patients with HIV were denied Medicaid coverage until they became sick and disabled  and did not have the resources to participate in health savings accounts   the group  which included the HIV Medicine Association  said in a statement  America s Health Insurance Plans in December said an immediate repeal of federal support   particularly federal cost sharing programs and Medicaid expansion   would jeopardize care for millions of Americans and disrupt market stability  Vice President elect Mike Pence told Republican lawmakers on Wednesday the transition team is  mindful of disrupting the market   but signaled that a replacement plan would not be in place at the time the law is repealed   The first order of business  was to  repeal and replace Obamacare   Pence told a news briefing  adding that  the architecture of the replacement  would come together  in the weeks and months ahead       MEDICAID EXPANSION BOOSTS COVERAGE     Before the ACA was passed  only about 13 percent of people with HIV had private health insurance and 24 percent had no coverage at all  according to the Department of Health and Human Services      Medicaid  which provides insurance for low income individuals  is the largest source of insurance coverage for people with HIV  covering more than 40 percent of HIV positive individuals  Kaiser Family Foundation estimates   In the 31 states plus the District of Columbia that expanded Medicaid under ACA  the law eliminated rules that prevented all but pregnant women and the disabled from gaining coverage   Obviously  not every state expanded Medicaid  but for the vast majority that did  this was the single most significant piece of the Affordable Care Act for people with HIV   said Amy Killelea of the National Alliance of State   Territorial AIDS Directors  NASTAD   Another 25 percent of people with HIV are covered by Medicare  the U S  insurance program for the elderly and permanently disabled      Nationwide data on how many of the 1 2 million HIV positive individuals in the United States gained coverage through the ACA are still being tallied  said Kaiser health policy analyst Jennifer Kates  But policy experts say the impact has been dramatic   A lot of what the ACA did that is kind of below the radar is incredibly important to people living with HIV   said Matthew Kavanagh  a policy analyst at Health Global Access Project in Washington  Before the Affordable Care Act  he said  people living with HIV  had huge problems accessing medications and insurance       In non expansion states  many people with HIV got their insurance premiums for Obamacare plans paid through the Ryan White program  a federal grant program established after the death of the Indiana teen in 1990 of AIDS  The program funds AIDS Drug Assistance Programs  ADAP   which pay for AIDS drugs and insurance premiums for people who are uninsured and underinsured   It s the main safety net below Medicaid  below Medicare  below private insurance   Kates said  Even if the Affordable Care Act were repealed in full  Ryan White would be there as a safety net  but the program has a fixed budget each year      In the past  that has resulted in waiting lists  In September of 2011  nearly 9 300 people were on ADAP waiting lists nationwide  NASTAD data show      Killelea said her group intends to work with members of Congress and the new administration to  underscore the public health and individual health impact  the ACA has had on people with HIV

Meanwhile  Trump warned that the border adjustment provision  a feature of House Republicans  plan that would tax imports and exempt exports  is  too complicated  
The comments added to growing uncertainty over U S  economic policy ahead of President elect Donald Trump s inauguration later this week 
The dollar index fell to as low as 100 44 earlier  a level not seen since December 8 
Meanwhile  oil prices traded up more than 1  on Tuesday  buoyed by the weaker dollar and the continuing flow of comments surrounding the deal to reduce global production 
Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Khalid al Falih said on Monday that the kingdom will adhere strictly to its commitment to cut output under a global agreement  expressing confidence that OPEC s plan to prop up prices would work 
Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of an industry event in Abu Dhabi  Falih added that OPEC and non OPEC producers are unlikely to extend their agreement to cut oil output beyond six months  citing the level of compliance with the deal and the rebalancing of the market 
On Tuesday  United Arab Emirates energy minister Suhail Mazroui reportedly said it was too early to say if major oil producers would need to renew the deal to curb output when it ends in roughly six months  but indicated he saw a drop in global inventory levels

188535,410051,UNH,Healthcare ETFs Head To Head  XLV Vs  VHT,opinion,"The healthcare sector has been in the spotlight lately  President Donald Trump targeted drug companies and accused them of charging extremely high prices  read    
Market Movers
 Prescription drug prices are out of control  The drug prices have gone through the roof   Trump said in a meeting  adding   The drug companies frankly are getting away with murder  We want to bring our prices down to what other countries are paying  
In a latest executive order  Trump aimed at scrapping a key component of Obamacare  The President said that he wanted to end subsidies to insurers that cost  7 billion this year and help millions of low income Americans pay medical expenses 
The uncertainty was reduced to some extent as news of the two political parties coming to a bipartisan deal started doing the rounds  Senators of both parties said they reached a deal to stabilize Obamacare for the short term and allow insurer subsidies  However  changes in the deal might be in the cards as it has to be passed by the Congress and signed by Trump first 
 The solution will be for about a year or two years  it ll get us over this intermediate hump  Trump said  Let us now discuss two ETFs focused on providing exposure to the healthcare sector 
Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund 
This fund seeks to provide exposure to healthcare stocks and tracks the Health Care Select Sector Index  It has AUM of  17 6 billion and charges a moderate fee of 14 basis points a year  It has 62 holdings and bears significant concentration risk as almost 50  of the assets are allocated to the top 10 holdings  read

Moreover  VHT outperformed XLV both on a year to date basis and in a year  VHT returned 1 6  more than XLV so far this year whereas in a year  it returned 1 7  more than XLV

188537,410053,UNH,Rolling Out And Up In Our Buy And Hold Portfolios ,opinion,"Portfolio overwriting is a covered call writing like strategy where we sell call options against long term buy and hold securities  Generally  these are low cost basis stocks that are dividend bearing and trading in non sheltered accounts  We want to leverage these stocks and   to generate additional income but also want to avoid assignment of the shares to avoid tax issues  In essence  we want our cake and eat it too 
Setting up and managing our covered call positions are handled in a specific manner when incorporating portfolio overwriting into our investment arsenal  This article will focus in on the time frame just prior to contract expiration where share value has appreciated above the original out of the money and now in the money strike  We will use UnitedHealth Group Incorporated  NYSE UNH  as the June 2017 contracts were expiring on June 16  2017 
Price chart of UNH on June 16  2017

The yellow field shows a price range of  169 00    182 00 during the contract month 
Trade assumptions
The June 16  2017  180 00 out of the money calls were sold after expiration of the May 2017 contracts
Stock price is  182 10 in the early afternoon of June 16  2017  expiration Friday
Contract exercise and share assignment must be avoided to avoid tax consequences
The options must be rolled to the next month
Position management decision
Since we use out of the money strikes with portfolio overwriting to allow for continued share appreciation  we must determine which strike to select 
Cost to close the near month short call

The published  ask  price is  231 00 per contract to close the near month covered call 
Option chain for the July 21  2017 call expirations

We will calculate the returns for 3 out of the money strikes 
 182 50
 185 00
 187 50
The Ellman Calculator
We will use the  What Now  tab of the  to generate the following results

 185 00 strike

Rolling Out And Up to the  185 00 Strike
 187 50 strike

Rolling Out And Up to the  187 50 Strike
These three screenshots show that the  187 50 strike offers the highest total potential return  option premium   share appreciation to the new strike   3 98    The  182 50 strike generates the highest initial return  2 11   for option premium only 
Discussion
When using portfolio overwriting  it is understood that in the money strikes must be rolled prior to contract expiration to avoid tax issues and continue dividend flow  When significant share appreciation has taken place  we look to roll out and up  The selection of the new out of the money strike will be dictated by our evaluation of the degree of bullishness we assess the market  If strongly bullish  we would favor deeper out of the money strikes to capture more share appreciation in addition to the option premium  We select slightly out of the money strikes when there is a bearish tone to our market outlook

Shares of    NYSE JNJ   increased 3 5  at market close on Oct 17  2017 after beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both earnings and revenues  The company s revenues of  19 7 billion increased 10 3  in third quarter 2017 on a year over year basis and 4 5  on a sequential basis  It came ahead of the consensus mark of  19 28 billion 
Increase in sales was driven primarily by strong sales of cancer drugs and recent acquisition activity  Earlier this year in June  JNJ in its biggest ever acquisition  bought Swiss biopharmaceutical company Actelion for  30 billion 
Johnson   Johnson reported non GAAP earnings per share  EPS  of  1 9 for third quarter 2017  up 13 1  year over year and 3 8  on a sequential basis  It beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 8

The company increased its revenue guidance for full year 2017 to the range of  76 1  76 5 billion and updated its adjusted EPS guidance to  7 25  7 30 
Industry Factors
In a latest executive order  Trump aimed at scrapping a key component of Obamacare  The President said that he wanted to end subsidies to insurers that cost  7 billion this year and help millions of low income Americans pay medical expenses  Moreover  Trump took a dig at drug pricing and accused companies of getting away with murder by charging sky high drug prices 
The uncertainty was reduced to some extent as news of the two political parties coming to a bipartisan deal started doing the rounds  Senators of both parties said they reached a deal to stabilize Obamacare for the short term and allow insurer subsidies  However  changes in the deal might be in the cards as it has to be passed by the Congress and signed by Trump first

188629,410145,UNH,Health Insurance Industry Stock Outlook   Sept  2017,opinion,"More than 8 months have passed since the Trump administration took the reins at the White House  This was a major political development that many saw as particularly consequential for the health care industry  given the GOP s  repeal   replace  demand 
Notwithstanding the priority afforded to the  repeal   replace  effort  the administration wasn t able to push a new measure through Congress on the first try and the odds of the second effort succeeding this week through the Graham Cassidy bill also appear slim 
One would think that this policy uncertainty should have been drag on the health insurer stocks  but you would be hard pressed to see that in the industry s stock market performance this year  Since the November election  the Zacks HMO industry stocks are up  36 1   more than double the S P 500 index s  16 5  gain 
We shall see how the latest congressional effort through the Graham Cassidy bill pans out in the next few days  but it appears that market participants had a better sense of the success of the  repeal   replace  effort than the politicians did 
The industry  however  has witnessed the failure of some high profile mergers  Other factors that weigh on the sector were losses from public exchange business  soft commercial insurance volume  increasing competition  increased expenses in the form of higher spending on innovation and technology 
Nevertheless  the  remained an outperformer by growing 24  year to date  outperforming the S P 500 index s 12  gain 
The industry was mired in a nasty regulatory web after the passage of the Affordable Care Act  ACA  aka  Obamacare   in 2010  Let s see to what extent this historic event has influenced the industry 
Was Health Reform a Blockage at All 
The industry is continuing with its bull run despite a pull back mostly in the form of stringent regulations which hampered the industry  post ACA passage   Revenues across the industry have been growing consistently  driving bottom line growth 
The performance of health insurance stocks since ACA doesn t show any unusual weakness  In fact  the industry performed better than the broader market during this period  indicating its ability to adapt to the changing landscape  Since the reform came into being  the industry has rallied 340 3   versus 117 8  growth in the S P 500 overall 
What Made This Outperformance Possible In a highly regulated environment  insurers modified their business strategies to deal with the changes that the law brought along  Moving beyond their domestic business domain to international shores aimed at growing part of their business  which would be outside the realm of ardent regulations at home  was a wise decision 
Investing in growing health services business  product diversification  instituting changes in an effort to become more consumer centric  and investments in technology have helped these companies reap hidden opportunities  Their business models are now buffered to a large extent to counter the upcoming changes in regulations 
What Are the Factors That Could Drive the Sector 
First and foremost  this is an industry that will continue to witness demand for its offerings given an aging population and no end to new and varied diseases  Strong pipelines  innovative services  better claims handling and increased health care spending should support growth 
Increased investments in technology and use of analytics have better equipped insurers to make informed decisions about premium pricing and claims handling  Adoption of technology has also led to better records handling  which has consequently reduced duplication of services that caused wastage and increased medical spend 
Why Health Insurance Stocks Still Have Some Upside Left
While the industry has outperformed the broader market lately  valuations are far from stretched and leave room for further upside 
The Zacks HMO industry is currently trading at 18 8x forward 12 month consensus EPS estimates  compared with 19 8x for the S P 500 index as a whole  Over the last five years  the industry has traded in a range of 8 5x to 19 4x  with a median of 12 6x 
Please note that the low valuation point  8 5x multiple  was in 2010 when the ACA was enforced  What this shows is that while HMO stocks aren t cheap  they re also not nose bleed expensive 
Positive Zacks Industry Rank
Within the Zacks Industry classification  health insurers are grouped in the Medical   HMOs 
We rank 250 plus industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry  We put our industries into two groups  the top half  industries with the best average Zacks Rank  and the bottom half  the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank   Over the last 10 years  using a one week rebalance  the top half beat the bottom half by more than twice as much 
The group s   14  top 4  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  indicates further upside  Our back testing shows that the top 50  of Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 
HMOs Worth Adding
In this mixed environment  sidelining the entire industry would not be prudent  Rather  there are chances of scooping up big gains from this corner  which despite short term hiccups has a bright long term growth trajectory 
Investors can consider the following HMO stocks that have solid fundamentals to weather any regulatory change  Also  their favorable Zacks Rank makes them solid picks

188675,410191,UNH,Healthcare Stocks In Focus On Latest CBO Report,opinion,"Healthcare stocks are back in focus as the  Repeal and Replace Obamacare  scenario plays out  A lot has been happening in this part of the medical sector with efforts to  Repeal and Replace Obamacare  not meeting with much success and basically collapsing A quick look at the events that have unfolded over the past few months shows that  Repeal and Replace Obamacare  has been a key goal for President Trump who had said that his first course of action  once elected  for Obamacare would be to ask Congress to repeal it immediately  However  the President and Republican party leaders first suffered a setback in March this year with a healthcare bill  the American Healthcare Act or Trumpcare  being pulled from the House floor when it became clear that there would not be enough votes to pass the bill Then in June  the Senate issued its version  the Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017  with certain changes being made    however  four Republican Senators  Sens  Rand Paul  Ted Cruz  Ron Johnson  and Mike Lee  issued a joint statement saying that they were not ready to vote for the bill due to several reasons but were open to negotiation and obtaining more information before the bill was brought to the floor  While the Senators acknowledged that the draft bill was an improvement to the current health care system  they noted that it did not appear to accomplish the goal of repealing Obamacare and making health care more affordable Last week  the Senate came out with a revised version of its bill but this too failed to garner full support with Senators Mike Lee and Jerry Moran announcing earlier this week that they will not vote for the current version of the bill  Moreover  moderate senators were concerned by the cuts to Medicaid Repeal Now  Replace LaterWith efforts to  Repeal and Replace Obamacare  failing  the focus has now shifted to repealing Obamacare without an immediate replacement    the Obamacare Repeal Reconciliation Act of 2017  But what will the repercussions be if such a move is taken According to a report issued by the Congressional Budget Office  CBO  yesterday  enacting this legislation would cut federal deficits by  473 billion over the coming decade  However  the number of uninsured people would go up by 17 million in 2018 and average premiums in the nongroup market would increase by about 25  Once the ACA s expansion of eligibility for Medicaid and subsidies for insurance purchased through the marketplaces established by the ACA are eliminated  the number of uninsured Americans would go up by 27 million in 2020 with premiums rising about 50   2026 would see the uninsured go up by 32 million with premiums doubling compared to the current law  Given these numbers  it doesn t seem likely that  Repeal Now  Replace Later  will get much support Impact on Healthcare StocksAs the  Repeal Now  Replace Later  scenario plays out  hospital and insurance stocks will remain in the limelight  Insurance stocks have had a very strong run so far in 2017 with the Zacks categorized  industry outperforming the S P 500 with the industry climbing 22  compared to the overall market gain of 10 7   Not surprisingly  the HMO industry is among the top 13  of the Zacks ranked industries with key players like Aetna Inc    NYSE AET   and Anthem  Inc    NYSE ANTM   holding a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  while Magellan Health  Inc    NASDAQ MGLN   and UnitedHealth Group Inc    NYSE UNH   are Zacks Rank  2  Buy  stocks  You can see  

Hospital stocks have also had a pretty decent run so far this year though this sector will be under pressure if Obamacare gets repealed without a suitable replacement  This is because hospitals benefited under Obamacare with more than 20 million people gaining coverage  Repealing and or replacing Obamacare without a suitable replacement would result in a significant increase in the uninsured population which does not bode well for hospitals  The Zacks categorized  industry is currently among the bottom 30  of the Zacks ranked industries

5 Stocks to Buy with Impressive Interest Coverage Ratio

	You can simply arrive at a decision to  Buy  or  Sell  a particular stock by looking at its sales and earnings numbers  But such a strategy does not always guarantee superior returns  A critical analysis of the company s financial background is always required for a better investment decision 

	A company s fundamentals should be sound enough to meet its financial obligations  This can be judged with coverage ratios   the higher these are the more efficient an enterprise will be in meeting its financial obligations  Here we have discussed one such ratio   the Interest Coverage Ratio

	Debt  which is crucial for most of the companies to finance operations  comes at a cost called interest  Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company and the company s creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets its interest obligations  Therefore  Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision 

	Interest Coverage Ratio suggests the number of times the interest could be paid from earnings and also gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest 

	An interest coverage ratio lower than 1 0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations  and could default on repaying debt  A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardship  Definitely  one should also track the company s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time 

What s the Strategy 

	Apart from having an Interest Coverage Ratio that is more than the industry average  adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a    of  A  or  B  to your search criteria should lead to better results

188736,410252,UNH,5 Stocks With Exciting Interest Coverage Ratio,opinion,A layman can end up losing bucks if he decides to pick a stock only on the basis of numbers flashing on a real time stock screen  A critical analysis of the company s financial background is essential for a better investment decision Often investors evaluate a company s performance by simply looking at its sales and earnings  which sometimes do not reveal the real picture  To be more precise  they do not tell whether a company s fundamentals are sound enough to meet its financial obligations  Here  the role of coverage ratios comes into play   the higher these are the more efficient an enterprise will be in meeting its financial obligations Why Interest Coverage Ratio Interest Coverage Ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charges on its debt Debt  which is crucial to financing operations for a majority of companies  comes at a cost called interest  Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company  And the company s creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets its interest obligations  Therefore  Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision Interest Coverage Ratio   Earnings before Interest   Taxes  EBIT  divided by Interest Expense The Interest Coverage Ratio suggests how many times the interest could be paid from earnings and also gauges the margin of safety a firm has for paying interest An interest coverage ratio lower than one suggests that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations  and could default on repaying debt  A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardships  Definitely one should also track the company s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time The Winning StrategyApart from having an Interest Coverage ratio that is more than the industry average  adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a  of  A  or  B  to your search criteria should lead to better results Interest Coverage Ratio greater than X Industry MedianPrice greater than or equal to 5  The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher 5 Year Historical EPS Growth     greater than X Industry Median  Stocks that have a strong EPS growth history Projected EPS Growth     greater than X Industry Median  This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years  This shows that the stock has near term earnings growth potential Average 20 Day Volume greater than 100 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment VGM Score of less than or equal to B  Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of  A  or  B  when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential  Here are five of the 17 stocks that qualified the screening Build A Bear Workshop  Inc    NYSE BBW    which operates as a specialty retailer of plush animals and related products  has a VGM score of  B  and an expected EPS growth rate of 22 5  for 3 5 years  The stock currently flaunts a Zacks Rank  1  You can see  The Marcus Corporation   NYSE MCS    which owns and operates movie theatres  and hotels and resorts  has a Zacks Rank  1 and a VGM score of  B   The expected EPS growth rate for 3 5 years is currently pegged at 15  Sprouts Farmers Market  Inc    NASDAQ SFM    which provides fresh  natural and organic food  has a VGM score of  B  with an expected EPS growth rate of 11 7  for 3 5 years  The stock carries a Zacks Rank  2 Grand Canyon Education  Inc    NASDAQ LOPE    which provides postsecondary education services  has a VGM score of  B  and an expected EPS growth rate of 10 8  for 3 5 years

188752,410268,UNH,Rubio says he s only one running with results fighting Obamacare,news,"By Emily Stephenson WASHINGTON  Reuters    Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio  seeking to win over conservative voters  told Reuters he was the only one running with a victory against President Barack Obama s signature health law  Rubio  a U S  senator from Florida  has touted his effort to prevent what he called a potential taxpayer bailout of insurers as his rivalry heats up with U S  Senator Ted Cruz of Texas  a chief critic of the 2010 Obamacare law  In an interview late Tuesday  Rubio said his battle over the little known provision in the law separates him from the other Obamacare critics running for president  including Cruz   Whether it s him or anybody else  everybody running for president on the Republican side wants to repeal Obamacare   Rubio said   I m the only one running that s actually ever scored a victory against Obamacare   Congressional Republicans have voted numerous times to repeal the health law  which required Americans to have insurance or pay a penalty  Senate Republicans passed a bill to gut the reforms last week  though Obama likely will veto it  Cruz argues the November 2016 presidential election should be a referendum on the Affordable Care Act  the law s formal title  He says he is the candidate who has fought hardest against it  referring to his role in a 2013 battle in Congress that led to a government shutdown  Rubio and Cruz came in second and fourth  respectively  in a recent Reuters Ipsos opinion poll  well behind front runner Donald Trump   The two have increasingly been at loggerheads over immigration and national security  Many Republican observers predict that if outsider candidates Trump and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson flame out  the Republican race could come down to Cruz versus Rubio   On Obamacare  Rubio and Cruz agree that they would repeal it as president  and both voted last week to gut the law  Rubio said it was unlikely to happen with Obama in office   In the interim  I think we should all agree that we shouldn t be using taxpayer money at the tune of over  2 billion to subsidize and bail out insurance companies   he said  At issue is a provision to support online marketplaces  or exchanges  where consumers compare competing plans and purchase individual insurance  The 2010 law included support for insurers that offered plans on exchanges  including a mechanism to offset some losses  Rubio argued that so called  risk corridors  program would lead to taxpayer bailouts of insurers and  in 2014  he pushed a provision through Congress restricting its funding  As a result  the Obama administration this year said it could pay out much less than the  2 9 billion requested by insurers that saw losses on the exchanges  Rubio said he saved taxpayers  2 5 billion in bailout money  Some experts disagree  saying a similar program under Medicare is not considered a bailout  Fact checking site PolitiFact rated his claim  mostly false   Regardless  some nonprofit insurers that expected to recoup some losses failed  Other  bigger insurers warned about instability if the risk corridor payments are not restored  UnitedHealth Group Inc  N UNH  said it might withdraw from the exchanges  citing unsustainable losses  Rubio said he knew insurers would lose money on the exchanges  He said consumers whose plans failed or who face higher premiums should blame the Obama administration

188772,410288,UNH,MedCity INVEST  Unlocking Value In Digital Health,opinion,Healthcare investors  entrepreneurs  and providers alike are gathered in Chicago today at MedCity INVEST  a national healthcare investing conference hosted by MedCity News and the Mid America Healthcare Investors Network  Among the many topics of conversation was the current state of the digital health industry  This space has exploded over the last several years  but as healthcare technology continues to advance  more and more investors have been left wondering where to find the best value in digital health In a panel moderated by Steven Collens  the CEO of Chicago based healthcare startup incubator MATTER  several players in the digital health space chatted about the most effective methods for unlocking value in the industry  The panel included Deborah Kilpatrick  the chief executive of healthcare data analytics firm Evidation Health  Marti Nyman  a vice president at UnitedHealth Group s   NYSE UNH   Innovation Center of Excellence  Mark Tomaino  a partner at Welsh  Carson  Anderson   Stowe  and Jim Weisman  the CEO in Residence of BioEnterprise  Overall  the conversation seemed to focus primarily on promoting efficiency  quality of care  and collaboration throughout the digital health space  There was also plenty of advice given to those looking to find value and quality in the busy world of digital health  When asked about what tends to work in this field  Tomaino responded by saying that the companies that succeed  are focusing on productivity and revenue  Of course  this is also a results driven field from a health perspective  As Nyman pointed out  investors have to question whether there is a legitimate health outcome or not   We have a high standard   he said  Kilpatrick argued that digital health companies have to ensure that they are properly focused  Citing cases where companies attempted to reach as large of an audience as possible  by marketing a public mobile app to a non specific group  for example  Kilpatrick highlighted the difference between certain approaches  Kilpatrick said that it was more effective for digital health companies to target specific  well defined groups  which she described as a  very healthcare thing to do  but not a very technology thing to do  Weisman also spoke to the importance of a focus in digital health  arguing that there was an identifiable value in providing efficiency  He said that BioEnterprise has found success with companies that have identified a specific inefficiency and designed a method to improve upon it The panel also addressed the current chaos in Washington  which promises to have some sort of effect on the overall healthcare sector  Nevertheless  the commentators at MedCity INVEST didn t seem too concerned about the gridlock s impact on digital health Tomaino said that the issues affecting the digital health space are  agnostic from the political party   and Weisman said that the only real impact will be on the  speed with which  we see the impact of certain digital health ideas  Another concern that was raised centered on the possibility that digital health solutions are too focused on the  incubator culture  and are therefore disconnected from patients and healthcare providers  The panel seemed to be in universal agreement that this was a legitimate concern  but it was also pointed out that the best incubators and accelerators are aware of this problem and are actively look to engage with patients and providers  In the end  the panel resonated optimism for the future of digital health  Unlocking value for investors is certainly important  but the experts in this field seem confident that the best digital health companies have a unique ability to do just that  Make sure to check back here for more coverage of the MedCity INVEST conference and all of the latest news in healthcare investing Want more stock market analysis from this author  Make sure to follow   on Twitter Stocks that Aren t in the News YetYou are invited to download the full  up to the minute list of 220 Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buys  free of charge  Many of these companies are almost unheard of by the general public and just starting to get noticed by Wall Street They have been pinpointed by the Zacks system that nearly tripled the market from 1988 through 2015  with a stellar average gain of  26  per year ,2017-05-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/medcity-invest:-unlocking-value-in-digital-health-200189799,200189799

188828,410344,UNH,Clinton plan to cut health costs includes tax credits  more sick visits,news,"By Amanda Becker DES MOINES  Iowa  Reuters    Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton unveiled a plan on Wednesday to lower out of pocket health costs  including expanded coverage of sick visits to the doctor and tax credits for those with substantial medical bills  Clinton  who has promised to build on President Barack Obama s signature healthcare initiative  also pledged to try to strengthen efforts to block or modify what her campaign called  unreasonable  health insurance rate increases  Clinton s campaign released the proposals a day after her plan to battle drug  price gouging  battered shares in some pharmaceutical companies  All of her healthcare proposals would face a difficult path to approval in a U S  Congress dominated by Republicans who have vowed to repeal or roll back the  Obamacare  healthcare law  But Clinton  the front runner for the Democratic nomination  has vowed to fight Republican criticism and make Obamacare a key element of her campaign for the November 2016 election  Under Clinton s plan  insurance companies would be required to cover three sick visits without counting toward a plan s deductible  The campaign said the move could save a person with private coverage more than  100 a year  Clinton s campaign cited a recent Kaiser Family Foundation study showing the average deductible for an individual has grown seven times faster than a worker s average wages since 2010   When Americans get sick  high costs shouldn t prevent them from getting better  With deductibles rising so much faster than incomes  we must act to reduce the out of pocket costs families face   Clinton said in a statement  The plan also would provide a refundable tax credit of up to  2 500 for individuals and  5 000 per family for Americans with out of pocket healthcare expenses above 5 percent of income  Clinton also pledged to strengthen the authority to block or modify unreasonable insurance rate increases by creating what her campaign called a fallback process for states that do not modify or block premium rate increases  Shares in drug and insurer stocks were largely unaffected by the proposals  Insurers such as UnitedHealth Group Inc  N UNH   Anthem Inc  N ANTM   and  Aetna Inc   N AET  all rose slightly  and the iShares U S  Healthcare Providers ETF  P IHF  closed up 0 6 percent  But the leading health insurance industry lobbying group said Clinton s plan would not help keep coverage affordable   Mandating additional benefits without addressing the cost of the services will just make coverage more expensive   said Clare Krusing  spokeswoman for America s Health Insurance Plans  Drew Altman  chief executive of the Kaiser Family Foundation  said when insurers added visits or reduced the cost of visits  there was a trade off with premium prices   It s a plan that will resonate for people and also raise some issues for big industry groups   Altman said

Monthly outlook  bias higher 
YM futures trader  no trade tonight 

Recap
The Dow put the lie to my call for a lower close Tuesday as it recovered from an early dip to end the day 24 points higher   so at least the damage was limited  UnitedHealth Group Incorporated  NYSE UNH  was really the big driver of this outcome with an outsized 3 6  gain of its own  We now move along to Wednesday s we close out what has been the best month since March 
The technicals
The VIX  Ah yes  I did note Monday night a gap up hanging an on the VIX but discounted the bullish implications of that for the market  Turns out  this was  as the VIX nearly always is  a good predictor  As of Tuesday night  after a 1 90  drop on the day we are left with a classic bearish evening star  The only thing here is that Tuesday s candle is a big spinning top leaving the door open to some possible upside on Wednesday  Which do you believe   the daily candle or the three day pattern  Hmmm 

Market index futures  Tuesday night  all three futures were lower at 12 23 AM EST with ES down 0 05  
ES daily pivot  As of Tuesday night the ES daily pivot is nearly unchanged  nudging from 2202 83 to 2203 17  For the second time in a week  that leaves ES sitting right on top of its new pivot  so this indicator is neither bullish nor bearish 

Well maybe the Dow rose but at least something fell on Tuesday and it was the trans  off 0 21  for a bit of bearish divergence  And remaining overbought it looks like there s still more downside to come here  I note too that the dollar took a big dump on Tuesday after rising steadily almost the entire month of November 
Dr  Copper meanwhile also moved lower Tuesday as I predicted even if that didn t affect the Dow  And with a bearish stochastic crossover in place it looks like that s not done going lower yet either  So the net impression is weakly bearish 
But with the futures only very slightly lower tonight and ES sitting right on its new pivot  it s a good time for another conditional call  if ES breaks above its new pivot and remains there by mid morning Wednesday  we ll close higher  But if it breaks lower  we close lower

188994,410510,UNH,Are Health Insurance Stock Investors Rooting For Donald Trump  ,opinion,"Earlier this week  health insurer Aetna Inc    NYSE AET   announced its second quarter earnings results  Despite beating our estimates for both earnings and revenue  Aetna highlighted some troubling signs about the state of the industry and the effectiveness of the Affordable Care Act 
Aetna said that it expects to lose about  300 million dollars on its Obamacare business this year  The insurance giant also said that it is cancelling plans to expand its Obamacare offerings into five new states  and it will reassess its existing business in the 15 states it currently covers 
 Also read   
Aetna s Obamacare struggles are the latest in what appears to be a growing trend in the industry  UnitedHealthcare   NYSE UNH    the nation s largest insurer  has announced that it will be reducing the number of counties it offers Obamacare plans in to just 156 from over 1 200 counties 
Across the board  health insurance companies are saying that Obamacare covered patients are too costly to cover and get sick too often  In fact  patients with Obamacare plans cost about 22  more on average to cover than those with employer plans 
Although insurance stocks popped with the implementation of Obamacare  the assumption that more customers would equal more profits isn t necessarily proving to be true  Obamacare continues to be a hot political issue  and with a contentious election around the corner  investors might already be looking at which candidates will help or hurt the healthcare industry 
Trump s Platform
Both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton have been outspoken on the topic of healthcare reform  with both candidates taking unsurprisingly opposite positions  Now that it looks like Obamacare s current form may not be helping insurance companies  investors in these companies may also be looking for regulatory reform 
Right now  it might make sense that investors with large stakes in health insurance companies might be rooting for the polarizing Republican nominee  From the earliest days of his campaign  Trump has been rather upfront with his desire to repeal Obamacare  and the billionaire businessman has always appeared to be a proponent of a free market economy 
Trump s official  details a seven part plan for healthcare reform  with several points that would have a direct impact on insurance companies  First of all  Trump firmly states that he will repeal Obamacare and eliminate the individual mandate  which requires citizens to purchase a healthcare plan 
Trump also says that he wants to modify laws that inhibit the sale of health insurance across state lines  and he would like to implement block grant Medicaid to States  Trump s stances on this topic fall in line with that of many classic conservatives  The general idea is that less government regulation will allow businesses to operate more freely and efficiently 
Competing Ideologies
At the end of the day  however  this all comes down to your fundamental political beliefs  An America without an individual mandate was the norm  and it led the country to have an uninsured rate of over 15   Since the implementation of Obamacare  the uninsured rate has fallen to about 9   its lowest point in 50 years 
While it has been tough for health insurance companies to turn profits under the current Obamacare plans  simply repealing Obamacare would almost certainly cause millions of Americans to revert back to being uninsured 
Typically  the idea is that a more free market will also lead to a reduction of costs  which would eventually lead premiums to go down  making healthcare affordable for all  If Trump wins and that happens  he certainly looks like a genius 
On the other hand  Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton thinks the best way to combat high costs is to target drug makers and other providers that manipulate prices  This would most likely come in the form of an expansion of the Affordable Care Act 
Like a lot of cases in politics  there s a good chance both candidates  plans could work  but there certainly is a disagreement on how to get things done ",2016-08-04,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/are-health-insurance-stock-investors-rooting-for-donald-trump-200146161,200146161
188995,410511,UNH,Obamacare Is Back In The News  3 Health Stocks On The Rise,opinion,"Despite the fact that Obamacare is expanding coverage  the U S  uninsured rate fell to 9 1 percent last year  its lowest mark ever   and that it has had a lot of benefits so far   like leading a surge in mental health treatment  eliminating lifetime and annual limits on coverage  and lowering overall healthcare costs   the state of the Affordable Care Act is enduring its most difficult time yet  Six years after the legislation was enacted  and four years after the Supreme Court upheld the legality of the legislation  Obamacare is back in the news with negative headlines 
Health insurance provider Aetna  NYSE AET  announced they re quitting the state managed public exchanges that were created in the hopes of increasing competition amongst healthcare providers  That competition never really happened  and Aetna said they re leaving the exchanges because of medical costs that were more expensive than expected   that Aetna only covered 8 percent of people enrolled in Obamacare  but there s no doubt that other healthcare providers are taking note 
The market reaction was fairly muted  both for Aetna and other health companies  as Aetna isn t the first company to leave the exchanges  However  the news does bring a certain amount of uncertainty to the industry  Will even more providers follow suit  Will the public exchanges continue in their current form  Could further legislation be on the horizon 
This isn t a discussion on the merits of the legislation  as there have been countless debates between intelligent people about whether Obamacare is a good or bad thing  What s more interesting to us is the impact that such sweeping legislation has on the enormous healthcare industry  There were a lot of worries when the law was first passed  but in the last few years  the industry has definitely stabilized 
Perhaps  stabilized  is too gentle of a word  Some healthcare companies have totally thrived in the past few years  making them interesting prospects for investors  Here s a look at three of those high performance healthcare stocks 
UnitedHealth Group  NYSE UNH 
Aetna s competitor has been having a strong year  Shares of UnitedHealth are up 21 percent on the year  and the previous few years have also brought steady growth to the health insurance company  Like Aetna  UnitedHealth has also quit several healthcare exchanges throughout the U S 
Their Q2 earnings released in July exceeded expectations and showed earnings  compared to the previous year 
What makes UnitedHealth interesting is that they go beyond health insurance  Its health services division  Optum  has been making promising strides in health data analytics and other fields  It s Optum that s mainly fueling United Healthcare s robust growth  In Q2 2016  Optum s profits rose an impressive 46 percent to  1 26 billion 
That s the kind of diversification that allows UnitedHealth to adapt to any legislative changes that could affect its core health insurance business 
WellCare Health Plans Inc  NYSE WCG 
Compared to Aetna and UnitedHealth  WellCare is a much smaller player in the health insurance industry  Despite a market cap of  only  5 05 billion  the company has been on a tear and is up almost 50 percent on the year to date  WellCare provides government backed Medicaid and Medicare managed health plans to several million customers 
Part of the company s strong performance in the past few years can be attributed to several acquisitions that helped the company expand to new states  While the previous quarter  in the number of customers  total revenues were higher than expected 
Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ 
It s not just health insurance companies that were impacted   for better or worse   by Obamacare  Johnson and Johnson s medical devices and pharmaceutical divisions were also affected by the legislation  However  Johnson and Johnson was in a unique position when the architect of the healthcare legislation left the White House to join their company 
Johnson and Johnson is big  diversified and as blue chip as a company could be  Shares are trading close to all time highs and have risen 17 5 percent on the year  It s the kind of company that can seem to survive just about anything  thanks to their broad industries that cover everything from household products to complex medical devices 
The debate over Obamacare will likely never end  but there s no doubt that some companies are adapting to the new normal better than others  Who knows what sort of shakeups will come to the healthcare industry in the future  For now  however  some companies are thriving ",2016-08-22,Modest Money,https://www.investing.com/analysis/obamacare-is-back-in-the-news:-3-health-stocks-on-the-rise-200149205,200149205

At the close of U S  trading  the Dow 30 rose 0 09   the S P 500 index rose 0 13   while the NASDAQ Composite index fell 0 08  
The Volatility S P 500 index  which measures the outlook for market volatility  was up 1 23  at 10 74 
The Federal Reserve on Wednesday left benchmark interest rates unchanged at 0 00 0 25  and cut its monthly bond buying program to  35 billion from  45 billion in a widely expected move 
The Fed sidestepped addressing specifically how much time will elapse after its monthly stimulus program ends and when interest rate hikes begin  with investors concluding that the Fed will take its time to tighten policy  which drew applause on Wall Street 
 It likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends  especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee s 2 percent longer run goal  and provided that longer term inflation expectations remain well anchored   the Fed said in its Wednesday policy statement 
Profit taking cut into gains  however  while markets kept a close eye on events unfolding in Iraq

189053,410569,UNH,Beyond The ACA Noise  UnitedHealth Group Inc Could Still Impress In 2016,opinion,"UnitedHealth absorbs  720 million loss courtesy of Obamacare
Management is mulling pulling out of Obamacare as losses mount 
Portion of the  9 5  10 billion cash flow in 2016 could trickle down to shareholders through buybacks 
UnitedHealth Group Inc  NYSE N UNH  is expecting more losses in its Affordable Care Act  ACA  plans in 2016  The U S  leading insurer registered a loss of  720 million through ACA in 2015  The management of UnitedHealth is currently weighing options of whether to withdrawal or stay in ACA business  Exiting ACA  or fondly the Obamacare  appears to be a popular option  although the company might still maintain some presence in ACA plan  but at a greatly reduced exposure 
After booking a loss of  720 million courtesy of Obamacare in 2015  UnitedHealth Group Inc  NYSE UNH  is projecting that its Obamacare linked losses in 2016 could exceed  500 million  which is above the initial management estimate for a loss between  400 and  425 million  The reason UnitedHealth is modeling a steeper Obamacare loss in 2016 than it previously guided is that its Obamacare enrollment for this year surpassed expectations  The company tried to suppress its Obamacare enrollment by trimming marketing and commissions to agents  but all that failed to put off people signing up for the ACA coverage through the insurer 
Because of the ACA issue  it may seem that there is nothing more to be excited about UnitedHealth  but nothing can be further from the truth  Although health insurance is UnitedHealth s largest business  the management is expressing confidence that Optum unit will drive growth despite the rot in the ACA coverage and offset challenges elsewhere 
ACA pain should be short lived
It looks likely that UnitedHealth s assessment of its Obamacare coverage will favor exit from the plan  However  the company might retain a small presence in the plan if it must  which should reduce its exposure to Obamacare losses 
UnitedHealth added 70 000 enrolling to its register for 2016  a number more than 55 000 it signed up in 2015  The management tried to discourage Obamacare individual signup in 2016 through means such as reducing ACA themed marketing  dropping some production options and cutting commissions for agents  Unfortunately  signups still surged beyond expectation  leading management to conclude that 2016 ACA losses will be  100 million more than the loss previously guided for the year  As such  UnitedHealth is preparing to absorb more than  500 million in Obamacare related losses in 2016 
However  because the company is mulling exit from the loss ACA coverage  its woes related to the plan should ease over time and eventually go away  Currently  the management is considering whether there is any reason for UnitedHealth to continue Obamacare coverage in 2017 
Strong guidance despite Obamacare challenge
UnitedHealth Group Inc  NYSE UNH  is expecting EPS of  7 60  7 80 on revenue of  180 billion in 2016  You can see that the management expects the company to continue generating profits despite the anticipated huge loss in the Obamacare plan  Perhaps that begs the question about where UnitedHealth is drawing its confidence 
Optum business
Amid challenges in Obamacare plan  UnitedHealth Group Inc  NYSE UNH  is finding support in its Optum business  a unit that renders a bevy of health services  The unit has been growing at a decent rate and has been offsetting the losses in health insurance business  In 4Q  Optum business revenues rose 70  to hit  21 9 billion  accounting for 50  of UnitedHealth s total revenues in the quarter  Optum s prescription arm was the bright spot in 4Q  That growth trend is expected to continue this year and into the future as UnitedHealth continues to invest in growth in the unit 
Stocking Optum
UnitedHealth has not only been relying more on Optum to underwrite health insurance losses  but the company has also been investing in the growth of the unit  The acquisition of Catamaran  a pharmacy benefit manager  has raised the profile of the Optum business  opening opportunities in new business segments for more accelerated growth 
Today  UnitedHealth boasts that Optum owns and operates over 270 clinic locations in 26 markets in the U S  With that network  the business serves over 7 million patients through its network of more than 150 payer partners 
There is a feeling at UnitedHealth that Optum has barely scratched the surface of its available opportunity  That means that continued investment in the business should unlock more revenues and profits 
Among other things  UnitedHealth provides technology services  offers PBM services and operates clinics through its Optum business 
Shareholder returns
UnitedHealth Group Inc  NYSE UNH  repurchased its shares worth between  60 and  65 million in the last quarter  thus reducing its outstanding shares by 600 000 in the quarter  For the year 2015  the company bought back 10 7 million shares  spending  1 2 billion in buybacks for the year  Although UnitedHealth is facing issues in its health insurance business and has slowed shares repurchases  the management remains committed to returning value to shareholders 
With the management of UnitedHealth modeling 2016 cash flow in the range of  9 5  10 billion  part of that amount should go into deleveraging the balance sheet post the Catamaran buyout  Some of that free cash flow is also expected to find its way back into the pockets of shareholders through shares buybacks 
4Q2015 results highlight
UnitedHealth Group Inc  NYSE UNH  still managed to post a profit in 4Q2015 despite the  245 million loss associated with Obamacare  Net income of  1 22 billion or  1 26 per share was mainly supported by gains in the Optum unit  Adjusted EPS of  1 40 surpassed the consensus estimate of  1 38 but fell short of  1 64 in the same period a year earlier  Revenue of  43 60 billion rose 30  YoY  topping the consensus estimate of  43 23 billion 
The chart below depicts UnitedHealth s revenue trend over the last five quarters 


Bottom line
The noise generated by Obamacare losses need not cloud the bigger picture in UnitedHealth Group Inc  NYSE UNH   As the management thinks of what to do with its Obamacare business  Optum can be relied upon to keep the business growing  Once the Obamacare issue is resolve  UnitedHealth should see more accelerated topline and bottom line growth

189054,410570,UNH,This Presidential Election Can Impact The Healthcare Sector,opinion,"The United States holds a Presidential election every four years  While every campaign season is exciting  the raw energy involved when both political parties in the US  Democrats and Republicans  hold a full primary are especially fun  The 2016 presidential election is wide open  as President Obama has reached his term limit 
The impact of two polarizing political forces in the United States holding unpredictable nominating processes at the same time can wreak havoc on Wall Street  Fickle US consumers may lose confidence in the health of the economy if the political discourse centers around the weaknesses in the market  The market can also react if it appears anti market forces are surging to help nominate and potentially elect a President that would be dangerous to the health of the markets  Dramatic changes in US policy have the ability to help or hurt individual industries  The fortunes of individual candidates  and more importantly  their platforms  throughout the process send signals to the markets  and savvy investors have their ears wide open 
For an example of this  let s look at the stocks that benefited from President Obama s landmark legislation 
President Obama s Healthcare Initiative  The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act  PPACA  
Finding a solution to help everyone in the United States gain affordable access to healthcare is a noble goal   Obamacare   as it was called by many of the President s detractors  encompassed a variety of legal and regulatory reforms designed to improve access to health insurance  These reforms include a mandate that requires all U S  citizens to acquire and maintain an active insurance policy that covers a defined set of medical procedures 
The PPACA became law on March 23  2010  Existing health insurance premiums skyrocketed for many insured prior to the Affordable Care Act becoming law  but more than 16 4 million previously uninsured Americans have since gained affordable health insurance according to the   But the real winners in the ACA were the health insurance providers 
UnitedHealth Group  NYSE UNH  was trading around  32 per share in March of 2010  Since the launch of ACA   all the way up to today s share price  a whopping  129 68 per share  That s more than a 400  rise since the enactment of the PPACA  and UNH isn t alone 
Aetna  NYSE AET  was trading at  31 84 in March of 2010  Currently  it s at  114 19  a 250  explosion  Human  HUM  traded around  47 20 a share when the ACA was enacted  Today it sits at  184 89 per share  over 290  growth  It s abundantly clear that the health insurance market  and its investors  made out like bandits as part of the ACA  It s amazing how stock prices surge when you make a product compulsory  and create heavy regulations that prevent additional players from launching in the space 
Do Investors in Health Insurance Have Anything to Be Worried About  
On January 20th of next year  the United States will have a new president  President Obama will be free to enjoy his new status as a multimillionaire    former leader of the Free World  The next President  if he or she is a Republican  will have control of both the House and the Senate  which means the PPACA could be heavily modified or repealed altogether 
It s this investor s opinion that if a Republican is elected  the healthcare market will radically change again and the insulated health insurance industry that has enjoyed such incredible gains may experience some turbulent change as market barriers are removed  Even the mandate could be removed  This year has turned into quite an interesting election season  with wild and impassioned rhetoric against Obamacare ",2016-03-31,Faizan Raza,https://www.investing.com/analysis/how-u.s.-presidential-elections-can-impact-the-stock-market-200123521,200123521
189077,410593,UNH,Sorry  But This Affects Both Your Health    And Your Wealth,opinion,"Health and politics should never meet  But when they do  and they certainly have   you can be sure not only your well being is at stake    but your money is on the line as well 
Our contributors have stretched more into the political realm than usual over the last few weeks  It s not by accident 
Not only is it a topic that affects our everyday lives  but more than ever  it affects your money 
If you re a fellow Pfizer Inc  N PFE  investor  you know what I mean 
We ve written plenty about tax inversions over the past year  We won t rehash our thoughts  Instead  let s look at exactly what Pfizer s  160 billion plan to merge with Ireland s Allergan  N AGN pa  has to do with the oh so awkward marriage of health  politics    and money 
For investors  there s no doubt the deal is positive 
Pfizer will go from a 25 6  corporate tax rate to something much lower  Allergen admits to paying a mere 5  tax rate last year  but Pfizer expects a rate of about 17  in the first full year after closing the deal 
That tantalizing figure alone illustrates why politics affects our investment choices  With a simple change of address  billions of dollars could flow to Pfizer s bottom line 
But what s so intellectually compelling about the Pfizer deal is the effect it will have on future generations 
It s not hyperbolic to say lives are at stake  As one of the world s most innovative drug companies  a leaner  more fiscally efficient Pfizer no doubt means better research and better medicine 
Again    politics stretches into our lives 
If Pfizer can merely meet its goal of a 17  tax rate in 2017  it frees  2 1 billion worth of cash that year   a large chunk of which will be spent on developing new drugs  One of them may save your life 
Don t forget  Pfizer was a pioneer in the realm of antibiotics  Imagine if it had decided not to pursue that research due to tax ramifications 
Or  better yet  imagine if it had an extra billion bucks right now to fight the waning effects of today s antibiotics 
Lives would be saved 
Of course  it s not just Pfizer  The decisions in Washington affect your health and those who want to profit from improving it in plenty of other ways 
Thanks to yet another deal involving Allergan  the generic giant Teva Pharma Industries Ltd  N TEVA  just announced it s going to unload about a billion bucks  worth of assets in order to get the nod of antitrust regulators 
You may have heard that in July Teva announced its plan to buy Allergan s generic business  But regulators are skeptical to allow it to move forward without first requiring the company to unload some of the overlap in what will be its combined drug portfolio 
There s no doubt anti trust measures have merit  but it s one more example of the effect political decisions have on not only our portfolios  but our health 
Teva will have fewer life saving arrows in its quivers    because that s what Washington   not doctors   wants 
Finally    the most politically incendiary news from the world of publicly traded health  UnitedHealth Group  NYSE  N UNH  just told us Obamacare has been bad for business 
It s news that even I was surprised by 
After all  four years ago I stood on a stage in Las Vegas and told the crowd to buy the stock right away  The oncoming gush of cash from Obama s then proposed plan and UnitedHealth s dominance of the Medicare world would send the stock soaring 
I was right  Shares went from  45 to a high of over  120 in the past 48 months  But now we re learning the company may have reached a bit too far into the realm of public healthcare 
Its decision to get involved in the health insurance exchanges of nearly half the states in the nation wasn t as fruitful as planned 
 We did not believe it would form this slowly  be this porous or become this severe   the company s CEO admitted this week 
It s important to note the insurance company is becoming much more vocal about a different segment of its business    a segment that s growing fast and quite profitably 
A segment that s largely removed from the government s long arm and sticky hands 
Most folks don t know it  but UnitedHealth is broken into two groups   the insurance business and a much smaller segment known as Optum  which provides pharmacy management and IT services  and also runs doctor s offices and clinics 
As the insurance business evolves  or  more accurately  devolves   it s clear that Optum and its double digit revenue growth is becoming a bigger focus for the company 
The company s recent emphasis on Optum is more evidence that the politically sensitive insurance realm and its shrinking margins have transformed a once stable business based on numbers and actuary tables to something that s much more volatile and dependent on who lives at the White House 
It s politics at work in your portfolio 
The subject of politics is never fun  There truly are no winners in the debate  But it s clear our elected leaders affect not only our investments    but our health 
The vital takeaway here hits at the heart of our mission    investor education and information 
The only way to successfully navigate a politically divided minefield is to know the facts  understand the variables and sort the fact from the fiction 
We gulp as we admit it  but politics absolutely affects your health and your wealth ",2015-12-07,Investment U,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/sorry,-but-this-affects-both-your-health...-and-your-wealth-374673",374673

UnitedHealth Group  NYSE UNH   stock has been on fire since the market bottom in March 2009  The entire insurance sector has done great for that matter  And heading into the week the merger activity is making things frothy  Not a bad situation for traders 
UnitedHealth Group itself has been in a consolidation pattern since mid March  under resistance at 122  Since the beginning of May the rising 100 day SMA has helped create an ascending triangle pattern  with the series of higher lows  A break above resistance would target a move to 133 
The momentum indicators are supportive of a move higher  The RSI is in the bullish zone while the MACD is rising  There is no resistance over 122  And support below may come at 119 45 and 116 followed by 111 25  Short interest is low at 1  and the company is expected to report earnings next on July 16th before the market opens 
The options chains show large open interest at the 121 Call Strike this week  but also from 113 to 117 on the Put side below  Looking at the July expiry  beyond earnings  shows very large open interest at the 125 Strike 
UnitedHealth Group  Ticker  UNH
Trade Idea 1  Buy the stock on a move over 122 with a stop at 119  A straight stock trade 
Trade Idea 2  Buy the stock on a move over 122 and add a July 120 115 Put Spread and selling the July 31 Expiry 125 Call  collar free late Friday   Adding a collar as protection to the stock through the earnings report

After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed Friday which  as the markets head out of June Options Expiration and officially into summer sees equities continue to churn with an upward bias 
Elsewhere look for gold to be biased to the upside short term in its consolidation while crude oil consolidates with an upward bias  The US Dollar Index looks headed lower in its broad consolidation of the long move up while US Treasuries may be consolidating in their downtrend  The Shanghai Composite may be beginning its long awaited correction  or just doing its 4th 10  plus move lower before another launch higher  while Emerging Markets are biased to the may be consolidating after their move lower 
Volatility looks to remain subdued keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s ARCA SPY  ARCA IWM and NASDAQ QQQ  The IWM continues to look the strongest on the short time frame as it sits at all time highs  with the QQQ strong as well on the weekly timeframe and the SPY stuck in a funk consolidating  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well
