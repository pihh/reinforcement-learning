14922,236437,SOHU,Hong Kong IPO surge challenges New York in battle for China listings,news,"By Jennifer Hughes and Julie Zhu HONG KONG  Reuters    It s not often Hong Kong can boast hotter initial public offerings than New York  but some recent deals and a potential pipeline of big Chinese tech floats suggest a shift in the balance between the two fundraising rivals  While New York is set to top the IPO league this year  it s Hong Kong which is seeing the biggest pre sale demand and first day pops for new tech listings  So far this year  the New York Stock Exchange has hosted listings worth  27 9 billion  more than double Hong Kong s  12 2 billion  according to Thomson Reuters data  But last week s Hong Kong float of  China Literature   HK 0772   the Kindle like e publishing arm of Tencent Holdings Ltd  HK 0700   jumped 86 percent on its debut  making it the most successful first day listing of any large company this year   far outpacing a 44 percent gain by  Snap Inc   N SNAP   the U S  social media platform  Big first day gains have become a rarity in Hong Kong where a stream of Chinese state backed IPOs failed to attract much interest  leaving mainland groups   which bankers dub  friends and family    to take up most of the shares  This week   Razer Inc   HK 1337   backed by  Intel Corp   O INTC  and billionaire Li Ka shing  gained 18 percent on its Hong Kong debut  and Yixin  HK 2858   China s largest online car retailing platform  ended its Thursday debut up 6 percent  While modest  those first day gains stand out in Hong Kong where half the big deals in the past six years have ended flat or lower  In New York  80 percent of IPOs saw a first day pop  Retail investors in Hong Kong have helped spur the gains  bidding for 625 times the shares initially on offer to them in China Literature s deal and 560 times for Yixin s new shares  Fund managers  too  sought many times the shares on offer in both  Bankers predict that sharp rise in interest can continue   especially for technology firms heading to market   Now you ve had some deals go well  investor interest in Hong Kong IPOs has returned   said David Binnion  Goldman Sachs  head of equity capital markets distribution and risk for Asia excluding Japan   There s a backlog of Chinese tech deals   notably fintech   and a growing number will look to list in Hong Kong   TECH DRAW  The shift in sentiment comes as bankers eye a string of potential blockbuster Chinese tech IPOs in the next 18 months   of greater value than the most likely U S  listings  They include Meituan Dianping  an online local services group valued at  30 billion  and Lufax  a wealth management platform worth  18 5 billion  Top of the list is Alibaba s  N BABA  payments affiliate Ant Financial  which was valued at  60 billion in a funding round last year   Hong Kong is definitely going to attract more tech firms from China   said Jin Zhong  co head of TMT at investment bank CICC   The successes     this year have given them confidence that Hong Kong is a good choice   Meituan Dianping  Lufax and Ant Financial have not commented publicly on their listing plans  The decision each must make over where to list comes as the advantages between New York and Hong Kong become less clear cut  Typically  New York has offered higher valuations  a deeper pool of tech savvy investors  a more flexible listing system that includes dual class shares  and the prestige of being the world s biggest market  For its part  Hong Kong boasts familiarity with China  an army of retail investors hungry for  shoot for the stars  stocks  and a convenient time zone for Asian executives  Also  the Stock Connect schemes linking trading in Shanghai and Shenzhen with Hong Kong can build added Chinese interest once shares have listed  The links don t yet allow IPO investments  John Hall  co head of investment banking for Asia Pacific at JP Morgan  says the valuation argument has become less of an issue   All deals are global now in terms of investor base  especially for Chinese deals which often attract investors from both the United States as well as Asia   SECOND CLASS  One clear difference is New York s acceptance of dual class shares   Just days after China Literature s Hong Kong debut  Sogou Inc  N SOGO   China s number two Internet search engine  raised  585 million in a New York IPO  involving dual class shares   Maybe in the future  Hong Kong becomes more attractive   said Charles Zhang  CEO at Sohu com  O SOHU   Tencent s partner in Sogou  who talked also of U S  investors  maturity and sophistication   You can also list in the United States with a dual class of shares  which was important for us   Hong Kong is  however  poised to consider dropping its strict one share one vote principle in an effort to better compete with New York for Chinese listings  Du Yilong  managing partner in law firm Latham   Watkins  Beijing office  says that could encourage Chinese tech groups to reconsider Hong Kong   With regulators  encouragement and Chinese capital flowing into the city via Stock Connects  the market will gradually increase its attractiveness to Chinese tech firms and establish itself  It will be a virtuous circle   he said  Would be U S  listings may also have been discouraged by how some recent floats performed there  Best Inc  N BSTI   a logistics group backed by  Alibaba   had to halve the amount it sought in September  raising  450 million  following tepid demand  and rival ZTO Express Inc  N ZTO   which raised  1 4 billion in New York a year earlier  fell 15 percent on its debut and has since lagged its offer price  U S  investors can also see the attractions of Hong Kong for Chinese groups   You look at the entrepreneurial environment in China  there are emerging companies that need to go public   said Michael Underhill  founder and chief investment officer of Capital Innovations in Milwaukee  Wisconsin  
 Would it be suitable for them to go public on a New York exchange  Maybe  but it s easier for them to do it in Hong Kong  ",2017-11-16,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/hong-kong-ipo-surge-challenges-new-york-in-battle-for-china-listings-872052,872052

106857,328372,SOHU,Facebook Settles With Advertisers,opinion,"Facebook   NASDAQ FB   has agreed to pay  40 million to settle a case with advertisers that it maintains is  without merit  
Advertisers claim that Facebook moderated viewing metrics that made them spend more on the platform  But as it turns out  the problem related to the way viewing metrics were recorded in the first place  and that was actually known to everyone  Facebook has added that it related to videos advertisers were providing free  on which Facebook didn t directly earn anything 
Facebook s system recorded a view only when it was longer than 3 seconds  While this left out some views  it appeared that average viewing times were longer than they actually were  Advertisers claimed that this led then to misread the popularity of their content  which made them increase their spending on the platform  And naturally  when they increased spending  Facebook benefited 
Facebook says that although it was not at fault  settling was a better way to finally put this thing behind it  the case related to what happened between 2015 and 2016  Facebook announced that this thing was happening in 2016 and was sued in October of that year   The company maintains that it was not aware of the happening a year before its public announcement  as claimed by some based on the fact that the watch time increased by up to 900  in some cases  
Whether at fault or not  the matter increased awareness about the need for independent auditing of ad metrics and led Facebook and other industry players like Alphabet   NASDAQ GOOGL   owned YouTube and Twitter   NYSE TWTR    to get their metrics audited by the Media Rating Council

106860,328375,SOHU,China s Baidu says mobile investment a priority as third quarter revenue falls short,news,"By Gerry Shih BEIJING  Reuters    China s dominant search engine Baidu Inc  O BIDU  said it would continue to invest significantly to adapt its business to the mobile era  a transition that has tripped up other Internet peers born in the desktop PC era like Google Inc  O GOOGL  
Sometimes known as the  Google of China   Baidu reported lower than expected 52 percent increase in third quarter revenue  and said it expected revenue growth in the fourth quarter to slow down marginally 
The results pushed shares of the U S  listed company down 1 6 percent to  221 01 in extended trading  but executives took a longer term view and reiterated investing in mobile   which now accounted for the majority of Baidu s traffic   was the company s top priority 
 It s really not a quarters question or a 2015 question   Chief Financial Officer Jennifer Li told analysts on a post earnings call in response to a question about when margins might expand   Investments on the mobile front is an ongoing effort for us  
For the current quarter  Baidu forecast a 45 4 to 49 6 percent rise in revenue  largely in line with Wall Street projections 
Baidu has faced competition from rivals on mobile devices such as smartphones  as all race to invest in apps and content to keep users engaged  It is also grappling with intensified competition on its own search turf from the likes of Qihoo 360 Technology Co Ltd  N QIHU  and Sohu com Inc s  O SOHU  Sogou search engine  which is 36 5 percent owned by Tencent Holdings  HK 0700  
Chief Executive Robin Li said Baidu would continue to refine its mobile search product and invest in new products  including the newly launched Baidu Connect platform to deliver ads to smartphone users 
 In the long run  mobile users will more actively choose to download Baidu apps   Li said  referring to competition from rivals   Most of our investment in the future will be in the search quality front  and we think consumers will be able to tell the difference  
Under a new accounting method that counted tablets as mobile devices rather than personal computers  mobile traffic surpassed PC traffic for the first time  while mobile revenues accounted for 36 percent of total sales 
Under the new accounting  mobile would have made up 33 percent of revenue during the previous quarter 
 It s a good overall picture for them   said Yuanta Research analyst Francis Ying   I think they will see some growth with mobile from next year  but it cannot be seen in the short term  
Net income jumped 27 2 percent to 3 876 billion yuan   631 5 million   The company earned 11 yuan  1 7993 US dollar  per share  beating investor expectations of 9 75 yuan  1 5948 US dollar  per share  according Thomson Reuters I B E S poll of analysts 
Baidu also said it has been spending more on marketing and content  and on acquiring users  Traffic acquisition costs grew to 12 9 percent of overall revenue  or 1 742 billion yuan in the third quarter  That was up from 11 7 percent a year earlier 
The company is also investing on content for iQiyi  its online video platform  Content costs grew to 3 7 percent of overall revenue  or 498 1 million yuan  That was up from 2 5 percent a year earlier

106863,328378,SOHU,5 Beaten Down Chinese Stocks Set To Rebound In 2020,opinion,The prolonged trade friction between the United States and China has taken its toll on economies across the globe  and the Chinese economy for obvious reasons is no exception  The roughly 18 month long trade war has taken a bite out of the world s second biggest economy  hurt a host of industries in that country and dragged down stocks of several Chinese companies China s Economy Rattled by Tariff WarThe bitter trade tussle has hurt the Chinese economy to a much greater extent than the U S  economy  China s economy grew at a slower than expected pace of 6  in the third quarter of 2019 on a year over year basis  the weakest in nearly three decades  amid trade tensions and softer domestic demand  The growth also slowed from 6 2  clocked in the second quarter The slowdown occurred despite Beijing s efforts to pep up its economy through measures including tax cuts  The trade tiff has created an uncertain environment for businesses and consumers  hurting the Chinese economy China  a major source of demand for a vast spectrum of products  has emerged as a global growth engine over the past few decades  As such  the sputtering engine of the Chinese economy has weighed on the world economy this year Notably  China s economy grew 6 6  in 2018  the slowest pace in almost three decades  China has set its GDP growth target for 2019 at 6 6 5  and hopes to achieve that target  Beijing is reportedly expected to set a growth target of roughly 6  for 2020 China s manufacturing sector bore the brunt of trade war this year  While November saw a sudden recovery in manufacturing on the back of government stimulus actions  the sector languished for most part of 2019  The official manufacturing purchasing managers  index  PMI  contracted for six straight months before modestly expanding in November  China has also seen a slowdown across infrastructure and the property sectors this year Meanwhile  the country s automobile sector is among those that were hardest hit by the fierce trade spat  The sector is crumbling under the weight of the steep U S  tariffs China s automobile sales dropped year over year in November for the 17th straight month amid a slowing economy and tariff war with the United States  Total vehicle sales slipped 3 6  year over year for the month  per the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers   CAAM    The world s largest automobile market looks to be on track for contraction for the second year China s export juggernaut has also slowed in the wake of the U S  tariffs  The country s export sagged for the fourth straight month in November  falling 1 1  year over year as trade with the United States declined sharply  China s exports to the United States dropped 23  year over year to roughly  35 6 billion  per customs data  Exports for the first 11 months also fell 12 5  on a year over year basis Nevertheless  the better than expected industrial and retail data in November is a welcome development  According to the National Bureau of Statistics   NBS    China s industrial production rose 6 2  year over year while retail sales went up 8  in November  The growth came on the back of higher domestic demand driven by the Chinese central government s supports aimed at alleviating the impacts of trade war  These data points suggest that China s economy might have bottomed out and an improvement is in the offing Trade Truce Gives a Glimmer of HopeThe de escalation in the U S  China trade war  at least for now  due to the recent announcement of the  phase one  trade deal augurs well for the reeling Chinese economy The United States and China have agreed to a phase one trade deal after months of negotiation on its terms  The deal averted the implementation of a new round of U S  tariffs on around  160 billion of consumer goods from China including popular consumer products like smartphones  which were slated to kick in on Dec 15  China has also reportedly suspended its additional tariffs on U S  goods that were supposed to take effect that same day Moreover  the United States will also slash its 15  tariff on about  120 billion of Chinese imports to 7 5   according to U S  Trade Representative  Robert Lighthizer  However  the existing 25  tariff will remain in place on about  250 billion worth of goods from China  The deal  which is expected to be signed in early January  also includes China s commitment to purchase a significant amount of U S  farm  energy and manufactured goods and improve intellectual property rights protection  However  exact details of the deal were not officially divulged President Trump also said that the parties will start negotiation on the  Phase Two  deal immediately rather than waiting until after the 2020 elections While much around the trade dispute remains unresolved  the partial trade deal has  to some extent  removed clouds of uncertainties and has also improved outlook heading into 2020  The deal is likely to instil confidence in the Chinese economy  improve business and consumer sentiment and drive trade and investment activities Beijing is also stepping up efforts to ramp up infrastructure investment to prop up its faltering economy  partly through issue of more special bonds  In particular  government stimulus measures are expected to cushion the country s beleaguered manufacturing sector  This should also bode well for the Chinese economy moving into the New Year 5 Battered Stocks Set for a ComebackThe tariff war with the United States has largely contributed to the slowdown in the Chinese economy  However  the completion of the initial trade deal should improve business sentiments and is expected to serve as a catalyst for growth moving into 2020  The recent rebound in industrial production is another positive  As such  Chinese stocks that failed to stand out in 2019 have a chance to bounce back in 2020 However  finding stocks that are likely to rebound in 2020 is no mean feat Here  Zacks  proprietary methodology comes in handy  Our research shows that stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  offer good

106866,328381,SOHU,Baidu competitor says to focus on AI as it plans U S  IPO,news,"By Sijia Jiang
HONG KONG  Reuters    China s second largest mobile search engine Sogou  controlled by Sohu com  SOHU O  and 45 percent owned by Tencent Holdings  0700 HK   said it will focus on artificial intelligence  AI  as it aims to build a next generation search engine 
Chinese internet and gaming company Sohu on Monday announced the plan to float Sogou in the United States  as early as market conditions permit   saying the search unit would make a confidential registration filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission 
Sogou is the second largest mobile search engine in China after Baidu  BIDU O   Tencent is the largest shareholder in Sogou  though the stake carries less voting power than Sohu s 39 percent stake 
Sohu on Monday reported a 10 percent revenue rise to  461 million in the second quarter  including  211 million from Sogou  which rose at a faster pace of 20 percent rise year on year 
Sogou CEO Wang Xiaochuan said in an internal email after the announcement on Monday that Sogou would leverage its strength in natural language processing  which he called the  crown jewel  of artificial intelligence  and move from search to question answering 
The aim was to become an  innovator and pioneer in artificial intelligence in China   he said in the email  the content of which was confirmed by Sogou 
Wang also said Sogou would increase investment into AI  big data and the so called internet of things 
Sogou declined to comment on the possible size of the IPO  Wang told Bloomberg in an interview in January that Sogou was targeting a valuation of  5 billion 
Sogou merged with Tencent s search business Soso in 2013 upon Tencent s strategic investment  Sohu management said in an earnings call on Monday that content sharing with Tencent s social media app WeChat contributed to Sogou s search traffic growth  which jumped 50 percent in mobile in the past quarter 
WeChat  China s most popular social media app with nearly 1 billion monthly active users  in April established a small search department of its own  which analysts said could grow into a powerful threat to other Chinese search companies such as Sogou and Baidu 
Sogou declined to comment on collaboration details with Tencent

Sohu com is a marketing media company in China  Sentiment has gotten way too negative on this sector partly because of the China slowdown but also because of the on going trade war  As most analyst will tell you  the trend war will likely be over before the US presidential election in 2020  In addition  the amount of stimulus thrown at the Chinese economy by the Chinese government has been huge  This will start to trickle down into business spending  At the current valuation  Sohu com makes a ton of sense as a bottom play with significant upside potential

106883,328398,SOHU,Google Pays Up In France,opinion,"Alphabet owned Google   NASDAQ GOOGL   has decided that it s better to pay the piper  The company has settled its tax dispute with French authorities that have been investigating it since 2016  when they raided its French offices 
It s a fairly normal practice for companies operating across Europe to choose their headquarters in a low tax zone and book all their sales there and Google s official jurisdiction  like many other technology companies was Ireland with its 12 5  tax rate  But in Google s case  the investigation likely revealed that the company omitted this safeguard 
As a result  it was easy game for a French court  which ordered it to pay a  500 million fine  in addition to the  465 million in back taxes it had already agreed to pay  That adds up to more than a billion dollars  The finance ministry was looking for 1 6 billion euros 
The company may have settled to bring things to a quick conclusion in the light of an ongoing antitrust probe of big technology companies back home that is likely to be far more comprehensive and difficult to handle 
However  the downside is that it could trigger a series of fines and investigations across Europe as other countries also try to get in on the cash  The UK in particular is looking for something  especially since the sweetheart deal   160 000  it got from Google a few years back was nowhere near what it should have been  Still  UK needs U S  support as it tries to leave the EU  So it may not finally go ahead with these plans  
The French authorities earlier announced a one of its kind 3  tax on digital companies that led President Trump to threaten increased tariff on French wine  France tried to get support for an EU wide digital tax  but Ireland  Denmark  Sweden and Finland opposed the move 
Larger economies within the EU have always been in opposition to the principle of a member nation attracting foreign investment by lowering taxes  That s because it leads to significant revenue loss for them  Google earlier settled with Italian authorities by handing over  306 million in back taxes 
The company maintains   We remain convinced that a coordinated reform of the international tax system is the best way to provide a clear framework for companies operating worldwide   Such an agreement may be ready as early as next year when the 134 OECD nations meet in Paris  France has said it will remove the digital tax once the international tax system kicks in

106897,328412,SOHU,SINA Downgraded To Strong Sell On Uncertain Future Outlook,opinion,"On Aug 12  SINA Corp    NASDAQ SINA   was downgraded to a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   Going by the Zacks model  companies carrying a Zacks Rank  5 are likely to underperform the broader market in the next one to three months 
Why the Downgrade 
The Zacks Consensus Estimates for fiscal 2017 has declined by 2 9   7 cents  to  2 41 in the last 30 days  Also  estimates have reduced by 10 7   45 cents  to  4 20 for fiscal 2018  These downward estimate revisions have primarily resulted in the downgrade of the stock 
We believe that uncertainty over advertising business and portal is preventing management from providing quarterly guidance  This can be attributed as the primary reason behind the decline in estimates 
Further  we believe that continuing investments in Weibo and other verticals like Internet finance  automobile and sports will hurt profitability  going forward  SINA s monetization efforts may see regulatory pressure due to restrictions imposed by the Chinese government  which may hurt subscriber growth  The company is also seeing some headwinds in regards to obtaining new media rights for sports in China Sina Corporation Price and Consensus

   Additionally  competition within the online advertising business in China is fierce  with rapid technological changes along with frequent new product and service rollouts  SINA faces stiffening competition in most of its operational markets from companies including Tencent Holding Ltd    OTC TCEHY    Sohu com Inc    NASDAQ SOHU    and NetEase  Inc    NASDAQ NTES   
We also note that SINA s shares have gained 31 7  in the last year  outperforming the  s gain of 27 6   However  the aforesaid headwinds can pull down the momentum in the rest of 2017

106912,328427,SOHU,What Lies In Store For SINA Corp  SINA  In Q1 Earnings ,opinion,"SINA Corporation   NASDAQ SINA   is set to report first quarter 2017 results on May 16  Last quarter  earnings of 27 cents was  in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Notably  the company has a mixed earnings surprises track for the trailing four quarters  with an average positive surprise of 368 75  
Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors at Play
SINA has a strong product pipeline and is investing in product development and marketing  The company s robust user base for its e commerce and Weibo offerings are positives 
We believe that SINA will benefit from the growth potential of e commerce  e banking  online payment and online entertainment services markets in China Sina Corporation Price and EPS Surprise
   Further  the booming gaming market in China is also a positive for the company  Shares of SINA have outperformed the Zacks categorized  industry  On a year to date basis shares of SINA have increased 35 2  compared with the industry s gain of 22  

We believe that Weibo s monetization ability will be a major driving factor for SINA amid intensifying competition from the likes of Sohu com Inc    NASDAQ SOHU   and NetEase   NASDAQ NTES   in the video and brand advertising market 
However  the company s business is likely to be impacted by soft macroeconomic conditions in China  Also  significant restrictions on online search and other social networking activities in the region remain concerns 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that SINA is likely to beat earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  SINA has an Earnings ESP of 0 00  as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of 28 cents  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Zacks Rank  SINA has a Zacks Rank  3  Though Zacks Rank  1  2 or 3 increases the predictive power of ESP  the company s ESP of 0 00  makes surprise prediction difficult 
We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions

SINA has a strong product pipeline and is investing in product development and marketing  The company s robust user base for its e Commerce and Weibo offerings are positives  In August this year  SINA announced that it will be distributing its Weibo stock to its shareholders on a pro rata basis  SINA has a majority stake  54  or 78  by voting power  in Weibo  which is a microblogging service available in China  Share distribution will reduce SINA s stake in Weibo to 50  or 75  by voting power  SINA will be giving away one Weibo Class A ordinary share to shareholders holding 10 shares of SINA  The move is widely observed as a way to tackle overvaluation of Weibo shares and closing the valuation gap for SINA shareholders  
However  the company s business is likely to be impacted by soft macroeconomic conditions in China  Also  significant restrictions on online search and other social networking activities in the region remain concerns

While Baidu most certainly gained from Google s exit from China  several home grown players are now proliferating  the most significant of which is currently Qihoo 360  NYSE QIHU   Qihoo entered the search market by leveraging its security user base of more than 450 million 
The company was already offering its Internet security products for free and generating revenue through advertisements  Its search engine So com followed the same model and so was immediately successful  pushing it to the number two spot  Qihoo is particularly strong on the mobile platform  where it has a number of popular products 
The merger between Sohu s  NASDAQ SOHU  Sogu and Tencent s Soso search engines also makes for a stronger third player in the search market 
Baidu is the market leader by far and the company is now focusing on the mobile segment  because this area is likely to see much stronger growth  The company has built products targeting three specific areas in mobile search  app distribution and location based services  Management stated that at the end of the last reported quarter  it had leadership positions in all three 
On the flip side  the company saw SG A expenses increase 107  in 2013  driven primarily by the promotion of its mobile products  And investment for growth does not end here    it is expected to remain particularly strong through 2014  Although sales will increase this year  management intends to plough back all additional profits into promotion in order to capture further market share in mobile 
Another hit to profits is the increased headcount  which was up by 5 300 in the last quarter  Acquisitions accounted for 4 000 of these people with most of the rest being recruitments for Baidu s own R D operations 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter dropped 15 cents following the earnings announcement with the estimate for the following quarter dropping 40 cents  The estimates for 2014 and 2015 are down  1 17 and 91 cents  respectively  This drove the Zacks Rank to  5  Strong Sell   However  note that even after the revision  earnings for 2015 are expected to be up 50  from 2014 on an expected revenue growth rate of 39   which is no mean feat 
Therefore  it is apparent that the market is pricing in the increased competition and Baidu s proposed investments  We would watch the price for an inflection point  buying on the weakness ",2014-03-27,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/baidu-down-13.3-ytd.-time-to-buy-207535,207535
106950,328465,SOHU,Should Investors Be Worried About The Alibaba IPO ,opinion,"Some investors claim that Alibaba is the most anticipated IPO in history  This could be true  and there is certainly a lot of buzz concerning how one of the largest filings for an IPO in the US will fare  Alibaba is pushing hard to try to keep up with all the hype by aiming for an IPO shortly after Labor Day  which is historically a solid time for IPOs  Alibaba originally wanted to debut on US markets on August 8th  but was unable to keep with the commitment  and there were concerns that volume would be too low in this slow summer month  For most institutional investors and those who are patient  this is not too much of a big deal  but for individual or retail investors who can t seem to wait any longer  the extra month could be a painful wait to get a slice of the Chinese e commerce giant  This is especially true given that there is lots of negative talk regarding Alibaba s offering as of late  Would patience be a virtue in this situation  Let s find out and let us also consider some of the other key aspects of this important initial public offering  and how it may influence the market in the weeks ahead 
Alibaba Forces Other IPOs to Hold Out
Smaller companies may seek to push back their IPO dates so as not to collide with Alibaba s IPO  Historically  firms have always changed public offering dates after assessing the market situation  and their readiness  Alibaba s IPO is likely to be the biggest ever  raising as much as  20 billion  according to the Wall Street Journal 
Alibaba has agreed with many large US banks  such as Credit Suisse Group  JP Morgan Chase  Citigroup  Morgan Stanley  Goldman Sachs  Deutsche Bank AG  to manage its offering  This should exemplify just how challenging handling the offering will be  Usually a couple of banks handle IPO s but Alibaba has contracted a lot more  Furthermore  this year has been very busy as more than  46 billion have been raised from around 202 IPOs per the Wall Street Journal  Wayfair  headquartered in Boston  Massachusetts  and Zalando  headquartered in Berlin  Germany  are two anticipated e commerce IPO s in Q4  According to UBS AG  investors will have many options to invest in  even though Zalando is planning to file in Frankfurt  it will still offer itself for US investors too 
Banks Face a Challenge
Many bankers are worried about how they may not be able to cope with the sheer volume of traded Alibaba shares  once the company goes public in mid September    However  there are some concerns that volume will trail off after the intial boom  so banks might be concerned about the price of Alibaba in the opening weeks of trading  We saw how Facebook s stock  NASDAQ FB  crumbled during its first few months after it initial public offering back in 2012  which raised an estimated  16 billion  the largest technology IPO to date 
Alibaba s Challenges
Alibaba faces a few long term and short term challenges  The short term challenge is to introduce itself to American investors and the general public in the US  Alibaba operates mainly in China  and caters to the Chinese market and its needs  The Wall Street Journal has also stated that Alibaba will have to answer questions from regulators and investors regarding its distinct  three legged  structure  and how it is going to  structure  its assets  which is not going to be easy considering China s foreign ownership regulations  The other challenge is the somewhat bizarre structure of Alibaba and how it is a Chinese company that is not treating the US as a permanent home  When investors buy Alibaba stock  they will be a stakeholder in a Cayman Islands entity  instead of actually owning part of the Chinese company s assets  however  they will still be entitled to all interest  gains  losses  and dividends  This is something US investors need to think about  as it is often times overlooked  and it is also worth to note that this method  variable interest entity  is already in use by Baidu  NASDAQ BIDU   Sina Cp   NASDAQ SINA   and Sohu com  NASDAQ SOHU  and it isn t having an impact at all  according to MarketWatch 
Accounting Issues in Focus
Very recently  there have also been accounting discrepancies regarding Alibaba s film production arm  Alibaba Pictures  and Deloitte  Alibaba Pictures  auditor  This has caused Alibaba to delay its results  until further investigation is finished  Many say that despite these  accounting irregularities   investors will not be shunned unless the irregularities become too large  Alibaba will also have to make sure that it is satisfying two largest stakeholders  Yahoo  Inc   NASDAQ YHOO  and Softbank  OTC SFTBF  
The Not So Secret Backdoors Close
By now  most investors looking forward to jump on the bandwagon when Alibaba enlists have figured that YHOO owns approximately 22 5  of Alibaba  It is also true that Japan s Softbank Corporation owns a large stake of Alibaba  around 37   but most US investors will have a hard time getting hold of some shares of Softbank  unlike YHOO  Yahoo looks forward to reap the profits that are likely to take place when Alibaba is available to trade  but many shrewd investors have already started stocking up on YHOO shares  in hopes of making gains and owning 22 5  of Alibaba indirectly  YHOO currently has a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   because we believe there are better buying opportunities or so called entry points  before Alibaba takes off  What happens then for YHOO stakeholders is something only time can tell Roundup Bottom Line It is unquestionable that Alibaba  which is rumored to debut with a  BABA  ticker  will have a huge impact on US markets and investors will seek to purchase their own stake in Alibaba  if they don t already have shares in YHOO  Investors will most likely be heavily rewarded during the first week  though time will tell how Alibaba s stock sails  We certainly hope it won t flop like FB s stock when Facebook made its debut  though much like with that company  it will be a very closely watched and anticipated IPO ",2014-08-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/should-investors-be-worried-about-the-alibaba-ipo-222847,222847
106952,328467,SOHU,3 Chinese Tech Stocks To Allay Market Correction Fears,opinion,"After an undeterred bull run for 928 days  China s benchmark Shanghai Composite index had a bitter taste of reality when it plunged 6 4  to close at 4 478 36 on Friday  The index fell 13 3  over the week  triggering fears of an imminent market correction following the longest bull run in history since local bourses were opened for trading in 1990 

The smaller Shenzhen Composite Index  which mostly tracks technology stocks on China s second exchange  also sank 5 9  to close at 2 742 18 on Friday   down 12 7  from its record close of 3 140 66 in the previous week  With more than  10 3 trillion floating in China s stock market  according to the World Federation of Exchanges  before the sudden crash  investors across the globe are bound to get rattled  Before we cherry pick a handful of Chinese technology stocks that are likely to beat the blues  let us dig a little deep to take stock of the situation  The Chinese AscentDespite meager GDP growth  by Chinese standards  of 7  in the first three months of the year  when the average economic expansion of the country was around 10  a year over the past three decades  the stock market continued to move north  The benchmark Shanghai Composite has climbed up nearly 60  this year till the end of May  while the Shenzhen Composite had a steep ascent of 120  
This compared to paltry 2 4  growth by the benchmark S P 500 index during the same time period  making the Chinese equity sector one of the best performing markets in the world 
As more Chinese investors began trading in stock markets  total market cap of the Shanghai Stock Exchange snowballed into  5 9 trillion by the end of May  while that of the Shenzhen Stock Exchange swelled to  4 4 trillion  according to the World Federation of Exchanges  These propelled the stock exchanges to the third and fifth place  respectively  on the list of top global stock exchanges by market cap Is It a Bubble The exuberance in Chinese stocks seems to arise not from healthy market fundamentals  but from government stimulus programs and unique investor frenzy  While the government has stepped up plans to increase liquidity by lowering interest rates and cash reserve ratio of banks  investors have responded by parking their wealth in the equity market According to a survey by State Street Corporation published earlier this year  about 81  of retail investors in China trade in the equity market at least once a month compared to 53  in the U S  This innate desire of investing more than their Western counterparts might be attributable to the cultural difference and the socio economic upbringing As the real estate market began deflating  more investors preferred the stock market to park their excess savings  The Chinese even took recourse to margin buying   a practice in which stocks were bought on borrowed money  According to Oxford Economics  margin accounts increased 86  year over year in 2014  with 700 000 new accounts opened in December alone Bulk of these accounts was opened by unsophisticated retail investors who seem to follow the broader market  So there remains a high probability that a large chunk of stock market wealth might get eroded by the whims of these investors  leading to high market volatility and a probable stock market crash 
A similar case was also witnessed in mid June  when investors abruptly pulled out nearly  7 billion from Chinese funds and ETFs  The withdrawal was largely attributable to MSCI s decision to exclude shares traded in Shanghai and Shenzhen from its widely tracked global benchmarks due to concerns over China s market restrictions 
3 Chinese Stocks Likely to Stand TallIrrespective of the fact that a market correction looks imminent as the stock market bubble appears to be on the brink of explosion  there remains a handful of priceless stocks that are likely to stand as tall as the archaic Great Wall of China  Investors should be better off with these Chinese stocks that are backed by a favorable Zacks Rank and impressive long term earnings growth rate Baidu Inc  NASDAQ BIDU   Headquartered in Beijing  Baidu offers a Chinese language search platform  In addition to serving individual Internet search users  Baidu provides an effective platform for businesses to reach potential customers through online marketing services to its customers directly and through other distribution networks Earnings estimates for this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock for the current year have been moving up in the last 7 days  With a forward PE of 29 2x  the long term earnings expectation of the stock is also pegged at a relatively high of 30 6  compared with an industry average of 18 5  China Mobile Ltd  NYSE CHL   Incorporated in 1997 and based in Central Hong Kong  this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock offers mobile telecommunications and related services in Mainland China and Hong Kong  In addition  the company provides wireless data traffic services and applications and information services  including mobile music  mobile paper  mobile reading  mobile video and mobile market The stock is currently trading at a forward PE of 13 9x  Earnings estimates for the current year have been moving up  implying bullish sentiments for the long term growth of the company Sohucom Inc  NASDAQ SOHU   Founded in 1996 and headquartered in Beijing  Sohu offers online media  search  and game services across diversified digital media  This leading Internet portal of the country provides Chinese language Web navigational and search capabilities  twelve main content channels  Web based communications and community services  and a platform for e commerce services The long term earnings expectation for this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock is currently pegged at 22 0  Moving Forward
Shane Oliver  head of Investment Strategy and Chief Economist at AMP Capital  observed   After rising 140  over 12 months and around 50  year to date such volatility is to be expected as it has risen a bit too far too fast   Whether or not a market correction indeed occurs  investors are likely to benefit from these Chinese technology stocks that are likely to outperform the broader equity market ",2015-06-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-chinese-tech-stocks-to-allay-market-correction-fears-255896,255896
106955,328470,SOHU,China s Stock Market Crashing  Be Prudent When Opening Positions,opinion,"Fortune always fights on the side of the prudent  Critias  Lately one cynic after another  some of whom claim to be experts  are all marching to the same drumbeat  The Chinese economy is in trouble  the Chinese markets are going to continue crashing  The Shanghai index experienced an astounding advance over a brief period of time and so it should not have come as a surprise that such a stupendous rally would culminate with an equally brutal correction  The doctors of gloom and doom are overdoing it  in our opinion 
Stephen Roach  the former manager of Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS  Asia  seems to concur with this assessment  He made the following proclamation on the 3rd of September 2015 

Growth in China has slowed   but it s not going in for a crash   and that will present  I think  an opportunity for shares to re evaluate the China threat  big time  

When the crowd panics  it takes a bit of time for the dust to settle down  Their confidence has been shaken  and they are letting their emotions do the talking  When emotions take over  the reaction is almost always overdone  When this occurs  the level headed investor is provided with a once in a lifetime opportunity to purchase shares in top rated companies for a fraction of their true value  Prudence is still warranted  but for the brave of heart and those that have a long term view  opening positions in companies such as NASDAQ NTES  NYSE BABA  NASDAQ SOHU  NYSE HNP  NYSE CHA  etc   will most likely prove to be a good call 
Our V indicator is signifying that we are going to witness volatility on a scale never seen before  the wild gyrations the Shanghai index has been experiencing clearly reflect this new trend in play  Volatility has a destabilising effect on the small players  they become nervous and end up throwing the baby out with the bathwater  In this instance  they might end up joining the baby and the bath water 
The Technical Outlook   
This five year chart clearly illustrates how explosive the move from Oct 2014 to June of this year was  Only the foolish would expect such a rally to continue unabated  In our opinion  the market is letting out well deserved steam and in doing so  getting rid of all the speculative money that was pumped into it  The Shanghai index is sitting on a zone of support right now 
However  we feel that there is still more downside  albeit not that much  and would not be surprised by a hard and fast move down to the 2500 2600 ranges  In the interim  there is a very good chance that the index could trade to the 3500 ranges with a possible overshoot to the 3700 ranges before dropping below 3000 

The trend in both the five year and the one year charts have been violated  and therefore  one should expect more volatility before the dust settles down  The one year chart illustrates that the index could run up as high as 3700 before dropping below 3000  For this to occur  a weekly close above 3250 would be needed  As the trend is not positive in all time frames  a test of the lows is almost a given 
To trigger a move down to the 2500 ranges  the index needs a weekly close below 2750  Any move below 2700 should be viewed as a splendid long term entry point 
Long term reasons to be bullish  

The markets in the West have been rigged in favour of short term gains via years of unconventional monetary policy and the Fed s insane desire to maintain an ultra low interest rate environment that favours speculators and punishes savers 
China s middle class continues to grow in leaps and bounds  According to a report by the South China morning post  SCMP   China s middle class grew by 203 million in 10 years 
China is transforming into a consumer driven economy  and according to a report by Bloomberg  China has the potential to create a  67 trillion economy  China is not ploughing as much money as it was into US treasuries  In fact  in April of this year  Japan overtook China as the largest holder of U S  debt  A report on Bloomberg by Daniel Kruger and Wes Goodman in August revealed that China had slashed its stake in U S  debt by  180 billion 

Conclusion
As an investor  you have the option to dance to your own drumbeat or dance to the drumbeat of those banging the drums of gloom  If you take this route  you run the risk of missing an opportunity  Fear knows no limits and is only superseded by stupidity  The masses are in a state of panic  and so it will take some time for the turbulent water to settle down  However  this is the time for the astute investor to start looking for good companies with great future prospects  we mentioned a few earlier 
China s market looks more promising than ours from a long term perspective  If you decide to open positions right now  don t be overzealous  take nibbles instead of large bites  Naysayers would have you believe that the world is about to end  They sing the same song of doom  and so far the world is still here and many of them are not  The naysayers have an innate knack for singing bloody murder after the correction is almost over and chanting songs of joy when the markets are close to putting in a top 
There is a wide abyss that separates fear from prudence  Prudence is warranted  as the driving force behind it is usually logic and not the irrational emotion of fear  If you embrace fear  you would not recognise opportunity even it slapped you hard in the face  Fear is parasitic in nature  it only takes and gives nothing in return  One should look for symbiotic relationships when it comes to investing  There is no such thing as a good parasite  so the logical option is to get rid of this parasitic emotion as soon as you can

The benchmark index declined on Wednesday primarily due to losses taken by property companies as investors indulged in profit taking after a six day stretch of gains  The Shanghai Composite moved lower on Thursday due to a significant correction and grievous losses incurred by small cap stocks which outweighed gains made by financial stocks 
JD com   NASDAQ JD   reported loss of 3 cents a share in the second quarter of 2016  better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 7 cents per share  SINA Corp    NASDAQ SINA   reported second quarter 2016 adjusted earnings of 6 cents per share  which was way better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 1 cent and loss of 19 cents reported in the year ago quarter 
Last Week s Developments 
Last Friday  the Shanghai Composite lost 0 2  and closed the week nearly unchanged following concerns over the health of the economy and firm steps taken by regulators to reduce market risk  These developments reduced trading volumes as investors stayed away from the bourses  Additionally  the appetite for risk taking declined following signs of an economic revival and doubt about how much additional stimulus would be forthcoming 
The CSI 300 gained 0 1  while the small cap heavy ChiNext declined by 1   Meanwhile  the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index advanced 1 4   boosting weekly gains to 1 9   This was its highest point in three months  Investors in Hong Kong were encouraged by speculation that the central bank would undertake fresh stimulus measures 
Markets and the Economy This Week
The benchmark index gained 0 9  on Monday after coal stocks surged and property companies racked up gains following excitement over a major developer buying up a rival s shares  These positives negated the effect of disappointing trade data  Both exports and imports declined to a larger extent than expected last month  indicating weakness in global demand remained 
Coal mining companies gained following reports that the borrowings made by some of them will be converted into medium and long term special loans  This is part of the efforts being made by the government to boost the embattled coal sector 
The Hang Seng added 1 6   rising to its highest level in seven months  Gains were led by real estate stocks and producers of building materials following impressive U S  jobs data which indicated that the largest economy in the world showing improvement
