178253,399769,VLO,Better Buy  Phillips 66 or Valero Energy,news,"If you are looking for exposure in the refining sector  Phillips 66  NYSE PSX  and Valero Energy  NYSE VLO  are among the stocks that first come to the mind  Both are top refiners with some of the best assets and healthy dividend yields  Both companies also look set to benefit from the new fuel standard from the International Maritime Organization that came into effect from January 1  However  it is important to know some key differences between the two before selecting one over the other 
Operations
The first key difference between Phillips 66 and Valero Energy lies in the two companies  operations  While Valero Energy is largely into refining  Phillips 66 is slightly more diversified in comparison  A significant chunk of Phillips 66 s earnings come from its midstream  chemicals  and marketing businesses  Though Valero too has some midstream assets  they contribute much less to the company s earnings 
This diversification gives Phillips 66 a slight advantage in terms of earnings growth  especially when the refining market environment is weak  However  investors looking solely for a refining exposure may like to consider how it fits in their portfolio 

Renewable energy 
Another area which differentiates Valero Energy from Phillips 66 is the scale of their ethanol and renewable diesel operations  Valero Energy has has made good progress in renewable diesel production  The extension of blenders  tax credit for a five year period will benefit Valero  While this amount may not look material now for big refiners  a longer term extension of five years is an indicator of the importance of renewable fuels for refiners in the future  The Environmental Protection Agency s RFS  or Renewable Fuel Standard  requires refiners to blend renewable fuels in with their transportation fuels  With a lot of focus on renewable energy  including the extension to 2030 of the Renewable Energy Directive II in Europe and the Low Carbon Fuel Standard program in California  the demand and margins for renewable diesel are expected to remain strong  
Though Phillips 66 is still working on a couple of renewable diesel projects  it recently called off a major project in Ferndale due to permitting delays  
Phillips 66 s better performance
In the last few years  Phillips 66 has been able to grow earnings at a higher rate compared to Valero as well as other refiners   A few key factors contributed to this outperformance  First is Phillips 66 s sound investments in the refining segment  The company s investments have generated higher returns and have an advantage in terms of crude inputs  This comes from the company s deep understanding of the refining markets  Second  Phillips 66 is able to better leverage its midstream investments by placing them around its refining footprint  Third  its chemicals business assets are also well positioned providing it a competitive advantage over others in terms of sourcing feedstocks  So  all of the company s businesses are contributing to its impressive growth 
Further  Phillips 66 is working on several key projects    including Gray Oak pipeline  Liberty pipeline  Red Oak pipeline  Sweeny Hub fractionators  and Gulf Coast petrochemical assets    that should continue to fuel its earnings growth 
Notably  Valero Energy stock has outperformed Phillips 66 on a total return basis over the last five years  This is likely due to Valero s higher dividend growth that has also resulted in its higher yield  However  in the last two years  the two refiners are growing dividends at the same rate   
So  which is better 
The biggest challenge of refiners currently is to stay profitable in an oversupplied market  Both Phillips 66 and Valero Energy are doing a great job not only in staying profitable  but also growing their earnings  The companies are also focused on returning value to the shareholders through stock buybacks and dividend increases  While Valero s edge in renewable diesel and its slightly higher yield may attract a certain set of investors  Phillips 66 has surely been a winner in terms of recent earnings growth  With a bunch of upcoming growth projects  Phillips 66 looks well placed for future growth too ",2020-01-28,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pnzmv,2069594

any questions after reviewing these tables  please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team after the call I would now like to direct your attention to the forward looking statement disclaimer contained in the press release  In summary  it says that statements in the press release and on this conference call that state the company s or management s expectations or predictions of the future are forward looking statements intended to be covered by the Safe Harbor provisions under federal securities laws  There are many factors that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations including those we ve described in our filings with the SEC  Now  I ll turn the call over to Joe for opening remarks Joe Gorder    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Homer and good morning everyone  We are pleased to report that we had a good quarter delivering solid financial results  Our refineries operated well at 96  utilization  allowing us to take advantage of wider sour crude oil differentials and weakness in high sulfur residual feedstocks Overall  2019 was a challenging environment for the refining business  We started the year with gasoline inventories at record highs and gasoline cracks at historic lows  We were also faced with narrow sour crude oil differentials for most of the year  primarily due to sanctions on Venezuela and Iran in addition to OPEC and Canadian crude oil production curtailments and differentials on inland sweet crude oils narrowed in the second half of the year with the start up of multiple new crude pipelines from the Permian Basin to the Gulf Coast Despite this challenging backdrop  our team demonstrated the strength of our assets and prior investments to improve our feedstock and product flexibility  allowing us to deliver another year of steady earnings and free cash flow  We demonstrated our crude supply flexibility by processing an annual record of 1 4 million barrels per day of North American sweet crude oil as well as a record of approximately 180 000 barrels per day of Canadian heavy crude oil in 2019  We also achieved another milestone by delivering the best ever year on employee safety performance and the lowest number of environmental events in company history  demonstrating our strong commitment to safety  reliability  and environmental stewardship  We continue to invest in projects that enhance the flexibility and margin capability of our portfolio  In 2019  we successfully started up the Houston Alkylation Unit and completed the Central Texas Pipelines and Terminals project and we have several growth projects that will be completed this year including the Pasadena Terminal  St  Charles Alkylation Unit and the Pembroke Cogeneration Unit  Looking further out  the Diamond Pipeline expansion should be completed in 2021 and the Diamond Green Diesel and the Port Arthur Coker projects are still on track to be completed in 2021 and 2022 respectively We also continue to explore growth opportunities in our renewable fuels business  which is already the largest in North America  As we previously announced  the Diamond Green Diesel joint venture is in the advanced engineering review phase for a new renewable diesel plant at our Port Arthur  Texas facility  If the project is approved  operations are expected to commence in 2024  which would result in Diamond Green Diesel s renewable fuels production capacity increasing to over 1 1 billion gallons annually or over 70 000 barrels per day We remain disciplined in our allocation of capital  a constant in our strategy for several years  which prioritizes our investment grade credit rating  sustaining investments and maintaining a sustainable and growing dividend  We expect our annual capex for 2020 to be approximately  2 5 billion  which is consistent with our average annual spend over the last six years with approximately  1 billion allocated for high return growth projects that are focused on market expansion and margin improvement and the balance allocated to maintain safe  reliable and environmentally responsible operations  And you should continue to expect incremental discretionary cash flow to compete with other discretionary uses including organic growth investments  M A  and cash returns to our investors Looking ahead  we have a favorable outlook for refining margins with the IMO 2020 low sulfur fuel oil regulation  which just took effect on January 1st  High sulfur crude oils are expected to be more discounted due to lower demand as less complex refineries switch to sweeter crude oils  Valero s complex refining system is well positioned to take advantage of the discounted high sulfur crudes and fuel oils as feedstocks and our growing renewable diesel segment continues to generate strong results due to the high demand for renewable fuels In closing  our incredible teams relentless focus on operational excellence  a steady pipeline of high return organic growth projects  and a demonstrated commitment to shareholder returns should continue to position Valero well  So with that  Homer  I ll hand the call back to you Homer Bhullar    Vice President Investor RelationsThanks  Joe  For the fourth quarter of 2019  net income attributable to Valero stockholders was  1 1 billion or  2 58 per share compared to  952 million or  2 24 per share in the fourth quarter of 2018  Fourth quarter 2019 adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders was  873 million or  2 13 per share compared to  932 million or  2 19 per share for the fourth quarter of 2018  For 2019  net income attributable to Valero stockholders was  2 4 billion or  5 84 per share compared to  3 1 billion or  7 29 per share in 2018  2019 adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders was  2 4 billion or  5 70 per share compared to  3 2 billion or  7 55 per share in 2018  The 2018 and 2019 adjusted results exclude several items reflected in the financial tables that accompany the earnings release  For reconciliations of actual to adjusted amounts  please refer to those financial tables Operating income for the refining segment in the fourth quarter of 2019 was  1 4 billion compared to  1 5 billion for the fourth quarter of 2018  Refining throughput volumes averaged 3 million barrels per day  which was in line with the fourth quarter of 2018  Throughput capacity utilization was 96  in the fourth quarter of 2019  Refining cash operating expenses of  3 93 per barrel were in line with the fourth quarter of 2018  The ethanol segment generated  36 million of operating income in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to a  27 million operating loss in the fourth quarter of 2018  The increase from the fourth quarter of 2018 was primarily due to higher margins resulting from higher ethanol prices  Ethanol production volumes averaged 4 3 million gallons per day in the fourth quarter of 2019  Operating income for the renewable diesel segment was  541 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to  101 million for the fourth quarter of 2018  After adjusting for the retroactive blender s tax credit recorded in the fourth quarter of 2019  adjusted renewable diesel operating income was  187 million in the fourth quarter of 2019  compared to  167 million for the fourth quarter of 2018  The increase in operating income was primarily due to higher sales volume  Renewable diesel sales volumes averaged 844 000 gallons per day in the fourth quarter of 2019  an increase of 124 000 gallons per day versus the fourth quarter of 2018 For the fourth quarter of 2019  general and administrative expenses were  243 million and net interest expense was  119 million  General and administrative expenses for 2019 of  868 million were lower than 2018 mainly due to adjustments to our environmental liabilities in 2018  For the fourth quarter of 2019  depreciation and amortization expense was  571  Phonetic  million and income tax expense was  326 million  The effective tax rate was 20  for 2019  Net cash provided by operating activities was  1 7 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019  Excluding the unfavorable impact from the change in working capital of  434 million and our joint venture partners 50  share of Diamond Green Diesel s net cash provided by operating activities excluding changing in its working capital  adjusted net cash provided by operating activities was  1 9 billion With regard to investing activities  we made  722 million of capital investments in the fourth quarter of 2019  of which approximately  445 million was for sustaining the business including costs for turnarounds  catalysts and regulatory compliance  For 2019  we invested  2 7 billion  which includes all of Diamond Green Diesel s capital investments of  160 million  Excluding our partners 50  share of Diamond Green Diesel s capital investments  Valero s capital investments for 2019 were approximately  2 6 billion with approximately  1 billion of the total for growing the business Moving to financing activities  we returned  591 million to our stockholders in the fourth quarter   369 million was paid as dividends with the balance used to purchase 2 3 million shares of Valero common stock  This brings our 2019 return to stockholders to  2 3 billion and the total payout ratio to 47  of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities  As of December 31st  we had approximately  1 5 million  Phonetic  of share repurchase authorization remaining and last week  our Board of Directors approved a 9  increase in the regular quarterly dividend to  0 98 per share or  3 92 per share annually  further demonstrating our commitment to return cash to our investors  With respect to our balance sheet at quarter end  total debt was  9 7 billion and cash and cash equivalents were  2 6 billion  Valero s debt to capitalization ratio  net of  2 billion in cash  was 26   At the end of December  we had  5 3 billion of available liquidity excluding cash Turning to guidance  we continue to expect annual capital investments for 2020 to be approximately  2 5 billion with approximately 60  allocated to sustaining the business and approximately 40  to growth  The  2 5 billion includes expenditures for turnarounds  catalysts and joint venture investments  For modeling our first quarter operations  we expect refining throughput volumes to fall within the following ranges  U S  Gulf Coast at 1 63 million barrels per day to 1 68 million barrels per day  U S  Mid Continent at 410 barrels per day to 430 000 barrels per day  U S  West Coast at 230 000 barrels per day to 250 000 barrels per day  and North Atlantic at 470 000 barrels per day to 490 000 barrels per day  We expect refining cash operating expenses in the first quarter to be approximately  4 15 per barrel  Our ethanol segment is expected to produce a total of 4 2 million gallons per day in the first quarter  Operating expenses should average  0 37 per gallon  which includes  0 05 per gallon for non cash costs such as depreciation and amortization  With respect to renewable diesel segment  we expect sales volumes to be 750 000 gallons per day in 2020  Operating expenses in 2020 should be  0 50 per gallon  which includes  0 20 per gallon for non cash costs such as depreciation and amortization  For the first quarter  net interest expense should be about  113 million and total depreciation and amortization expense should be approximately  560 million  For 2020  we expect G A expenses excluding corporate depreciation to be approximately  860 million  The annual effective tax rate is estimated at 22   Lastly  we expect RIN s expense for the year to be between  300 million and  400 million That concludes our opening remarks  Before we open the call to questions  we again respectfully request that callers adhere to our protocol of limiting each turn in the Q A to two questions  If you have more than two questions  please rejoin the queue as time permits  This helps us ensure other callers have time to ask their questions Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions  And our first question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JPMorgan  Your line is now open Phil Gresh    JPMorgan    AnalystHey  good morning Joe Gorder    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Phil Phil Gresh    JPMorgan    AnalystSo first question  two part question  I was wondering if you could discuss in the fourth quarter what incremental actions Valero took in order to run more fuel oil as a feedstock across the portfolio and how much of that you re actually able to capture in the quarter as well as why you think the high sulfur fuel oil prices have started to strengthen here in the beginning of 2020 Joe Gorder    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI ll start with the    in terms of how we ve maybe looked at our operating conditions and our operating envelope  I mean  Gary  can sort of finish up with the market  On the operating conditions  we widened our window    our operating window to try to reach out and get more challenging high sulfur resid  We always    we ve for years and years and years  really for the decade  we ve been somebody who buys a lot of high sulfur resid and to run them  but we opened up the market    now look as we    we believe the idea was is as the market changed and try to conform or at least to the IMO 2020  some of these high sulfur resids would free up in the marketplace and so we want to get at the resid before it gets blended into the high sulfur fuel oil market because of the quality reasons  So that s really what we did  we reached out and ran quite a few high sulfur resid that we have not historically ran Gary Simmons    Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial OfficerYeah  so the second part of that in terms of I guess where    how much of it showed up in the fourth quarter  we ran a lot of high sulfur resids  but we really didn t see the discounted barrels coming in until about mid December  so it didn t have a real significant impact on fourth quarter results and you ll see that more going forward  but in terms of high sulfur fuel oil getting more expensive  you know  it s    we re still in the very early phase of what s a significant transition in our industry as we respond to the IMO bunker sulfur spec change and so with the change of the magnitude  you would expect it to create some volatility in the markets and it will take some time for the markets to reach equilibrium  So we certainly see that there s not a lot of liquidity in the physical fuel oil markets  there is a lot more liquidity in the paper markets  If you look at the forward curve  steeply backwardated and kind of showing fuel oil gets back to 60   65  of Brent  which is kind of more where we think it will be  So our view really in respect to high sulfur fuel oil and the crude oil quality discounts hasn t changed  As the markets normalize  we expect to see the discount widen back out as the forward curve reflects and as high sulfur fuel blend stocks have to compete for space with heavy sour crudes and complex refining capacity like we have in the Gulf Coast Phil Gresh    JPMorgan    AnalystOkay  got it  Thank you  The second question just on the capital allocation side of things  You continue to keep capital spending flattish here in 2020 and you had a really healthy dividend increase that you announced  which looks pretty well covered by cash flow  So just curious how you re thinking about this increase in the dividend and is it just a shift from the dividend to the buyback and you re sticking with the same constructs that you ve had  40  to 50  of cash flow and obviously the buyback will reduce the dividend burden over time  but just curious how you re thinking about all this today  Thanks Donna Titzman    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerNo  we haven t changed our policy and it continues to be that we want to return 40  to 50  of the cash flow from operations to the shareholders  The dividend increase is just a part of that payout  We don t have anything in particular in mind in regards to a dividend only payout  it s just part of the overall cash return  You might see that    the dividend as a percentage of the total vary each year as our cash flow varies  but buybacks will continue to fill in the balance of that return Phil Gresh    JPMorgan    AnalystOkay  great  Thank you OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from the line of Manav Gupta from Credit Suisse  Your line is now open Manav Gupta    Credit Suisse    AnalystJoe  could you talk a little bit about the Gulf Coast operating results  You were almost up 75  on operating income on the Gulf Coast and the context I m trying to understand this is like you have global majors  one of which indicated that downstream earnings could be down 80  quarter over quarter  another one reported today downstream earnings down 36   How is Valero in an alternate universe where you are so much better than others Joe Gorder    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerManav  that s a really good question and I d love to give you an intelligent answer  but why don t I let one of these guys cover it here  Gary or Lane Gary Simmons    Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial OfficerYeah  so hey  so Manav  which    I mean  first of all  we did see higher    higher discounts    crude oil discounts and obviously the resid discounts in the fourth quarter  So if you re comparing third quarter to fourth quarter  that s part of the answer  The second part of the answer is we got better naphtha netbacks because naphtha prices improved over the quarter  And again  we also had butane  For butane  we    when you compare fourth quarter to third quarter  its our ability to run cheaper butane or at least blend it obviously helped us with our capture rates when compared to the third quarter Manav Gupta    Credit Suisse    AnalystA quick follow up on the renewable diesel and the expansion of    targeted for late 2021  You guys have indicated a normalized margin of only 125  Phonetic  versus a 180  Phonetic  or something you realized in this quarter without BTC  but if you put the basic even 125  Phonetic   you could get like  250 million EBITDA on the base margin and then about another  140 million  So you re looking at a return of like  390 million of EBITDA on this project  So  from your capital expenditure point of 550  Phonetic   it looks like a two year payback on this entire project  like is the math s right or is something off here Martin Parrish    Senior Vice President Alternative FuelsWell  we feel pretty good about it  Manav  this is Martin Parrish  We still feel good about the pro forma guidance as 126  Phonetic  that excludes the blender s tax credit  So that puts you at  2 26  Phonetic  per gallon EBITDA  I think that kind of checks out with what you re saying Manav Gupta    Credit Suisse    AnalystThanks guys  Thank you Joe Gorder    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo yes  Manav  agree with you  you re very close Manav Gupta    Credit Suisse    AnalystThank you  sir Joe Gorder    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYou bet  Take care OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America  Your line is now open Doug Leggate    Bank of America    AnalystHey  good morning guys  Joe  I think it s the first time we ve spoken this year  So  happy New Year Joe Gorder    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Same to you  Doug Doug Leggate    Bank of America    AnalystJoe  I got one on the market and one on the letter  Phonetic   let s go with the letter  Phonetic  first  Maybe Donna wants to take this  but Phil already asked about the payout  you know  the 40   50  of your cash flow payout  I guess I m more curious on the mix with the dividend  I mean you were very early to get on this train of returning a significant amount of cash to shareholders and its paid  pardon the pun  but it has paid dividends in both the credibility of the business model as well as the relative performance of the stock  but why not more dividends over buybacks  I m just curious how you think about that Joe Gorder    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerDo you want to take a crack at it Donna Titzman    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSo look  we have told    we ve explained to the market that we do consider that dividend to be part of the non discretionary piece of our capital allocation  So when we look at that  we look at it in the context of it being competitive to the market with our peers in the market in general  but also more importantly sustainable through market cycles  So again  we regularly review that with those objectives in mind Joe Gorder    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYou know  Doug  what I would    and Donna is exactly right  what I would add to what she said  you ve got the sustainability aspect in a down market cycle  which is something that we spend a lot of time looking at to be sure that we don t find ourselves cutting that dividend and you reinforce that by having a very strong balance sheet  but if I think about it longer term  OK and this is really where my brain goes  it goes to the sustainability of the growth of the dividend going forward and we want to continue to be able to grow  we want to give our owners more every year and the way that you go about doing that is tempering it a little bit  I think we started talking last year about moderating the dividend a little bit more  which I think you saw we did this year and the other thing that s really encouraging from my perspective is that we ve got these capital projects that are coming on stream  they are providing significant future earnings potential and some of them are longer cash flow cycles  which we haven t done a lot of over the last bunch of years  but I mean we got another renewable diesel plant  we ve got the coker and then if we end up doing the Port Arthur renewable diesel plant in the future  these are huge EBITDA producing projects which are going to really reinforce our ability to go ahead and continue to deliver dividend growth going forward  Now  I m not making you a promise because Lord only knows what might happen  but that would be our objective and that s kind of the way we re looking at investing our capital  The component part  the percentage of the total payout that s made up of the dividend  that the dividend comprises  that s not formulaic  It s more us looking at all of the factors involved and there is a lot of sausage making that takes place there that we won t get into here  but I always want to be in a position when we do something like this to let you know that we feel fairly assured that this isn t going to be an issue going forward Doug Leggate    Bank of America    AnalystI appreciate the lengthy answer guys  My follow up  Joe  I don t know if you want to sort this to one of the guys and I mean I also offer my congratulations to the new officer titles in the team  but maybe Lane wants to take this  but there was a lot of chatter about new capacity coming online at the back end of this year and maybe for the next couple of years  Obviously  things are kind of soft it seems on the demand side given what s going on with China  but I m just wondering how you see the prognosis for the short term  IMO tailwinds transitioning maybe into a more challenging refining environment longer term  how are you guys thinking about that  And I ll leave it there  Thanks Joe Gorder    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Doug Lane Riggs    President and Chief Operating OfficerYeah  so I think for at least for the next year to two years  we see global oil demand growth kind of keeping pace with the capacity additions and we still think we have favorable balances between production and consumption  but then  yes  we start to show two years to three years out that capacity additions start to outpace global oil demand growth and at that time  we would expect to see some rationalization in the industry Doug Leggate    Bank of America    AnalystSo the next couple of years  you re not concerned about  I mean obviously Aramco has got a bunch of stuff coming online and then Asia kicks up  21   22  Phonetic   So you re not concerned about the short term    that kind of medium term outlook then Lane Riggs    President and Chief Operating OfficerNo  we still show that oil demand growth outpaces capacity addition for the short term Doug Leggate    Bank of America    AnalystOkay  will watch with interest  Guys  I m looking forward to seeing you in March at our conference  Thanks Joe Gorder    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Doug OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey from Mizuho  Your line is now open Paul Sankey    Mizuho Securities    AnalystMorning all  if I could also follow up on that  Hi guys  Joe you ran higher than we expected in every region  Could you talk about then that s obviously versus your guidance  could you talk about the pattern of higher volume  I don t know if there s a volume mass issue there  but certainly your capture suggests that s not the right direction to be looking in  and furthermore  once you ve hopefully helped explain how come you re running at the levels that you are right across the system  could you and this is the follow up to the previous question  could you talk about any expectations you have for shutdowns in refining if margins stay extremely weak and potentially get worse with this whole situation in China  Thanks Joe Gorder    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerOkay  so Paul  we ll    we re kind of looking at each other  Let us give    take a crack at this and then we ll give you the opportunity if we re not answering your question to follow up  OK   Speech Overlap  Lane Riggs    President and Chief Operating OfficerYeah  hey  Paul  this is Lane  I ll start  We ve had a long strategy really dating back to 2011 to work in a very organized way on our reliability projects and what we ve seen is our refining system has gone from say 95  to 96  availability  all the way up to sort of over 97  availability and that s helped us    we re available in the market is right and been able to perform better  And in addition to that  we do believe that we re the best in the industry in terms of understanding what feedstocks go where in the systems that we re in and we re highly adaptable to that  So I think that helps us versus some other people in terms of our capture rates Paul Sankey    Mizuho Securities    AnalystLane  could you just dig in a little bit on that better than anyone else argument because to an extent I guess the computer programs commoditized or not  if you could just go a bit down that rabbit hole  I d be grateful  thanks Lane Riggs    President and Chief Operating OfficerYou know it s interesting you would say they are commoditized because everybody has tools  everybody believes that they are all implementing these tools to some degree or another  I would say that I believe we are more integrated and more aligned on making sure that our tools have characterized the feeds and we understand our units very well  It s one thing to have the tools  sometimes people have tools  but they don t use the tools  We have a world class planning and economics group and they do a fantastic job coordinating with our refineries in terms of having those sub models very well understood and therefore  we understand the operating envelopes and how those feedstocks are characterizing our systems Paul Sankey    Mizuho Securities    AnalystYeah  I mean I guess further to a previous  previous question  we ve seen big mega oils you would think have a similar structure in terms of their refining footprint to you guys  wildly underperforming against what you guys are achieving  So it s just interesting trying to establish what the competitive advantage is Joe Gorder    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWell  we appreciate you saying that  Paul Lane Riggs    President and Chief Operating OfficerYes  thank you Joe Gorder    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAnd then the follow up question was on capacity Lane Riggs    President and Chief Operating OfficerYeah  so I think the situation in the Far East is just developing and it s really too early for us to be able to judge the magnitude of the impact that s going to have and whether it leads to refineries shutting down or not Joe Gorder    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYou know  the reality of it is we ve got capacity coming on stream  we ve also got capacity that isn t running well and that in the foreseeable future probably won t be able to run well and so  and Paul  if you assume at some point  it s a zero sum game  there is going to be a lot of capacity that shouldn t run  certainly in a post IMO world  it s going to have an effect on that  And so if you got poorly performing assets today  turning them around is a lengthy process and then if you ve got a marginal asset due to economics  you re going to be the guy that has to bow out at some point in time  So that s why we look at it  I mean frankly our tendency is to focus a whole lot more on our business and what we can do to make it better and more efficient than kind of what s happening more broadly Paul Sankey    Mizuho Securities    AnalystYeah  got it  If I could just ask a very specific follow up  If we assume that there was extreme weakness in jet fuel demand  what would that mean for you and the global industry and I ll leave it there  Thank you Joe Gorder    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerOkay  thanks Gary Simmons    Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial OfficerWell  our jet yield is about 8  and as we make 200 000 barrels a day  250 000 barrels a day of jet  some of that is contract demand and inland demand  which is going to stay  but a lot of it in our Gulf Coast refineries we have the ability to put that into diesel if jet demand got soft and I suspect that s what would happen Paul Sankey    Mizuho Securities    AnalystThank you Joe Gorder    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThanks OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from the line of Sam Margolin from Wolfe Research  Your line is now open Sam Margolin    Wolfe Research    AnalystHello  how are you Joe Gorder    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerHi  Sam Sam Margolin    Wolfe Research    AnalystI know you just said you focus on your own business and not the market  but I have a market question to start  so sorry Joe Gorder    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerOh  I didn t say we don t focus on the market Sam Margolin    Wolfe Research    AnalystSo a lot of attention is being paid to this collapse in diesel cracks  part of the reason that the drop has been so pronounced is because the peak that it started from was so high and at the time when we were at that peak  it seemed obvious why  but in retrospect  IMO is having more of a feedstock effect than a product effect  So do you have any updated thoughts about that period just three months ago when diesel cracks were peaking in retrospect what was really driving that and maybe that will help inform how we can escape this headwind in the intermediate term Lane Riggs    President and Chief Operating OfficerYes  Sam  So I think you know as we got to the back half of the fourth quarter obviously round season  wind it down and we started to see refinery utilization ramp up and with higher refinery utilization  of course  distillate production increased and then overall demand has been weaker than what we anticipated  So a lot of that has been due to warmer weather  The warmer weather has somewhat offset a lot of the demand increase we thought we would get as a result of IMO  In addition to that  certainly in the U S  Gulf Coast  we ve had very heavy fog which has limited our ability to export the diesel to some of the export markets  In addition to that  we ve had very high freight rates which again hinder our ability to export  Of course  South America is a big export market for us  They ve had a lot of rain in South America  which has delayed the harvest  So again  having a hit to demand and then I think you know the final thing is there was a lot of pre stocking of very low sulfur fuel oil that happened in the industry  And so  so far it s muted the impact that IMO will have  We certainly are confident that that demand will show up  but it may be more of a second quarter type demand increase than what we re seeing so far in the first quarter Sam Margolin    Wolfe Research    AnalystOkay  thanks  And my follow up is on renewable diesel  You know it s been said on this call already  the economics are really strong  it scales very accretively  On the feedstock side  are there any constraints as you imagine this business getting bigger  There was another operator in the business who recently pivoted a little bit on the feedstock side and said tightening was possible in the future  do you see any of that or is does the strength of your partnership with Diamond kind of help you avoid that friction Joe Gorder    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWell  definitely the strength of our partnership with Darling helps us  They process 10  of the world s meat byproducts  So we re in a unique position with the JV we have  This feedstock is tied to GDP growth per capita and that s growing in the world  So it s going to tighten up some  but we still feel good about being able to source and we don t see that as a constraint with what we have on what we ve talked about so far Sam Margolin    Wolfe Research    AnalystAll right  thanks so much  Thank you  Our next question comes from the line of Paul Chen from Scotiabank  Your line is now open Paul Chen    Scotiabank    AnalystHi  good morning guys Joe Gorder    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Paul Paul Chen    Scotiabank    AnalystI think that the first one is probably either for Lane or for Gary  You guys historically won the M100 I suppose that s directly for the crew unit  Have you test or whether that you will be  have the configuration to one  the high sulfur fuel directly through the coker and that if you do that    how big is that capacity you may be able to do  And also whether you have export any low sulfur VGO in the fourth quarter Lane Riggs    President and Chief Operating OfficerHey  Paul  This is Lane  I ll start and Gary can round you out  As you ve alluded to  we have a history of running M100  but not all M100s are created equal  there s varying qualities  We had what we would consider to be a quality window that we historically ran  We ve widened that  We do run that    we run those types of long resids  They ll obviously have a little bit of cutter stock in it and we typically run them in our crude supply and so as we raise the percentages of them  you think about  well  what we re doing is we re running those to fill to destroy the resid and obviously it makes    it builds out the bottom of the refinery and then we re running light sweet crude as a supplement to that because that s been an advantaged crude really for the past year  So it s really over time  we re optimizing by looking at all    the domestic light sweet with these resids opening the operating envelope for all the resids that we can find in the world and then we are constantly optimizing that versus the heavy sour crude availability and that s kind of how we always run  we ve just    we ve worked really hard to characterize some of these that are new to the market and are trying to run more of them  What was your second question Paul Chen    Scotiabank    AnalystNo  in the first one  have you export any low sulfur VGO Lane Riggs    President and Chief Operating OfficerRight  so our economic signals have been pull low sulfur VGO out of the cat crackers and we did sell quite a bit of it in the fourth quarter and so far in the first quarter  we re seeing the same economic signals Joe Gorder    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWell in addition to that we re    so  Paul  in addition to that  we re also exporting a lot of low sulfur ATV that we normally run in RTFCs as well Paul Chen    Scotiabank    AnalystWhat kind of economic and how much you have export  I mean  is that part of the reason why your margin has been perhaps better than people thought Joe Gorder    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes  I mean we were  we were export    we were selling those particularly low sulfur ATVs in some of the other hydroprocess resids quite a bit above what they historically have been worth Paul Chen    Scotiabank    AnalystYeah and is there a volume that you can share  Is it say 50 000 barrel per day  100 000 barrel per day  Any kind of rough number Joe Gorder    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerNo  we probably don t really want to share that Paul Chen    Scotiabank    AnalystFinal one  180 000 barrel per day of the WCS  Is there any more room that you would be able to expand that Gary Simmons    Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial OfficerYes  there is  So we have    you know  we primarily run the Canadian and Port Arthur in Texas City we can also take it to St  Charles and we have plenty of capacity to run more Canadian Paul Chen    Scotiabank    AnalystHow about supply  can you get it there Lane Riggs    President and Chief Operating OfficerYes we can  So today  a lot of the problem is certainly pipelines coming out of Western Canada are full but we buy up the pipeline and we also continue to take volume by rail  So I think in the fourth quarter  we did a little below 38 000 barrels a day of heavy Canadian by rail  We re seeing those volumes ramp up in the first quarter and expect them to ramp up even more in the second quarter Paul Chen    Scotiabank    AnalystPerfect  Thank you Joe Gorder    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Paul OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs  Your line is now open Neil Mehta    Goldman Sachs    AnalystGood morning and let me add my congrats to Lane and Gary here on the promotion  I guess my first question is  we ve spent a lot more time than we ever have with investors on the issue of sustainability and carbon intensity and it s really the E side of the ESG and Joe maybe you could just talk high level how you think about Valero s framework for talking to investors about ESG and carbon intensity  Do you feel like you are there where you want to be on carbon target and disclosures and then I would think the renewable diesel business becomes a big part of the narrative as to how you can respond to any questions that might emerge around that Joe Gorder    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  no  Neil  that s a really good question and you are right  we do spend a lot of time on this  and frankly I think Valero has got a great story  Jason is responsible  He and John are jointly responsible for our efforts around this and we ve made a lot of progress  So I want to let those two guys speak to this in some detail Jason Fraser    Executive Vice President and General CounselYes  this is Jason  Neil  I ll be glad to talk to you a little bit about it and as you    the points you made about strategy is of course correct  Two of our three segments are now renewable  We re the largest renewable diesel producer in the U S  through DGD  second largest producer of ethanol and we continue to look at that area and expand it as we ve discussed and we re also looking at other low carbon fuels and ways to lower our carbon intensity in our existing business  So just as a business footprint  I think we ve been evolving as the market expectations have changed  I think we ve done a good job on that side  And on the environment side  we re very mindful about environmental impact  We ve always been proud of our record  In 2019  we had our best ever performance on environmental scorecard events  It s the lowest number we ve ever had and safety has always been a big focus of ours  In 2019  our refining employee injury rate was our best ever and the combined employee contractor rate was our second lowest in company history  We think we have a good governance structure  10 of our 11 directors are independent  We have substantial diversity  It s something we re always working on  We have really good risk oversight  risk management within our governance structure  And then on the disclosure area  which is one of the things you asked about  We ve definitely beefed it up here in the last couple of years as we put more focus in the ES G area  In September of 2018  we published our report on climate related risks and opportunities and we prepared that in alignment with the TCFD recommendations  which seems to be more and more    our investors seem to be coalescing around that as being the standard they want  There are a lot of competing regimes out there  So it s good to see some standardization kind of come into play and we also put out a stewardship and responsibility report annually where we talk about    some about the carbon stuff  but also about other sustainability oriented areas and we re continuing to work on that every year and try to make it better and I know there has been some large investors focusing on safety  Phonetic  as being maybe the standard and once again outside of carbon  there has been a lot of variability and different disclosure structures on what people they want  So we re taking a hard look at safety  Phonetic  this year and comparing to what we re doing to see if we would need to tweak some things there  We re always looking to improve Neil Mehta    Goldman Sachs    AnalystI appreciate it  And as a follow up question actually relates to RINs which I know it s collectively our least favorite topic  but there were some headlines recently around a court case around RINs injections and a small waiver  The waiver is for some of the smaller refiners from couple of years ago  Do you see any risk that this becomes an issue that could put upward price pressure on RINs again Jason Fraser    Executive Vice President and General CounselOkay  yeah  this is Jason again  we did see that 10th Circuit case out of Denver last week and what it did was vacated SREs for three refineries  two of HollyFrontier s and one of CVRs and the EPA has several options including appeal  Expect they probably will appeal like neither appeal and have the 10th Circuit hear the case as a whole or go straight to the Supreme Court and we know they re evaluating their options to see  The court took a reading of the statute a fairly constrained view that as far as I know has been done by a court in the past  but it is definitely not in keeping with the view the EPA has had  the way they have interpreted this statute in the past  So we really have to see what the EPA does when it gets an idea of how impactful this is  One important point is  because it was at the 10th Circuit instead of the DC Circuit  which is a decision the plaintiffs made and when they filed it  it only has legal effect within the 10th Circuit  So it only binds the EPA within those six states that are covered by the 10th Circuit  So let s see how it evolves Joe Gorder    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  we ll see how it plays out  I think it s probably too early to give a market signal on RINs prices as a result of this case really Neil Mehta    Goldman Sachs    AnalystGreat guys  thank you OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from the line of Theresa Chen from Barclays  Your line is now open Theresa Chen    Barclays    AnalystGood morning  Joe  I d like to touch on your comments earlier about permanent types of Gulf Coast and narrowing of inland and as far as developments at Corpus Christi goes there has been continued discussion on potential dock constraints in the area and based on one of your competitors  releases yesterday  it seems that one of the bigger dock projects may be delayed a bit  What is your current outlook on the possibility that we might have a glut of crude at Corpus  which I m sure would benefit your facilities there and if there are indeed dock constraints  would this effect MEH first since there is no public Corpus price and then affect Midland if things really get backed up or how should we think about that Joe Gorder    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes  Theresa  that s a good question  Gary is close to this  Let s let him talk about it for a minute Gary Simmons    Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial OfficerYes  so we are  when we look at this  it looks like there that there will be plenty of dock capacity available  but there is some periods of time where it could get very tight and so our focus really has been to make sure that we re connected to all of these lines coming out of the Permian and we can take barrels to Corpus or Three Rivers and then we ve also put effort into expanding our dock capacity from our Corpus Christi refinery  So part of that project is completed  By early second quarter  we ll have that project 100  completed and essentially double our export capacity that we ll be able to put through our system  The second part of your question  yes  I would expect it to really affect the MEH posting first and then  yes  it will probably work its way back into the Permian as time goes on Theresa Chen    Barclays    AnalystGot it and switching gears a bit  so the natural gas pricing outlook seems pretty depressed  Can you talk about how much of a tailwind this could be for your business this year Lane Riggs    President and Chief Operating OfficerWell  it is Lane  So obviously energy is a big part of the cost structure in our business and it s been depressed for a while  So it obviously it works not only to our advantage  but really the industry s advantage to compete in the world  I mean natural gas is how we run these refineries largely and it s a big advantage for the U S  refining in general Joe Gorder    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  really all industrial activity Theresa Chen    Barclays    AnalystThank you very much OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from the line of Benny Wong from Morgan Stanley  Your line is now open Benny Wong    Morgan Stanley    AnalystHey  good morning guys  Thanks for taking my question  I just kind of want to follow up on Paul s question around the Canadian barrels  There is more talk up North about building diluent recovery units  Just wanted to get your perspective on that if that s kind of a viable path for more Canadian barrels to reach the U S  Gulf Coast  And just curious have you kind of tested any of these unblended bitumen in your facilities and if they are really the more desirable type of feedstock that s what s being toted as Gary Simmons    Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial OfficerYes  So  this is Gary  And yes  we took bitumen directly from Western Canada and ran it at our refinery at St  Charles and have ongoing discussions with several producers  You can just move a lot more by rail if you take the undiluted barrel and it would fit well into our system and we have plenty of capacity to be able to run it Benny Wong    Morgan Stanley    AnalystThanks  Gary  Appreciate that  And my follow up is more on the RFS program and maybe Jason can chime in on this is  there seems to be more focus in DC about what that program will look like after it sunsets in 2020 and it seems like the thought of setting a higher octane gasoline standard is alive again  Just wanted to get your thoughts on that and if there is really a path for it this time or    and I guess how you think about that program beyond 2022  Thanks Jason Fraser    Executive Vice President and General CounselSure  yeah and this is Jason and you re right gives us tables that set the volumes expire in 2020 and the program falls back in the hands of the EPA to set the volumes using certain standards as guides and it s still open  They hadn t signaled a lot about what they re going to do  but we would like the higher octane fuels to be part of the solution  We think that s a great answer  it s great for the autos  It enables them to meet their CAFE  its great for us  it keeps the internal combustion engine more viable in this lower carbon world and more vibrant competitor and it is great for the ethanol guys because there is a good choice of low cost octane  So really it s a win win win solution that we would like to see get traction and we definitely are talking it up  We think it s a great solution for the country Benny Wong    Morgan Stanley    AnalystGreat  thanks guys Joe Gorder    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Benny OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo  Your line is now open Roger Read    Wells Fargo    AnalystHi thanks  good morning everybody Joe Gorder    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerHey Roger  good morning Roger Read    Wells Fargo    AnalystA lot of the good stuff has already been hit here  but maybe just to dig in a little bit more on sort of the  let s call it the North American performance versus the global performance  You ve mentioned some benefits from naphtha  some benefits from natural gas and from butane  but there were also in the last couple of months issues with tanker rates and things like that  So as those events  let s call it normalize or in this business where everybody takes advantage of them pretty quickly  we arb away those advantages  What looks more sustainable for you here in the next few months versus what looks transitory  not just worried so much  you re thinking  hey  we re going to go to summer grade gasoline  which has its own benefits  Just curious there what you re seeing Gary Simmons    Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial OfficerYeah  So I think overall  you know  as long as the U S  production is having to clear to the export markets despite where freight rates go  we ll see good advantage running domestic light sweet crude at many of our assets  We also see that running the heavy sour and the high sulfur fuel blend stocks into our high complexity assets looks to be very favorable for the foreseeable future as well as a result of the IMO bunker spec change  Outside of that  I don t know what else I would add Lane Riggs    President and Chief Operating OfficerRoger  I want add    this is Lane  I ll just add one thing  What you re really seeing is as we alluded to  we are marketing low sulfur VGO and low sulfur ATV into the low sulfur fuel oil market and what that does is that really is constructive for SEC    for gasoline because SEC is going to be cut and we prefer    talked about it over the past  really for the last two years when we were talking about IMO and that part of it is certainly playing out  I mean  you will see as the gasoline season rolls in  you ll get and essentially that market is going to have to compete for feed that s into the gasoline market  So it should be supportive of both really sort of both gasoline and diesel Roger Read    Wells Fargo    AnalystOkay  that s helpful  And then maybe back to Theresa s question about natural gas  Obviously  cash opex guidance up over 4  Phonetic  is kind of higher than what we ve seen over the last few years  and I know there has been some changes in the consolidation of VLP and all that  but I m just curious  is that something that can be a help on the opex side that we should see or there other things moving around here that are going to keep opex on the upper end Lane Riggs    President and Chief Operating OfficerSo  hey Roger  If you look    this is Lane again  So if you compare our guidance to last basically fourth    third quarter  20 to first quarter  19  it is pretty much flat  That s sort of our large turnaround time frame and so I would just sort of say it s flat year over year  but when you look at to the longer term  certainly we ve had realignment reporting structures  We ve moved the renewable    the Diamond Green Diesel out and we ve taken all of the MLP stuff  which would have been in our sort of cost of goods and it came into our opex and so as we realigned all that stuff  it sort of resulted in a little bit in terms of our opex  a little bit higher and then overall  there are obviously there are some inflationary pressures in the world when    again when you compare our overall cash opex performance on a sort of what we would call a follow on  Phonetic  basis  we are by far in the first quarter  so which means we are the pace setters in the industry when it comes to costs Roger Read    Wells Fargo    AnalystWell  that pretty well answers it  Thanks guys OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from the line of Brad Heffern from RBC  Your line is now open Brad Heffern    RBC    AnalystHi everyone  a question maybe for Lane on throughput  So this quarter  there was almost 1 7 million barrels a day as we    I think you guys have quoted the capacity historically as more like 1 6 million barrels a day  So is there something that s changed  is that something that running the resid is allowing you to do and then how should we think about that going forward with some of the diffs  like Mia widening out Joe Gorder    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo what you re    and I kind of touched on it a little bit earlier  as we re running more and more resid  the resid doesn t really have that much light in components  So as it substitutes and sort of moves out either heavy really the real thing that we re backing out if you look at year over year is medium sour  So what s happening is we re running more and more light sweet which and that s what that s doing is it s sort of it s substituting for medium sour which does have some light into it  So that s a journey we re on  we ve been signaling Max light sweet crude and Max heavy and we optimize between heavy sour crudes and resid and so I don t know that we can go a whole lot higher  but we ll just see quarter to quarter and see how much higher we can go Brad Heffern    RBC    AnalystOkay  thanks for that  And then  Joe  in your prepared comments you were talking about sort of the different things competing for capital and you mentioned M A as you have in the past  I know you haven t done a whole bunch recently  you ve done some ethanol deals  there was the terminals acquisition  I guess  can you just put any meat on that in terms of what you would potentially be interested in on the M A front Joe Gorder    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Why don t we let Rich  talk about that Rich Lashway    Senior Vice President Corporate Development and Midstream OperationsSure  this is Rich  hey Brad  So yeah  we continue to look at the opportunities as they arise  A lot of this stuff tends to be in niche markets and we re focused on the Gulf Coast and just haven t seen a lot of things arise there  that s where we would capture the synergies and where we would have the advantage  So I mean we look at everything as it comes up  but we don t see any opportunities that compete against the pipeline of organic projects that we have Joe Gorder    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Speech Overlap  Yeah  that s right Brad Heffern    RBC    AnalystOkay  appreciate it OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gabelman from Cowen  Your line is now open Jason Gabelman    Cowen    AnalystYeah  hey guys  good morning  I d like to ask a question about the ethanol and renewable diesel segment  it looks like the indicators have fallen quite a bit from 4Q to year to date  And I m just wondering what s going on in those twp markets and how you see that evolving throughout the course of the year and I have a follow up  thanks Martin Parrish    Senior Vice President Alternative FuelsOkay  this is Martin  On the renewable diesel  the indicator drops because the    you have the blender s tax credit in place now  So we gave up a little bit on the ran  feedstock cost got a little higher  but you need to add  1 a gallon to that indicator to get fairly where market is  So again we re 126  Phonetic  pro forma  but that s really  226  Phonetic  EBITDA per gallon  So that one is not concerning at all  Fourth quarter ethanol was  0 14 a gallon EBITDA was our performance  That s come in and you re correct there  January is always tough in the business  I mean domestic gasoline demand is low  ethanol inventories always build in January  Really what s happened in the ethanol space we ve been oversupplied in the U S  for several years  Exports were growing at 30  CAGR up through  18  In  19  they took a breather and that was really due to low sugar prices in the world  So Brazil made more ethanol  Right now though  sugar prices are up 20  versus where they averaged 2019 at  Export demand is strong  We re seeing really good numbers in December  January  February and March  So we still    ethanol is in the fuel mix to stay in the U S   a little bit of incremental E15 and then hopefully this higher octane standard would really help the industry obviously  So we re still optimistic about the future Jason Gabelman    Cowen    AnalystThanks  I appreciate those thoughts  And then if I could just go back to running resid high sulfur fuel oil  Can you just put some numbers around or discuss how much of those intermediates you re running and backing out crude as a result and how much of that is incremental feedstocks and in addition to that  are there any type of indicative economics that you could give on running those barrels  I understand there is a lot of moving parts  but are we talking low single digit dollar per barrel  high single digit dollar per barrel  in the double digit range just to give us a sense of what the uptick is  Thanks Lane Riggs    President and Chief Operating OfficerHey  so this is Lane  We re not going to share our detailed volumes in terms of how we do all that and obviously the relative margins are all a function of what the market is  They re not fixed off one another  There is a dynamic market out there that s a function of the crude market  the high sulfur fuel oil market  the low sulfur fuel oil market  the latter two of which are still trying to sort themselves out with respect to IMO 2020  So these things vary just like any other feedstock that we run  There is not a guaranteed margin relative to one another and they re and as all the refining capacity looks at all this and optimizes and if they    the margins are going to be different over time  So there s nothing that is    there is not anything we could communicate that you can hang your hat on per se Jason Gabelman    Cowen    AnalystOkay  thanks OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Blair from Tudor  Pickering  and Holt  Your line is now open Matthew Blair    Tudor  Pickering  Holt   Co     AnalystHey  good morning everyone  I wanted to check in on asphalt and pet coke  I know it s only about 3  of your product slate but how has pricing and realizations fared on these areas just given all the volatility on high sulfur fuel oil in the recent weakness Gary Simmons    Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial OfficerYeah  so this is Gary  I think overall we ve been surprised that asphalt margins has stayed relatively strong  We thought that there may be an attempt to push a lot of these high sulfur resids into the asphalt market and you would see weakness  but thus far asphalt margins in our system have remained strong and I wouldn t say we ve seen much of an impact at all on pet coke Matthew Blair    Tudor  Pickering  Holt   Co     AnalystSounds good  And then the sales volumes in renewable diesel were quite strong in the fourth quarter  Just wanted to confirm  was that a result of selling down some inventory or is it the plan to actually run at those levels Gary Simmons    Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial OfficerWe ran at those levels Matthew Blair    Tudor  Pickering  Holt   Co     AnalystOkay  thank you very much OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from the line of Chris Sighinolfi from Jefferies  Your line is now open Christopher Sighinolfi    Jefferies    AnalystHi  Joe  everyone  thanks for taking my question Joe Gorder    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerHi Chris Christopher Sighinolfi    Jefferies    AnalystI just wanted to follow up on Niel s earlier sustainability question if I could and I just have two quick questions  I guess  first  Joe  have you looked at CCUS investments to capture incremental carbon off the facilities  I know some of your integrated peers are working on that specifically on ethanol facilities to use in some of their EOR operations  So I m just wondering if it s something you ve looked at what the opportunity set might be Joe Gorder    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWe are looking at it  yes and Martin and Rich  they got a team put together and we re kind of down the road on this  I think you know  I guess the real question that we re trying to    you always are wondering about is what s the cost of carbon going to be  what are the economics going to look like on an investment for    in a project like this  So we are looking at it though Christopher Sighinolfi    Jefferies    AnalystOkay and then I guess second in light of the BTC extension  DGD JV has clearly become more valuable  As noted  it s a key pillar in your environment  both sustainability story  which is clearly set apart from your refining peers  but I m just curious  do you think you get appropriate credit for that and the ethanol franchise within Valero and I guess what are any thoughts or internal evaluation about if or when those businesses might make more sense being independent Joe Gorder    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  well  those are two very different questions  one is do we think it matters from an ES G perspective and I think it definitely does  We have a very clear view of what    where things are going and what the world s demanding now and we really believe renewable fuel is a key component of that and the good news is that they both happen to be great businesses and we got great assets and good teams running them  So I think as time goes on  people will see that Valero is somewhat differentiated perhaps from others out there because of these investments  As far as separating them off  my view is they are producers of motor fuels and different types of motor fuels is very low carbon intensity motor fuels  but their motor fuels and Valero produces motor fuels

178259,399775,VLO,Ten U S  refineries emitted excessive cancer causing benzene in 2019  report,news," Reuters    Ten U S  oil refineries  including six in Texas  released the cancer causing chemical benzene in concentrations that exceeded federal limits last year  according to government data published by the green group Environmental Integrity Project on Thursday 
The study is based on the first full year of data reported by U S  refineries since a U S  Environmental Protection Agency rule was implemented in 2018  The rule requires continuous monitoring of air pollutants around plants to protect nearby communities  many of which are disproportionately poor  black and Hispanic 
 These results highlight refineries that need to do a better job of installing pollution controls and implementing safer workplace practices   EIP Executive Director Eric Schaeffer said in a statement   Now  EPA needs to enforce these rules  
EPA officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment 
Long term exposure to benzene can cause blood disorders and leukemia  according to the agency 
Monitoring for benzene is meant to be a tool that allows for  early detection of potential problems   said Ericka Perryman  a spokeswoman for the American Fuel   Petrochemical Manufacturers trade group  in a statement 
But the EPA s data  is not intended as a measure of community exposure or health risk and could inadvertently provide misleading results to the public   she added 
According to the report  benzene levels consistently exceeded the EPA standard of 9 micrograms per cubic meter of air at the fencelines of 10 of the more than 100 refineries examined by EIP  The EPA requires facilities that exceed that threshold to take corrective action  the report said 
Philadelphia Energy Solutions  refinery in Philadelphia recorded the highest benzene concentrations  at nearly five times the EPA standard  the data show  HollyFrontier Corp s  N HFC  Navajo Artesia plant in New Mexico followed  with more than three times the federal standard 
Philadelphia Energy shut that refinery and filed for bankruptcy in July after a fire destroyed part of the plant 
Texas was the hardest hit state  with six refineries exceeding the federal benzene standard  the report said  These are  Total  SA s  PA TOTF  Port Arthur refinery   Chevron  Corp s  N CVX  Pasadena Refinery  Flint Hills Resources  Corpus Christi East refinery   Valero Energy  Corp s  N VLO  Corpus Christi East  Royal Dutch Shell Plc s  L RDSa  Deer Park and  Marathon Oil  Corp s  N MRO  Galveston Bay Texas refinery 
Two other refineries listed are Chevron s Pascagoula in Mississippi and PBF Energy Inc s  N PBF  Chalmette Refining in Louisiana 
In a statement  Chevron said it had taken steps to improve performance and added that its Pascacoula and Pasadena refineries were in compliance with EPA requirements 
Marathon spokesman Jamal Kheiry said in an emailed statement that a relief valve at its refinery s dock was the source of a benzene release in March 2019  The company took steps to fix the problem  he said 
 We are committed to comply with EPA rules   Total spokeswoman Marie Maitre said in an email   Our refinery employees live and have families in this community and the Total Port Arthur Refinery works hard at being a good neighbor  
Flint Hills spokesman Andy Saenz said the EPA s fenceline monitoring program  is not an accurate measurement of ambient air conditions in a community   He said benzene levels in Corpus Christi were  much lower than this report would suggest and well within public health standards  
Owners of the other refineries did not immediately comment on the report ",2020-02-06,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/ten-us-refineries-emitted-excessive-cancercausing-benzene-in-2019-report-2077520,2077520
178260,399776,VLO,U S  renewable fuel credits double since court decision on refinery waivers,news,"By Stephanie Kelly
NEW YORK  Reuters    U S  renewable fuel prices have doubled since a U S  appeals court in late January ruled that the Trump administration must reconsider three waivers it previously handed out to oil refineries that exempted them from biofuel blending laws 
Renewable fuel  D6  credits  for 2019 are trading at around 19 cents each  up from nine cents before the court s Jan  24 court decision  traders said  Refiners including Phillips 66  N PSX  and  Valero Energy  Corp  N VLO  have actively bought in the market  two traders said 
Prices have steadily risen because the court decision raises the possibility of fewer small refinery waivers going forward  creating higher demand for the credits  traders said 
Under the U S  Renewable Fuel Standard  the nation s oil refineries are required to blend billions of gallons of biofuels such as ethanol into the nation s fuel pool  or buy credits known as RINs from those that do  But the EPA can waive refiners  obligations if they prove compliance would cause them financial distress 
The Environmental Protection Agency under President Donald Trump has roughly quadrupled the number of waivers handed out to small refiners  angering the biofuel industry  which claims the exemptions hurt demand for corn based ethanol  The oil industry rebuts that and says the obligations are too pricey 
According to the court s decision  the EPA overstepped its authority to grant waivers in the past for HollyFrontier s  N HFC  Woods Cross and Cheyenne refiners and CVR Energy s  N CVI  Wynnewood refinery because the refineries had not received exemptions in the previous year 
Market participants are awaiting clarity on how the EPA will address the court s ruling  The court vacated the EPA orders granting the exemptions to the three refineries and sent the issue back to the EPA for further action 
Biomass based  D4  credits  for 2019 have also risen since the ruling  to 55 cents each from 45 cents each  traders said ",2020-02-07,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/us-renewable-fuel-credits-double-since-court-decision-on-refinery-waivers-2079589,2079589

178289,399805,VLO,Anadarko Board Faces Scrutiny Amid  38 Billion Bidding War,news," Bloomberg     Anadarko Petroleum Corp  NYSE APC   s market value has soared 56 percent since a bidding war for the American shale driller kicked off two weeks ago  Yet the company s directors have managed to step on the toes of almost every player involved 
Anadarko reopened talks with Occidental Petroleum Corp  NYSE OXY   on Monday after the board sided with investors who said the  38 billion offer was likely better than the agreed upon deal with  Chevron  Corp   NYSE CVX  Though Occidental s been making a run at Anadarko for more than a year  Chevron s pursuit began in earnest just a few months ago  If Anadarko officially deems Occidental s bid  superior   Chevron will be forced to sweeten its offer or drop out altogether 
In a letter published April 24  Occidental Chief Executive Officer Vicki Hollub criticized Anadarko for agreeing to the Chevron deal s  1 billion breakup fee  without even picking up the phone to speak to us  about two separate proposals the same week that were at a  significantly higher value  
 It is messy  They jumped on the Chevron offer  leaving this one mystifyingly unaddressed   said Craig Pirrong  director of the Global Energy Management Institute at the University of Houston   The board should have been happy to have multiple bidders rather than stiffing one and focusing exclusively on the other  
Shareholders haven t been quiet about their frustration  either  Investors including Janus Henderson and Miller Howard Investments Inc  said in interviews that they didn t understand why Anadarko would sign with Chevron when a higher offer was available 
New York based D E  Shaw urged Anadarko to open up its sale process  people familiar with the matter said last week 
Anadarko did not immediately respond to a request for comment  In an earlier statement  the company said Occidental s most recent bid reflected a  significant improvement  compared to previous offers 
Anadarko s board has a few heavyweights     Valero Energy  Corp  NYSE VLO   CEO Joe Gorder  former Perella Weinberg Partners Capital Management LP CFO Alexandra Garbers Pruner and David Constable  ex CEO of Sasol Ltd  But otherwise  the 13 member board lacks major figures from the oil and gas world 
Directors  pay  though higher than the S P 500 average  is largely in line with Chevron and Occidental  according to data compiled by Bloomberg 
Still  Anadarko s directors faced scrutiny even before Occidental announced its offer  after they sweetened executive pay packages the day before the Chevron deal was announced  The tweaks eliminated a provision that would have reduced CEO Al Walker s potential payout because he hasn t yet reached age 65 and included a vow to cover excise taxes on golden parachutes 
Walker  62  also serves as the chairman of the board ",2019-04-30,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/anadarko-board-faces-scrutiny-amid-38-billion-bidding-war-1850342,1850342

WASHINGTON  Reuters    Five Republican senators are warning President Donald Trump s new pick to run the Environmental Protection Agency  Andrew Wheeler  that their support for his nomination may hinge on his biofuels policy 
The senators  all from states hosting oil refineries  said they want to be assured that Wheeler would work to reduce the regulatory costs for oil companies of complying with the U S  Renewable Fuel Standard before they decide on whether to back him as permanent chief of the EPA 
The Renewable Fuel Standard requires oil refiners to blend increasing amounts of biofuels like corn based ethanol into their fuel each year  or purchase blending credits from those who do  The measure is intended to help farmers and reduce U S  dependence on foreign energy sources  but oil refining companies   like  Valero Energy  Corp  NYSE VLO  and billionaire investor Carl Icahn s CVR Energy Inc   complain it costs them a fortune 
 Without an adequate proposal to meaningfully lower the regulatory burden     we will have serious concerns with your nomination   the five Republican senators said in a letter to Wheeler dated Feb  11 
The letter was signed by Ted Cruz of Texas  Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania  Michael Lee of Utah  as well as both John Kennedy and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana 
The five were due to meet with Wheeler later on Wednesday night to discuss biofuels  according to two sources familiar with the matter 
The EPA is working on a number of critical adjustments to its biofuel policy that are of interest to the oil industry  including resetting targets for annual biofuels blending volumes  lifting a summertime ban on higher ethanol blends of gasoline  and proposing measures to limit speculation in the blending credit market 
In their letter  the senators asked Wheeler to provide his views on these and other issues before Feb  22 
Wheeler  a longtime Washington insider and former coal lobbyist  took the reins at EPA on an interim basis in July after his predecessor  Scott Pruitt  resigned in a storm of controversy over his high spending on first class travel  round the clock security  and office equipment

their gasoline and diesel each year or buy credits from those that do   The corn industry is constantly pushing for targets to go up to ensure a robust market for growers  while the oil industry wants them to decline because biofuels compete with petroleum and compliance costs them money  Wheeler rejected a staff proposal presented in December that suggested the amount of ethanol that must be blended into the nation s fuel could be cut from the current level of 15 billion gallons annually to as low as 14 3 billion over the final three years of the RFS program ending in 2022  a figure that had been sought by the oil industry  according to two of the sources  EPA staff made the proposal in the form of a range of 14 3 billion to 15 billion  the two sources said  Wheeler  who has been running the agency on an interim basis since his predecessor Scott Pruitt resigned in July  dismissed the proposal saying the 14 3 billion gallons at the bottom of the range was too low and would guarantee outrage from corn state lawmakers  one of the sources briefed on the matter said  A second source familiar with the matter said Wheeler had rejected the 14 3 billion number because it was not clear if agency staff had considered the potential impact of a soon to be published EPA proposal to lift a summer ban on sales of higher ethanol blends of gasoline called E15  which could boost the market for the corn based fuel  Asked about the exchange  the EPA s assistant administrator for the Office of Air and Radiation  Bill Wehrum  last week said   We ve talked to Wheeler about what we should do in the reset but no final decisions have been made   He added the work on the reset continued  EPA spokesman Michael Abboud said on Friday   EPA is still developing options regarding a reset proposal  and no final decisions have been made    Five Republican senators from oil states  led by Ted Cruz of Texas  sent a letter to Wheeler dated Feb  11 asking him about his biofuels policies  and saying their support for his confirmation could hinge on his responses   Trump nominated Wheeler in January but he still faces a senate vote  likely to take place at the end of February   Two sources told Reuters the senators were particularly concerned about Wheeler s rejection of the initial staff proposal on biofuel volume targets   Officials from the senators  offices did not respond to requests for comment explaining their concerns  WAIVERS  MEETINGS The senators were also concerned that Wheeler had signaled in several recent meetings the agency could issue fewer exemptions to the nation s biofuel laws to small refineries than under Pruitt  according to the sources  Pruitt s expanded use of the waivers  which are intended for small refining operations under financial strain  angered farmers and their legislative backers by exempting some 2 25 billion gallons of ethanol from the U S  mandates  But it also saved the oil industry hundreds of millions of dollars by driving down the cost of compliance credits    One justification Wheeler could use for providing fewer waivers is that the lower credit prices have reduced the financial burden on refiners  But in recent weeks  refiners like  Valero Energy  Corp  NYSE VLO  and HollyFrontier have been buying more of them than usual  three brokers told Reuters  a sign that they expect a rebound  In their letter to Wheeler  the senators asked him if he would continue providing waivers  fully in accordance with the statute and case law   The senators have also been worried by Wheeler s meetings with biofuel trade groups and corn state senators  according to one of the sources briefed by the senators  staff   A Reuters analysis of Wheeler s public schedule shows he has met regularly with representatives of both sides of the debate  but has held several more meetings with corn backers than refining industry supporters since taking over in July  EPA spokesman Michael Abboud has said that Wheeler  is happy to meet with those who actually request meetings

178315,399831,VLO,Half Billion Dollars of Sanction Stained Oil Sits Off Venezuela,news," Bloomberg     Venezuela is running out of space to store its sanction stained crude that few dare to buy  forcing it to reduce output at a time when the world is thirsty for heavy  sulfurous oil 
Tankers holding 8 36 million barrels of Venezuelan crude worth upwards of a half billion dollars are floating off the country s coast as the nation struggles to find buyers for its oil following new U S  sanctions in January  An armada of 16 ships holds cargoes belonging to state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela SA   Chevron  Corp   NYSE CVX    Valero Energy  Corp  NYSE VLO   and Rosneft Oil Co PJSC  according to shipping reports and ship tracking data compiled by Bloomberg 
Oil ventures owned by PDVSA with Rosneft  Chevron   Total  SA  PA TOTF  and Equinor ASA  whose upgraders convert tar like Venezuelan crude into oil that refineries can process  reduced rates this week because they ran out of space to store crude  according to people with knowledge of situation  With few buyers willing to take PDVSA s oil  the alternative was to put some of that oil onto tankers to clear space and continue to operate at lower rates 
The backlog of ships and growing difficulty in keeping its oil upgraders running underscore the impact U S  sanctions are having on PDVSA  Shipments to the America  once Venezuela s largest customer  have dried up  Without access to the U S  financial system  on which many refiners and trading houses rely on to finance purchases  PDVSA is having trouble finding buyers outside of countries such as India and China  to whom it owes oil in payment for past loans 
The PDVSA Rosneft joint venture Petromonagas upgrader isn t processing oil after running out of space to store their production  a person with knowledge of the situation said  PDVSA Chevron s Petropiar venture has reduced output for the same reason  other people said  Petrocedeno  a PDVSA Total Equinor venture  is running out of oil to process as a ban on sales of heavy naphtha to PDVSA has made it difficult to ship the heavy oil through pipelines from inland fields to the upgrader  another person said 
While Venezuela has been having a hard time selling its oil  the rest of the world struggles to find heavy barrels after Canada s self imposed oil curtailment and OPEC supply cuts reduced the availability of the type of oil Venezuela produces 
The tightness in heavy oil supply translated into higher prices for Colombia s flagship oil Castilla  which competes with Venezuelan oil in the global market  Castilla for loading in March traded  4 per barrel less than global benchmark Brent  according to people with knowledge of situation  That compares with a discount of  9 80 for cargoes that loaded in February ",2019-02-25,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/halfbillion-dollars-of-sanctionstained-oil-sits-off-venezuela-1790124,1790124
178318,399834,VLO,Exclusive  Citgo  Valero try to return Venezuelan oil following sanctions  document,news,"By Marianna Parraga  Reuters    The top U S  buyers of Venezuelan oil are in the unusual position of trying to return millions of barrels of crude they need but cannot accept because of U S  sanctions on the South American nation and its state run energy firm PDVSA  PDVSA s U S  refining subsidiary Citgo Petroleum Corp and  Valero Energy   NYSE VLO  are proposing to return 2 million barrels of crude loaded before sanctions  while a third U S  oil company   Chevron  Corp  NYSE CVX   has sought so far unsuccessfully to legally pay for 4 3 million barrels  according to an internal PDVSA document seen by Reuters   In effect  more than 6 million barrels of Venezuelan crude remain in limbo as a result of U S  sanctions imposed on Jan  28 by Washington in an effort to oust President Nicolas Maduro  The United States and dozens of other nations recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido as the nation s legitimate leader   To comply with U S  sanctions  Valero  Citgo and others are not allowed to pay PDVSA  Guaido s administration has yet to establish its own bank accounts to receive proceeds from oil sales to U S  customers  leaving those shipments stranded  Overall oil exports from the OPEC member state dropped by about 40 percent in the first full month of sanctions  as the U S  sought to cut oil revenue to Maduro  who presides over a nation beset by a years long economic crisis  with millions fleeing for a lack of food and medicine  PDVSA  Citgo and Valero did not reply to requests for comment  Chevron does not comment on supply and trade matters  a spokesman said   STRANDED TANKERS  The standoff has stranded some 6 4 million barrels of Venezuelan heavy crude onboard 11 tankers originally destined for the United States  as they have not been authorized to set sail  The vessels fell into limbo because PDVSA demanded prepayment for the cargos after sanctions were imposed  which U S  firms cannot do  Chevron  the second largest U S  oil firm by market value  wanted to take the oil shipments in lieu of loans and dividends stemming from joint ventures with PDVSA  a person close to the matter said  The cargoes were loaded at Venezuelan ports ahead of sanctions  but they remain undelivered  according to the document  and it is unclear if PDVSA would accept that offer   Valero proposed to pay PDVSA for 1 05 million barrels of Venezuelan oil  but that request was rejected by the U S  Office of Foreign Assets Control  OFAC   which oversees sanctions  the documents said   The Houston based Citgo cut ties with its parent company in compliance with U S  measures that halted its purchases of PDVSA s oil  the documents said  A U S  Treasury spokesperson declined to comment on the requests to pay PDVSA for the cargoes   As of March 8  the 11 loaded vessels remained anchored off ports in Venezuela  Two other Chevron chartered cargoes were stuck off the U S  Gulf Coast and a third was returned to Venezuela s Amuay terminal  according to Refinitiv Eikon vessel tracking data  PDVSA does not expect Citgo or Valero to accept the cargos and intends to  commercially reallocate the volumes onboard so tankers can be freed   a Feb  21 trade and supply document showed  The same document expressed worry over demurrage fees   the daily cost for storing the oil on tankers   which have been accumulating for over a month  PDVSA SCRAMBLES TO AVOID EXPORT SHORTFALL Separately  a days long blackout across the country has halted exports from Jose port  the nation s primary crude export terminal  PDVSA on Monday was trying to restart operations  The Venezuelan company has been forced to redesign its production and export logistics in recent weeks to avoid halting operations  including formulating new crude blends  swapping a large portion of its oil for imported fuel  selling through intermediaries and finding new customers  But the efforts have not been enough to avoid an export decline  The OPEC member country s oil shipments fell to some 920 000 barrels per day  bpd  in February according to Refinitiv Eikon data  PDVSA exports could fall further due to a lack of imported naphtha  a light distillate  needed to dilute its extra heavy oil as the company has been able to secure only two 500 000 barrel cargoes versus 2 3 million barrels per month needed  according to the document  If it cannot import enough naphtha to formulate its oil for export  PDVSA plans to start mixing other domestic fuels to ready oil for export  Lack of maritime crews to take PDVSA tankers idled due to unpaid shipping fees is also hampering oil deliveries between domestic ports and to the Caribbean  where PDVSA stores and ships much of its export barrels  Some shipping firms  reluctance to work in Venezuela after sanctions have stopped PDVSA from using leased tankers to ease storage bottlenecks at its Orinoco Belt s joint ventures  The ones willing to work with PDVSA are charging high prices and extra fees  the document added  On March 4  PDVSA completely shut output at its Corocoro oilfield  which was producing some 12 000 bpd  due to lack of storage capacity  Its Pedernales oilfield could follow due to similar issues  according to the report  The four Orinoco upgraders were working at minimum on Monday   GRAPHIC  Venezuelan crude

178320,399836,VLO,EPA Biofuel Trading Plan Would Hurt Banks  Buffett Truck Stops,news," Bloomberg     A Trump administration plan to impose trading restrictions on biofuel credits would slash revenue for big oil companies and truck stops like those owned by Warren Buffett  while forcing Wall Street banks out of the market 
The draft proposal  now being reviewed by White House officials and set to be formally released by the Environmental Protection Agency as soon as this week  aims to quell wild price swings in credits that refiners use to prove they have satisfied annual government mandated blending quotas for biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel 
The plan was described by four people familiar with the document who asked not to be named discussing administration strategy  EPA spokesman John Konkus said the agency does  not comment on items under interagency review  
President Donald Trump directed the EPA to develop the measure to aid some independent oil refiners as part of a political move that also helps agricultural communities by lifting summertime fueling restrictions on ethanol  a corn based competitor 
The draft asks for public comment on four major possible restrictions in trading and holding biofuel credits known as Renewable Identification Numbers  or RINs  according to the people familiar with the document  The feedback is meant to guide a final EPA decision about which limits to adopt in the market billionaire Carl Icahn once blasted as  rigged  
The prospect of sweeping changes to the thinly traded RINs market has unleashed fierce lobbying by refiners and integrated oil companies dueling over the idea  At stake  profits tied to a market worth  18 billion in recent years  including a revenue stream for truck stops such as those owned by Buffett s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc     NYSE BRKa 
Although the government created the RIN system to give refiners more flexibility in fulfilling U S  mandates to use biofuel  the credits that are created along with each gallon of ethanol and biodiesel are now traded as commodities  with swaps negotiated among companies  traders and brokers via email and instant messages 
Under current rules  refiners and importers have up to two years to submit RINs to the government as proof they have satisfied biofuel quotas  but credits can change hands many times before they are submitted to the EPA and therefore  retired   Companies that fall short of blending requirements must buy RINs to make up the difference 
Two of the EPA s options seek to promote steadier trading volumes  block companies from hoarding credits and discourage refiners from shorting the market  by forcing traders to shed holdings quarterly  Refiners and importers that are obligated to blend biofuel would have to retire 80 percent of their obligation every quarter  Companies that don t actually need to fulfill biofuel quotas    but generate or trade RINs anyway    would have to rid themselves of all of their credits quarterly 
Shorting the Market
The time limits could undercut some trading strategies  including refiners  ability to short the market by betting RIN prices will fall and buying credits just before they are needed to prove compliance each March 
The EPA also plans to ask the public about imposing firm position limits or disclosure requirements meant to shine a spotlight on anyone with a large collection of RINs  Under the agency s proposed two part test  details would be revealed about companies holding at least 3 percent of the total credit pool as well as more RINs than needed to meet 130 percent of their individual biofuel quotas 
Another proposed provision would edge some traders out of the market by limiting the sale of credits to refiners and importers obligated to satisfy U S  biofuel mandates 
Oil Industry Rift
The EPA is  trying to make the system more transparent   said Wallace Tyner  an agricultural economist at Purdue University in West Lafayette  Indiana 
However  the effort has widened a rift in the oil industry  which could see uneven results from the changes  Independent refiners that must purchase RINs to satisfy quotas argue reforms will pare compliance costs by damping speculating and calming volatile prices  But the restrictions also could lower RIN related revenue for large  integrated oil companies that generate more than enough of their own credits and sell the excess for profit 
The American Petroleum Institute  which represents some of the world s largest oil companies  including  BP   LON BP  Plc and Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  Plc  argues the changes would limit liquidity while failing to solve more fundamental problems with the U S  Renewable Fuel Standard 
Efforts to  cherry pick  aspects of the biofuel program for reform  both misdiagnose the problem and provide misguided and counterproductive cures   said Frank Macchiarola  head of downstream operations at API   The RFS is a broken program that needs significant reform  but parties have made capital investments and business decisions under the existing program structure  
Under the current dynamic  some truck stop owners such as Pilot Flying J Inc  and Murphy USA Inc   are able to sell RINs created by blending biodiesel and ethanol for sale at filling stations  Buffett s Berkshire Hathaway purchased a 38 6 percent stake in Pilot Travel Centers LLC  owner of the Pilot Flying J truck chain  in 2017 
The Virginia based trade group NATSO  which represents Pilot Flying J  Love s Travel Stops and Country Stores Inc  and 1 700 travel plazas and truck stops  warns changes to the RINs market  would cause more harm than good   RIN values are used to determine pump prices for biodiesel  which costs more than petroleum based diesel  The group argues RIN revenue has provided an incentive to build out distribution infrastructure 
Price Swings
Independent refiners such as  Valero Energy  Corp  NYSE VLO   insist reforms are necessary to rein in an irrational market in which economic transaction costs are estimated to dwarf those for oil  ethanol and other energy commodities  Policy news out of Washington has sparked violent swings in prices  RINs tracking ethanol consumption hovered at just a few pennies in 2012 but soared to  1 40 apiece in 2013 and have generally fluctuated between  0 20 and  1 10 since then 
Supporters of restrictions point to market anomalies documented in a 41 page analysis by NERA Economic Consulting spearheaded by former Commodity Futures Trading Commission member Sharon Brown Hruska  The analysis  conducted for Valero  notes that when RINs near expiration dates  they historically cost more than credits with a longer remaining lifespan  even though the opposite should be true 
The unorthodox pricing    akin to consumers paying more for eggs about to go bad than those that don t expire for weeks    suggests an inefficient market and possible hoarding of credits  NERA said  And just small amounts of hoarding can cause RIN prices to jump  creating an incentive for companies with excess credits to withhold supply  NERA said ",2019-03-11,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/epa-biofuel-trading-plan-would-hurt-banks-buffett-truck-stops-1803960,1803960
178329,399845,VLO,Oil Refiners Could Be Outed in Quest to Avoid Biofuel Quotas,news," Bloomberg     The Trump administration is weighing a plan that could force some of the nation s biggest oil companies to come clean about their bids to dodge U S  biofuel mandates 
The Environmental Protection Agency said in a notice Friday it was opening a 15 day window for the public to comment on whether it should reveal  basic information  about refineries seeking waivers from annual biofuel quotas  including the names of the companies and facilities seeking the exemptions 
For years  the agency has kept those details private  claiming they are confidential business information  A surge in waivers   including some issued to refineries connected to major oil companies  has spurred complaints from biofuel advocates demanding more transparency 
If oil companies  aren t willing to put their names on waiver requests claiming that they can t fairly compete in their markets  even as they are reporting record high profitability  then they shouldn t submit them   Gene Gebolys  the president of World Energy Alternatives LLC  said in an email 
 Hardship 
Under federal law  the EPA can exempt small refineries using no more than 75 000 barrels of crude per day from annual biofuel quotas if they face a  disproportionate economic hardship   The exemptions were automatically granted to a slew of small refineries initially  but the agency now makes decisions on a case by case basis  guided by an Energy Department s economic analysis of each petition 
HollyFrontier Corp  and Calumet Specialty Products Partners LP are among refiners that have said they ve received exemptions in recent years  Carl Icahn s CVR Energy Inc  has declined to comment on whether it received waivers  Still  a February filing showed that CVR spent  60 million on biofuel compliance credits in 2018  a 76 percent drop from the company s  249 million tab in 2017   Valero Energy  Corp  NYSE VLO   executives in January pointed to the exemptions as the reason behind lower prices for the credits 
The EPA doesn t divulge the names of refineries that seek or win waivers  even though last year it began publishing aggregated data on the small refinery exemptions  However  some companies have acknowledged securing those waivers in filings with the SEC 
 In the Dark 
 It s just bogus that the refiners are hiding behind  claims of confidential business information  said Geoff Cooper  president of the Renewable Fuels Association   These decisions have been made in the dark  and that s just not good government  
Oil industry advocates warned that more visibility on small refinery exemption requests may cause harm to the companies seeking them  as well as broader markets 
 The data underlying small refinery exemption requests reflects the underlying financial health of facilities in the highly competitive refining sector   Fueling American Jobs Coalition  which represents a group of independent refiners  small retailers and labor unions  said in an emailed statement   Such information can affect access to capital for marginal refineries and can make them attractive targets of acquisition  literally moving markets  
Republican senators Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia and John Barrasso of Wyoming  last year warned the administration that disclosing sensitive information about small refineries seeking waivers could  compound the harm to small refineries  
The EPA has granted 35 refineries waivers from 2017 biofuel blending quotas  up from seven approvals targeting 2015 requirements  In the same period  the number of denied waiver requests dropped to zero from six  according to agency data  The government currently is considering 39 applications for waivers from 2018 requirements

178343,399859,VLO,U S  sanctions Venezuelan state oil firm  escalating pressure on Maduro,news,By Matt Spetalnick and Brian Ellsworth WASHINGTON CARACAS  Reuters    The Trump administration on Monday imposed sweeping sanctions on Venezuelan state owned oil firm PDVSA  aimed at severely curbing the OPEC member s crude exports to the United States and at pressuring socialist President Nicolas Maduro to step down  Minutes before the announcement  Juan Guaido  the Venezuelan opposition leader who proclaimed himself interim president last week with U S  backing  said congress would name new boards of directors to the company and its U S  subsidiary  Citgo  Guaido  supported by the United States and most countries in the Western Hemisphere  says Maduro stole his re election and must resign to allow new  fair polls  Maduro  in a live national broadcast on Monday  accused the United States of trying to steal U S  refining arm Citgo Petroleum  the OPEC member s most important foreign asset  which also manages a chain of U S  gas stations  He said Venezuela would take legal actions in response   In the first sign of serious retaliation  three sources with knowledge of the decision told Reuters that PDVSA had ordered customers with tankers waiting to load Venezuelan crude bound for the United States to prepay for the cargoes or they will not receive authorization to fill the vessels or leave the ports   The Trump administration sanctions stopped short of banning U S  companies from buying Venezuelan oil  but because the proceeds of such sales will be put in a  blocked account   PDVSA is likely to quickly stop shipping much crude to the United States  its top client    If the people in Venezuela want to continue to sell us oil  as long as the money goes into blocked accounts we will continue to take it  otherwise will we not be buying it   Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said at a White House briefing  Oil at sea  already paid for  would continue its journey to the United States  he said  White House national security adviser John Bolton said at the briefing the measure would cost Maduro  11 billion in lost export proceeds over the next year and block him from accessing PDVSA assets worth  7 billion  While there are significant exceptions  such as rules that should allow Citgo to keep using Venezuelan crude in U S  refineries  the sanctions will likely cause some reordering of global oil flows as Venezuela seeks to sell elsewhere  Gulf refineries that use Venezuela s heavy crude will have to look for alternatives to replace supplies  Despite a sharp decline in oil exports due largely to mismanagement of the industry and the economic crisis Venezuela remains the fourth biggest vendor of oil to the United States  supplying some 500 000 barrels per day  Citgo   Valero Energy  Corp  NYSE VLO  and  Chevron  Corp  NYSE CVX  are the three largest buyers of Venezuelan crude in the United States    They are not allowing tankers bound for Valero  Citgo and Chevron to leave Venezuelan ports if not prepaid   a PDVSA source said referring to a decision by the company s trade and supply division  Other exceptions in the sanctions will make it easier for Chevron Corp to keep participating in a joint venture in Venezuela  and allow U S  entities in Venezuela to keep buying PDVSA gasoline   VITAL SECTOR The sanctions  contained in an executive order issued by U S  President Donald Trump  freeze U S  based assets of PDVSA  Venezuela s largest source of revenue  The Trump administration had long held off on targeting Venezuela s vital oil sector for fear that it would hurt U S  refiners and raise oil prices for Americans  White House officials had also expressed concern about inflicting further hardship on the Venezuelan people  The latest sanctions appear to seek to build on the momentum that has mounted in recent weeks against Maduro at home and abroad  U S  officials said the sanctions on PDVSA were intended to prevent Maduro s government from siphoning off funds from the oil company to maintain his grip on power  Mnuchin said oil supplies were sufficient to ensure no significant impact on U S  gas prices in the short term and that the U S  Treasury Department would issue temporary licenses to permit some transactions with PDVSA  Even though the Venezuelan military has shown no sign of abandoning Maduro  Bolton said   Our assessment based on numerous contacts on the ground is that the rank and file of the Venezuelan military is acutely aware of the desperate economic conditions in the country and we think they look for ways to support the National Assembly government   Countries around the world have recognized Guaido  the National Assembly speaker  as Venezuela s rightful leader  and the United States vowed to starve Maduro s administration of oil revenue after he was sworn in on Jan  10 for a second term that was widely dubbed illegitimate  Guaido s team of advisers is rushing to take control of Citgo Petroleum  before a potential bond default that could leave half the company in creditors  hands  sources close to the talks told Reuters on Monday  Maduro has promised to stay in office  backed by Russia and China  which have bank rolled his government and fought off efforts to have his government disavowed by the United Nations  Bolton reiterated that Maduro would be held responsible for the safety of U S  diplomatic personnel in Venezuela as well as Guaido and other opposition figures  He also not rule out U S  military intervention  although such action is widely considered to be

178346,399862,VLO,Sanctions on Venezuela s oil firm sends U S  refiners scrambling,news,By Devika Krishna Kumar and Stephanie Kelly  Reuters    Venezuela s revenues from oil sales to the United States have come under severe threat as sweeping sanctions on Venezuelan state owned oil firm has sent U S  buyers scrambling for replacements   The United States on Monday imposed sanctions on Petr leos de Venezuela  S A   known as PDVSA  to cripple the OPEC member s oil shipments  which account for nearly all of Venezuela s exports  in response to the reelection of socialist President Nicolas Maduro  a vote widely viewed as fraudulent   Washington has recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela s head of state   U S  refineries that depend on Venezuela s heavy crude are turning to domestic sour crude grades to offset the impact  sending prices to the strongest in about five years  traders said  Other potential alternatives from Canada  Mexico or elsewhere in Latin America are hard to secure amid slowing production  limited spare capacity and transportation bottlenecks  traders said  Broader oil futures prices found some support on news of sanctions but the market reaction was largely muted as a lack of investment  mismanagement and fleeing workers have already driven the OPEC member s oil production to the lowest in almost seven decades   PDVSA is seeking to sidestep Trump administration sanctions restricting payments for its oil by asking major buyers  including U S  refiners  to renegotiate contracts  four sources involved in the talks said  The United States is Venezuela s biggest oil customer  importing  on average  about 500 000 barrels per day  bpd  of crude in 2018  according to Refinitiv Eikon data    The region with the biggest shortfall of Venezuelan crudes  either through sanctions or inadvertently through further production declines is the U S    said Michael Tran  commodity strategist at RBC Capital Markets  in a note   For an interactive

be put in a  blocked account    Because of this  PDVSA is likely to quickly stop shipping much crude to the United States  its top client  Overnight  Maduro said cargoes loaded for the United States that had not already been paid for could not depart   There s going to be appetite around the world to take Venezuelan oil   Zachary Rogers  an oil markets analyst at consultancy Wood Mackenzie said  Venezuela will likely be forced to offer steep discounts and increase shipments to Russia  China and India to try and make up for lost revenues from its top market  traders and analysts said  Its output has been cut in half since 2016 to near 70 year lows to less than 1 2 million bpd  according to figures from OPEC secondary sources  due to a major cash crunch  As a result  the U S  share of its exports has declined in recent years  with more shipments going to Russia and China made largely through oil for debt repayment structures  Venezuela can prioritize exports to Asia  but it is the most competitive battleground on the planet  RBC Capital s Tran said  adding that while they remain the second largest market for Venezuelan crudes  the Chinese have also tapered its buying from Caracas over the past two years  For an interactive graphic on Venezuelan crude exports to the United States  see     HOW WILL THE U S  REPLACE VENEZUELAN OIL  Shipments to the United States account for about 75 percent of the cash Venezuela gets for crude shipments  according to a  Barclays   LON BARC  research note published earlier this month   Citgo Petroleum  the U S  refining arm of PDVSA and the biggest importer of Venezuelan crude  did not reply to a request for comment  The other primary importers  Valero Energy  Corp  NYSE VLO  and  Chevron  Corp  NYSE CVX  said they will comply with U S  laws  Though the United States is the top oil producer with output of nearly 12 million bpd  complex Gulf Coast refineries need heavier crude grades to produce diesel and other high margin products  and cannot simply substitute it with light crude  The easiest substitute for now is domestic sour grades  Prices of heavier U S  grades like Mars Sour  an offshore medium U S  crude  and West Texas Sour crude  have risen as buyers scramble for supply   On Tuesday  Mars crude traded at about  6 a barrel premium to the U S  crude futures benchmark  up from a  5 20 a barrel premium on Monday and remained near a five year high  traders said  while West Texas Sour was near the strongest level in a year   It s nuts  Everything with sulfur in it is getting bid   said one U S  crude trader said  referring to crude s sulfur content that is known in the market as  sour grades   Some traders said much of the impact had already been priced in   I actually think it may end up being bearish medium to longer term     If Guaido takes power and foreign investment flows into Venezuela  then their production has a lot of room to go back up over time   a trader at a merchant said  Currently  alternatives to Venezuela s heavy sour crudes are becoming increasingly scarce in the Americas  due to challenges facing heavy crude producers Canada and Mexico   Canada produces more than 4 million bpd  much of it heavy crude that could replace Venezuelan grades  but pipeline bottlenecks are hampering its exports    Until the ongoing  Canadian  pipeline issues are addressed  crude by rail is simply not as scalable as increased shipments from Mexico or Iraq   said Tran  However  Mexico s crude output levels are among the lowest on record dating back several decades as its top producing fields have aged  and new ones to replace them have not been developed  The Trump administration is considering tapping the country s emergency reserve of crude as it imposed sanctions on PDVSA  but no decision has been made  a U S  government source said  The reserve currently holds 649 1 million barrels of crude  about 396 million of which is classified as sour oil  For an

178348,399864,VLO,Global oil industry braces for turmoil from U S  crackdown on Venezuela,news,"By Jessica Resnick Ault NEW YORK  Reuters    More than 24 hours after the United States announced large scale sanctions on Venezuela s nationally owned oil company  merchant trading firms and refiners were still deciphering what the measures prohibited  The sanctions  announced on Monday  are aimed at driving President Nicolas Maduro from power  the strongest U S  measures yet against the socialist president who has overseen economic collapse and an exodus of millions of Venezuelans in recent years  Traders who sell Venezuelan crude to the United States are looking for avenues to keep crude flowing during the sanctions  according to people familiar with the discussions  while U S  companies who buy Venezuelan oil have also been looking for work arounds  seeking counsel for instance on whether the use of third party intermediaries  such as commodity merchants  can continue   The sanctions  froze assets of state run PDVSA and require U S  firms to pay for oil using accounts controlled by the country s opposition party head and self proclaimed interim president  Juan Guaido  PDVSA is seeking to sidestep the restrictions by asking major buyers  including U S  refiners  to renegotiate contracts  sources said  Oil sanctions in the past have been evaded by using intermediaries  said Scott Maberry  who specializes in international trade at Sheppard Mullin law firm  but he doubted that would happen with PDVSA   I would not be surprised if this administration is vigilant and does not feel bound by past practices   said Maberry  A U S  Department of Treasury spokesman called the sanctions against PDVSA  extremely sophisticated   adding that the department would  take questions from industry and stakeholders and issue FAQs as appropriate    No FAQ  frequently asked questions  had been issued by Tuesday evening  Via PDVSA  Venezuela exports about 500 000 barrels of oil daily to the United States  mostly to PDVSA subsidiary Citgo Petroleum and U S  companies  Valero Energy  Corp  NYSE VLO  and  Chevron  Corp   NYSE CVX  It also imports products from the United States   The sanctions not only limit U S  companies from paying PDVSA for crude  but also oil sales moved through multiple third parties  such as potential arrangements involving sending oil to Russia or China  which would later sell to an intermediary that would pass the oil on to U S  buyers   Intermediaries that comply with U S  sanctions in general and transact in U S  dollars would still be subject to the Venezuela sanctions  Transactions sent through a multitude of parties would only be allowed if the revenues were sent to accounts inaccessible by Maduro s government  according to a source familiar with the sanctions    Treasury will be tracking this closely  The idea that this can get laundered and not tracked is far fetched   said Joe McMonigle  senior energy policy analyst at Hedgeye in Washington and a former Energy Department official under President George W  Bush   The Trump administration has said the restrictions should have a minimal impact on the U S  consumer  but some experts said they were concerned there could be unanticipated effects   PDVSA has so many intertwined dealings and transactions with the U S   including through Citgo  that the immediate impact of these sanctions is far more comprehensive on the U S  economy than you would typically see   said Scott Flicker  chair of the Washington office of law firm Paul Hastings and head of the firm s global trade controls practice   The United States exempted Citgo from sanctions until July 27  However  previous sanctions have already prevented Citgo from sending PDVSA its profits  which had been paid to the parent in the form of dividends  Analysts at Tudor  Pickering   Holt said that if Citgo was unable to import Venezuelan barrels   some sort of impact on operations seems like a distinct possibility    U S  refiners last week asked the administration not to issue sanctions  according to a letter seen by Reuters on Tuesday

178352,399868,VLO,The Great Oil Paradox  Too Many Good Crudes  Not Enough Bad Ones,news," Bloomberg     The shale boom has created a world awash with crude  putting a lid on prices and markedly reducing U S  dependence on imported energy  But there s a growing problem  America is producing the wrong kind of oil 
Texas and other shale rich states are spewing a gusher of high quality crude    light sweet in the industry parlance    feeding a growing glut that s bending the global oil industry out of shape 
Refiners who invested billions to turn a profit from processing cheap low quality crude are paying unheard of premiums to find the heavy sour grades they need  The mismatch is better news for OPEC producers like Iraq and Saudi Arabia  who don t produce much light sweet  but pump plenty of the dirtier stuff 
The crisis is Venezuela  together with OPEC output cuts  will exacerbate the mismatch  The South American producer exports some of the world s heaviest oil and Trump administration sanctions announced this week will make processing and exporting crude far more difficult  American refiners are scrambling for alternative supplies at very short notice 
 We still have some holes in our supply plan  over the next 30 days  Gary Simmons  a senior executive at  Valero Energy  Corp  NYSE VLO    the largest refiner in the U S   told investors on Thursday   We are not taking anything from Venezuela  
Crude isn t the same everywhere  the kind pumped from the shale wells of West Texas resembles cooking oil    thin and easy to refine  In Venezuela s Orinoco region  it looks more like marmalade  thick and hard to process  Density isn t the only difference    the sulfur content is also important  dividing the market into sweet and sour crude  Heavy crude tends to have more sulfur than light crude 
As Saudi Arabia  Russia and Canada cut production  and American sanctions force Venezuelan and Iranian exports lower  the market for low quality crude is feeling the impact 
 The strength in the physical crude market continues  led by sour crude shortages   Amrita Sen  chief oil analyst at consultant Energy Aspects Ltd  in London  said echoing a widely held view within the market  
For consumers and politicians focused on the headline oil price for Brent and West Texas Intermediate  the most popular benchmarks  it may not matter much  Car drivers could even benefit  because too much light sweet crude often leads to too much gasoline  and lower prices  On the flip side  truckers may find themselves short charged  as refiners prefer heavy sour crude to make diesel 
To oil traders in the physical market  it provides opportunities for to profit from the changing price spreads between different crude varieties 
Few oil executives see the market changing anytime soon  The supply and demand balance could deteriorate further as OPEC deepens output cuts next month    Saudi Arabia has warned it will reduce production even further in February  Saudi oil exports into the U S  last week fell to the second lowest level in nearly a decade 
 OPEC cuts will sustain the tightness of heavy sour crude   Alex Beard  the head of oil at commodities trading giant  Glencore   LON GLEN  Plc 
At the same time  U S  shale production keeps growing  feeding the glut of light sweet crude  The proportion of light crude in U S  total petroleum output has risen to nearly 57 percent  up from 51 percent in early 2017  according to Bloomberg calculations based on U S  Energy Information Administration data 
In the physical market  oil price differentials for some important varieties of heavy sour crude    including Russia s main export grade  Urals  and Mars Blend from the U S  Gulf of Mexico    are at the strongest levels in five years  according to data compiled by Bloomberg 
Mars crude on Tuesday traded at a  5 85 premium to U S  benchmark West Texas Intermediate  compared to a discount of  1 60 a barrel a year ago  Earlier this month  Heavy Louisiana Sweet crude traded at a rare premium to its sister variety Light Louisiana Sweet 
 OPEC is having the impact that they wanted in the physical market  which is tightening   Marco Dunand  chief executive officer of commodities trader Mercuria Energy Group Ltd 
Heavy sour crude is becoming so expensive    and gasoline refining margins are so low    that some U S  refiners are running their most sophisticated kit at low rates in an effort to save money  Others are likely to follow 
The cracking margin for heavy sour crude for the most sophisticated refineries in the U S  Gulf of Mexico has fallen to about  2 50 per barrel in recent days  compared to a five year average of  12 a barrel  according to data from consultant Oil Analytics Ltd 
The global refinery has no option but to adapt almost in real time  Valero is  changing the way it s sourcing crude on weekly  daily basis to try to get the best netback we can on the plants   Joe Gorder  chief executive officer  told investors on Thursday ",2019-02-01,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/the-great-oil-paradox-too-many-good-crudes-not-enough-bad-ones-1766273,1766273

178391,399907,VLO,Toxin in U S  corn harvest poses latest headache for farmers,news,"By Tom Polansek and Michael Hirtzer CHICAGO  Reuters    North American farmers are finding increased levels of a plant toxin known as vomitoxin in this year s corn harvest  adding insult to injury for growers already suffering as the U S  China trade war hurts soybean exports and crop prices  Vomitoxin sickens livestock and can also make humans and pets fall ill  and grain buyers can reject cargoes or fine farmers for shipments that contain it   More cases than normal are likely in the corn crop because wet weather this autumn caused the fungus to develop while delaying harvests  Iowa State University grain quality expert Charles Hurburgh said on Monday   About three fourths of U S  corn is used domestically to feed livestock and make ethanol and a byproduct called distillers  dried grains that is fed to animals  However  livestock and ethanol producers need to blend corn that contains vomitoxin with corn that does not to make it suitable for feed when toxin levels are high   Hogs don t like the taste and don t like the smell  They will literally starve to death before eating it   said Indiana grain inspector Doug Titus of Titus Grain Inspection  whose company has labs at Andersons Inc  a crop handler  and energy company  Valero Energy  Corp  NYSE VLO  sites  The quality worries come as U S  farm income has plunged by half over the past five years and as the deepening trade war harms demand for soybeans  the most valuable U S  agricultural export product to China  and one frequently rotated with corn  WH Group Ltd s Smithfield Foods Inc  SFII UL   the world s biggest pork producer  has detected vomitoxin in corn in Iowa and Nebraska  where it is not normally a problem  a source with knowledge of the situation said  The company  which feeds corn to hogs  did not immediately respond to a request for comment  The U S  Food and Drug Administration allows vomitoxin levels of up to one part per million  ppm  in human and pet foods and recommends levels under five ppm in grain for hogs  10 ppm for chickens and dairy cattle  Beef cattle can withstand toxin levels up to 30 ppm  Ohio based Andersons is warning farmers delivering corn to an ethanol plant in Albion  Michigan  that corn with vomitoxin levels above five ppm is subject to rejection  Ethanol plants in Michigan and Ohio are also testing corn deliveries for the toxin and charging farmers financial penalties if their loads contain too much  a grain dealer in Michigan said  In upstate New York  farmers are feeding dairy cattle with millfeeds  a byproduct of wheat flour milling  instead of contaminated corn  according to a feed broker in upstate New York  Prices for millfeeds rose about  5 per ton to  100 per ton for trucks in Buffalo  New York  on Monday  Problems stretched over the border into Canada  too    I m already getting the panic button pushed in Canada in Ontario   said Max Hawkins  a nutritionist with Alltech Inc  a Kentucky based feed supplement company  Alltech had tested 45 samples of this year s U S  corn harvest as of Friday and found 80 percent contained vomitoxin  Hawkins said  That is about average  Hawkins said  but he expected further testing to reveal bigger problems      More samples have not been examined yet because of the rains that delayed harvesting  which was 76 percent complete as of Sunday

178392,399908,VLO,Exclusive  EPA refinery biofuel waiver program on hold pending review   sources,news,"By Humeyra Pamuk and Jarrett Renshaw NEW YORK  Reuters    The Trump Administration has temporarily frozen a program meant to exempt small oil refineries in financial distress from the U S  biofuels law  as it reviews the scoring system to evaluate applications  according to two sources familiar with the matter  The review means changes are likely to the program  which has become a lightning rod of controversy between the rival oil and corn industries since the Environmental Protection Agency vastly increased the number of waivers for last year  Under the U S  Renewable Fuel Standard  oil refiners must increasingly blend biofuels like corn based ethanol into their fuel each year or purchase blending credits from those that do  The regulation was passed in 2005 to help farmers and cut fuel imports  But small oil refineries can be exempted from the standard if they prove that compliance would cause disproportionate hardship  The EPA granted 29 such waivers for the 2017 compliance year  up from 14 in 2015 and 20 in 2016  The biofuels industry and lawmakers representing farm states have argued that the expansion hurt farmers by eroding demand for ethanol and want the program halted  But refiners consider the program a lifeline to small facilities and have won lawsuits accusing the EPA of being too stingy with waivers  The two sources  who requested anonymity to discuss the matter  said over the past week that the Trump administration was delaying consideration of any new waivers while the Department of Energy reviews its scoring system for applications  The department evaluates waiver requests and provides recommendations to the EPA  That has placed on hold seven applications for the 2017 compliance year  and 15 applications for the 2018  Typically  the EPA waits until the latter half of the year to begin reviewing applications because applicants need to demonstrate financial hardship using hard figures for their facilities  An EPA official confirmed the review   I think what DOE needs to do is tighten up their approach and we need to do the same   said the official  who asked not to be named   I honestly don t know where they ll end up and whether they re going to make any changes at all   Whatever the outcome  it could have a dramatic impact on the multi billion dollar credit trading market  which has been hard hit by the waiver expansion  Credits  called Renewable Identification Numbers or RINs  have dropped in value from over  1 to 10 cents this week as reports emerged of the number of EPA waivers granted last year  Some of those went to facilities owned by big  profitable companies like  Chevron  Corp  NYSE CVX  and Andeavor  which recently merged with Marathon Petroleum Corp  NYSE MPC   Reuters has reported   That cut in credit prices has saved merchant refiners that lack enough biofuel blending facilities  like  Valero Energy  Corp  NYSE VLO   PBF Energy Inc and Carl Icahn s CVR Energy Inc hundreds of millions of dollars in compliance costs  The issue has placed President Donald Trump in a tough spot between two key constituencies  as he tries to support the agriculture industry slammed by the impact of his trade war with China  and keep costs down for the oil industry  Biofuel supporters had argued the expansion of the waiver program was politically driven by former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt  an Oklahoman considered an oil industry ally  Pruitt resigned in July in a flurry of ethical scandals  and has been replaced by Andrew Wheeler  a former coal lobbyist    Under the last EPA chief  the waiver program became a cookie jar open to every well connected refinery owner  and we re seeing the results across rural America with biofuel plants closing their doors or idling production   Brook Coleman  head of the Advanced Biofuels Business Council  said   The EPA has blamed the program s expansion on recent federal court rulings  triggered by challenges filed by small refining companies Holly Frontier and Sinclair  which said the agency was using too strict of a test to determine disproportionate hardship  
All hardship applications are first handled by the Energy Department  which determines whether compliance would lead to disproportionate impact  or threaten a refinery s viability  The final decision on applications rests with the EPA ",2018-11-28,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/exclusive-epa-refinery-biofuel-waiver-program-on-hold-pending-review--sources-1703040,1703040

This is not the first time Trump has waded into the debate over biofuels policy which pits two groups that have supported him against each other  farmers and refiners  He tried to broker a deal between the rival corn and oil industries earlier this year  but those efforts stumbled as the corn lobby dug in its heels against certain changes ",2018-09-27,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/white-house-mulls-limits-on-biofuel-trading-as-part-of-e15-deal-sources-1626755,1626755

178435,399951,VLO,Exclusive  U S  EPA grants refiners biofuel credits to remedy Obama era waiver denials,news,"By Jarrett Renshaw and Chris Prentice NEW YORK  Reuters    The U S  Environmental Protection Agency has awarded tens of millions of dollars worth of biofuel blending credits for this year to refiners HollyFrontier and Sinclair Oil after they argued the agency had wrongly denied them waivers from the country s biofuels law as far back as 2014  according to two sources and public filings  The release of the Renewable Identification Numbers  or RINs  marks the first reported instance of the EPA issuing tradable credits from previous years into the present market  It is likely to add fuel to an already fiery dispute between Big Oil and Big Corn over the future of America s biofuel policy by opening the door to similar challenges from other refiners in the future  The EPA s move may put even more pressure on credit prices  which have plummeted to five year lows amid the agency s expansion of the small refinery waiver program  Credits fell to 20 cents each in early trading  down from 25 cents on Wednesday  on the Reuters report  traders said   The U S  Renewable Fuel Standard requires refiners to blend specific volumes of biofuels like corn based ethanol into the fuel supply each year and prove compliance by acquiring RINs that can be either earned or purchased  The law has helped farmers by creating a 15 billion gallon market for ethanol  but refining companies have complained it costs them a fortune  At issue is the EPA s responsibility to release small refineries from the regulation if they can prove complying would cause them  disproportionate economic hardship    The agency has historically been closed fisted with the exemptions but has awarded an unusually high number under the administration of President Donald Trump  It now appears to be taking measures to compensate for denials made by the agency during the administration of President Barack Obama  The EPA decided to give HollyFrontier nearly  34 million worth of credits for this year to reverse a denial for a waiver for one of its Wyoming plants dating back to 2015 and undisclosed millions more to Sinclair for two of its facilities in the same state for 2014 and 2015  according to the filings and sources  who asked not to be named  Both companies had challenged EPA s denials in a federal appellate court in Colorado in 2016  That court in August 2017 ruled EPA had erred in denying Sinclair s applications for exemptions by being too strict in its definition of disproportionate economic hardship and remanded the case back to EPA to come up with a remedy   The HollyFrontier case had been put on hold during the Sinclair proceedings and was also remanded back to EPA at the agency s request  according to the filings and sources   In the first quarter of 2018  the EPA allowed us to generate new 2018 vintage RINs to replace the RINs previously submitted to meet the Cheyenne Refinery s 2015 RVO   HollyFrontier disclosed in its most recent quarterly filing  valuing the RINs at  33 8 million  The sources said Sinclair was also given RINs for this year as a remedy  though it was unclear how many or what their value was in dollars  The company is private and does not disclose its financial data  EPA spokesman Jahan Wilcox did not respond to multiple requests for comment  HollyFrontier s President and Chief Executive Officer George J  Damiris defended the waivers  saying that by granting them  EPA is following the law and underscoring their importance to small refineries   Small refineries are the lifeblood of local communities   they provide good paying jobs  support the local tax base  and help ensure our nation s energy independence   Damiris said in an emailed statement  Susan Schoolfield  a spokeswoman for Sinclair  did not respond immediately to request for comment   Blending credits have a two year life cycle  meaning that the companies  2014 and 2015 credits came due for delivery to EPA in 2016 and 2017  The 2018 RINs could be used to prove compliance with the RFS as late as 2020   MATERIAL ADVANTAGE  The EPA s decision to give the RINs to Sinclair and HollyFrontier as a remedy for errant waiver denials in the past  could open the door to similar challenges by other refiners  according to legal experts interviewed by Reuters  The EPA s decision not to disclose the release of the RINs into the notoriously opaque credit market could also open up questions about the agency s handling of market sensitive information  according to Ed Hirs  an energy economist at the University of Houston   What the EPA did was issue a security and potentially conveyed a material advantage to these refiners without notifying the market   he said   The EPA is already facing at least two legal challenges and a wave of criticism over its handling of biofuels policy from corn farmers and their legislative backers who say the agency is undercutting a program Trump had vowed to protect  The RFS was adopted more than a decade ago as a way to boost farmers  cut petroleum imports and reduce air pollution

178437,399953,VLO,Exclusive  Trump s EPA ignored Energy Department calls to limit biofuel waivers,news,"By Jarrett Renshaw and Chris Prentice NEW YORK  Reuters    The Trump administration s Environmental Protection Agency has consistently ignored recommendations from the Department of Energy to reject or limit waivers to oil refiners seeking exemptions from nation s biofuels law  according to five sources familiar with the matter  The U S  Renewable Fuel Standard requires the firms to cover costs of blending corn based ethanol into gasoline  But the EPA  after consulting with the energy department  can exempt small refineries in cases where compliance presents a  disproportionate economic hardship    The waivers can save refiners tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars a year  Under EPA chief Scott Pruitt  an appointee of President Donald Trump  the agency has issued more than two dozen such exemptions in recent months   about triple the usual number granted under past administrations  During that time  EPA has consistently granted full waivers in cases where the energy department recommended only partial exemptions  and  at least once  granted a full approval when the energy department advised an outright rejection  according to two sources familiar with the decisions  That approach marks a sharp break from Obama administration s EPA  which had often either adopted energy department recommendations or  when it didn t  ruled against exempting oil refiners  the sources said  The shift between the Democratic and Republican administrations shows how political ideologies and constituencies can steer bureaucratic interpretation of a law that never changed   with major impacts on industry  The waivers save refineries money by freeing them from their obligation to blend ethanol into their gasoline or to purchase compliance credits from those who do  The broad use of waivers lately has angered the powerful corn lobby  which argues they threaten corn demand  The Renewable Fuels Association  which represents U S  ethanol makers  last month estimated that the waivers have reduced the amount of ethanol refiners are required to blend by 1 6 billion gallons  The law currently requires refiners to blend 15 billion gallons of the biofuel per year  The surge in waivers has sent the price of biofuels compliance credits to five year lows  saving refiners such as  Valero Energy  Corp  NYSE VLO  and PBF Energy hundreds of millions of dollars  Until now  it was not known if the EPA gave the waivers on the basis of the energy department recommendations or despite them  The EPA has denied public records requests seeking information on the waivers  which it considers proprietary company information  Pruitt has misled farmers about the agency s relationship with the energy department to help shield himself from criticism  Jon Doggett  said Executive Vice President of the National Corn Growers Association   Actions like that make it nearly impossible for farmers to trust anything this EPA has to say   Dogget said in a statement Tuesday  Biofuel groups have asked the U S  Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit in Washington to review legality of the waivers   arguing the EPA is  methodically destroying the demand for renewable fuels    and to force the EPA to disclose them  EPA spokeswoman Molly Block declined to comment on the pending litigation or on whether the agency has approved waivers that the energy department recommended rejecting   From the beginning of this administration  we have worked closely with our partners at DOE on this issue   she said in a written statement  DOE spokeswoman Shaylyn Hynes did not respond to requests for comment   FINANCIAL HARDSHIP  During a recent Midwest tour  Pruitt told Nebraska farmers that the EPA works  in alliance with the Department of Energy  to grant the waivers  saying there was just one example of disagreement  EPA spokespeople have repeatedly said the agency s criteria for granting waivers have not changed   He sat in our conference room  looked us in the eye  and told us     that EPA doesn t approve them without DOE s recommendation   Bill Pracht  a farmer and CEO of East Kansas Agri Energy  said in a statement on Tuesday   Now we know that just isn t true   The sources with knowledge of the two agencies  interactions disputed the assertion that the EPA and DOE are acting as partners in these decisions  They declined to provide a specific number of cases in which the EPA has gone against energy department recommendations or to name most of the companies involved  but did provide two examples of what they said has become regular practice  In one case  the EPA provided a full waiver to a refiner after the energy department had recommended rejecting the exemption  two sources told Reuters  In another  the EPA granted full waivers to refineries owned by Andeavor   a large U S  refining company which reported  1 4 billion in net income last year   after the energy department had recommended a 50 percent exemption  according to two other sources familiar with the company s approval  The waivers for Andeavor were first reported by Reuters in April  The company said in a May earnings statement that the waivers  provided to its smallest refineries  saved it about  100 million in compliance costs   Scott LaBelle  an Andeavor spokesman  declined to comment beyond the company s previous statements  Obama s administration was accused of being too stingy with the waivers  Last year  an appellate judge said Obama s EPA had used too narrow a definition of  financial hardship  when it denied Sinclair Oil waivers for its Wyoming refineries for 2014 and 2015  But appellate judges in two other similar cases upheld the EPA s denials and its methods  Neither the rulings nor the change in presidential administrations changed the way energy department analysts scored applications  according to the sources   Energy department analysts score applications on a two part test that considers whether compliance would lead to disproportionate impact or threaten a refinery s viability  Qualifying under either leads to a partial exemption  qualifying under both leads to a full exemption    WORKAROUND  TO HELP REFINERS The EPA s relaxed standard for the waivers is the latest illustration of the agency s leadership seeking to deliver relief to refiners from the law  which was signed under Republican President George W  Bush to help farmers  reduce petroleum imports and improve air quality  Pruitt has repeatedly recommended overhauling the law to reduce strain on refiners and advocated for changes during months of failed negotiations between oil and corn representatives mediated by President Donald Trump   Republican Senator Joni Ernst from Iowa  the top ethanol producing state  said Pruitt s handling of the waivers appeared to be based on a political goal of helping the oil industry   a charge the EPA has denied   This is definitely a workaround that they have figured out  That s why we are demanding transparency   Ernst said in an interview  referring to requests her and other lawmakers for the EPA to disclose information on the waivers  The current administration has attempted to lower compliance costs for some refiners since billionaire investor and refinery owner Carl Icahn first raised concerns to Trump during his campaign  and then again after Trump named Icahn as a  special advisor  on industry regulation after his election  
Icahn resigned from his advisory post in August under pressure from lawmakers who said his dual role as investor and advisor posed ethical concerns  Icahn s CVR Energy was among the refining companies that received a waiver from EPA  Reuters reported earlier this year ",2018-06-26,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/exclusive-trumps-epa-ignored-energy-department-calls-to-limit-biofuel-waivers-1507329,1507329

Futures in New York slipped 0 4 percent  on course for a 0 7 percent drop this week  French President Emmanuel Macron earlier this week predicted President Donald Trump will exit the Iran agreement  while U S  Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said Thursday a decision on a withdrawal hasn t been made  North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae in agreed to finally end seven decades of hostile relations this year 
Oil this month touched the highest level in more than three years as speculation swirled over the potential breakup of the nuclear accord that Iran signed with world powers in 2015  The deal had lifted sanctions on the Islamic Republic  enabling it to boost oil production by about 1 million barrels a day  Investors are also watching global inventories amid signs that production cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies could continue to deepen while American output soars 
 The oil price should not fall in any significant way until the question of renewed Iran sanctions has been resolved   said Carsten Fritsch  an analyst at  Commerzbank AG   DE CBKG  in Frankfurt

The offer  payable in either cash or shares  values Andeavor at about  152 27 a share  the companies said in a statement on Monday  That s about a 24 percent premium over Friday s closing price  The Wall Street Journal first reported the acquisition on Sunday 
 This transaction combines two strong  complementary companies to create a leading U S  refining  marketing  and midstream company  building a platform that is well positioned for long term growth and shareholder value creation   Marathon Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Gary Heminger said in a statement on Monday 
Marathon s geographic footprint is focused in the U S  Midwest and Gulf Coast  while Andeavor s refineries and pipelines are in western states  They are among the biggest beneficiaries of the shale boom  as the rapid growth in oil production has given them access to abundant supplies at a discount to global prices  Independent operators also reaped fatter profits from the recent overhaul of the U S  tax code  and the Standard   Poor s 500 Index of oil refiners reached an all time high last week 
The CEO expects annual cost and operating synergies of about  1 billion within the first three years  Given projected cash flow generation  Marathon s board also approved share buybacks of  5 billion 
The boards of both companies unanimously approved the deal  which is expected to close in the second half of this year  subject to regulatory and shareholder approvals 
Greatest Capacity
Findlay  Ohio based Marathon Petroleum is the third largest U S  refiner by market capitalization  valued at about  38 6 billion  according to data compiled by Bloomberg  San Antonio  Texas based Andeavor  formerly known as  Tesoro  Corp  NYSE ANDV    is the fourth largest  worth  18 7 billion  Phillips 66  NYSE PSX  is the largest U S  independent refiner  valued at  51 9 billion

to belong to the Michoacan Family drug cartel  came in February 2015   They said they knew who I was and where I lived   said Alberto Arredondo  who got the call at work as a pump technician at an oil refinery in the central Mexican city of Salamanca   They wanted information   At first  Arredondo hung up   But they were insistent   he said  calling back and demanding details of when fuels would be pumped and through which pipelines  Over the next two years  Arredondo said  he would be hounded  kidnapped  pistol whipped and stabbed so severely that surgeons removed his gall bladder  In December 2016  he fled to Canada  where he now seeks asylum from gangs that steal fuel from Salamanca and five other refineries operated by Pemex  PEMX UL   the state owned oil company  Fuel theft is fast becoming one of Mexico s most pressing economic and security dilemmas  sapping more than  1 billion in annual revenue from state coffers  terrorizing workers and deterring private investment in aging refineries that the government  following a 2014 energy reform  hoped instead would be thriving with foreign capital  Because of government offensives that toppled narco kingpins in recent years  Mexico s drug cartels have splintered and are eager for new sources of revenue  Now  their increasingly dominant role as fuel thieves pits two of the country s biggest industries   narcotics and oil   against one another  The cash rich cartels  believed by the Mexican government to generate well over  21 billion each year  are an increasing threat to Pemex  which in 2016 reported revenue of about  52 billion and generates about a fifth of government income   The business is more profitable than drug trafficking because it implies less risk   said Georgina Trujillo  a ruling party congresswoman who heads the lower house energy commission   You don t have to risk crossing the border to look for a market   she added   We all consume gasoline  We don t all consume drugs   Pemex did not respond to detailed questions from Reuters about the cartels and fuel theft  Among other questions  Reuters asked about the cartels  impact on the refineries  Pemex s security measures and how the company responds to extortion and violence against its employees  One senior Pemex refining executive  who asked not to be identified  said   We worry about the influence of organized crime   but would not discuss the issue further  Fuel theft is not new or unique to Mexico  But cartels are taking it to calamitous new dimensions and  in the process  bolstering their bottom line   Fuel theft just makes these groups more powerful   according to one senior official from the U S  Drug Enforcement Administration  who asked not to be identified  By targeting refineries  already suffering from a lack of investment  Mexico s most notorious criminals gain access to nerve centers for much of the country s fuel supply   That threatens an oil industry that accounts for about 8 percent of Mexico s economy and creates yet more uncertainty for a country already reeling from U S  threats to dismantle the North American Free Trade Agreement   Graphic  As illegal fuel taps soar  refineries suffer      It hurts the national coffers  weakens national security and hinders the reform and development of Mexico s energy market   said Gustavo Mohar  a former Mexican energy and intelligence official  BLEEDING MONEY AND FUEL Between 2011 and 2016  the number of unauthorized taps discovered on Mexico s fuel lines nearly quintupled  according to a recent report by the federal auditor  Repair costs surged almost tenfold  to 1 77 billion pesos   95 million   A May 2017 study  commissioned by the national energy regulator and obtained by Reuters via a freedom of information request  found that thieves  between 2009 and 2016  had tapped pipelines roughly every 1 4 kms  0 86 mi  along Pemex s approximately 14 000 km pipeline network  After decades of poor upkeep  the refineries are bleeding money as well as fuel  In addition to unscheduled outages  which cause big operational losses  maintenance problems have led to fatal accidents  including fires and explosions  Together  the refineries have accumulated annual operating losses of about  5 billion in recent years  Production of refined products  meanwhile  fell to just over 700 000 barrels per day in 2017  That s about half the production levels at the refineries  peak in 1994  The 2014 energy reform is the landmark economic initiative of President Enrique Pena Nieto  It ended more than seven decades of monopoly of the oil sector by Pemex   It also gradually phased out subsidies that kept retail fuel cheap  causing prices at the pump to climb by an average of nearly 25 percent since 2014  even though global oil prices fell by as much as 75 percent during that period  Higher prices were meant to attract foreign oil companies and other private investors   They also attracted criminals  who undercut licensed retailers by selling stolen fuel at a discount  With know how gained from extorting sectors including agriculture  transport and mining  drug gangs began applying their tried and true methods at refineries  Using the habitual narco offer of  plata or plomo   or  silver or lead   gangs extort refinery workers into providing crucial information  Their tactics  coupled with fighting between groups jockeying for access to the racket  have led to a surge of violence in cities like Salamanca  home to a third of the fuel taps discovered in Mexico in 2016  Mutilated corpses of refinery workers  police and suspected fuel thieves increasingly appear around the city  terrifying its 260 000 residents  Cartels routinely festoon Salamanca with  narcomantas   banners that mark territory or spell out grisly threats to rivals  In Guanajuato  the surrounding state  investigators opened 1096 murder cases last year  14 percent more than in 2016  That is a 71 percent increase over 2013  Pena Nieto s first full year in office  Interviews with Pemex and Mexican security officials  authorities in Guanajuato and locals affected by fuel theft describe an increasingly desperate situation for the industry and the regional economy   Interviews with Arredondo  the former pump technician  and Juan  a cartel member and admitted killer turned federal informant  show the heavy toll inflicted on people on both sides of the theft  Juan  whose last name Reuters agreed not to disclose because of his ongoing role as an informant  is no longer in Guanajuato  His information is believed by the government to be credible and has been corroborated upon further investigation  according to one senior federal security official   DON T PASS THROUGH SALAMANCA  The Salamanca refinery  the second oldest Mexican refinery in operation  was inaugurated on July 30  1950  It was part of a nationalistic push by Mexico  12 years after the government expropriated foreign oil assets and created Pemex  to assert economic and industrial might   Located in Guanajuato because of the state s central geography  with easy access to Mexico City and far flung corners alike  the refinery became a symbol of progress  It put Salamanca  previously a farming town in a sea of sorghum fields  on the map  Quickly  though  Salamanca and the refinery would also come to be associated with some of the deadly risks of the oil business  Jose Alfredo Jimenez  a legendary singer of Mexico s traditional ranchera music  penned a still famous song after a brother died after getting sick at the refinery in 1953   Guanajuato Road   as the song is titled  leads to places where  life has no value   he sang   Don t pass through Salamanca   he continued   the memory pains me there   The refinery grew to dominate the local economy  its fortunes rising and falling along with those of the Mexican oil industry  Although thieves targeted the pipelines leading to and from the facility  they rarely caused significant loss  In recent years  that changed  One particular gang of  huachicoleros   as fuel thieves are known  now dominates the racket  Allegedly run by a local  Jose Antonio Yepez  the gang is known as the Santa Rosa de Lima cartel  after a small town 60 km east of Salamanca  Yepez  himself known as  El Marro   or  The Mallet   is wanted by federal authorities and suspected of crimes ranging from drug trafficking to fuel theft  Little is publicly known about him or his organization  Reuters was unable to reach Yepez for comment  Juan  the informant whose account of the organization has not been reported before  said he joined the gang in 2013  Originally from the neighboring state of Jalisco  he was earning 600 pesos   32  a week as a day laborer when a friend phoned about work in Guanajuato that paid many times more  That April  Juan said  he moved to the town of Villagran  about 25 km east of Salamanca  Initially  he worked for the gang as a lookout  earning 5 000 pesos a week to report on soldiers and federal police driving through the area   Soon  though  he graduated to filling up giant  60 000 liter fuel tankers at a ranch called  El Caracol   connected by buried hose to a pipeline about three km away  The chief fuel tapper  known as Fito  bragged to Juan and the gang about his refinery contacts and his unique tapping skills  Other tappers simply siphoned fuel from near the pipeline  Fito lined a hose along the underside of the duct  burrowed it far away and then ran it underground to the ranch  The technique made taps difficult to detect  allowing the gang to milk pipelines continuously  One tap ran four years undetected  Fito boasted   ONE OF US   By late 2013  El Marro s outfit faced incursions by others  Juan and federal security officials say  The interlopers included major gangs like the Zetas  the Knights Templar and a successor cartel known as the Michoacan Family  to which the people who extorted Arredondo claimed to belong  To deter them  El Marro built up a militia   El Puma   a Marro lieutenant  recruited Juan for the force   Now you re one of us   Juan said he was told by El Puma  He handed Juan a gun and said the first order of business was to take down an emerging gang made up of bandits recruited from as far away as the Pacific coast  El Marro  a proud local  told his gang that they had the upper hand on their own turf  Juan recalled   No dog is brave beyond its home   El Marro said  Juan said he and fellow militia members killed six of the rivals  Later  a group of Zetas approached El Marro and demanded three pesos for every liter of fuel he stole  El Marro s gang arranged a meeting with the Zetas   Before the meeting could begin  however  Juan and his colleagues ambushed 13 of the rivals  killed them and buried them in a mass grave in a region they refer to as the  Bermuda Triangle   In total  Juan said he had killed about 30 people  Reuters could not independently verify Juan s claims  The senior federal security official said the details and scope of the events Juan described are consistent with the bloodbath around Salamanca  Juan  aged 55  is the government s single best source of information on fuel theft across Mexico  the official said  As the gang s strength grew  El Marro grew prominent  He bought land and racehorses and commissioned songs from a local band  a practice common among narcotraffickers to manufacture their personal mythologies  In  Bermuda Triangle   his signature  corrido   as the songs are known  the group sings that  the competition sweats and fast will be finished because the Mallet rules here and he and his men hammer   Yepez also built up a payroll that Juan and government security officials say includes politicians  local  state and federal police  and state and federal prosecutors  Juan said on several occasions he personally delivered a payoff of 30 million pesos to one official to ensure that law enforcement turn a blind eye to the theft and extortion  Juan named the official he allegedly gave money to  but Reuters could not independently verify the payment  Prosecutors have not charged the official with any crime   Around late 2014  police surrounded El Marro  Juan and other gang members near the town of Celaya  El Marro remained calm  Juan recalled   I m going to make a quick call   the boss said  The police promptly let them go  Graft among Salamanca police got so severe that the state recently fired the entire local force and replaced it with Guanajuato state officers  State police referred questions about the incident involving El Marro to state prosecutors  who did not respond to requests for comment  The payoffs  like the theft  are all possible because of the gang s refinery sources   That s where we got everything   Juan said   It s the brain    I TOLD THEM EVERYTHING  Arredondo  the former refinery worker  grew up in Salamanca and is now 37 years old  He had been a pump technician for more than a decade when the extortionists phoned in 2015  His job involved delivering gasoline  diesel and jet fuel through pipelines  After the first call  Arredondo said he went to a manager  who told him not to disclose any information  Then the gang called again  threatening to kill him  Arredondo folded  giving the caller details of a diesel delivery  After work that day  a motorcyclist approached and offered Arredondo an envelope   The patron sends this   the helmeted rider said  using a Spanish term for  boss   Arredondo said he declined the package  But the message was clear  Despite salaries similar to his  a modest 30 000 pesos   1550  a month  some of Arredondo s colleagues had grown affluent  buying expensive cars and watches and sending their kids to schools abroad  One colleague bragged of renting a strip club for one night  splurging on drinks and prostitutes for himself and for friends   They were providing information   Arredondo realized  Such payoffs  he said   never interested me   After rejecting the envelope  Arredondo said he sought to lie low  He moved house  But the thieves wanted more  In February 2016  as he left a supermarket  armed men pulled up and told Arredondo to climb into a white van  They yelled  threatened to kill him and drove him to a ranch  There  another group waited  The leader of that group berated him  demanding to know details about the pump team   I told them everything   Arredondo said  explaining the team s eight hour shifts  each staffed by four workers  The group leader was unconvinced  He grabbed a pistol and struck Arredondo with the butt  cutting his forehead  The men forced him back into the van  drove off and tossed him by the roadside  Going to the police was out of the question  That year  two refinery colleagues were killed  Family members of the victims told Arredondo that the colleagues had informed police about threats from fuel thieves  Police referred questions about those deaths to the Guanajuato state attorney general s office  A spokeswoman there said it had records of three suspected murders of Pemex employees in recent years  A Reuters review of local press coverage found at least seven alleged murders of Pemex workers around Salamanca since 2012  The company and law enforcement rarely confirm employment details of victims after such killings  The calls to Arredondo intensified  now directly to his cell phone  He told managers once more  but said they were little help  Arredondo moved again  But the men from the van caught up with him  lingering outside his new home and making sure to catch his eye   I felt cornered   he said  He moved a third time  On Oct 18  2016  his 36th birthday  Arredondo went to a bar  As he left  a man stabbed him in the stomach and ran off  not bothering to speak or even rob him  For two months  he recovered at his parents  house  The day before he planned to return to the refinery  he went home  But there were the gang members  yet again   I realized that this was never going to end   he said  Arredondo immediately bought a plane ticket for Canada  where he once vacationed  He took a bus to Mexico City the next morning and left his country that night   NO LONGER A BLESSING   Arredondo is not the only one now fleeing Guanajuato  Before the surge in violence  the state s location had made it a hub for manufacturing and logistics and an emerging hotbed for business  Investment in Guanajuato  which peaked at  2 9 billion in 2015  is now falling steadily  reaching less than half that amount for most of 2017  according to state figures  Up to 15 percent of Salamanca s 10 000 businesses have closed  said Francisco Gonzalez  head of a local chamber of commerce   The refinery  and Pemex in general  are no longer a blessing for us   he said   The refinery is underperforming  operating at just over 60 percent of its capacity in 2017 and getting less funding than in years past  Despite Pena Nieto s promise to modernize the sector  low oil prices have handicapped investments in the six refineries  The 2017 budget allocated 18 92 billion pesos for refinery upgrades  less than half the 39 77 billion spent in 2014  Efforts to lure private investment  meanwhile  have struggled  Last month  Pemex reached a preliminary deal with Japan s Mitsui   Co Ltd to complete a  2 6 billion coking plant at its refinery in Tula de Allende  north of Mexico City  according to two people familiar with the decision   nL1N1PB1JD   But Pemex officials last year sought separate refinery funding from companies including  Valero Energy  Corp  N VLO  and  Tesoro  Corp  N ANDV   according to two people familiar with those efforts  Neither company was interested   nL1N1I7012  Mitsui  Valero and Tesoro  which last year changed its name to Andeavor  declined to comment   There is no incentive to invest in the Mexican refining system   said John Auers  executive vice president of Turner  Mason   Company  a global refining consultancy  citing  organized crime and corruption   The report commissioned by Mexico s energy regulator assigns blame inside and outside the sector   The problem is corruption  not just in security and judicial services  but also inside Pemex   it read  In public pronouncements  Pemex has vowed to crack down  The company said in an October statement it had fired an unspecified number of employees for unspecified illegal activity at Salamanca s storage and distribution center  It did not elaborate   What we re starting to see is that we re approaching the end   Pemex Chief Executive Jose Antonio Gonzalez Anaya told lawmakers recently  referring to what he described as gains against fuel thieves  In late November  Pena Nieto named Gonzalez Anaya finance minister and announced a new Pemex chief  Few in Salamanca see any end to the problem in sight  Police increasingly seize vehicles  including school buses  ambulances  and delivery trucks  gerryrigged to carry stolen fuel   El Marro   on the offensive after continued incursions by rivals  in October published a YouTube video in which he shouts expletives and vows to hunt down members of the Jalisco New Generation cartel  Behind him  about 70 men brandish automatic rifles  cheer and empty their magazines into the sky  Juan  the former gang member  said he recently found religion and a girlfriend  with whom he had a son in 2016  He left the gang in early 2017 and sought out authorities  Arredondo  meanwhile  is hoping for asylum  In June  the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada rejected his initial petition  Although it called him  a largely credible witness   the panel recommended he relocate within Mexico  suggesting two cities where the Michoacan Family is not present  A spokeswoman for the refugee board said it could not comment on specific applications for asylum   Arredondo appealed the board s decision and has a  good shot   said Christina Gural  his Canadian lawyer  Just in case  though  Arredondo is researching asylum possibilities in other countries  including Australia  Norway and Finland  Of one thing he is certain   I can t return to Salamanca   he said

178468,399984,VLO,Cruz urges biofuels policy revamp at rally for bankrupt U S  refiner,news,"By Jarrett Renshaw Philadelphia  Reuters    Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas on Wednesday urged President Donald Trump s administration to push for an overhaul of the nation s biofuels policy  during a rally at a Pennsylvania oil refinery that blames its bankruptcy on the controversial regulation   We need a federal government that stands up for workers  not against them   Cruz  whose state is home to numerous oil refining companies  told a cheering crowd of 1 200 people gathered in a tent on the grounds of the Philadelphia Energy Solutions plant  The oil industry and the corn lobby have been at odds over the causes of the Philadelphia area refiner s insolvency  which has become a touchstone in the debate over whether the U S  Renewable Fuel Standard  RFS  needs to be rewritten  The decade old regulation requires U S  refiners to blend biofuels like corn based ethanol into their fuel  or buy credits from those who do  While it has created a lucrative market for corn states like Iowa and Nebraska  refiners like Philadelphia Energy Solutions  PES  that have no blending facilities say it is unfair and costly  PES  which employs more than a thousand people  declared bankruptcy in January and placed the blame squarely at the feet of the RFS  The corn industry has pushed back  pointing out that other refining companies   like top U S  refiner  Valero Energy  Corp  NYSE VLO    are raking in their biggest profits in years  and suggesting PES  problems may have had more to do with regional refining economics and management choices  Reuters reported this week that PES  investor backers   led by the  Carlyle Group   NASDAQ CG    withdrew at least  594 million in a series of dividend style distributions from PES since 2012  most of them backed by loans the company ultimately could not repay  The distributions  combined with a shift in U S  energy economics  made complying with the RFS a challenge   Workers at PES deserve real answers for the financial troubles facing the refinery  and that starts with investors who drained the company while other U S  refiners flourished under the RFS   said Emily Skor  chief executive of biofuels producer Growth Energy   Cruz has been leading an effort to reform the RFS  putting holds on presidential nominations favored by corn state lawmakers and organizing meetings with administration officials  The oil and gas industry is among Cruz s top financial backers  according to the Center for Responsive Politics  Cruz has suggested putting a cap of 10 cents on credit prices   a fraction of their current value   a move that would save refiners millions of dollars but which was roundly rejected as unworkable by the biofuels industry  Cruz said on Wednesday that  despite his free market principles  he supports capping prices of the credits  called RINs   A RIN is not a commodity     it s a made up government license   he said   The former presidential hopeful said that his proposal would help refiners without hurting corn growers  He added that if he had won the 2016 race for the White House  he would have done more than suggest tweaks to the program   If I would ve won  I would ve ended the RFS   Cruz said to a round of applause

178474,399990,VLO,Trump pushes Big Corn and Big Oil to break biofuels deadlock,news,"By Jarrett Renshaw  Reuters    U S  President Donald Trump urged representatives from the rival oil and corn industries on Thursday to break a deadlock in talks over the future of the nation s biofuels policy by accepting a deal involving reforms sought by both sides  Trump has arranged a series of talks between Big Corn and Big Oil since late last year amid rising concern in the White House over the U S  Renewable Fuel Standard  RFS   a law requiring refiners to mix biofuels such as corn based ethanol into their fuel  The decade old policy was intended to help farmers and reduce petroleum imports but has increasingly divided farmers and energy companies   two of Trump s most important constituencies  Refining company Philadelphia Energy Solutions LLC in the key electoral state of Pennsylvania in January blamed the RFS for its bankruptcy  A source who attended Thursday s meeting at the White House said Trump told the gathering of lawmakers and corporate executives that he supports a proposal from the refining industry to cap the price of biofuels blending credits that refiners must acquire to comply with the RFS  Prices for the blending credits   which refiners must either earn or purchase   have surged in recent years  upsetting companies that in some cases are spending hundreds of millions of dollars on them   The source  who asked not to be named because he is not authorized to speak publicly on the discussion  said Trump also expressed support for expanding sales of high ethanol gasoline   a tweak long sought by ethanol producers   The Environmental Protection Agency bans the use of gasoline containing 15 percent ethanol during the summer months  a move intended to reduce ozone emissions and smog during the peak driving season   The two ideas  combined  represented a  win win  solution for the oil and corn industries that could help them break their deadlock  Trump told the meeting  according to the source   Biofuel interests in the meeting tried to persuade Trump to approve the so called E15 waiver and see if that drives down credit prices  but Trump rejected the request saying the industry needed immediate changes  Trump told the parties that he wanted credit caps and greater use of higher ethanol blended gasoline and to come back in a week  the source said  He then abruptly ended the meeting  stood and began to exit the room  the source said   Republican Senator Joni Ernst  of Iowa  asked for more time to study the impact of the price cap  the source said   Take the deal  Joni   Trump said as he walked out of the room  according to the source   Ernst disagreed with the source s description   It s not accurate  That exchange didn t take place   an Ernst spokeswoman said via email on Friday morning  The White House said after the meeting that talks on the issue would continue   Today s meeting is a part of the ongoing effort to best understand the many differing views on this issue  and the president looks forward to continuing this discussion   it said in a statement  Republican Senator Charles Grassley of corn state Iowa  who attended the meeting  said the talks did not yield any final decisions  but that an  emerging solution  could include allowing year round sales of 15 percent ethanol fuel  He added that he opposes a credit price cap  saying such a move could put  thousands of jobs in rural America  at risk  No specific price cap level was discussed at Thursday s meeting  according to the source  but Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas  who has been driving efforts to tweak the RFS on behalf of refiners and who attended the meeting  has proposed limiting credit prices to 10 cents each   a fraction of their current value  Prices for the credits  called RINs  dropped 10 cents to 53 cents each after the meeting  according to traders   Cruz said in a statement with Republican Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania that he was  encouraged that President Trump recognizes the importance of providing relief from crushing RINs costs and expanding the potential market for ethanol    CONTINUE TO PLAY OUT  The biofuels industry had mixed reaction to the meeting  generally supporting the idea of year round sales of high ethanol blend gasoline but worried by the proposed price cap for credits  which some in the industry worry would curtail investment in new blending facilities   The president very clearly understands that the path forward is to allow sales of E15 year round  promote growth  and put more RINs on the market   said Emily Skor  chief executive officer of biofuels producer Growth Energy   Nothing new was discussed in this meeting  Removing accountability from oil companies would deprive millions of Americans the freedom to choose less expensive  homegrown biofuels and imperil countless jobs and family farms across America s heartland   said Jeff Broin  CEO of leading U S  ethanol producer POET  Ethanol producer Green Plains Inc also attended  sources said

178475,399991,VLO,U S  refinery workers head to Washington to urge biofuels reform,news,"By Jarrett Renshaw WASHINGTON  Reuters    A delegation of workers from U S  oil refining companies that oppose the nation s biofuels policy will converge on Washington on Wednesday to lobby lawmakers to find a way to lessen the regulation s costs without hurting corn farmers and makers of the alternative fuels   The trip  organized by the United Steelworkers union  marks the latest move in a battle between Big Oil and Big Corn over the fate of the U S  Renewable Fuel Standard   a law requiring corn based ethanol in gasoline that the refining industry says is costing it hundreds of millions of dollars a year  More than two dozen workers from refiners  Valero Energy  Corp  N VLO   HollyFrontier Corp  N HFC   PBF Energy Inc  N PBF  and bankrupt Philadelphia Energy Solutions  PES  are expected to meet with lawmakers  including House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy  a California Republican  to seek support for changes to the RFS   We are going to try to explain how the RFS hurts merchant refiners and how there are options on the table to reform the program that don t hurt the ethanol industry   said Ryan O Callaghan  president of the United Steelworkers chapter that represents PES  He said the group would urge changes that could lower costs of the RFS to refiners  including potentially placing a price cap on the blending credits at the center of the program  or by shifting the responsibility for blending fuels off of refiners and further down the supply chain  Rural biofuel plant workers and managers delivered a letter to President Donald Trump on Wednesday  reminding him of their industry s economic importance to the nation s heartland   After four straight years of declining agricultural income  your steadfast support of homegrown biofuels has been a lifeline for the farm economy   the group wrote   We ask that you send a clear and final signal that this administration will no longer entertain misleading schemes designed to kill the RFS   The RFS currently requires refiners to cover the cost of blending increasing volumes of biofuels like ethanol into the nation s fuel each year  To prove compliance  refiners must earn or purchase tradable blending credits  known as RINs   the price of which has skyrocketed in recent years  The program  established in 2007 to help farmers and cut petroleum imports  has been an economic driver in corn states such as Iowa  but merchant refiners say the increasing compliance costs are overly burdensome and put jobs at risk   PES  which employs more than 1 000 people in the key electoral state of Pennsylvania  in January blamed its bankruptcy on the costs of the credits  Reuters reported that other factors may also have played a role in its bankruptcy  including the withdrawal of more than  590 million in dividend style payments from the company by its investor owners   The company s financial meltdown has heaped pressure on the White House and lawmakers to address biofuels policy  Last week  President Donald Trump waded deeper into the issue when he told rival groups gathered at the White House that he supported a compromise that temporarily caps credit prices to lower refinery costs  while also lifting restrictions on higher ethanol blended gasoline to boost corn growers  The Environmental Protection Agency currently limits gasoline to 10 percent ethanol during the summer months  a policy intended to reduce ozone emissions and smog during the peak driving season   Like past efforts to overhaul the RFS  Trump s proposal faces political and legal challenges from ethanol industry advocates that worry a credit price cap would undermine the biofuels program   Another White House meeting initially planned for this week to further discuss the idea may be postponed for logistical reasons  two sources said  In the meantime  the U S  Environmental Protection Agency and the U S  Department of Agriculture are preparing an analysis of Trump s proposals for the White House  the sources said

178476,399992,VLO,Earnings Preview  Valero Energy  VLO  Q4 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"The market expects Valero Energy  VLO  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 30  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This oil refiner is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 59 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  25  
Revenues are expected to be  27 59 billion  down 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 11 82  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Valero Energy 
For Valero Energy  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Valero Energy will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Valero Energy would post earnings of  1 35 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 48  delivering a surprise of  9 63  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times

the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 60  However  quarterly earnings decreased from the year ago figure of  2 19 per share Total revenues fell from  28 730 million in the prior year period to  27 879 million in the quarter under review  However  the top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  27 586 million The better than expected results can be attributed to lower cost of sales and processing of a record number of Canadian low cost heavy crude  Higher ethanol prices also supported the results  This was partially offset by lower refining margin and higher corn prices Full year 2019 revenues amounted to  108 3 billion  down from the 2018 figure of  117 billion Valero Energy Corporation Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Segmental PerformanceOperating income from the Refining segment declined to  1 419 million from  1 468 million in the year ago quarter  However  the figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 263 million due to wider sour crude oil differentials  Moreover  weakness in high sulfur residual feedstocks fuelled its performance  Notably  the company processed record 180 000 barrels per day  BPD  of Canadian heavy crude oil through 2019  Also  it exported 343 000 BPD of gasoline and distillate on an average  in 2019 In the Ethanol segment  the company reported operating income of  36 million against a loss of  27 million in the year ago quarter  Moreover  the reported figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a profit of  14 9 million  The upside can be attributed to higher ethanol prices  partially offset by increased corn prices Valero created a new segment during the first quarter  namely Renewable Diesel  which incorporated the operations of a consolidated joint venture  Diamond Green Diesel  Gross operating income from the segment was  541 million compared with  101 million in the year ago period  The figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  83 million  The increase was attributed to rise in renewable diesel sales volumes Expenses   Operating IncomeGeneral and administrative expenses in the Corporate and other segment totaled  243 million compared with the prior year level of  230 million  Total cost of sales fell to  25 876 million in the quarter from the year ago period s  27 184 million Quarterly operating income in the quarter rose to  1 739 million from  1 299 million in the year

barrels per day  MBPD   marginally up from the prior year quarter s 3 013 MBPD  Refinery throughput capacity utilization in the reported quarter was 96  In terms of feedstock composition  sweet crude  medium light sour crude and heavy sour crude accounted for 55 5   8  and 10 9   respectively  of its total volume  The remaining volumes came from residuals  other feedstock blendstocks and others  The Gulf Coast contributed approximately 58 4  to total throughput volume  Mid Continent  North Atlantic and West Coast regions accounted for 15 3   16 9  and 9 4   respectively  of the total throughput volume Throughput MarginsRefining margin per barrel of throughput decreased to  10 90 from the year ago level of  11 03  Refining operating expense per barrel was  3 93 compared with  3 96

178480,399996,VLO,Oil Gets A Lift From EIA Supply Data  Moves Back Above  50,opinion,Oil prices rose  1 14  or 2 3   to  50 75 a barrel on Thursday  recovering slightly from the steep sell off fueled by fears that the coronavirus outbreak in China would have a severe impact on oil demand U S  Crude Benchmark Falls into a Bear MarketThe commodity collapsed into a bear market earlier in the week  having plunged more than 20  from its 52 week high of  63 27 on Jan 6  In fact  the health scare  which has killed over 500 people so far and infected in excess of 28 000  was enough to send oil prices sliding below the psychologically important  50 a barrel for the first time in more than a year Overall  the latest round of energy market selling comes amid heightened worries of the mysterious illness playing out like the 2003 SARS epidemic  Although it is quite difficult at this stage to assess the possible implications  according to Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS   the deadly virus could lower oil demand by up to 260 000 barrels per day if it impacts passenger traffic due to travel restrictions The EIA ReliefIt s the U S  Energy Department s latest inventory release that sent the market higher yesterday  The report revealed decrease in gasoline and distillate supplies  which more than offset the impact of higher than expected rise in crude stocks  Ahead of the EIA publication  oil prices had already been gaining strength on unconfirmed reports about the development of coronavirus vaccines that might stem the outbreak of the deadly strain  Crude price was also supported by indications that the OPEC  group is preparing deeper output cuts to stem the decline Let s review the EIA s Weekly Petroleum Status Report for the week ending Jan 31 Crude Oil  The federal government s EIA report revealed that crude inventories rose by 3 4 million barrels  compared to the 3 million barrels increase that energy analysts had expected  Tepid refinery activity drove the stockpile build with the world s biggest oil consumer even as U S  production dropped from record levels  This puts the total domestic stocks at 435 million barrels   2 7  below the year ago figure and 2  lower than the five year average The latest report also showed that supplies at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma  the key delivery hub for U S  crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange  was up 1 1 million barrels to 36 7 million barrels The crude supply cover was up from 25 9 days in the previous week to 26 5 days  In the year ago period  the supply cover was 26 6 days Turning to products  and it is a fairly bullish story Gasoline Gasoline supplies fell after increasing for 12 straight weeks  The fuel s small drop  91 000 barrels to be precise  is attributable to higher demand  Analysts had forecast 1 9 million barrels climb  At 261 1 million barrels  the current stock of the most widely used petroleum product is 1 2  above the year earlier level and exceeds the five year average range by 4  Distillate  Distillate fuel supplies  including diesel and heating oil  were down for a third consecutive week  The 1 5 million barrels decrease could be attributed to strengthening demand  Meanwhile  the market had been looking for a supply draw of 100 000 barrels  Current supplies   at 143 2 million barrels   are 3  higher than the year ago level but remain 4  below the five year average Refinery Rates  Refinery utilization edged up 0 2  from the prior week to 87 4  About the Weekly Petroleum Status ReportThe Energy Information

Notably  Valero forecasts capital expenditure for 2019 and 2020 to be  2 5 billion each  Around 40  of the budget will be used in growth projects  The company s Pasadena terminal and St  Charles alkylation plus Pembroke cogeneration units are expected to come online in 2020  Moreover  its Diamond Green Diesel expansion and Port Arthur Coker projects are scheduled to be completed in 2021 and 2022  respectively  The growth projects are likely to boost the company s cashflow 
Majority of the company s refining plants are located at the Gulf coast area from where there is an easy access to the export facilities  This Gulf coast presence helped Valero expand its export volumes over the last few years and gain from high distillate margins  Moreover  Valero is poised to benefit from the new standard set by International Maritime Organization  IMO  
Per the standard  likely to be effective 2020  the proportion of sulfur in marine fuel will decline to 0 5  from the current 3 5   thereby boosting demand for distillate fuel  Valero  being a producer of a significant amount of distillate fuel  is expected to capitalize on this 
The company is projected to benefit from the rising export volumes of refined petroleum products  This is because Valero has majority of its refining facilities in the U S  Gulf Coast region  Notably  the company entered into long term accords to utilize three new refined product terminals in Mexico  The leading refining player will be able to expand its product supply chain once the Guadalajara  Monterrey and Altamira terminals commence operations in 2021 
Headwinds
However  there are a few factors that are impeding the stock s growth lately 
In a bid to lower greenhouse gas emissions  Energy Information Administration  EPA  set a Renewable Fuel Standard  Per the new mandate  refiners need to add year over year higher volumes of advanced biofuels to gasoline through 2019  Following this  Valero will be compelled to divert cash to ensure regulatory compliance  which can limit profitability  This is also likely to lead to the refiner incurring higher biofuel blending costs this year 
The slowdown in the global economic growth is likely to hurt demand for refined petroleum products  Being one of the largest refiners in North America with refining contributing the most among all operating segments  weak refined petroleum products  demand is anticipated to drain the company s profit and contract total throughput volumes 
The gasoline crack spread has significantly narrowed recently  denting the company s bottom line  Moreover  the spike in corn price has been ailing the refiner s ethanol business  In the third quarter  the company s Ethanol segment suffered an operating loss of  43 million against a profit of  21 million in the year ago quarter due to steeper corn prices 
Wrapping Up
Despite substantial prospects mentioned above  higher corn prices and sluggish global economic growth are concerns for the company  Nevertheless  we believe that a systematic and strategic plan of action will fuel its long term growthValero Energy Corporation Price and Consensus

178507,400023,VLO,Why Valero Energy  VLO  Is Poised To Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering Valero Energy  VLO   which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas   Refining and Marketing industry 
When looking at the last two reports  this oil refiner has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 9 92   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the most recent quarter  Valero Energy was expected to post earnings of  1 35 per share  but it reported  1 48 per share instead  representing a surprise of 9 63   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  1 37 per share  while it actually produced  1 51 per share  a surprise of 10 22  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Valero Energy lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Valero Energy currently has an Earnings ESP of  1 60   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on January 30  2020 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate

benchmark has increased 26 1  so far this year  Most of the rally was buoyed by trade deal optimism  robust U S  economic indicators and stronger than expected corporate earnings  The Fed s rate cut for the third time in 2019 also whetted the risk appetite of investors The trend is likely to continue though bouts of volatility and instability have kept crossing the bulls The proxy version  SPDR S P 500 ETF Trust  ASX SPY  NYSE SPY    which tracks the S P 500 Index has gained 27 86  year to date But even as the books close for a record setting 2019  energy stocks remain this year s big laggards Energy  The Worst Performing S P SectorWhile major averages are enjoying their best year in nearly a decade  Energy has been the least successful S P 500 sector in 2019 with majority stocks in the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund  XLE  NYSE XLE   languishing in bearish zone Let s discuss the 2019 performance of oil and gas in detail Supply Side Woes and Sino US Trade War Plague the Oil MarketMounting concerns over wilting global demand due to trade war induced slowdown at a time when U S  shale output surged had heightened oversupply fears significantly  This put downward pressure on oil prices despite President Donald Trump s decision to re impose U S  sanctions on Iran last November The most chief catalyst behind crude s selling pressure was the deteriorating outlook for oil demand as the trade feud between the United States and China threatened an economic downturn  The protracted dispute between the world s two biggest economies and oil consumers decelerated growth and prompted analysts to lower forecasts for oil demand Meanwhile  the U S  shale production constantly shot up  Per the EIA  volume from U S  oil fields has expanded more than 50  since mid 2016 to nearly13 million barrels per day  largely driven by a spurt in shale oil production Rising Natural Gas Production Shatters PricesThe natural gas scenario also seems to be gloomy as output in the United States climbed to record levels  The EIA forecasts that the United States will produce 91 4 billion cubic feet a day  Bcf d  of dry natural gas this year  up from the 2018 average of 83 4 Bcf d  marking a record high for the second consecutive year  Soaring volumes are weighing on the outlook for prices What to Expect in 2020It seems the worst is over for the energy markets Oil  WTI crude  the U S  benchmark  bounced back above  60 per barrel after the United States and China agreed on a so called phase one deal that is seen as a step to melting trade tensions  Also boosting oil  the OPEC  group announced trimming output by as much as 500 000 barrels per day from Jan 1 next year for three months  This is in addition to the existing production curbs of 1 2 million barrels per day by OPEC  Russia and other non member oil producers The trade deal helped prop up the demand outlook for oil while OPEC s deeper supply cut pledge is likely to push the market back into supply deficit  Finally  the growth rate of U S  shale oil production is set to slacken substantially in 2020 on reduced capital availability  Natural Gas  Demand for cleaner fuels and the commodity s relatively lower price catapulted natural gas  share of domestic electricity generation to 37  from 25  in 2011  Moreover  new pipelines to Mexico together with large scale liquefied gas export facilities meant that exports out of the United States are set for a quantum leap  Finally  higher consumption from industrial projects will likely ensure buoyant natural gas demand A Handful of Companies Defied the DownturnNotwithstanding the unpredictable  declining market  some companies stood firm  indicating investors  confidence in them  If bought now  these stocks are likely to outperform others and build long term wealth  As mentioned above  there are reasons to believe that 2020 could be favorable for oil and natural gas stocks  However  selecting stocks to bet on could be a tricky proposition  especially with oil prices moving like a roller coaster  One should focus on picking up stocks with a sound business  good management and is not pricey While it is impossible to be sure about such outperformers  this is where the Zacks Rank  which justifies a company s strong fundamentals  can come in really handy  Particularly  we shortlisted five companies that have surpassed oil prices over

178531,400047,VLO,EPA abandons changes to U S  biofuel program after lawmaker pressure,news,"By Jarrett Renshaw NEW YORK  Reuters    The U S  Environmental Protection Agency has backed off a series of proposed changes to the nation s biofuels policy after a massive backlash from corn state lawmakers worried the moves would undercut ethanol demand  according to a letter from the agency to lawmakers seen by Reuters  EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt said in the letter dated Oct  19 that the agency will keep renewable fuel volume mandates for next year at or above proposed levels  reversing a previous move to open the door to cuts   The move marks a big win for the biofuels industry and lawmakers from corn states like Iowa  Nebraska and Illinois  while dealing a blow to merchant refiners like PBF Energy Inc and  Valero Energy  Corp  NYSE VLO  who hoped the administration of President Donald Trump would help provide regulatory relief  The White House issued a statement hours after the Pruitt letter was delivered to lawmakers expressing the president s support for maintaining the renewable fuel plan    President Donald J  Trump promised rural America that he would protect the Renewable Fuel Standard  RFS   and has never wavered from that promise   the White House statement said  Trump s second place finish in the Iowa caucuses in early 2016 gave credibility to his candidacy and he defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton in the state in the Nov  8 election  It was the first time a Republican had won Iowa since George W  Bush in 2004 and provided Trump a key takeaway  The letter could end uncertainty about the future of the U S  Renewable Fuel Standard that has roiled commodity and energy markets for months  The program  which requires refineries to blend increasing amounts of ethanol and other biofuels into the nation s fuel supply or buy credits from those who do  appeared on the verge of a massive overhaul  The most popular form of program credits hit two month highs on Friday on the EPA news  traders said    The so called D6 credits sunk to 68 cents last month as EPA considered cost cutting measures  but prices have rebounded in recent weeks and approached 90 cents on Friday  traders said  Pruitt said the EPA would not pursue another idea floated by EPA leadership that would have allowed exported ethanol to be counted toward those volume quotas  Pruitt also said the EPA did not believe a proposal to shift the biofuels blending obligation away from refiners was appropriate  That plan is backed by representatives of a handful of independent refining companies who have warned the cost of the program will bankrupt plants and cost thousands of jobs  Those ideas would have eased the burden on some in the refining industry  who have argued that biofuels compete with petroleum  and that the blending responsibility costs them hundreds of millions of dollars a year  But Midwestern lawmakers  including Republicans Charles Grassley and Joni Ernst  had vocally opposed all those ideas  calling them a betrayal of the administration s promises to support the corn belt  They were concerned the moves would undercut domestic demand for ethanol  a key industry in the region that has supported corn growers    It s a great day for Iowa and a great day for rural America  Administrator Pruitt should be commended for following through on President Trump s commitment to biofuels   Grassley said in a statement  In the letter  Pruitt said the EPA was prepared to work with Congress to examine the possibility of a waiver that would allow the sale of E15 gasoline  containing 15 percent ethanol  year round   something currently not permitted during the summer due to concerns about smog  Renewable Fuels Association President and Chief Executive Bob Dinneen said in a response to the letter on Friday morning that the U S  ethanol industry was  grateful for Administrator Pruitt s epiphany on the road to the RFS    The program disproportionately hurts mid sized refiners and mom and pop gas stations that are the backbone of the nation s energy infrastructure and needs to reformed  said Greg Blair  a spokesman for the Fueling American Jobs Coalition  a group of merchant refiners formed to seek changes in the program

EIA report revealed that crude inventories rose by 822 000 barrels  compared to the 1 8 million barrels decrease that energy analysts had expected  A combination of surging imports and lower refinery runs largely drove the surprise stockpile build with the world s biggest oil consumer even as U S  production dropped from record levels  This puts the total domestic stocks at 447 9 million barrels

week to 27 1 days  In the year ago period  the supply cover was 25 5 days Turning to products  and it is a fairly bearish story as well Gasoline Gasoline supplies increased for the fifth straight week

the quarter under review  However  the top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  24 594 million The better than expected results can be attributed to lower total cost of sales and the

Specifically  the manufacturer and marketer of transportation fuels and petrochemical products has been  improving returns in refining while growing in the higher value midstream and renewable segments that also support refining ops   Jenkins pointed out  It also continues to maintain a strong balance sheet and return cash to shareholders 
However  Valero is facing various market headwinds  and as such  Raymond James slightly lowered its Q3 19 expectations for the company  Jenkins indicated 
For one  it reduced its Q3 19 earnings per share estimate to  1 30 from  1 50 
Two  for Valero s Refining segment  Raymond James lowered its Q3 19 gross margin forecast to  9 69 per barrel from  9 79 in light of modest capture difficulty in the Midcontinental and North Atlantic regions

178593,400109,VLO,Exclusive  U S  weighs financial sanctions to hit Venezuela s oil revenue   sources,news,"By Marianna Parraga and Matt Spetalnick HOUSTON WASHINGTON  Reuters    The United States is considering financial sanctions on Venezuela that would halt dollar payments for the country s oil  according to a senior White House official and an adviser with direct knowledge of the discussions  The move could severely restrict the OPEC nation s crude exports and starve its socialist government of hard currency  Sanctions prohibiting any transaction in U S  currency by Venezuela s state run oil firm  PDVSA  are among the toughest of various oil related measures under discussion at the White House  the two sources told Reuters  The administration aims to pressure socialist President Nicolas Maduro into aborting plans for a controversial new congress that critics say would cement him as a dictator   Venezuela s oil based economy is in the grip of a brutal recession and a local currency crash  and Maduro has faced months of anti government unrest that has claimed the lives of about 100 people  Sanctions on dollar transactions would make it even harder for Maduro s government to secure cash for debt payments and finance imports of basic goods  The White House declined to comment on the sanctions under consideration  PDVSA and Venezuela s Oil Ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment  The U S  measures under discussion are similar to those that were imposed against Iran over its nuclear program   which halved Iran s oil exports and prevented top crude buyers from paying for Iranian oil   The measures were seen as among the most effective economic sanctions ever imposed and paved the way for a deal that curbed Tehran s nuclear activity  Measures on financial transactions would give President Donald Trump s administration the power to escalate pressure on Venezuela by threatening punishment of any U S  firm doing business with PDVSA or U S  banks processing any of its transactions in dollars   The financial restrictions have been  raised repeatedly  in recent discussions about options for actions against Maduro s government  said the senior White House official  who spoke on condition of anonymity   The administration is also discussing a ban on U S  oil imports from Venezuela  but no final decisions have been reached  the official said   Sanctions on dollar transactions could be more punitive than an import ban because they would make it much more difficult for any refiner or trader to buy Venezuelan oil   not just customers in the United States  The impact of sanctions on PDVSA would ripple across oil markets  forcing refiners to buy alternative supplies  The U S  could use crude from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve  SPR  to blunt the impact of any short term supply shortage  the policy adviser told Reuters   The United States bought 780 000 barrels per day  bpd  of Venezuelan crude and refined products in the first four months of 2017  according to the Energy Information Administration  nearly 8 percent of total imports  PDVSA is a major supplier to  Valero Energy   N VLO   Phillips 66  N PSX    Chevron  Corp  N CVX  and PBF Energy  N PBF   PDVSA s refining unit in the United States  Citgo Petroleum  last month was the second largest recipient of Venezuelan crude  It is unclear how Citgo  being wholly owned by Venezuela  would be impacted by U S  sanctions  Citgo operates three refineries  pipelines and a fuel distribution network in the United States  The threat of sanctions against Venezuela was a key reason for talks this week between PDVSA and Rosneft  Russia s leading state owned oil firm  which is already under U S  sanctions  The negotiations in Moscow  reported by Reuters earlier this week  focused on a proposed swap of Rosneft s collateral stake in Citgo for a host of other Venezuelan oil assets   a move to avoid legal complications  BARTER DEALS CREATE CASH CRUNCH The White House said earlier this week that Trump s administration could take what it called  strong and swift economic actions  against Venezuela as soon as July 30  Other options under consideration by Washington include putting more Venezuelan officials and PDVSA executives on its sanctions list  the two sources told Reuters  Maduro intends to create a superbody called the constituent assembly this year that would have the power to rewrite the country s constitution  It would supersede other institutions and replace the democratically elected National Assembly   Maduro has decried what he calls  imperialist meddling  by U S  officials  Several governments in Latin America also have called on Maduro to abandon the assembly plan  But officials in neighboring countries also expressed concern that U S  economic sanctions would trigger famine in Venezuela  which is already reeling from shortages of food and medicine  PDVSA s cash flow has plummeted in recent years  in part due to the Venezuelan government s deals to barter its oil to other nations in exchange for fuels  services and loans  Chinese and Russian entities currently take about 40 percent of all PDVSA s exports as repayment for more than  50 billion in loans to Venezuela and its oil company in the last decade  according to a Reuters analysis of its sales  PDVSA also barters with Caribbean nations  Indian refiner Reliance  NS RELI  and its unit Citgo  Almost all of PDVSA s cash paying customers are in the United States and India  and the preferred currency for oil transactions worldwide is the U S  dollar  PDVSA currently collects most payments from oil exports using China s Citic Bank  SS 601998   but customers making dollar transfers require a correspondent bank in the United States to guarantee the money arrives in China  The Venezuelan oil firm has been struggling to find correspondent banks in the United States since Citibank a year ago suspended providing that service  It would have even fewer options to collect dollars if the sanctions are levied  The company could seek payment in euros through European bank accounts  or use other non dollar denominated transactions  But the European Union could also take similar measures to prevent transactions in euros  following the lead of the United States  SANCTION THREAT RATTLES U S  REFINERS The crude import ban has been strongly opposed by oil companies and crude processors because of the impact it could have on the refining sector  especially on the U S  Gulf Coast   Administration officials have heard from U S  refiners on the hardships an import ban could have on their businesses and  are now measuring its potential impact on prices  market movement   and  inventories   the policy adviser to the White House told Reuters  Phillips 66   the third largest buyer of Venezuelan crude in the United States this year   said on Thursday that the administration should  carefully consider  sanctions that would affect U S  refiners and not prevent the sale of Venezuelan crude elsewhere   Valero did not respond to a request for comment  Chevron declined to comment   Chet Thompson  chief executive of trade group American Fuel   Petrochemical Manufacturers  AFPM   has been calling and writing White House officials  urging they consider something other than an Venezuelan oil import ban  Some refineries get up to half their supply from Venezuela  he said in an interview Friday    It s not easily replaced   he said  adding that the sanctions also may not have their intended effect

178638,400154,VLO,Earnings Preview  Valero Energy  VLO  Q2 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Valero Energy  VLO  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 25  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This oil refiner is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 55 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  27 9  
Revenues are expected to be  26 65 billion  down 14 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 6 17  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Valero Energy 
For Valero Energy  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  4 70  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Valero Energy will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Valero Energy would post earnings of  0 20 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 34  delivering a surprise of  70  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Valero Energy doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-valero-energy-vlo-q2-earnings-expected-to-decline-200441343,200441343

178642,400158,VLO,White House weighs U S  biofuels program change  no position yet  official,news,"By Emily Stephenson
WASHINGTON  Reuters    The Trump administration is reviewing the possibility of a key change to U S  biofuels policy requested by oil refiners and Carl Icahn  the billionaire investor and special advisor on regulations to President Donald Trump  a White House official said on Monday 
The administration has no position  either way on this issue at this time   the White House official confirmed to Reuters  The statements come after news last week that Icahn had reached out to the White House regarding the change 
The debate centers on the Renewable Fuel Standard  RFS   a 2005 policy that requires increasing volumes of biofuels to be added to gasoline and diesel each year  Oil refiners including  Valero Energy  Corp  NYSE VLO  and CVR Energy Inc currently have to show environmental regulators they are meeting those annual mandates  and have urged the government to push this compliance further downstream to fuel blenders and integrated oil companies 
Opponents of the change say it will complicate ensuring compliance and that it could threaten the future of the RFS policy that sets the annual requirements for use of biofuels with gasoline and diesel 
Confusion over Trump s plans for RFS sparked wild swings in energy and agricultural markets last week  Carl Icahn  who owns a majority stake in CVR  said he had reached out to the White House about the issue 
The Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  has also been reviewing requests from oil refiners including Valero Energy Corp and Delta Air Lines  NYSE DAL  Inc s Monroe Energy LLC  A public comment period on the issue wrapped up late last month

178656,400172,VLO,Big Dakota pipeline to upend oil delivery in U S ,news,"By Catherine Ngai and Liz Hampton
NEW YORK HOUSTON  Reuters    It may seem odd that the opening of one pipeline crossing through four U S  Midwest states could upend the movement of oil throughout the country  but the Dakota Access line may do just that 
At the moment  crude oil moving out of North Dakota s prolific Bakken shale to  refinery row  in the U S  Gulf must travel a circuitous route through the Rocky Mountains or the Midwest and into Oklahoma  before heading south to the Gulf of Mexico 
The 450 000 barrel per day Dakota Access line  when it opens in the fourth quarter  will change that by providing U S  Gulf refiners another option for crude supply 
Gulf Coast refiners and North Dakota oil producers will reap the benefits  Losers will include the struggling oil by rail industry which now brings crude to the coasts 
The pipeline also will create headaches for East and West Coast refiners  which serve the most heavily populated parts of the United States and consume a combined 4 1 million barrels of crude daily  They will have to rely more on foreign imports 
The pipeline  currently under construction  will connect western North Dakota to the Energy Transfer Crude Oil Pipeline Project  ETCOP  in Patoka  Illinois  From there  it will connect to the Nederland and Port Arthur  Texas  area  where refiners including  Valero Energy   NYSE VLO   Total and Motiva Enterprises operate some of the largest U S  refining facilities 
 That s a better and cheaper path than going out West and down through the Rockies   said Bernadette Johnson  managing partner at Ponderosa Advisors LLC  an energy advisory based in Denver 
CHEAPER THAN RAIL
Moving crude by pipeline is generally cheaper than using railcars  The flagging U S  crude by rail industry already is moving only half as much oil as it did two years ago  volumes peaked at 944 000 bpd in October 2014  but were around just 400 000 bpd in May  according to the U S  Energy Department 
Rail transport has become less economical for East and West Coast refiners when compared with importing Brent crude  the foreign benchmark  because declining supply out of North Dakota made that grade of oil less affordable 
 If you look at the Brent to Bakken arb  it s tight   said Afolabi Ogunnaike  a senior refining analyst at Wood Mackenzie in Houston   If you look at the spot rate  it s uneconomical to move crude by rail right now  
Ponderosa Advisors estimated that the start up of the pipeline could reroute an additional 150 000 to 200 000 bpd currently carried by rail to the U S  East Coast and Gulf Coast 
Crude imports into the East Coast are now on the rise  averaging 788 000 bpd this year  with nearly 960 000 bpd in July  the highest level in three years  according to Thomson Reuters data 
On the West Coast  refiners like Shell  LON RDSa   Tesoro and  BP   LON BP  may have to commit to some railed volumes for longer because of shipping constraints  although it will largely depend on rail economics  They also face declining output from California and Alaska 
Tesoro s top executive Gregory Goff told analysts and investors last week he expects rail costs to drop as much as 40 percent from the current  9 to  10 barrel cost to compete with pipelines  in order to move Bakken to its Anacortes  Washington  refinery 
CHANGING TIDES
Rail companies have been trying to adapt  CSX Corp  NASDAQ CSX   which runs a network of lines in the eastern part of the country  said it was evaluating potential impacts of the pipeline  BNSF Railway declined to discuss future freight movements  but said that at its peak  it transported as many as 12 trains daily filled with crude  primarily from the Bakken  Today  it is moving less than half of that 
In a recent earnings call  midstream player Crestwood Equity Partners said it was working to capitalize on the pipeline and not be dependent on loading crude barrels onto trains  That includes building an interconnection to its 160 000 barrel per day COLT crude rail facility in North Dakota 
As refiners bring in more barrels from overseas  Brent s premium over U S  crude will eventually widen  On Thursday  December Brent futures settled at a 97 cent premium to U S  crude  one of its widest premiums this year 

Separately  Bakken crude  a light barrel  could rise further due to the additional competition  especially as production is still falling  Bakken differentials hit a six month low earlier this week of  2 65 a barrel below WTI  according to Reuters data  but rose to a  1 80 a barrel discount by Thursday ",2016-08-12,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/big-dakota-pipeline-to-upend-oil-delivery-in-u.s.-420043,420043

178660,400176,VLO,U S  refiners cash in on Mexico s record fuel imports,news,"By Devika Krishna Kumar and Marianna Parraga NEW YORK HOUSTON  Reuters    U S  Gulf Coast refiners are cashing in on rising fuel demand from Mexico  shipping record volumes to a southern neighbor that has failed to expand its refining network to supply a fast growing economy  The fuel trade could top a million barrels per day  bpd  at times in 2017 as Mexico becomes increasingly dependent on the United States for strategic energy supplies and providing business worth more than  15 billion a year to refiners such as Valero  N VLO   Marathon Petroleum  N MPC  and Citgo Petroleum  The rise in Mexico s fuel imports reflects an economy that  after expanding for 27 quarters in a row even amid a public austerity plan  has been unable to increase its refining output to satisfy the consistent growth of its energy demand   It has led to rapid reversal in energy trade between the two countries  In 2016  crude exporter Mexico will be a net oil importer from the United States for the first time as shipments of refined fuel heading south outnumber shipments of crude to the north  according to the U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA   Just ten years ago  the United States  net oil imports from Mexico stood at 1 45 million bpd  Profit margins for the exports are strong for U S  Gulf Coast refiners  said a source at a refiner involved in the trade   You re getting very good values if you re a Gulf coast supplier   he said   Freight has been dirt cheap too   so it doesn t cost that much to move the barrels either   Mexico constitutes a bright spot in what has otherwise been a dark year the U S  refining industry with profits at a five year low in 2016   Mexico s appetite for U S  gasoline and distillates has played a significant part in sustaining Gulf Coast refining margins   said Sandy Fielden  director of oil and products research at Morningstar  The exports also help to ease a supply glut in the U S  market  said  Barclays   LON BARC  equity analyst Paul Cheng  That boosts profit margins industry wide  even for refiners that are not directly involved in the trade  he added  Other than state run Pemex  among the top exporters of U S  gasoline and distillates to Mexico to date in 2016 are Citgo Petroleum   Exxon Mobil   N XOM  and Marathon  according to partial data based on shipping data from Thomson Reuters  A full breakdown combining marine  road  rail and pipeline exports by company is not publicly available  That data shows Citgo  PDVSAC UL   owned by Venezuela s state oil firm PDVSA  has exported nearly 57 000 bpd of fuels to Mexico  while Marathon has shipped about 43 000 bpd  Last year   Valero Energy   N VLO  was the top exporter with nearly 62 000 bpd  Based on the price for benchmark U S  gasoline  RBc1  trading at over  65 a barrel  that volume of Citgo s exports are worth around  1 4 billion and Marathon s around  1 billion       Link to graphic on Mexico s energy imports from the U S     Despite the rising volume of exports to Mexico  publicly traded U S  Gulf refiners are valued below their peers  Marathon is trading at 14 67 times its expected earnings  while Valero is at 12 51  That compared to an industry median of 16 10 in oil and gas refining   Valero did not respond to requests for comment on this story  Marathon said they would not go into detail about its exports  and Exxon Mobil also declined to comment   RISING CONSUMPTION The shortfall between demand and supply in Mexico has been exacerbated by the government slashing the budget for oil giant Petroleos Mexicanos  Pemex   Pemex faces a further cut of around  5 36 billion in 2017  which hurts its ability to improve refinery output  Refineries in Mexico are running at about 60 percent of their 1 576 million bpd of capacity  according to the company s data  That leaves the onus on Pemex to import more to cover demand  For decades  imports were a burden on state coffers  as Mexico made a loss on fuel sales at the pump while they were heavily subsidized rate  Mexico s fuel demand is around 2 04 million bpd and the government expects growth of 2 3 percent per year in coming years  The country is the world s fourth largest consumer of gasoline  Car sales through September increased 18 percent on the year  to a record of 1 12 million units  pointing to continued strong demand growth    We continue to see very good demand for gasoline into Mexico and South America    we see good growth in that region   Gary Simmons  a senior executive at Valero  said on a conference call  In September  Mexico s imports of U S  fuel surged to a monthly record of about 960 000 bpd  according to the EIA  The average for the year to date is around 820 000 bpd  Most of the exports are seaborne  but rail firms have also benefited with a sharp rise in volumes shipped over the border on trains  according to the Association of American Railroads  Mexico s government opened the industry to private capital in 2013 to reverse a protracted slide in oil output  refining and reserves  Pemex still buys most of the imports from the U S  Gulf refiners  but private imports are expected to grow in 2017 with further liberalization and improved cross border infrastructure   We are expecting Mexico s imports from the U S  to increase to an average of 900 000 barrels per day  bpd  in 2017    imports would surpass 1 million bpd at times in 2017 if private imports become significant after price liberalization   said Robert Campbell  head of oil products research at Energy Aspects  TRADE CONCERN President elect Donald Trump s plans to rewrite the terms of trade between the two countries have made importers and exporters nervous that a deterioration in bilateral relations or changes in taxes and tariffs could disrupt the flow    Even a minimum change in taxes could mess up gasoline exports to Mexico   a source working at a terminal and pipeline operator doing business with Pemex said   Everybody is worried  but nobody says it     More difficult trade could force Mexico to look for other supply sources such as Europe  but it is difficult for European refiners to export fuel at a price competitive with their rivals in the United States due to shipping costs  Some of the top ranking members of Trump s cabinet are from the energy industry  adding even more clout to one of the most powerful lobbies in Washington which will push hard to prevent Trump doing anything that would hurt the trade  
 Whatever restrictions might be placed on trade and immigrant flows between Mexico and the U S  during the Trump Administration  U S  energy producers will be anxious to protect growing hydrocarbon exports to our southern neighbor   said Fielden ",2016-12-22,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/u.s.-refiners-cash-in-on-mexico's-record-fuel-imports-449362,449362
178661,400177,VLO,Border tax ideas roil oil markets  favor Gulf Coast refiners,news,"By Liz Hampton and Catherine Ngai HOUSTON NEW YORK  Reuters    As with many industries now fretting over the uncertain future of U S  trade policy  the oil business is sizing up the potential impact of the various protectionist measures being bandied about Washington   which have sent crude markets into a tizzy  The trade proposal with the most momentum may be the controversial tax reform  pushed by Republicans in Congress  that could slap a tax of up to 20 percent on all imports  including crude oil  That would spark a rise in fuel costs across the country that would hurt East and West Coast refiners more than those near the Gulf of Mexico   It would also hit the pocketbooks of drivers and airline passengers  as refiners pass on the nearly  30 billion that the tax could cost them each year on crude imports   The consumer is really the one that suffers   Cynthia Warner  executive vice president for operations at refiner  Tesoro  Corp  NYSE TSO   said earlier this month at a conference in Houston  Tesoro operates seven refineries  two in California  two in North Dakota and one each in Utah  Alaska and Washington   The  border adjustment  tax could also redraw trade maps for global flows of crude and refined products  U S  crude producers would be the obvious beneficiaries as their overseas rivals bear heavy taxes on imports  which are used often by coastal refiners  especially those without direct access to U S  pipelines  Higher prices for domestic crude would make pumping from more U S  fields economically viable   encouraging higher output from the shale patch and giving more momentum to a nascent recovery in the U S  shale industry after a brutal international price war  While that likely would not put a big dent in the 7 9 million barrels per day  bpd  that the U S  imports  Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  estimates that U S  oil exploration and production firms would benefit to the tune of  20 billion from higher domestic crude price and increased production  Crude markets have been buffeted by the public back and forth between President Donald Trump and the Republican party over various tax proposals   Contradictory signals from Trump sent the oil markets up and down in recent days  U S  crude fell to its biggest discount to Brent crude in five months last week after Trump appeared to poured cold water on the idea as  too complex    The next day  he said the tax would be discussed   and U S  crude rose relative to Brent   Traders had speculated on the tax with an options bet that the value of U S  crude would rise above the global Brent crude benchmark  Trump s comments caused volatility in trade of those options  which in turn impacted benchmark oil prices  Investment bank Goldman Sachs estimated in a report this week the border tax proposal had a 20 percent chance of passing  But White House chief of staff Reince Priebus seemed to move the President closer to supporting the border adjustment tax on Thursday  in the context of discussing how to make Mexico pay for a security wall on U S  border with Mexico  his signature campaign promise   Asked if Trump favored a border adjustment tax  Priebus said such a tax would be  one way  of paying for the border wall   30 BILLION IN IMPORT COSTS Border taxes are part of a broader tax reform plan that is being pushed by Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan as an alternative to a variety of protectionist trade policies discussed in a more ad hoc way by Trump   While Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on specific industries or countries in an effort to boost U S  manufacturing  Ryan s border adjustment tax would tax all imports at 20 percent  Exports would be tax free   That could add more than  30 billion to the annual import bill for U S  refiners  assuming an oil price of  53 per barrel on the 7 9 million bpd of imports that fuel the world s largest economy  A steep rise in import costs would squeeze the margins of refiners dependent on foreign crude shipments such as  Chevron   NYSE CVX  and PBF Energy  But all refiners would see feedstock prices rise if the tax pushed up domestic crude prices   and it would  because there is not enough U S  crude to meet demand  To cover the costs to refiners  retail gasoline prices would need to increase by 13 percent  or 30 cents a gallon  energy consultant Philip Verleger estimated in a report last month  Diesel would rise by 11 percent  or 27 cents a gallon   That would be the equivalent of adding  300 to  400 per year to the average consumers  gasoline tab   Barclays   LON BARC  Capital said earlier this month  Aside from oil refiners  automakers and retailers oppose the tax  Those against the measure include billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch  who spend heavily to support Republican candidates and conservative policies and own a refinery that imports crude  Republicans  who now control the House and Representatives and the Senate  say that if U S  companies want the lower corporation tax from its current level of 35 percent   a move supported by both Trump and Ryan   then they have to accept the border tax on imports  COSTS FOR COASTAL REFINERS The refining industry as a whole opposes the tax  which would separate it from the global oil marketplace  But East and West Coast refiners have more reason to worry   Coastal refiners import more foreign oil and typically have a competitive advantage over inland counterparts in accessing imports because they can buy a wider range of crude oil in various qualities  That advantage would evaporate with the tax   Anybody who is importing crude and not exporting very much   mostly refiners on the East and West Coasts   is going to be in a worse position   said Sandy Fielden  director of oil and products research at Morningstar   Their raw material cost will have gone up  and that will eat into their margins   Chevron  which operates two refineries in California with capacity of more than 500 000 barrels per day  is the largest importer of foreign crude  according to government data from 2016   For the first ten months of 2016  Chevron imported some 213 million barrels  excluding Canadian imports  That s followed by  Valero Energy   NYSE VLO   which imported 194 million barrels  and Phillips 66  NYSE PSX   which imported 130 million barrels   Phillips 66 said it was analyzing the potential impacts of such a law  while Chevron  Valero and PBF Energy did not respond to requests for comment  West Coast refiners may feel the pinch less than those on the East Coast  because they have access to Alaskan crude cargoes

178678,400194,VLO,Earnings Preview  Valero Energy  VLO  Q1 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"The market expects Valero Energy  VLO  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 25  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This oil refiner is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 20 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  80  
Revenues are expected to be  23 57 billion  down 10 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 18 45  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Valero Energy 
For Valero Energy  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Valero Energy will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Valero Energy would post earnings of  1 03 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 12  delivering a surprise of  105 83  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Valero Energy doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-valero-energy-vlo-q1-earnings-expected-to-decline-200408486,200408486

This year  higher prices drew the attention of California Attorney General Kamala Harris  who in May subpoenaed California refiners as part of a probe into whether they manipulated gasoline prices since 2014  A similar investigation in 2006 found no evidence of manipulation ",2016-07-29,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/wholesale-california-gasoline-prices-plunge,-consumers-still-pay-up-417305",417305
178686,400202,VLO,EPA should change biofuels program to help small fuel retailers  letter,news,"By Chris Prentice  Reuters    U S  regulators should alter a much debated biofuels program that disadvantages small fuel retailers  said the chairman of a newly formed coalition  joining the likes of refiners including  Valero Energy  Corp  NYSE VLO   which have made a similar push  The Renewable Fuel Standard  RFS  gives an unfair advantage to large petroleum retailers and sidelines smaller ones  Bill Douglass  the founder of Texas based Douglass Distributing and Chairman of the Small Retailers Coalition  said in a letter to Janet McCabe  the Environmental Protection Agency s  EPA  acting assistant administrator for air and radiation  The EPA oversees the RFS  setting annual targets as to how many gallons of ethanol and other renewable fuels need to be blended with gasoline and diesel  Oil refiners and importers are required to prove compliance with the policy by either blending biofuels or buying paper credits  known as RINs  from companies that are in compliance  Higher annual targets and soaring prices for RINs have prompted Valero and other refiners to press the agency to consider pushing the obligation to comply with the program to later this year   The EPA is considering a petition from refiner Valero to consider altering the RFS to push the onus of proving compliance from oil refiners further downstream to companies that blend the fuels   The fact that small retailers are joining refiners in the push is significant  Large fuel retailers have historically opposed the change  Companies like fuel retailers  which blend fuels  benefit from selling RINs to obligated parties such as refiners  Those profits could soar this year as prices of the credits have jumped to highs not seen since 2013 on supply worries due to more ambitious targets for biofuels  fueling the complaints from refiners  Biofuels supporters note that the higher profits from blending biofuels help justify the costs to overhaul infrastructure to introduce the new fuels  But the  windfall profits  from selling RINs gives large fuel retailers an unfair advantage over smaller ones in a business that is largely about scale  Douglass said in the letter dated July 28   The current system needlessly tilts the playing field toward large retailers   Douglass said  In May  the EPA proposed targets for biofuels use in 2017 that disappointed both biofuels producers and oil companies alike

178700,400216,VLO,Venezuelan Sanctions Could Mean Oil Prices Rise Sharply In May,opinion,"The political crisis in Venezuela took a new turn this week when President Trump issued sanctions on Venezuela s national oil company  PdVSA  The objective of this move is to prevent Nicholas Maduro  whom the United States and many other countries no longer consider the legitimate leader of Venezuela  from benefiting from oil revenue  It is  however  also likely to hit oil supplies and raise gasoline prices in the U S   as well as impact global oil prices in the medium term 

Technically  the United States is not embargoing sales of oil from Venezuela to the U S  Rather  the sanctions prohibit companies in the U S  from transferring payment to the Maduro controlled government  Refineries can continue to pay for Venezuelan oil  but the money will be held in accounts in the United States  possibly to be transferred at a later stage to a non Maduro controlled Venezuelan government  In reaction  Maduro has forbidden PdVSA from loading any oil on U S  bound ships unless they have received payment in advance  This will effectively halt Venezuelan oil shipments to the U S  though oil cargoes currently en route will be permitted to proceed normally 
In December  refineries in the U S  imported about 574 000 barrels per day of Venezuelan oil  The effect of the sanctions on U S  oil supplies won t be immediate  because shipments on the seas now will be allowed to proceed  But  if the political issues remain unresolved  refineries in the U S  will feel the crunch in a few weeks  This oil can t be easily replaced with oil produced in the U S   because Venezuela exports heavy sour crude and the U S  produces mainly light sweet crude 
The two can t be interchanged in the refining process unless refineries are reconfigured  And while there are other sources of heavy sour crude  such as the Canadian tar sands and various producers in the Middle East  there are logistical and supply impediments to rerouting this crude to refineries in the U S 
When the Trump administration issued the sanctions  Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said he didn t expect oil supplies in the U S  to be adversely affected because production in the Middle East will increase to compensate  It is true that Saudi Arabia  Kuwait and the UAE could increase production  but it s extremely unlikely these countries will do so  In fact  Saudi Arabia said that it is decreasing its production to 10 2 million barrels per day in February and that it will be cutting exports to the United States but maintaining shipments to Asia  This could spell trouble for U S  oil supplies in late February and into March 
However  there are a few factors that will blunt a coming supply crunch in the U S  The first is that the U S  has quite a lot of excess gasoline in storage due  in part  to a temporary halt in gasoline exports to Mexico  The second is that refineries in the U S  will soon begin their regular seasonal maintenance and switchover to summer gasoline blends  Crude oil demand typically drops during this time as refineries in various regions undergo staggered and temporary shut downs  Because U S  refineries have been running at record levels and gasoline exports have slowed  there are excess gasoline supplies to cushion the impact of the sanctions 
In fact  the supply crunch in the U S  may mainly be felt by the primary importers of Venezuelan crude  Citgo  Chevron  NYSE CVX   PBF Energy  NYSE PBF  and Valero Energy  NYSE VLO  import significant amounts of Venezuelan crude  These refineries will have difficulty securing alternative sources of heavy sour crude  and it is likely that U S  consumers will see higher prices and possibly even shortages at the gasoline stations that receive products from these refineries 
Depending on their contracts  the service stations could try to purchase gasoline from other refiners if the Citgo supply is unavailable  but the costs will be higher  Citgo gas stations may be the most adversely impacted because they provide a special branded type of gasoline that they get from Citgo refineries  It is unclear if Citgo stations would need to rebrand and change advertising if they were supplied by alternative refineries 
It is possible that Maduro may relinquish control in the near term  but it isn t likely given that he is receiving support from China and Russia and maintains control over the Venezuelan army  In the probable event that this crisis drags on  oil prices could rise sharply in May  At that point  it becomes likely that the Venezuela crisis and current OPEC production cuts could combine with the end of Iran sanction exemptions  to make oil prices jump ",2019-01-31,"Ellen R.

178704,400220,VLO,Exclusive  Energy Transfer has held talks to sell Sunoco   sources,news,"By Mike Stone
 Reuters     Energy Transfer  Equity LP  N ETE   the U S  pipeline company that agreed to acquire Williams Companies Inc  N WMB   has held talks to sell gas station and convenience store operator Sunoco LP  N SUN   according to three people familiar with the matter 
While these discussions were preliminary  they underscore Energy Transfer s efforts to bolster its balance sheet after a plunge in oil prices made its pending acquisition of Williams more financially burdensome than it previously envisioned 
Energy Transfer held conversations to sell Sunoco earlier this year after it was approached by at least one interested company  the sources said this week  who asked not to be identified because the deliberations were confidential 
Energy Transfer and Sunoco did not respond to requests for comment 
The potential sale would have involved Energy Transfer s ownership of the general partnership of Sunoco  which could be valued at more than  2 billion  the people said 
A 36 4 percent stake in the limited partnership in Sunoco owned by Energy Transfer Partner LP  N ETP   a master limited partnership  would also have been divested  the people added  Sunoco has a market capitalization of  3 3 billion 
The discussions about a sale never advanced because of disagreements over Sunoco s valuation  the people said  cautioning that Energy Transfer may choose to revisit the potential divestment if it receives new interest 
Sunoco operates about 900 convenience stores and fuel outlets in eight U S  states  offering merchandise  food service and motor fuel  It also distributed about 7 6 billion gallons of motor fuel across the United States in 2015 
Logical buyers for Sunoco s gas station network could include Canada s  Alimentation Couche Tard Inc   TO ATDb    Valero Energy  Corp  N VLO  or  Tesoro  Corp  N TSO   sources said 
An Alimentation Couche Tard spokeswoman  Karen Romer  said the company was always looking for acquisitions  but would not comment on whether the company had approached Energy Transfer with an interest in Sunoco  Tesoro also declined to comment  while Valero did not respond to a request for comment 
Energy Transfer s acquisition agreement with Williams in September valued the latter at  33 billion in stock and cash  Since then  pipeline company stocks have been pummeled as their oil exploration and production clients suffer from low oil prices 
In the wake of the selloff  the implied value of the deal is now  14 billion  As a result  the  6 billion cash portion of ETE s deal with Williams  which is scheduled to close in the first half of 2016  has gone from a minor consideration to a major portion  nearly half of the deal s value  A sale of Sunoco would help Energy Transfer recoup much of that cash 
Energy Transfer is not able to walk away from the deal  under its current terms  But Williams shareholders still need to vote to approve the deal  Williams has not yet set a date for the shareholder vote 
In another move to raise cash  Energy Transfer disclosed this week that a minority of its shareholders  including its billionaire chief executive Kelcy Warren  would receive convertible units in the company in exchange for foregoing some of their dividends for up to nine quarters 
Williams responded by arguing that it had offered to work with Energy Transfer to develop a way to finance the deal that is more beneficial for both companies investors

178724,400240,VLO,Analysts Estimate Valero Energy  VLO  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Valero Energy  VLO  reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 31  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This oil refiner is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 04 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  10 3  
Revenues are expected to be  29 07 billion  up 10 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 33 08  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Valero Energy 
For Valero Energy  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Valero Energy will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Valero Energy would post earnings of  1 95 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 01  delivering a surprise of  3 08  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times

An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

178730,400246,VLO,Exclusive  Exxon Mobil puts Torrance  Calif  refinery up for sale   sources,news,"By Jessica Resnick Ault  Reuters    Exxon Mobil Corp   N XOM  has put its Torrance  California  refinery on the block  according to two people familiar with the matter  making it the latest big oil company to consider exiting the state amid tougher environmental standards 
 Torrance has been looked at extensively   said one of the people  who was not authorized to speak about the sale 
The 155 000 barrel per day  bpd  refinery  in the south part of Los Angeles  is Exxon s only refinery in California and the second smallest of its half dozen plants in the United States 
An Exxon Mobil spokesman said the company does not comment on market rumors or speculation  adding that the firm  regularly evaluates its global portfolio of businesses and opportunities for growth  restructuring or divestment  in accordance with the company s overall strategic business objectives  
He said ExxonMobil remains committed to conducting business in California 
BP  L BP  halted refining in the state with the sale of its Carson  California  plant to Tesoro last year  Shell  L RDSa  sold its Wilmington refinery to Tesoro in 2007  leaving it with a single plant in the state 
California s environmental regulations make it a difficult state for refiners to operate in  Refiners including Chevron  N CVX   ConocoPhillips  N COP   Tesoro  N TSO  and Valero  N VLO  already operate two or more refineries in the state  limiting their ability to buy others 
Despite regulatory difficulties  PBF Energy Inc  N PBF  has said it has mulled refinery purchases in the state 
PBF has been  looking at opportunities particularly in California  and we say particularly in California because that s where most of the opportunities have been  it s a market where we have as a team experience  it s a very difficult market   Executive Chairman Tom O Malley said on the company s earnings call last month 
 I always warn our team that when we look at California  we must look at it to some degree almost as a different country and as a different set of requirements  but we re familiar with them and certainly we have lived with them in the past  
PBF did not immediately respond to a request for comment 
Other potential buyers could include private equity firms  according to the two people

178731,400247,VLO,High Noon on the Gulf Coast  Canada  Saudi oil set for showdown ,news,"By Catherine Ngai  NEW YORK  Reuters    As a test of wills between OPEC nations and U S  shale drillers fuels a global oil market slump  a brewing battle between Canadian and Saudi Arabia heavy crudes for America s Gulf Coast refinery market threatens to drive prices even lower   While the stand off between the oil cartel and U S  producers of light  sweet shale oil has captured the limelight in recent months  the clash over heavier grades   playing out in the shadowy  opaque physical market   may put even more pressure on global prices that have halved since mid 2014   Two factors will come into play over the next few weeks  From the North  new oil pipelines will pump record volumes of Canadian crude to the southern refineries  many better equipped to process heavy crudes than lighter shale oil   From the Middle East  top exporter Saudi Arabia is offering crude at discounted prices in an attempt to defend its remaining share of the important regional market  which has shrunk by more than half in recent months    So far  the Gulf Coast has suffered from an oversupply of light oil  but now there s competition for heavier crude   said Sandy Fielden at RBN Energy  With the Saudis already facing fierce competition for their light grades  the arrival of Canadian crude  could add insult to injury   he said   On Monday  Saudi Aramco stepped up its counteroffensive  cutting its monthly U S  bound price for Arab Medium for a sixth straight month  putting it at the deepest discount against the regional sour crude benchmark since December 2013   OSP SA    The timing of this clash may magnify its market impact as Houston area oil refiners shut down for maintenance in early spring  further reducing their demand by an estimated 1 million barrels a day  bpd     We ll see that overhang into the summer  at least   said one physical crude trader   That will put further pressure on U S  prices and may spur investors in New York and London to extend a sell off in crude futures    SPOILT FOR CHOICE  The looming clash of barrels comes at a time when oil markets already face a global glut expected to last for a year or longer   Large volumes of foreign heavy oil reaching the Gulf Coast will give many U S  refiners more choice after they have upgraded their systems to process cheaper  heavier crudes  The new supply also marks a breakthrough in Canada s years long effort to bring its growing Alberta oil sands crude output to new markets   Enbridge Inc s  TO ENB  600 000 bpd Flanagan South pipeline  which runs from Illinois down to the Cushing  Oklahoma  oil hub began commercial service on Dec  1  Enterprise Product Partner  N EPD  announced that its 450 000 bpd Seaway Twin pipeline from Oklahoma to Freeport  Texas  shipped its first volumes on Dec  21   That promises another quantum leap for Canadian crude after its U S  Gulf Coast sales already hit a record 274 000 bpd in October  nearly three times as much as a year earlier  according to U S  data   The new flows will compete with other crudes as well  Some refiners see Saudi s medium crude as a more direct substitute for Mexican and Venezuelan crudes   However  some refiners are likely to blend oil sands crude with overabundant super light U S  condensate  creating medium blends that may rival Saudi Arabia s main grade  said Citi global commodities strategist Ed Morse  He warns the clash could set up another tumble in global prices   The growing pressure on the Gulf market is already showing up in pricing and inventories   Mars Sour   a domestic grade similar to Arab Medium  has fallen to a discount of  1 90 a barrel compared with U S  crude futures after trading at a premium over 45 cents two months ago   Crude oil inventories in the U S  Gulf have risen to nearly 200 million barrels  a record high for late December and up some 15 percent from a year earlier    The build up comes as Saudi Arabia shifts its focus to fiercely defend what remains of its market in the United States   the world s largest consumer of oil   Until recently  it seemed to be holding its own in part thanks to a major expansion of its joint venture Motiva Enterprises refinery   Saudi crude sales to the U S  Gulf rose by a third to a record high of nearly 1 million bpd in the two years to 2012  a period where gushing shale production had begun to displace foreign suppliers   But this year it has begun to lose ground  with shipments tumbling to 461 000 bpd in October  data from the U S  Energy Information Administration showed   Ironically enough  the decline was driven partly by a one third cut in imports by Motiva  jointly owned by Saudi Aramco and Royal Dutch Shell  L RDSa    Other customers have also turned away  Valero Energy Corp s  N VLO  cut imports by 85 percent in the first 10 months of 2014  with Saudi purchases falling to just 35 000 bpd  according to EIA data  Marathon Petroleum Co  N MPC  cut Gulf Coast imports to 33 000 bpd in October from 205 000 bpd 10 months earlier   While most Saudi customers agree on annual contracts with little room to reduce purchases  the Kingdom s state oil firm knows it needs attractive prices to retain long term buyers

178752,400268,VLO,Can Valero Energy  VLO  Keep The Earnings Surprise Streak Alive ,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering Valero Energy  VLO   which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas   Refining and Marketing industry 
This oil refiner has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 5 29  
For the most recent quarter  Valero Energy was expected to post earnings of  1 95 per share  but it reported  2 01 per share instead  representing a surprise of 3 08   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  2 per share  while it actually produced  2 15 per share  a surprise of 7 50  
Price and EPS Surprise

With this earnings history in mind  recent estimates have been moving higher for Valero Energy  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the company is positive  which is a great sign of an earnings beat  especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Valero Energy currently has an Earnings ESP of  10 44   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on January 31  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2018-12-31,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-valero-energy-vlo-keep-the-earnings-surprise-streak-alive-200372125,200372125

  NYSE MPC   buyout of Andeavor and Energy Transfer LP s   NYSE ET   simplification transaction From upstream to midstream to downstream  the M A activities came from all facets of the oil and gas sector  While a number of companies struck deals to increase scale and be competitive  some transactions were driven by the need to simplify corporate structures and others with the intent of bringing diversification across products and geographical coverage Here is an overview of the 5 major proposed energy deals from 2018 1     Marathon Petroleum AndeavorThe  35 billion  between oil refiner Marathon Petroleum Corporation and Texas based rival Andeavor  announced on Apr 30 and closed on Oct 1  is one of the highest valued deal among energy firms in recent times  The transaction created the largest U S  refiner in terms of refining capacity  surpassing Valero Energy  NYSE VLO   The new Marathon Petroleum also created a nationwide refining giant in terms of market capitalization  taking over the crown from Phillips 66  NYSE PSX  The deal expanded the geographical footprint of Marathon Petroleum in attractive markets  bolstering its foothold in the Permian Basin  thereby creating an enviable retail and marketing portfolio 2     Energy Transfer Equity Energy Transfer PartnersIn August  pipeline and midstream operator Energy Transfer Partners LP agreed to  with its general partner Energy Transfer Equity  The  27 billion unit for unit exchange  which saw Energy Transfer Equity change its name to Energy Transfer LP  created a larger and stronger energy MLP    The transaction   concluded on Oct 19   was aimed at simplifying the organizational structure and boost the credit profile of the partnership  along with improving transparency  With a diverse base of assets that comprises crude  liquids and natural gas pipelines along with terminal and midstream operations  the merged entity will be able to reach key supply basins and markets 3     Concho

U S  oil industry  bringing about a wave of consolidation in the prolific shale play  Another energy company to join the bandwagon was Diamondback Energy  Inc    NASDAQ FANG    which  in August  announced the  of Energen Corporation in a mega  9 2 billion deal  in a bid to bolster its Permian presence The purchase of Energen   concluded in November   transformed Diamondback into one of the

quarter production of the combined entity was 577 000 BOE d  52  of which was liquids The purchase of Newfield Exploration should transform Encana into one of the leading unconventional energy producers  Post acquisition  the company s pro forma production is expected to increase roughly 20  from 2018 levels  while generating significant synergies for shareholders Are More M A in the Oil Patch Coming As low oil prices continue to plague energy industry  the M A market is likely to remain busy  The flurry of such activities in recent times suggest that stronger companies are lining up to buy the weaker ones A prolonged period of low oil prices will eventually lead to  survival of the fittest   Larger companies   especially those with cash to spend   are set to take advantage of this opportunity and buy quality assets at cheap valuations  The most vulnerable companies are the ones with increasing levels of debt and distresses assets Therefore  with oil still below the psychological  50 a barrel threshold  energy investors should brace themselves for more M A activities to unfold in 2019 The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of All Last year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce  the world s first trillionaires   but that should still leave plenty of

178771,400287,VLO,Best And Worst Stocks To Buy After A Sell Off,opinion,"Stocks on Wednesday suffered their worst day in months    or years  in the case of the tech rich Nasdaq Composite  The S P 500 Index  SPX  endured its steepest one day percentage loss since February  giving up 3 3   Meanwhile  the S P 500 ETF Trust  SPY  NYSE SPY   14 day Relative Strength Index  RSI  fell below 25    into oversold territory  However  if recent history is any indicator  stocks could be ripe for a short term rebound    and airline stocks could extend today s rally 
Rare Oversold Signal for SPY
The last time the SPY RSI fell south of 25 was more than three years ago  during the August 2015 stock market decline  Prior to that  you d have to go back to May 2012  per data from Schaeffer s Quantitative Analyst Chris Prybal  In history  this has happened only 13 other times  considering one signal every 30 days 
If past is prologue  this sets up a nice  bounce  environment for SPY in the near term  One week after signals  the exchange traded fund  ETF  was up 1 8   on average  and higher 75  of the time  That s nine times its average anytime one week return of 0 2   with a win rate of just 57   It s a similar story two weeks out  with the SPY up a better than usual 1 4  and higher 75  of the time 
A month after SPY RSI signals  the shares were 4  higher  on average    more than five times the average anytime one month return    and were in the black a whopping 92  of the time  Three months later  the SPY was up 5   on average  more than doubling the norm 

Stocks Could Bounce Back in Q4
In the same vein  the SPX tends to outperform in the short term  after dropping 3  in the span of one day  Since 2010  this has happened just nine times  considering only one signal per every two weeks  per Schaeffer s Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White  The last time was during the February 2018 stock market correction  and prior to that you d have to go back to the June 2016 Brexit brouhaha 

One day after these drops  the S P tends to remain weak  dropping 0 54   on average  So far today  the broad market barometer is  in fact  on pace for a sixth straight loss  Further  the index was positive less than half the time a day after a steep sell off  That s compared to an average anytime one day gain of 0 05   with a win rate of 54 6   looking at data since 2010 
However  a week after these stock market routs  the S P 500 was up 1 26   on average  and higher an impressive 88 9  of the time  That s about six times its average anytime one week return of 0 23   with a positive rate of 60 2   One month after a 3  drop  the S P was up 2 62   on average  and three months later  the index was up 5 71   handily exceeding its anytime returns 

Best  and Worst  Stocks to Buy After a Sell Off
So  where should you put your money after the latest stock market swoon  Well  if past is precedent  airline stocks could continue to climb into November  The sector is defying broad market headwinds today  thanks to a well received earnings showing from Delta Air Lines  Inc   NYSE NYSE DAL  
DAL stock is up 3 0  to trade at  51 24 today  after yesterday falling to a nearly three month low  Following S P 500 drops of 3  or more in one day  Delta stock gained 4 24  in the subsequent two weeks  on average  and was higher 78  of the time  Fellow airline issue United Continental Holdings Inc  NASDAQ UAL  was also higher 78  of the time two weeks after a steep SPX drop  boasting an even better average return of 4 64   Meanwhile  Alaska Air Group Inc  NYSE ALK  was up an average of 3 8   with a win rate of 78

Investors will be hoping for strength from VLO as it approaches its next earnings release  which is expected to be February 7  2019  On that day  VLO is projected to report earnings of  1 29 per share  which would represent year over year growth of 11 21   Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of  30 87 billion  up 16 98  from the year ago period 
VLO s full year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of  6 47 per share and revenue of  118 14 billion  These results would represent year over year changes of  30 44  and  25 71   respectively 
Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for VLO  These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short term business trends  As a result  we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company s business outlook 
Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near term stock prices  Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank  This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple  actionable rating system 
The Zacks Rank system  which ranges from  1  Strong Buy  to  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive outside audited track record of outperformance  with  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant within the past month  VLO is currently a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  
Investors should also note VLO s current valuation metrics  including its Forward P E ratio of 14 11  Its industry sports an average Forward P E of 14 55  so we one might conclude that VLO is trading at a discount comparatively 
We can also see that VLO currently has a PEG ratio of 0 75  The PEG ratio is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but this metric also takes the company s expected earnings growth rate into account  The Oil and Gas   Refining and Marketing was holding an average PEG ratio of 1 09 at yesterday s closing price

178775,400291,VLO,Oil   Gas Stock Roundup  BP  Chevron Starts Production From Megaprojects,opinion,"It was a week where oil prices sank to its lowest finish since October 2017  while natural gas futures hit more than four year highs 
On the news front  integrated energy biggies BP plc  LON BP    NYSE BP   and Chevron Corp    NYSE CVX   started up production at their Clair Ridge and Big Foot developments  respectively 
Overall  it was another mixed week for the sector  While West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures lost 10 6  to close at  50 42 per barrel  natural gas prices edged up some 0 8  to  4 308 per million Btu  MMBtu  
The U S  crude benchmark tumbled to its lowest settlement in more than a year  reflecting rising supply from major producers  Russia  Saudi Arabia and the United States  and fear that an economic slowdown will dampen the outlook for demand  Data showing domestic crude inventories increasing for a ninth straight week also contributed to the losses 
Meanwhile  natural gas prices reached their highest point since February 2014 as inventories remain significantly below their five year average amid predictions of strong demand with the early onset of cold weather 
Recap of the Week s Most Important Stories1     BP plc commenced production at the Clair Ridge oil field in the U K  North Sea  The field is considered as one of the country s biggest new oil developments in decades  The company anticipates production to peak at 120 000 barrels of oil per day Located 75 kilometers  47 miles  west of Shetlands  the Clair Ridge project represents the second phase of the Clair field  The first phase commenced production in 2005  while the third phase is under evaluation  Discovered in 1977  Clair is expected to produce for the next four decades  The project is estimated to hold recoverable volumes of 640 million barrels of oil The other partners in the field include Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa  plc  Chevron and ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP   The partners spent seven years and more than  5 8 billion to enhance the field s output  In 2018  Clair Ridge is BP s sixth major start up subsequent to seven in 2017  These new projects are anticipated to boost the company s production by 900 000 barrels of oil equivalent  boe  per day by 2021   Read more  2     Chevron recently declared the commencement of production from its Big Foot deepwater project in the U S  Gulf of Mexico  GoM   The field   first brought to light in 2006   is expected to hold more than 200 million oil equivalent barrels of recoverable resources  The production site  at a water depth of around 1 584 meters  is located 360 kilometers south of New Orleans  The Big Foot field has an estimated production life of 35 years The field has a production capacity of 25 million cubic feet of natural gas and 75 000 barrels of oil per day  Production from the site began on time  as expected by the company  This will likely enable Chevron to achieve its 2018 production growth target of 7   The  4 billion deepwater project was sanctioned during 2010 end While Chevron  the operator  has 60  stake in the project  a subsidiary of Equinor ASA has 27 5  and Marubeni Oil

178813,400329,VLO,Is Guggenheim Multi Asset Income ETF  CVY  A Hot ETF Right Now ,opinion,"Launched on 09 21 2006  the Guggenheim Multi Asset Income ETF  CVY  is a smart beta exchange traded fund offering broad exposure to the Total Market  U S   ETFs category of the U S  equity market 
What Are Smart Beta ETFs 
Products that are based on market cap weighted indexes  which are strategies designed to reflect a specific market segment or the market as a whole  have traditionally dominated the ETF industry 
Because market cap weighted indexes provide a low cost  convenient  and transparent way of replicating market returns  they work well for investors who believe in market efficiency 
However  some investors believe in the possibility of beating the market through exceptional stock selection  and choose a different type of fund that tracks non cap weighted strategies  smart beta 
By attempting to pick stocks that have a better chance of risk return performance  non cap weighted indexes are based on certain fundamental characteristics  or a combination of such 
The smart beta space gives investors many different choices  from equal weighting  one of the simplest strategies  to more complicated ones like fundamental and volatility momentum based weighting  However  not all of these methodologies have been able to deliver remarkable returns 
Fund Sponsor   Index
The fund is sponsored by Invesco Powershares  It has amassed assets over  292 13 M  making it one of the larger ETFs in the Total Market  U S   ETFs  CVY seeks to match the performance of the Zacks Multi Asset Income Index before fees and expenses 
The Zacks Multi Asset Income Index is comprised of approximately 125 to 150 stocks selected  based on a multi factor proprietary model  from a universe of domestic and international companies  including U S  listed common stocks  ADRs paying dividends  REITs  MLPs  closed end funds and traditional preferred stocks 
Cost   Other Expenses
Since cheaper funds tend to produce better results than more expensive funds  assuming all other factors remain equal  it is important for investors to pay attention to an ETF s expense ratio 
Annual operating expenses for CVY are 0 79   which makes it on par with most peer products in the space 
The fund has a 12 month trailing dividend yield of 3 99  
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings
It is important to delve into an ETF s holdings before investing despite the many upsides to these kinds of funds like diversified exposure  which minimizes single stock risk  And  most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis 
When you look at individual holdings  Phillips 66  NYSE PSX  accounts for about 1 28  of the fund s total assets  followed by Valero Energy Corp  VLO  and Bank Of America Corp  BAC L  
The top 10 holdings account for about 11 39  of total assets under management 
Performance and Risk
So far this year  the ETF has gained about 0 49   and is up roughly 11 87  in the last one year  as of 05 23 2018   CVY has traded between  20 64 and  23 39 in the past 52 week period 
The ETF has a beta of 0 86 and standard deviation of 12 72  for the trailing three year period  With about 148 holdings  it effectively diversifies company specific risk

178816,400332,VLO,5 Reasons Shale Production Still Isn t Affecting The Price Of Oil,opinion,"Around this past new year  oil prices were climbing higher and many analysts predicted that a rush of new production from U S  shale oil fields would  over time  put a damper on prices Nearly six months into 2018  U S  shale oil production continues to grow  yet it still does not seem to be impacting prices as predicted  This can partially be explained by geopolitical events that have pushed prices up  but it is also a result of some serious and systemic impediments facing the U S  oil industry 
There is a possibility that each of these impediments could change in coming months  If they do  the U S  shale production numbers and the price of oil will change as well 
 1  Pipeline infrastructure
Pipelines in regions where shale oil is produced are running at around full capacity  This has caused problems for smaller oil producers who have to pay more to transport their oil  In fact  producers who do not have contracts in place for pipeline transportation have been forced to sell their oil at a discount  These types of pipeline constraints have actually plagued the U S  oil industry for years and have forced companies to ship crude in trucks or by rail  two modes of transportation that are more expensive and more dangerous than pipelines 
Now  it seems this bottleneck may be ending  Several new   have been announced and other pipelines are already under   It is possible that by the end of 2019 the price to transport U S  oil will have fallen significantly and greater volumes of U S  oil will be able to reach the market  This would mean that U S  producers would be able to sell their product without the current discounts  up to  13 off per barrel for some oil   to some reports   It would also mean that U S  oil would reach ports more quickly  Improved pipeline infrastructure could make the entire U S  oil industry more efficient 
2  Ports
U S  producers have only been free to export their crude oil since the beginning of 2016 and most ports are not  to  the largest tankers  VLCCs  which carry up to 2 million barrels of oil  Most ports capable of exporting oil can handle ships that carry less than half that amount  Only the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port  LOOP  can accept the VLCC tankers for export at present  though there are plans to dredge other   such as Texas  Corpus Christi  if funding can be accessed  The lesser capacity of most U S  ports is another limitation on the efficiency of the U S  shale oil industry 
3  Personnel and Supplies
Producers in shale oil regions have faced personnel constraints for months now  Companies are paying a premium for truck drivers  roughnecks  welders and other similar positions  There has also been a  of sand which used in fracking  although reports are that new sand mines are in the  of alleviating this constraint  Though we have seen an increase in production of U S  shale oil  the increase is not as high as it might have been without such constraints 
4  Crude grade
Most important to consider  however  is whether there is a sufficient market for even more U S  shale oil  The oil produced from fracking is a very light type of oil  U S  refineries are not designed to process so much light crude  Some mix this crude with heavier grades  but the process is not ideal for the refining needs  Building new refineries is almost impossible in today s regulatory climate  The U S  has not built a new  since 1977  although two small refineries have been permitted and are under construction in South Dakota and south Texas   Some refineries have expanded their facilities  such as Motiva in 2012 and Valero  NYSE VLO  in 2017  
Other markets for light crude appear to be saturated as well  except  apparently  for China   to an opinion piece by an S P Global Platts content director  independent Chinese refineries want more of the light crude oil that the U S  shale oil industry produces 
5  Trade War Risk
As of now  the U S  has only  two VLCC tankers to China with U S  crude  but  as U S  infrastructure constraints ease  there could be more  On the other hand  the amount of crude Chinese independent refineries can import depends on the will of the Chinese government  which issues import licenses twice a year 
It is entirely possible that U S  crude oil exports to China could become a pawn in the ongoing trade negotiations between China and the U S  In that case  politics  not the industry  might determine the size of the market for U S  oil ",2018-05-23,"Ellen R.

178927,400443,VLO,Is Your Portfolio Low Energy  Consider Natural Gas Stocks,opinion,"ARE YOU FEELING LOW ON ENERGY  OR IS IT JUST NATURAL GAS 
Energy and Health Care are two sectors that have not participated in the Great Bull Market that followed 2008 s Great Recession 
Ignoring these two sectors means ignoring a combined 27  of the US GDP 
 Energy  stocks  to me  mean natural gas and LNG  lithium  oil  hydro  solar  wind  biomass and more  I always own at least some of these  and some health care as well 
Even in times when the energy sector writ large is out of favor  some sub sectors are moving nicely  My goal is to find these hiding in plain sight opportunities and profit from them  Today I ll talk about energy 
Energy and Health Care are two sectors that have not participated in the Great Bull Market that followed the Great Recession  Both have been ignored as investors flocked to Tech and Financials  including REITs and business development companies   BDCs   for yield  
On a valuation basis  I believe Energy offers the best opportunities to buy future growth at reasonable prices  According to S P s analysis of its 11 primary sectors as measured by their overarching sector ETFs  Energy has declined 1  over the past 5 years while the S P has risen 86    1  Even those invested in the boring old Utilities sector have seen their investments rise 59  during this time 
But not all energy  For instance  it is in both the national security interests and the economic interests of the United States for oil and natural gas to remain somewhere in the area they both are right now 
The ideal position from a national security standpoint is that oil and gas firms are profitable enough for the best companies with the best technologies to make a profit but not so high that adversarial nations whose interests are inimical to our own receive a windfall infusion of new cash with which to blackmail  harass  fund terrorism or intrude upon America or our allies 
Do we really want to see oil and gas prices rise to the point where Russia can fund a new round of the nuclear arms race  Iran can fund its ballistic missile programs and increased terrorism  or autocracies like Venezuela can continue to prevent Venezuelans from enjoying the fruits of their labors 
The same price range works best for the average American s pocketbook as well  Our daily lives are deeply affected by the price of energy  Where and how often we travel  whether we can afford to accept a better job with a longer commute  how comfortable we can make our internal living spaces  even what we eat all depend upon the price of energy  Gasoline at  2 40 a gallon is bearable  Gasoline at  4 20 a gallon is not  The equation is simple  affordable energy makes our lives better than they otherwise would be  On a macro level  affordable energy promotes growth 
You won t hear me saying  I ll buy energy companies when I think oil prices are going to go higher   Yes  the companies will increase their earnings if that happens  But we don t have to wait  Some companies are doing just that right now 
In my opinion  the two most promising areas of growth right now  today  are in the natural gas and LNG exploration and production  transportation  and refining areas and in the extraction and processing of lithium for use as batteries and other storage systems  To keep this article less than 50 pages  I ll concentrate solely on natural gas today  specifically on one speculative explorer and on one blue chip refiner 
If you are a long term subscriber or reader  higher gasoline prices at the pump are a bother  but not a hardship  You have made enough money on energy stocks  starting around 2001   that the price of gasoline could go to  10 a gallon and you could still pay for it out of your profits from owning energy companies 
But what if you are a newer reader who didn t buy early and then take profits on gas and oil companies over the last few years  Opportunities still abound  Remember  all the energy firms on the S P 500 have moved exactly  1  over the past five years  Within that range some are down 50  and more  some are up 100  or more  Selection is key 
By the way  I do not believe the current Saudi inspired sprint up in oil prices will hold  I do believe that  longer term  as energy stocks pull back from this geopolitical event  prices will still stabilize in a good buying range  especially if the dollar declines as I expect it to  In this quarter and 2018  we will again be buying energy in size 
About the Saudi uncertainty  As I wrote just yesterday 

 Oil is rising because Saudi Arabia s 32 year old heir apparent to the crown  Mohammed bin Salman  is doing what every autocrat who wants to wield power does  from Bashar al Assad to Vladimir Putin to Xi Jinping  consolidating his power 
 In this case  he is smart enough to do so while daddy  current king Salman bin Abdulaziz  is still alive and the absolute monarch who can do whatever he pleases  Once King Salman dies or more likely anoints   appoints his son as king  Mohammed bin Salman s   MBS   aggressive ways may make it more difficult for him to secure unbought allies  

What action am I taking with the energy holdings in our portfolio  Simply maintaining our profitable positions with trailing stops  In the short term  stocks react to news  In the long term they react to earnings  It is earnings derived from significant discoveries at low costs of production that drive serious gains in energy  not a one off geopolitical event 
I already discussed EnCana  NYSE ECA  here and added it once again to our model portfolio  EnCana and Canadian Natural Resources  NYSE CNQ  are two of the Big Dogs in Canadian gas and oil production  Both are powerhouses in the Montney formation spanning Alberta and British Columbia  But allow me to introduce you to a somewhat smaller firm  Its shares are by definition more speculative in nature but I believe its prospects may well warrant at least a small position in the higher risk portion of many portfolios 
The stock I am referring to is Advantage Oil   Gas Ltd   NYSE AAV   a Canadian company that is listed on the New York Stock Exchange   The symbol  on either the NYSE or the Toronto Exchange  is the same  AAV  
You might want to review my article on the  Montney Formation  of Alberta and British Columbia  I believe the Montney has the capability to outperform every formation in the US with the possible exception of the Permian  You can read that story  which compared the potential reserves of the Montney with the better known and older US formations Marcellus  Haynesville and Eagle Ford  here  AAV  Seven Generations Energy Ltd  TO VII  and Birchcliff Energy Ltd   OTC BIREF  are three lesser known explorers that are active and successful in the Montney  Here is the story on AAV  2  
When seeking the most attractive companies in the energy business the first thing I look for is efficiency  I want to find companies that spend the least amount of money to get the greatest return on their capital  This isn t as easy in the energy business as it is in many others 
I have to rely upon my experience gained over many years in assessing whether a new find  always unprofitable until the fuel starts flowing to a customer that is actually paying for it  is worthwhile  After that  I need to ensure that the trends of production are such that costs per unit of energy are rapidly coming down as they should when expenses are overwhelmed by the revenue  Finally I have to ensure that management  relieved they can finally pay themselves bonuses after all the hard work and uncertainty  are resisting the temptation to spend lavishly and instead are putting most of the money back into further exploration and production  Advantage Oil   Gas satisfies all three of those criteria 

As you can see in the chart above  AAV is not just a low cost leader when compared to some of the best US producers like Range Resources  NYSE RRC  and Cabot Oil   Gas  NYSE COG  but also beats its peers in the more prolific Montney formation like ARC Resources  TO ARX  and NuVista  TO NVA   An operating cost of 99 cents  Canadian  per mcf of gas produced means a greater cushion for those times when natural gas dips below its current  3   3 80 Canadian  spot price 
I have written in depth about why I believe the Montney is the next beneficiary of enhanced oilfield technology in my two previous articles cited above so I will simply say here that  within the Montney  some geographic locations are likely to be better than others  The early results from the gas that is flowing here clearly shows the likelihood of continued elephant finds and it looks to me like AAV has some of the most promising acreage 


You ll notice something special about AAV  a property only Birchcliff  BIREF  also enjoys in the Montney  Please note the red  building  icon on the map above  Advantage has the advantage of owning its own gas processing plant  That is a big part of how they are able to keep their operating costs down  They can deliver gas to the pipeline companies  ready to pipe   Most of AAV s competitors pay the pipeline companies to prepare the raw gas into a form that can be shipped via their pipelines 
Finally  please note below the positioning I believe to be so important when selecting a potential winner in exploration  The bulk of Advantage s properties lie truly within the heart of the Montney  They are on the over pressurized side of the formation which makes it more likely that when they discover gas and liquids the costs of extraction relative to the size of the flow will be a dynamic in their favor  And you will note that they are also at the center of the best pipeline distribution systems  ensuring easy access to the most favorable markets  be they in Eastern Canada  the US or Asia 


AAV has been steadily paying down debt and has a current debt to equity ratio of just 12   Their increasing cash flow can easily render the debt moot within 2 3 years if they choose to do so 
   
Having spent this much time on AAV  I will only discuss my favorite blue chip briefly   mostly because it is well known to clients and frequent readers 
Valero Energy  NYSE VLO  is  quite simply  the best positioned and most profitable refinery in the United States   It is also the biggest but I consider that a secondary consideration   Most US refineries were built before new technologies made shale exploration and production viable  As a result  most refineries in this country were built to process all that gooey high sulfur oil coming from overseas 
The bonanza of oil that is now flowing due to enhanced recovery techniques and horizontal hydraulic fracturing is light sweet crude  Valero is uniquely positioned to refine both types  With the supply of light sweet crude continuing to accelerate  VLO finds itself in the catbird seat  the most flexible company with the highest operating and net margins in the business 
By the way  the simplistic and inaccurate way many people view the relationship between oil and gas prices is this  the   The numbers crunching arm of the Department of Energy  estimates that the average barrel of oil contains 5 8 million British thermal units  BTUs  of energy  With a barrel of oil selling around  57  and natural gas  as of today  trading at  3 14  you can buy the same amount of energy produced by natural gas for just  18 or so 
Aye  but here s the rub  In fact there isn t a great deal of fungibility between these two resources  Oil is used mostly for transportation  75  of a typical barrel goes to diesel  gasoline  and jet fuels  with the rest going into plastics  medicines  over the counter health aids  look at the ingredients of the Vaseline jar    100  petroleum jelly  and food  Yes  food 
Natural gas  on the other hand  is used primarily for heating and cooling by being used to create electricity  or burned directly for gas cooking and heating  Hence my emphasis more on natural gas than oil  The transportation dynamic is changing rapidly  thanks to electric vehicles powered by natural gas fired electricity and rechargeable lithium batteries  But that s a subject for a whole  nuther   and forthcoming   article

178928,400444,VLO,Should Value Investors Pick Valero Energy  VLO  Stock Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Valero Energy Corporation   NYSE VLO   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Valero Energy has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 18 2  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 21 1  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Valero Energy s current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 23 4  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Valero Energy has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 17 4  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Valero Energy stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Valero Energy has a P S ratio of about 0 4  This is significantly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 4 right now  However  as we can see in the chart below  this is in line with the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years  This suggests that the company s stock price has already appreciated to some degree  relative to its sales Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Valero Energy currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Valero Energy a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Valero Energy is 1 8  a level that is lower than the industry average of 2 0  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 10 5  which is slightly better than the industry average of 10 9  Clearly  VLO is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Valero Energy might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of B and a Momentum score of A  This gives VLO a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mostly trending higher  The current quarter has seen five estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to one lower  while the full year estimate has seen six upward and three downward revisions in the same time period As a result  the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 24 8  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has increased 1 3   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Valero Energy Corporation Price and Consensus    Even though Valero Energy has a better estimates trend  the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   That is why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineValero Energy is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Furthermore  a robust industry rank  among the Top 43   should boost investor confidence However over the past three years  the industry has underperformed the broader market  as you can see below Despite the poor past performance of the industry  a good industry rank signals that the stock is likely to benefit from favorable broader factors in the immediate future  Add to this the positive estimate revisions and robust value metrics  and we believe that we have a strong value contender in Valero Energy Zacks  Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website  our best recommendations and most in depth research are not available

178947,400463,VLO,How Valero Energy  VLO  Stock Stands Out In A Strong Industry,opinion,One stock that might be an intriguing choice for investors right now is Valero Energy Corporation   NYSE VLO    This is because this security in the Oil and Gas   Refining and Marketing space is seeing solid earnings estimate revision activity  and is in great company from a Zacks Industry Rank perspective This is important because  often times  a rising tide will lift all boats in an industry  as there can be broad trends taking place in a segment that are boosting securities across the board  This is arguably taking place in the Oil and Gas   Refining and Marketing space as it currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 11 out of more than 250 industries  suggesting it is well positioned from this perspective  especially when compared to other segments out there Meanwhile  Valero Energy is actually looking pretty good on its own too  The firm has seen solid earnings estimate revision activity over the past month  suggesting analysts are becoming a bit more bullish on the firm s prospects in both the short and long term Valero Energy Corporation Price and Consensus   In fact  over the past month  current quarter estimates have risen from  1 65 per share to  1 74 per share  while current year estimates have risen from  4 47 per share to  4 68 per share  The company currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which is also a favorable signal  You can see  So  if you are looking for a decent pick in a strong industry  consider Valero Energy  Not only is its industry currently in the top third  but it is seeing solid estimate revisions as of late  suggesting it could be a very interesting choice for investors seeking a name in this great industry segment 5 Trades Could Profit  Big League  from Trump PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest  wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington s changing course Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals  tariffs  lower taxes  higher interest rates  and spending surges in defense and infrastructure ,2017-10-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/how-valero-energy-vlo-stock-stands-out-in-a-strong-industry-200219010,200219010

On the news front  European oil major BP plc  LON BP    NYSE BP   and its international partners have agreed to pay Azerbaijan  3 6 billion to extend an oilfield contract for 25 more years  offshore drilling company SeaDrill Limited   NYSE SDRL   filed for bankruptcy protection  while small oil and gas explorer Resolute Energy Corporation   NYSE REN   sold properties in the Paradox Basin in southeastern Utah for up to  195 million

The U S  oil benchmark closed at its highest level since Jul 31 as traders held out hope for price stability amid an improving supply demand narrative  Data showing the number of U S  oil rigs dropping for a second straight week helped cement those gains 
Energy bodies OPEC and IEA both recently raised global oil demand forecasts for this year  helping to tighten the market significantly  Further  the Paris based IEA  the global oil supply had come down by 720 000 per day last month to 97 7 million barrels on outages and maintenance in non OPEC countries 
Meanwhile  according to the OPEC s   the oil cartel s production fell by 79 000 barrels a day in August to 32 76 million as output dropped in Libya  Gabon  Venezuela and Iraq  This points to the success of the 14 member group s output curb initiatives and rising compliance levels

PSA   which calls for a one time payment of  3 6 billion to the State Oil Fund of the Republic of Azerbaijan  Per the new agreement  Azerbaijan s government has extended the production sharing deal for the country s massive ACG oilfields until 2049  The current deal was slated to end in 2024  Under the new accord  State Oil Company of the Republic of Azerbaijan   SOCAR   has increased its shareholding to 25  from 11 65   BP s shareholding has dropped to 30 37  from 35 8   though it continues to be the operator of the field Located in the Azerbaijan Sector of the Caspian Sea  the first PSA for the ACG field was inked in 1994  The field has received investments of over  33 billion and has yielded about 440 million tons of oil  This has aided the country to rake in a direct net profit of  125 billion  Total production from ACG averaged 585 000 barrels per day during the first half of the year The extended contract is a major milestone for BP amid the ongoing price volatility  It will provide regular revenues to the company for almost the next three decades and also increases the company s backlog   Read more   2     International offshore drilling company SeaDrill Limited filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Sep 12 to restructure its balance sheet amid volatile oil prices  Following the development  shares of the company rose more than 20  to eventually close at 23 cents on Sep 12  The stock scaled up further more than 21  yesterday  The rise reflects investors  optimism as the company finally managed to secure a restructuring agreement after 18 months of negotiations  The agreement will provide the company with more than  1 billion of capital to restructure its highly leveraged financials Due to the plunge in oil prices since 2014  energy companies reduced their spending and slashed rig hires  Demand for drilling reduced further as the rigs ordered during the boom period led to oversupply  This in turn led to reduced activities and diminishing contracts for Seadrill which negatively impacted the company s revenues  earnings and cash flows  Increased costs  idle rigs and low dayrates led to high operating losses and affected the market capitalization of the company adversely  SeaDrill  being one of the worst sufferers of the downturn has been battling with around  14 billion debts and liabilities The company expects to emerge from Chapter 11 in six to nine months  The restructuring deal will not affect the day to day business operations of SeaDrill as the company expects to pay employees  suppliers and vendors as usual  The company which has more than  1 billion in cash will not require debtor in possession financing   Read more    3     In a bid to transform itself into a Delaware Basin pure play  upstream player

barrels of oil per day  The oilfield contains around 1 5 billion barrels of oil equivalent  out of which just 31  has been recovered yet Proceeds from the deal will be used to pay the outstanding balance under the revolving credit facility of Resolute Energy  This will help the company to reduce its leverage ratio and strengthen its financials  Employees of Aneth Field will also make a

expenses of the Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company  You can see  The transaction not only aims at improving the cost structure of the company  it also makes Resolute Energy become a pure play in the

179036,400552,VLO,Oil Stocks To Watch For Earnings On Apr 28  XOM  CVX   More,opinion,"The Q1 earnings season is in full swing with Energy bigwigs like Exxon Mobil Corporation   NYSE XOM   and Chevron Corporation   NYSE CVX   set to release financial results tomorrow Earnings Picture So FarTo date we have Q1 results from 181 S P 500 members that combined account for 40  of the S P 500 Index s total market capitalization  According to the latest  report  total earnings for these companies are up 10  on 4 3  higher revenues  both on a year over year basis  So far  75 7  companies delivered positive earnings surprises and 64 1  beat revenue estimates Prospects of the Energy Sector Look Good As of now  the  Energy  sector has made a good start this earnings cycle  For the few sector components  21 2  to be precise  on the S P 500 Index that have reported Q1 results  total earnings surged 146 1  on 21  higher revenues  Most importantly  71 4  of the energy companies have surpassed earnings estimates while 42 9  of the firms beat the top line We expect matters to improve further and the sector is likely to clock its second consecutive positive earnings growth after eight quarters of declines Let s delve deeper to find out what influenced the sector s performance this time around Improvement in Commodity PricesDespite the biggest oil deal in a decade and a new pro fossil fuel administration in the White House  crude prices declined almost 6  in the first quarter  OPEC s historic accord to trim output and rebalance the demand supply situation have stabilized the market to a large extent  However  U S  shale players tried to make the most of the improving oil price scenario by increasing production  With the recent uptick in U S  shale production putting pressure on the market  oil ended the first quarter at  50 60 per barrel  down 5 8  from the 2016 end level Natural gas fared even worse  Price of the commodity plunged 14  in the January March quarter  thanks to one of the mildest winters on record  A warmer winter translated into lesser requirement for the heating fuel  which in turn  upended demand forecasts Despite the sequential fall  however  both oil and natural gas prices are better placed than the corresponding period of 2016  In the year ago period  crude slumped to a 12 year low while natural gas futures dropped to its worst level in almost 17 years Year over Year Gains Likely Ending the dismal trend displayed in the past few quarters  the Oil Energy sector finally turned the corner in the Q4 earnings season  In fact  the sector s performance drove the overall growth of the S P 500 Index The October December quarter of 2016 turned out to be a rather good one with positives the OPEC deal and extreme weather conditions resulting in a substantial increase in oil and gas prices The historic OPEC production cut agreement  together with help from non OPEC producers  saw oil prices end the year at  53 72 a barrel  up 11 4  sequentially and 45  on an annualized basis  Natural gas too advanced  with futures increasing almost 25  in Q4  Ending the year at  3 724 per million Btu  MMBtu    up 59  from 2015   the heating fuel gained from strong demand in a frigid winter As a result  following eight back to back quarters of earnings declines  the sector turned around in Q4 and clocked its first positive earnings growth after two years  With estimate revisions going up following OPEC s Algeria grandstand  the Oil Energy sector s earnings were expected to improve handsomely from the year ago comparable quarter True to the predictions  the sector came out swinging  For the sector components on the S P 500 index  total Q4 earnings were up 17 1  on 2 0  higher revenues The picture is rather encouraging for the ongoing Q1 earnings season as well  This is not surprising as both oil and gas prices fell to multi year lows in the year ago period  In fact  the Energy sector may swing to earnings this quarter from a modest loss in the year earlier period Per our analysis  the aggregate dollar amount of earnings increase for the Energy sector is the highest of all 16 Zacks sectors  This sectors is expected to earn a total of  7 7 billion in Q1 compared with a loss  1 6 billion in the year earlier quarter  The top line is likely to show an impressive growth of 27 2  from year earlier level  Margins are anticipated to improve 4 3  Stocks to Watch for Earnings on Apr 28Let s see what s in store for these four energy companies that are expected to report Q1 results on Apr 28  before the opening bell

179062,400578,VLO,Valero Energy  VLO  Becomes Part Of RFA  What To Expect  ,opinion,"Per Bloomberg  leading independent refiner Valero Energy Corporation   NYSE VLO   has joined the leading trade association for ethanol industry of U S    Renewable Fuels Association  RFA   This indicates that the previously unwilling fuel producers are now agreeing to blend ethanol with gasoline to take advantage of the rapidly growing biofuels market 
The U S  Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  has come up with a new requirement specifying the increased amount of renewable fuel that should be added by refiners to their gasoline supply  For 2017  EPA increased the level to 19 28 billion gallons of renewable fuel from the prior 2016 mark of 18 11 billion gallons 
Most importantly  the newly proposed mark for 2017 is higher than EPA s earlier figure of 18 8 billion gallons and the 18 1 billion gallon target for 2016  The blending of more renewable fuel with gasoline will mostly be done by mixing corn based ethanol 
Interestingly  Valero had previously opposed the Renewable Fuel Standard that mandates refining players to blend ethanol and gasoline to lower emission 
Why the Need to Lower Emission 
Per the Energy Information Administration  EIA   motor gasoline and diesel consumed for transportation in the U S  during 2015 emitted a total of 1 545 million metric tons of carbon dioxide  CO2   This accounted for almost 83  of the U S  transportation industry s total CO2 discharge  This is where the urgent need for reducing pollution and saving the environment comes into play      
San Antonio  TX based Valero Energy is the largest independent refiner and marketer of petroleum products in the U S  With 15 refineries located across the U S   Canada and the Caribbean  the company has a refining capacity of 3 0 million barrels per day  Over the last one month  the company gained almost 8  compared with the Zacks categorized oil refining and marketing market s 7  gain 
Valero Energy also surpassed other refiners like Marathon Petroleum Corp    NYSE MPC    Phillips 66   NYSE PSX   and Tesoro Corp    NYSE TSO   that gained 5 5   1 5  and  3 3   respectively 
These are reflected in the company s Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  VALERO ENERGY Price

This Week Ideas from the Trading Room
Holmes
This week I m buying high fashion  Michael Kors  KORS   trading at 42 83 
The stock looks to be consolidating at a higher low from the previous big down move  40 70  of May 17 2016  which is higher than the move before that of 35 79 and Jan 15  2016  All these higher lows give me the chance to buy here and watch carefully that KORS stays above the previous low  What is my upside target  Well  the highs seem to be lower too so I m thinking 48 60 the current 200d MA is a worthy target but I ll be watching carefully  If I get the rally and the stock starts to roll over I ll be a quick seller 
Don t need to hit homers all the times  many games are won with timely singles 

J  Homers versus singles  Have you been spending more time with Oscar 
H  He did take me to the  dog night  at  The Cell  last year 
J  It is now called    
H  No   Oscar still calls it Comiskey 
J  Turning to your KORS idea  have you been following retail sales reports  especially for the luxury sector 
H  As you know  I read charts  not news 
J  The stock looks good on a fundamental basis as well  Here is the basic  

H  It looks like  value  investors might have been stuck in this one for some time  My rebound strategy is clearly better 
Athena
My pick this week  Fifth Third Bancorp  FITB   has started to level off since November s rally  I like that price action  As you know by now  I m most enthusiastic about a stock when I think it s due for a pop  FITB is still underpriced based on my technical indicators  We were closer to fair valuation at the end of December  I might hold onto this one for three or four weeks  and hope for a small gain 

J  Once again you have a choice that fundamental investors can also embrace  I have been recommending regional bank stocks for many months  The recent increase in interest rates has helped the group  If the economy continues to improve  the Fed will raise short term rates  The prime rate goes up instantly  Rates paid to savers go up more slowly   much more slowly  That means more profit for banks 
A  Your complex methods can sometimes lead you to a conclusion that is obvious from the chart 
J  This time my methods allowed me to enjoy that November surge 
A  Let us see if they get you out in a timely fashion as well 
Felix
I will begin this week with my responses to reader votes for the favorites list 















My list provides rankings within each zone  as well as the basics about buy  hold  and sell  The list includes the top overall vote getters from our  free  subscription list as well as some new requests I got during the week 
J  The stocks are about the same as last week 
F  The list changes  but only as the reader favorites change  I encourage my fans to submit requests 
J  The order of the ratings has changed  Are you going to resume showing us the week over week comparison 
F  I am thinking about that problem  Some of the stocks were not rated last week  For the moment  readers must follow their favorites each week 
J  Maybe we ll get some good new suggestions  What is your featured stock for this week 
F  I suspect that you will not like my answer  I have nothing new this week 
J  Didn t you just request a raise 
F  Yes  As you know I have had the best performance since you added me in September  I have been better than the dog  and a lot better than Oscar 
J  That is only five months  but I agree about your good start  That does not give you license to take the week off 
F  I worked  but there are no new ideas for my style  You told us all not to trade just to prove we are doing something  The holding period for my stocks averages five quarters  I am not going to have a fresh trade each week 
J  That makes sense  Just stay on the job and don t reach for new positions  I don t want to encourage you to get ideas from those high frequency models in Chicago  They play a very different game 
F  So I have heard 
Oscar







Here are my ratings for the top reader interests  There are still three open slots  so keep the questions coming 
J  Interesting  What do you have for us this week 
O  I ve talked about oil and oil refiners a lot over the past few weeks  Judging by the dip we ve seen over the past year   and the rough patch we had in January 2016   there was an awful lot of value to be found in this sector  I see a similar  albeit more modest  opportunity in Refiners now  Valero Energy  NYSE VLO  is a suitable example  Note the contraction so far in the month of January  Our 50 day moving average has spiked  while the 200 day moving average has barely evened out  I would be very surprised to see a correction here continue for much longer   despite the volatility in this sector 
J  Many people mistakenly trade in overall energy ETFs that include refiners  The characteristics are quite different  Crude is a raw material for refiners  so lower prices can be very good  Gasoline demand is important  Twice a year they make a switch from the summer blend to winter  and vice versa  It is early for the summer switch  but could that be what you are seeing 
O  I see what the chart tells me  I just put it in the tank no matter whether it is winter or summer  Gas prices will be going higher and VLO will probably cash in

179064,400580,VLO,Should Value Investors Choose Valero Energy  VLO  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Valero Energy Corporation   NYSE VLO   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Valero Energy has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 17 51  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 27  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Valero Energy s current PE level puts it above its midpoint of 8 15 over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months  However  the current multiple stands a bit below the recent highs for the stock Further  the stock s PE stands way below the Zacks classified Oils   Energy sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 59 40  This indicates that the stock is considerably undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Valero Energy has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 13 60  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Valero Energy stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Valero Energy has a P S ratio of about 0 39  This is significantly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 08 right now  making the stock undervalued from the P S aspect too Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Valero Energy currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  A   putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Valero Energy a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Valero Energy is just 1 15  a level that is lower than the industry average of 1 32  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 6 34  which is slightly better than the industry average of 6 89  Clearly  VLO is a good choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Valero Energy might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  D  and a Momentum score of  F   This gives VLO a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  C    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Further  the company s recent earnings estimates have been quite discouraging  The current quarter has seen four estimates go lower in the past sixty days compared to just one upward revision  while the full year estimate has seen six downward with no upward revisions in the same time period This has had a dismal impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has slumped 27 3  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has decreased 9 4   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Valero Energy Corporation Price and Consensus    In light of these bearish trends  the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  which indicates that we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineValero Energy is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  Bottom 38  out of over 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks categorized Oil Refining   Marketing industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick The Best   Worst of Zacks Today you are invited

179086,400602,VLO,EIA Says U S  Crude Supplies Increased For The Third Week,opinion,"The U S  Energy Department s inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded an unexpected build  Worryingly  supplies at the Cushing  OK storage hub rose  too  On a further bearish note  the report revealed that refined product inventories   gasoline and distillate   both increased from their previous week levels   
However  the downbeat sentiment on the back of increase in stocks across the board was mostly offset by subsequent reports suggesting Russia s willingness to back OPEC oil cartel s decision to curb production  As a result  West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures fell by a miniscule 0 5   or 25 cents  to  45 57 per barrel Wednesday 
Analysis of the EIA Data
Crude Oil  The federal government s EIA report revealed that crude inventories increased by 5 27 million barrels for the week ending Nov 11  2016  following a rise of 2 43 million barrels in the previous week 
The analysts surveyed by S P Global Platts   the leading independent commodities and energy data provider   had expected crude stocks to go down some 2 million barrels  An uptick in imports led to the surprise stockpile build with the world s biggest oil consumer even as refinery activity jumped 
Moreover  stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma   the key delivery hub for U S  crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange   was up 691 000 barrels from previous week s level to 59 17 million barrels 
Following the third straight inventory rise  U S  remains awash with excess oil  though the year over year storage surplus has narrowed down considerably in recent months following a run of drawdowns 
At 490 28 million barrels  current crude supplies are up 8  from the year ago period and are above the upper limit of the average range for this time of year 
The crude supply cover   at 31 2 days   remained flat from previous week  In the year ago period  the supply cover was 30 8 days 
Gasoline  Supplies of gasoline were up for the first time in 4 weeks on rising imports  partly offset by strengthening demand and lower production  The 746 000 barrels build   contrary to the analysts  polled number of 400 000 barrels decrease in supply level   took gasoline stockpiles up to 221 71 million barrels  Following last week s increase  the existing stock of the most widely used petroleum product is 3  higher than the year earlier level and is well above the upper half of the average range 
Distillate  Distillate fuel supplies  including diesel and heating oil  edged up by 310 000 barrels last week  again contradicting analysts  expectations for a 2 2 million barrel decline  The increase in distillate fuel stocks   after having fallen for seven straight weeks   could be attributed to a rise in imports and production  assisted by lower demand  At 148 91 million barrels  distillate supplies are 6  higher than the year ago level and are sitting comfortably over the upper half of the average range for this time of the year 
Refinery Rates  Refinery utilization was up by 2 1  from the prior week to 89 2  
About the Weekly Petroleum Status Report
The Energy Information Administration  EIA  Petroleum Status Report  containing data of the previous week ending Friday  outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U S   both locally and abroad 
The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements  thereby helping investors understand the demand supply dynamics of petroleum products  It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry 
The data from EIA generally acts as a catalyst for crude prices and affect producers  such as ExxonMobil Corp    NYSE XOM    Chevron Corp    NYSE CVX   and ConocoPhillips   NYSE COP    and refiners such as Valero Energy Corp    NYSE VLO    Phillips 66   NYSE PSX   and HollyFrontier Corp    NYSE HFC

179087,400603,VLO,5 Ethanol Stocks To Watch On EPA s New Gasoline Mandate,opinion,"The honeymoon for oil refiners seems to be at an end  As per the Energy Information Administration  EIA   motor gasoline and diesel consumed for transportation in the U S  during 2015 emitted a total of 1 545 million metric tons of carbon dioxide  This accounted for almost 83  of U S  transportation industry s total CO2 discharge  This is where the urgent need for reducing pollution and saving the environment rises       
Keeping this in mind  the U S  Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  has come up with a mandate that more refiners will be required to mix more renewable fuel with gasoline in an effort to lower emission and save the planet  This can only result in gains for companies dealing with ethanol and investors need to closely observe the performance of ethanol stocks given the rapidly growing biofuels market   
What Does the New EPA Requirement Mean  
The EPA has come up with a new requirement specifying the increased amount of renewable fuel that should be added by refiners to their gasoline supply  For 2017  EPA increased the level to 19 28 billion gallons of renewable fuel from the prior 2016 mark of 18 11 billion gallons   
Most importantly  the newly proposed mark for 2017 is higher than EPA s earlier figure of 18 8 billion gallons and the 18 1 billion gallon target for 2016  The blending of more renewable fuel with gasoline will mostly be done by mixing corn based ethanol 
Following this announcement  the market has witnessed opposition from oil industries citing that a higher amount of ethanol in gasoline will harm the engines of vehicles  In fact  Frank Macchiarola   director of American Petroleum Institute  API  downstream group   said   We are disappointed that EPA has taken a step backwards with this final rule  
Oil Refiners Hit  Ethanol Players to Gain
For sure  the EPA s directive is unfavorable for oil refiners as greater volumes of ethanol in gasoline will increase the blending cost to unfeasible levels  This is already being reflected in stock prices of refiners  which have started slipping  Leading oil refiners like Tesoro Corp    NYSE TSO    Valero Energy Corp    NYSE VLO    Marathon Petroleum Corp    NYSE MPC   and Western Refining Inc    NYSE WNR   saw share prices falling 1 4   0 8   0 3  and 2 2   respectively 
On the other hand  it is time for ethanol companies to celebrate as more ethanol   a clean burning  high octane renewable fuel   should be produced or transported to favor the new EPA mandate  We have employed our proprietary screening methodology to pick ethanol players that are worth watching 
5 Ethanol Stocks 
Headquartered in Cupertino  CA  Aemetis Inc    NASDAQ AMTX   is primarily involved in the production of advanced fuels and chemicals that include ethanol  For the last two quarters  the company s average positive earnings surprise was 13 04   Moreover  over the trailing three months  the stock rose 14 5   Aemetis currently carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   implying that it will outperform the broader U S  equity market over the next one to three months

Oil prices inched up marginally as traders adopted a  wait and see  attitude ahead of OPEC s Vienna meeting on Nov 30 with mixed signals on whether the cartel members will agree to rein in output as part of the plan reached in Sep  The commodity was also bolstered by the U S  Energy Department s weekly inventory release  which showed an unexpected decline in crude stockpiles 
However  to a large extent  the bullish sentiment was offset by data from Baker Hughes showing another rise in the domestic oil rig count and pointing to the resurgence in shale drilling activities Oils Energy Sector Price Index

   Another area of concern for the company is its weak operating cash flow However  all is not lost for the company  Among independent refiners  Valero has the most diversified refinery base  The company has a capacity of 3 0 million barrels per day through its 15 refineries located throughout the U S   Canada and the Caribbean  More importantly  Valero is well positioned to profit from increased refining margins  mainly due to its strategic refinery structure that enables it to use cheaper oil for more than half of its needs Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Valero Energy is likely to beat earnings this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  1 Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here  as you will see below    Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is 0 00   Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Valero Energy stand at  1 09 Zacks Rank  Valero Energy carries a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   which lowers the predictive power of ESP  We caution against Sell rated stocks  Zacks Rank  4 and 5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Currently  the stock is trading at  50 78  We expect the earnings release to lead to stock movement Stocks to ConsiderThough earnings beat looks uncertain for Valero Energy  here are some companies you may want to consider on the basis of our model  which shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter Spectra Energy Corp    NYSE SE   has an Earnings ESP of  40 00  and a Zacks Rank  1  The company is slated to release earnings on Aug 3 Enterprise Products Partners LP   NYSE EPD   has an Earnings ESP of  3 13  and a Zacks Rank  3  The company is slated to release earnings on Jul 28 Hess Corporation   NYSE HES   has an Earnings ESP of  1 60  and a Zacks Rank  3  The company is slated to release earnings on Jul 27 ",2016-07-21,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/valero-(vlo)-q2-earnings-may-disappoint:-stock-to-suffer-200143386,200143386
179145,400661,VLO,Oil Up On Bullish Inventory Draw  Gasoline Build A Worry,opinion,"The U S  Energy Department s weekly inventory release showed that crude stockpiles recorded a larger than expected drop  The report further revealed that within the  refined products  category  gasoline stocks rose  while distillate supplies were down from the week ago level  Meanwhile  refiners scaled up their utilization rates 
The drawdown in U S  crude stocks lifted the commodity from 2 month lows  But the impact was limited on account of a surprise build in gasoline supplies despite rising summer demand 
As a result  West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures edged up 0 7   or 29 cents  to settle at  44 94 per barrel Wednesday 
Analysis of the EIA Data
Crude Oil  The federal government s EIA report revealed that crude inventories decreased by 2 34 million barrels for the week ending July 15  2016  following a decline of 2 55 million barrels in the previous week 
The analysts surveyed by S P Global Platts   the leading independent commodities and energy data provider   had expected crude stocks to go down some 1 25 million barrels  An uptick in refinery demand led to the higher than expected stockpile drawdown with the world s biggest oil consumer even as imports and production rose 
However  crude inventories at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma   the key delivery hub for U S  crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange   edged up 189 000 barrels from previous week s level to 64 11 million barrels 
Despite the ninth straight week of inventory decline  at 519 46 million barrels  current crude supplies are up 12  from the year ago period and are at the highest level during this time of the year 
The crude supply cover was down from 31 4 days in the previous week to 31 1 days  In the year ago period  the supply cover was 27 8 days Oils Energy Sector Price Index
Gasoline  Despite healthy demand  supplies of gasoline were up for the second time in two weeks   the culprit being higher imports  The 911 000 barrels build   contrary to the the analysts  polled number of 625 000 barrels decrease in supply level   took gasoline stockpiles up to 241 million barrels  Following last week s increase  the existing stock of the most widely used petroleum product is 11  higher than the year earlier level and is comfortably above the upper half of the average range 
Distillate  Distillate fuel supplies  including diesel and heating oil  fell by a modest 214 000 barrels last week  as opposed to analysts  expectations for an 875 000 barrels rise in inventory level  The decrease in distillate fuel stocks   for the third time in four weeks   could be attributed to lower production and strengthening demand  At 152 78 million barrels  distillate supplies are 8  higher than the year ago level and are above the upper half of the average range for this time of the year 
Refinery Rates  Refinery utilization was down by 0 9  from the prior week to 93 2

Analysis of the EIA Data
Crude Oil  The federal government s EIA report revealed that crude inventories decreased by 3 23 million barrels for the week ending May 27  2016  following a decline of 1 37 million barrels in the previous week 
The analysts surveyed by S P Global Platts   the leading independent commodities and energy data provider   had expected crude stocks to go down some 3 4 million barrels  Improved refinery usage and lower imports led to the stockpile drawdown with the world s biggest oil consumer even as production picked up 
In particular  crude inventories at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma   the key delivery hub for U S  crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange   were down 1 36 million barrels from previous week s level to 65 56 million barrels 
Despite the fourth inventory decline in 5 weeks  at 532 48 million barrels  current crude supplies are up 13  from the year ago period and are at the highest level during this time of the year 
The crude supply cover was down from 32 9 days in the previous week to 32 6 days  In the year ago period  the supply cover was 28 7 days 
Gasoline  Supplies of gasoline were up for the second time in 3 weeks as demand weakened and production rose  The 1 01 million barrels rise   contrary to analysts  polled number of 900 000 barrels decrease in supply level   took gasoline stockpiles up to 239 63 million barrels  Following last week s build  the existing stock of the most widely used petroleum product is 10  higher than the year earlier level and is comfortably above the upper half of the average range 
Distillate  Distillate fuel supplies  including diesel and heating oil  jumped 1 75 million barrels last week  as opposed to analysts  expectations for a 600 000 barrels drop in inventory level  The increase in distillate fuel stocks   ending a run of seven consecutive draws   could be attributed to lower demand amid rising production and imports  At 151 38 million barrels  distillate supplies are 13  higher than the year ago level and are well above the upper half of the average range for this time of the year 
Refinery Rates  Refinery utilization was up by 1 1  from the prior week to 90 9

SPX Overview 
The S P 500 saw its third day of consecutive declines in a month as concerns over Brexit  China and global monetary policy have begun to weigh on the index  The index closed at 2079 on Monday  roughly the mid point between the trading range of 2120 and 2040 
Jitters are evident in the recent price moves  but one would be waiting for the price to break below the Ichimoku cloud and for a close below 2040 to show that the trading range is decisively broken  In such a scenario  the 1925 1825 lows of January and February could open up again

179183,400699,VLO,Valero  VLO   Stock To Disappoint This Earnings Season ,opinion,"Leading North American independent refiner and marketer of petroleum products  Valero Energy Corporation   NYSE VLO   is set to report first quarter 2016 results on May 3  Let s see how things are shaping up prior to the announcement 
In the preceding three month period  the company reported a positive earnings surprise of 27 86   Coming to earnings surprise history  Valero Energy beat estimates in each of the last four quarters 
 

Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to ConsiderAmong independent refiners  Valero has the most diversified refinery base with a capacity of 2 9 million barrels per day through its 15 refineries located throughout the U S   Canada and the Caribbean  More importantly  Valero is best positioned to profit from increased refining margins mainly due to its strategic refinery structure that enables it to use cheaper oil for more than half of its needs 
The refining segment  which contributes the bulk of Valero s revenues and earnings  is the major growth driver  However  given that refiners are buyers of crude  an increase in oil prices can limit their profitability 
Refiners in the U S  generally face uncertainty regarding future regulations pertaining to greenhouse gas emissions and the potential for higher requirement of biofuels  Other risks include government regulations  weather conditions  crude oil and natural gas prices as well as renewable fuel prices  These might result in increased costs  reduced growth and fines or other sanctions 
Another area of concern for the company is its weak operating cash flow Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Valero Energy is likely to beat earnings this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1 Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here  as you will see below    Zacks ESP  Valero Energy currently has an Earnings ESP of  5 48   This is because the Most Accurate estimate is 69 cents and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands higher at 73 cents Zacks Rank  Valero Energy carries a Zacks Rank  3  Though this increases the predictive power  a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult We caution against Sell rated stocks  Zacks Rank  4 and 5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Stocks to Consider

Crude Touches  50
Following these bullish data sets and other associated positive developments  oil prices briefly traded above the psychologically important  50 per barrel level on Thursday   the first time since October 
Predictably  this has had a positive effect on the sector components  In particular  savvy investors might view the price bump as the impetus the stocks need after freefalling for two years  Undoubtedly  still a long way to go  but improving crude prices may have already primed certain oil producers and linked entities for upward momentum 
Analysis of the EIA Data
Crude Oil  The federal government s EIA report revealed that crude inventories decreased by 4 23 million barrels for the week ending May 20  2016  following a rise of 1 31 million barrels in the previous week 
The analysts surveyed by S P Global Platts   the leading independent commodities and energy data provider   had expected crude stocks to go down by 3 3 million barrels  A pullback in the level of imports led to the larger than expected stockpile drawdown with the world s biggest oil consumer 
In particular  crude inventories at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma   the key delivery hub for U S  crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange   were down 649 000 barrels from previous week s all time high level to 67 62 million barrels 
Despite the second inventory decline in 3 weeks  at 537 07 million barrels  current crude supplies are up 12  from the year ago period and are at the highest level during this time of the year 
The crude supply cover was down from 33 6 days in the previous week to 33 1 days  In the year ago period  the supply cover was 29 5 days 
Gasoline  Supplies of gasoline were up for the first time in 3 weeks as demand weakened  The 2 04 million barrels rise   contrary analysts  polled number of 1 6 million barrels decrease in supply level   took gasoline stockpiles up to 240 11 million barrels  Following last week s build  the existing stock of the most widely used petroleum product is 9  higher than the year earlier level and is comfortably above the upper half of the average range 
Distillate  Distillate fuel supplies  including diesel and heating oil  fell 1 28 million barrels last week  easily outpacing analysts  expectations for a 900 000 barrels drop in inventory level  The decrease in distillate fuel stocks   the sixth in as many weeks   could be attributed to lower production  But at 150 88 million barrels  distillate supplies are still 17  higher than the year ago level and are well above the upper half of the average range for this time of the year

Analysis of the EIA Data

The analysts surveyed by S P Global Platts   the leading independent commodities and energy data provider   had expected crude stocks to go down some 3 1 million barrels  Another pullback in the level of production  marking the twelfth consecutive weekly drop  led to the modest stockpile drawdown with the world s biggest oil consumer

179208,400724,VLO,3 Refiners To Watch For An Entry,opinion,"I just got back from a wonderful night at the All Star Game with my son  It was a great game if you are an American League fan  The excitement in the stadium was palpable  But more than anything else it was a a great father son bonding experience  We had a blast 
With all the driving I have not been glued to the screen and it has been a bit harder to write  But I did notice that 3 refining company stocks that are on my broader watchlist this week are pulling back  possibly ready to give a new entry signal  Maybe it was also the gasoline that got me thinking 
Tesoro  NYSE TSO 
Tesoro had broken above a long consolidation box to end last week  and was out of the Bollinger Bands   After a long consolidation or base break  it can be expected to rise for some time  but often retests the break out first  The saying goes   the longer the base  the higher it goes into space   Watch a retest of the box and reversal back higher as an entry signal 
Phillips 66  NYSE PSX 
Phillips 66 has been moving higher in a channel  Like consolidation  but with some upside  It hit the top of that channel Monday  and is pulling back  No break out this time  But there is a possible opportunity to pick up the stock on a touch back at the bottom of the channel  Watch for a touch and reversal for an entry signal 
Valero Energy  NYSE VLO 
Valero Energy also broke above a resistance zone Monday  triggering a Cup and Handle with a target to 77  But it started to pullback the next day and is following through lower  A failed break out  Maybe  or maybe just a higher extended Cup and Handle  Watch for a hold and reversal at the prior consolidation  and March highs at 64 as an entry signal

179209,400725,VLO,4 Stocks To Watch  ALJ  VLO  ATEN  LPCN,opinion,"It was a nasty day on Wall Street  certainly contributed to by the Chinese devaluation of the yuan  It wasn t pretty  yet  when I look at the Boxer Shorts it looks like a mixed picture  The long side is still fairly good if you re in the right sectors  Let s take a look at long positions and patterns here 
Alon USA Energy Inc  NYSE ALJ  is one of the strongest oil related stocks in refining and marketing  This stock broke out in January and has been really strong all year  It came down slightly about two weeks ago  and then turned around and headed right back up  and has kept on going  On Tuesday  it was up another 65 cents to 22 57  or nearly 3   on 1 2 million shares  The target for ALJ is in the 24 25 00 zone 
Valero Energy Corporation  NYSE VLO  is another strong  oil related stock  It took a dip in January  then ran up  pulled back  ran up again  came down and based for a couple months  ran up and pulled back a couple more times  and then on Tuesday  it spiked up  reaching new  all time highs at 70 63  and then pulled back  But it was still up 1 43  closing at 70 43  just 20 cents off the high  on 7 5 million shares  It looks like the top of the channel could be in play near the low 80 s  So keep an eye on this one 
A10 Networks Inc  NYSE ATEN  has an interesting pattern  It broke down mid July  going from a June high of 7 07  all the way down to a low near the end of July at 4 98  it turned around  and has been working its way back up  Recently  it formed a wedge  popped out of the wedge  and then a swing trade was put on it  On Tuesday  it was up 22 cents to 7 17  or 3   on 1 8 million shares  reaching a nominal new high at 7 37  Be looking for a breakout  If it gets one  it has a complete gap to fill around 7 75  and if it gets through that  the next target is 9 00  and then 11 1 2 12 00 
Lipocine Inc  NASDAQ LPCN  is having a good run these days  A year ago this stock broke down  going from 9 64 all the way down to 4 10  it based out for a while  and then gradually worked its way back up  going from 12 19 to 17 83  5 64 points in the last week  week and a half  On Tuesday  it was up 3 40 to 17 37  or 24   on 2 million shares  It seems destined for a test of the 19 1 2 20 zone short term  Keep an eye on this one 
Other stocks on the long side include Applied Optoelectronics Inc  NASDAQ AAOI   American Biltrite Inc  OTC ABLT   Aquinox Pharmaceuticals Inc  NASDAQ AQXP   magicJack VocalTec Ltd  NASDAQ CALL   DS Healthcare Group Inc  NASDAQ DSKX   Novavax Inc  NASDAQ NVAX   Senomyx Inc  NASDAQ SNMX  and Tetra Technologies Inc  NYSE TTI  ",2015-08-12,Harry Boxer,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/alj,-vlo,-aten,-lpcn-261345",261345
179210,400726,VLO,Outlook 2016  Oil  Gold  USD  China And Contrarian Bets,opinion,"Though it s difficult to pinpoint what specifically might have been the biggest market story of 2015  it s clear that the collapse of the commodity sector oil s 35  decline in particular was at the forefront of everyone s list of concerns  The strong US dollar was another culprit  Though it benefited some retailers  it wreaked havoc on many emerging market economies including Russia  Turkey  Brazil and South Africa 
The timing of the Fed s rate decision was another big story that occupied traders and investors until year end when Ms  Yellen finally delivered and markets at least in the short term jumped on the news 
Then of course there s China  Its economy  most analysts agree  is slowing and undergoing a major shift away from manufacturing  toward services  The country s Shanghai Index had a roller coaster year  skyrocketing up into the summer months  then rapidly down as the fall months began  The PBoC had been devaluing the yuan in small increments throughout 2015 in an effort to groom the currency for inclusion in the IMF s SDR basket of key currencies  but on August 12 it blindsided FX markets when it engineered a 2  drop  to make its exports more competitive and shore up growth in the flagging economy  
U S  markets offered their own surprises  The Dow  S P 500 and the NASDAQ each hit record highs this past year  with the NASDAQ breaking records multiple times between April and late July 
With such a full year in the markets  rear view mirror  and as 2015 winds down  we asked 11 of our most popular contributors how they re preparing for the coming year  We received a provocative mix of views and strategies and have divided the responses into two articles  Part I  below  covers commodities  currencies and contrarian opinions  Part II  which we ll publish later this week  offers insight into where the US s 7 year equity bull might be headed

Stocks probably need to consolidate for the first half of next year before they can break out to new highs and start the run into a bubble phase top  The correction into the S P 500 s 7 year cycle low in August wasn t deep enough to properly correct the excesses of 6 years of QE  so I expect that will delay the beginning of the bubble phase for a while as the 200 week moving average will need to  catch up  to price during the beginning of the year  I m expecting a rather volatile market with several mini crashes as the market continues to try to correct and the Federal reserve and other global central banks try to prop up markets with their printing presses 
Commodities have been severely underperforming for three years  It s time for them to form a final bear market bottom and outperform next year  The bottom may have occurred in November  or if oil can make one more lower low it could stretch out to the spring of next year  but I do think 2016 will be the year for commodities to shine 
Again this year everyone expects the dollar to soar  It s still too stretched above the long term mean to expect a move to 110 or 120 this year or next  So I suspect the currencies will remain stuck in a sideways consolidation for most of 2016 

Ross Woodfield  Blackwell Global EURUSD Reversal  Silver Will Find Buyers
Picking winners 12 months out is extremely difficult  but there are some trends and themes that are certainly worth paying attention to  The euro vs the US dollar is one pair that I will be looking at as I believe we will see it reverse much of the slide we saw in 2015  The Fed have talked the market into believing interest rate liftoff is upon us  but I believe this only opens the door for disappointment  The Fed have said rates will rise slower than expected and I do not doubt them on that  The US dollar will likely weaken as the glacial pace of interest rate rises will not live up to the market s expectations  and any rate rise may affect adversely US growth 
That brings us to the euro  As we have seen  the ECB are still willing to expand stimulus  but the need will diminish  2015 has ended rather positively for EU businesses  with growth  spending and even hints of inflation returning  I believe this trend will continue into 2016 which will be seen in the ECB s monetary policy actions  The dovish rhetoric will slowly turn to neutral and the market will realize the euro has been oversold  I would not be surprised to see the euro return above the 1 20 level on EU strength and USD weakness 
Silver is also going to be on my watchlist for 2016  The metal has been hammered lower in 2015 thanks to the expectation that US rates will begin to rise  The metal will likely find buyers below the  14 mark with  13 looking like a line in the sand  If rates rise more slowly than expected  or growth begins to tail off in the US  look for the silver bulls to have a field day 

Tiho Brkan  Market Timing and Contrarian Bets
Entering into 2016  the major talk of the town is the Federal Reserve s desire to raise interest rates for the first time since 2006  Financial experts are very much divided as to whether or not this will end up being a good idea  Observing the United States equity markets  where the S P 500 is trading only a couple of percentage points from its all time high  one could easily conclude that all is well  However  those with a sharp eye should easily notice that the state of the financial markets is quite fragile right now 
For example  consider the weakness in MSCI Europe and MSCI Emerging Markets stocks  both of which peaked in the middle of 2014 and remain in a downtrend  The junk bond market has been under pressure too  trading at the lowest level since October 2011  Finally  there is carnage in the commodity market  especially in Crude Oil   which is clearly affecting mining and energy producers 
Therefore  the risks in predicting which asset classes will outperform in 2016 is connected to the divergence in monetary policy around the world  As the Federal Reserve embarks on its tightening cycle  while other central banks  such as the ECB and BoJ  continue to ease  we are expecting volatility to be high throughout the year  Let us consider our main recommendation for 2015  which was favouring Chinese equities  iShares China Large Cap  N FXI   over their US counterparts  This trade worked very well for the first half of the year  with H1 total return gains exceeding 25   However  very quickly  panic gripped global equity markets and by the fall of 2015  we saw the VIX above 50 and a mini stock market crash around the world  With this in mind  timing markets throughout 2016 could play a critical role for those investors who wish to achieve above average returns 
As long as nothing dramatic happens in the coming months  the US equity bull market will have its 7th year anniversary in March of 2016  Investors should note that valuations are getting very stretched  price to book is at 3 times  and revenues   earnings have disappointed as of late  Nevertheless  the primary trend remains up and the tape is signalling higher prices ahead  We expect the S P 500  SPDR S P 500  N SPY   to break out towards new highs within the first quarter or two of the year  Having said that  the rise in the index has been accompanied by ever narrowing breadth and somewhere down the line the market could eventually run out of steam 
On the other hand  Chinese equities  FXI  are trading at relatively low valuations  price is below book value  and have the potential for recovery after being down again this year  Macau gaming stocks such as SJM Holdings  OTC SJMHF   Sands China  OTC SCHYY   Wynn Macau  OTC WYNMY  and so forth are a contrarian s delight  particularly for those with higher risk appetite 
Speaking of contrary plays  we also favour the S P energy sector  Energy Select Sector SPDR  N XLE   and energy producers like MSCI Russia  Market Vectors Russia  N RSX   in 2016  However we wouldn t buy either of these indices until WTI Crude Oil tests the critical support level around  33 per barrel from early 2009 and first shows clear signs of stabilising  Finally  the greenback still continues to be our main currency of choice  and while volatility will remain high  think of the recent December ECB meeting   we expect the US Dollar Index to be trading at new bull market highs sometime in the next year 
Anna Coulling  Commodity Bear Continues  China Hard Landing
In looking forward to 2016 it is perhaps worthwhile briefly to reiterate the dominant themes of 2015  not least of which has been the attempts by the Fed to normalize monetary policy  the continued and relentless decline for commodities  in part due to the strength in the USD  and finally the sustained rally for equities which continues to defy many market experts 
Indeed if any of these trends is to reverse dramatically in 2016 the principle influence is likely to be inflation  or the lack of inflation  and it is this factor which in my opinion will affect much of the tone for the year ahead 
Whilst the Fed may hope to see a return of inflation  albeit in a modest way  the economic data thus far tells a different story  and much of the rhetoric that has been forthcoming would appear to be based on hope rather than anything more concrete  One could also argue that in taking a decision to increase rates  this in itself has been designed to inject some much needed confidence into the market  and in particular the retail sector  whilst simultaneously saving face  Given the recent statements in Europe  and with the suggestion of a major slowdown in China  the economic outlook globally remains extremely fragile  and it would be no surprise next year to see the Fed fail to increase rates again  and indeed one could argue that they may even consider a cut  although this would be unthinkable for the preservation of their reputation 
The single biggest factor currently contributing to this low inflation environment is  of course  oil  In 2014 I anticipated that oil prices would likely be in the  40 per barrel region by the end of 2015  but even I have been astonished by the relentless decline in prices which has resulted in prices moving down to a low of  35 per barrel  There are many and varied factors for this  not least Saudi Arabia s decision to take on the alternative producers in a price war  and with Iranian sanctions set to be lifted in January  which will result in a further 1m barrels a day flooding the market  oil will most definitely continue to take center stage in 2016 
From a technical perspective there is little to suggest that we are at a bottom for oil prices  and indeed on the slower time frames of the weekly and monthly charts there is a distinct lack of buying and the prospect of a buying climax some way off  My view is that there is further downside to come  and we are likely to see WTI oil prices shed a further  10 a barrel  before any major buying comes to the market 
Furthermore  whilst one of the direct impacts for oil prices is  of course  in terms of inflation  one of the less obvious is in those indices heavily dominated by oil company stocks  and here the UK s FTSE 100 is a classic example  Over the last few months we have seen a major divergence between the bullish momentum of US indices  and bearish sentiment in the FTSE100 as the price of oil drags these stocks lower 
Staying with the commodities theme  the outlook for gold remains equally bearish in the early part of the year  However  I am expecting a bottom to be reached once the metal moves below  1000 per ounce  and it may even reach  900 per ounce next year  As always any buying climax will be signalled by volume on the slower time frame charts 
Silver too is likely to follow gold lower  with a possible bottom forming in the  10  11 per ounce region 
To round off on commodities  the decline in copper has been dramatic  and indeed counter cyclical to its conventional role as representative of economic health  In other words the term Dr  Copper could not be further from the truth  and given the bearish technical picture I am expecting the metal to continue selling off with a possible move to 1 400  last seen in March 2010 
The economy everyone will be watching next year is China where the hope is for a gradual decline in economic growth  and a soft landing  However  given the track record of central bank management of economic and monetary policy  a hard landing would be no great surprise  and should this occur the effects would be dramatic and impact commodities  commodity currencies and equities in equal measure  and make the financial crisis of 2008 appear as no more than a minor correction 
Moving to currencies where 2015 provided a high degree of volatility and some great trading opportunities  2016 is likely to continue in this vein  and for the majors much will depend on whether the USD index continues higher  and can overcome the resistance now firmly in place in the 100 20 region  Should this be breached  as seems likely  then the index may continue its bullish tone for much of next year  and we could see a test of the 104 region  last seen in 1999  The congestion phase that has been building on the monthly chart since February 2015 certainly suggests further upside momentum to come 
For the euro  the only question for 2016 is whether parity will be achieved  and longer term bearish sentiment remains firmly in place despite Mario Draghi s recent failure to increase the ECB s bond buying program which the market had been expecting  and has led to a strong move higher in the short term 
For both the British pound  and the Aussie dollar  both currencies continue to remain bearish  with the first falling on weak economic data and likely to continue so  with the latter given a helping hand from the RBA and the continued weakness in commodities 
The Canadian dollar too is likely to remain under pressure for as long as oil prices continue to decline 
Finally  to equity markets which are now reaching a point of exhaustion in the US  and certainly from a technical perspective are building very solid ceilings of resistance to any further short term advance  For the YM  Dow Jones futures  the level is being created around the 18 000 price region  and to date we have not seen a meaningful break and hold of this price point 
The sisters  namely the NQ  NASDAQ futures  and ES  S P500 futures  too are at key resistance price points  with the NQ attempting to break through the 4750 region  and whilst the NASDAQ Composite has been leading stocks higher throughout 2015  this index too appears to be running out of momentum as congestion builds at this price region 
In summary whether you are a trader or investor 2016 promises to be another vintage year 

Ellen R  Wald  Ph D   Oil Glut Remains  Instability Continues
OPEC recently announced its intention to continue with its current crude oil production policies   in other words  the crude oil glut remains at least through June  2016  Instability will continue to roil oil markets for the foreseeable future  The timing on Iran s return to the oil market along with questionable predictions for the amount of oil it will dump on the oversupplied market will factor prominently into 2016 oil pricing  Another key concept to remember as we head into 2016 is that OPEC nations are in the business of making money  Oil rich nations like Saudi Arabia  Kuwait  and the UAE are intentionally overproducing to lower the price of oil and devalue petroleum assets worldwide  This is a strategy to   The big question for 2016 is  When will we see prices begin to recover 
To foresee that turnaround  keep an eye on the major players and what moves they make  When companies like ExxonMobil  N XOM   Chevron  N CVX   and Valero  N VLO  begin to acquire assets from distressed companies in shale oil fields   or buy up smaller shale companies themselves   that is a sign that the price of oil soon rise  Other key indications will be well capitalized national oil companies  like Saudi Aramco  purchasing strategic assets  Responsible energy investors need to follow these national companies as important barometers of the greater energy market  even though they are not traded on the exchanges  These companies are using this period of prolonged low crude prices to expand their contracts in Asia  boost their refining endeavors  capitalize on cheap financing to fund energy infrastructure expansion  and purchase under valued foreign assets  They will not begin to cut back on crude oil production until they have made the strategic long term investments they seek  and they  more than anything else  determine the price of crude 
Meanwhile  in the current market conditions  refineries can be a profitable area  Despite government regulation in the United States that makes pipeline construction difficult  railroads are not a profitable sector  With a new administration  however  the anti oil infrastructure policies may change and  towards the second half of 2016  pipelines may emerge as a profitable option  With continued low crude oil prices  decreasing global passion for climate change  and potentially a Republican administration in the White House  investors should be wary of renewable and clean technology in the long term  Current wind  solar power  and electric charging technologies largely require government assistance to appear profitable  and as more government scaffolding is removed in 2016 and in the following years  the long term viability of these projects will be put to the test 

Matthew Weller  EUR USD Rally
In last year s outlook  I argued that the consensus EUR USD short trade was becoming too crowded and that the increasingly common calls for a move down to parity  1 00  were way off base  Looking back  the big drop in January and February caught me off guard  but for what it s worth  EUR USD was essentially steady around 1 10 for the last ten months of the year 
For 2016  I m going back to the well to make a contrarian case for a EUR USD bounce  While the widely discussed monetary policy divergence between the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank could limit any topside  the divergence may not be as extreme as many traders expect  Inflationary pressures are still nonexistent anywhere in the developed world  so the Fed may not be able to move as quickly it hopes Meanwhile  economic data in the Eurozone has quietly been improving of late  potentially limiting the scope for further easing from the ECB  At the same time  the short EUR USD trade is once again extremely crowded  with the CFTC s Commitment of Trader data showing that speculative traders are short over 200k EUR USD futures contracts 
Albert Einstein once observed that the definition of insanity is  doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results   Fortunately  or maybe unfortunately  depending on your perspective   financial markets are not nearly as deterministic as the physics that Einstein studied  Of course  it s also said that there is a fine line between genius and insanity  and if EUR USD rallies against all expectations in 2016  the traders who capitalize on the move will look like geniuses 
Part II  Is the 7 Year Equity Bull History ",2015-12-28,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/outlook-2016-part-1-376079,376079
179228,400744,VLO,The Week Ahead  Is It Finally Time For  Risk On  ,opinion,"With a modest schedule of data releases  we can expect more analysis of last week s news  Trading in several markets changed course rather abruptly  With traders poised to spot any change in trend  the question will be whether this shift is for real 
Is it finally time for  Risk On  
Prior Theme Recap
In last week s WTWA I predicted that the deluge of economic data would be closely examined for signs of weakness  Put another way  would the economic releases confirm the story of the markets in commodities and bonds  The question was a good one  and the answer was  no   Friday s employment report was the final element  changing the terms of the debate from deflation concerns to that old standby  worrying about the Fed 
Feel free to join in my exercise in thinking about the upcoming theme  We would all like to know the direction of the market in advance  Good luck with that  Second best is planning what to look for and how to react  That is the purpose of considering possible themes for the week ahead 
This Week s Theme
The quirks of the calendar sometimes result in a quiet week following one crammed with data releases  Such is the case in the week ahead  but there is plenty of food for thought  Strength in oil  commodities  and stocks combined with weakness in bonds  utilities and even the dollar  It was the first 2015 sign of a change in market tone  Traders were asking  Is it time for  Risk On  
Background
Over the last two months I have carefully raised and explored the  message  from various markets 
Oil Prices  12 13 14 
The bond market  1 11 15 
Earnings  1 18 15 
Europe  1 25 15 
These themes all gave due respect to the approach of seeking a  message from the market   This is a favorite for most traders and pundits  but it often serves to explain the past  Few seem to find predictive edge from this approach  although it sounds good on TV 
The alternative is to use economic data and corporate earnings to discover where markets may not be efficient  This helps to identify sectors and stocks that are mispriced  Last week I suggested that it might be time to start with the economic data rather than market prices  This advice echoed my 2015 Annual Preview 
The Viewpoints
Here are the main contenders 
Trader perspective   markets lead  Brett Steenbarger started the week with his explanation of   In the old days when he lived in Naperville  we would have a cup of coffee to argue it out  I miss those conversations  By week s end  that a  savvy trader  had to be alive to changes in market themes 
Trader perspective   agility  Charles Kirk s indispensable   small subscription price required  and well worth it  notes that markets held support   safety  trades could be quickly abandoned  and there was still a search for reasons to sell  Well put 
Improving economy  Check out the weekly analysis below  Also   And   NDD also has his valuable  
There is no hope   cannot even discuss good news for a few minutes before turning to what this means for the Fed  You know it is politically charged commentary when it says the Fed is  running out of excuses   A small change in the timing for the very first increase in short term rates is heralded as a market disaster  This theme finds its way into the mainstream media  even including non financial sources like the PBS Newshour 
The tone change was apparent in oil  bonds  utilities  and other markets  The trading in TNX is typical  This is a CBOE product that tracks the ten year yield  Just divide by ten  Pick your own upside target for the first move  
And here is the same story told in utility trading   last year s big winner and last week s big loser  via SPDR Select Sector   Utilities  NYSE XLU   

As always  I have some additional ideas in today s conclusion  But first  let us do our regular update of the last week s news and data  Readers  especially those new to this series  will benefit from reading the  
Last Week s Data
Each week I break down events into good and bad  Often there is  ugly  and on rare occasions something really good  My working definition of  good  has two components 
The news is market friendly  Our personal policy preferences are not relevant for this test  And especially   no politics 
It is better than expectations 
The Good
Despite the market reaction  there was plenty of good news last week 
Rail traffic was strong  See   Also note Bob Dieli in the quant corner on truck traffic  Skeptics of government data should be paying attention to verification from private sources 
Weekly jobless claims remained low  The 278K reading confirmed last week s holiday data  Bespoke has the story and this chart 

Earnings reports have been positive  It may not seem like it  but 78  of reporting S P 500 companies have beaten on earnings and 58  on sales      Some readers objected last week that these results reflected success against lowered expectations  Of course  I have frequently written about this phenomenon  The question right now is whether estimates have fallen enough  and apparently they have   has a more upbeat take  emphasizing the results outside of energy  If energy were to stabilize  potential would be even stronger  This is why it is right to take note of results  especially in the energy sector  where the news was pretty good this week 
Auto sales were strong versus easy comparisons from last winter  A feature was the rebound in the Ford F150 indicator  This has some correlation with small business and construction activity  but has recently been distorted by the model changeover   for the story and charts 
ISM services registered a slight beat of expectations at 56 7  maintaining former strong levels     
Oil prices firmed  The long term economic effects remain a subject for debate  Meanwhile  the short term  risk on  correlation remains   summarizes the economic and geopolitical factors behind this week s trading 
Employment strengthened  Net payroll jobs increased as did wages and hours  Labor force participation was stronger  Prior months were revised higher  You had to look hard to find something wrong with this report  mostly factors that were improving less than the headline numbers  The    to the possible implications for Fed policy 

The Bad
The bad news included some significant economic reports 
Ukraine  There were European meetings without apparent progress  addressing the question of whether Ukraine supporters should provide more deadly weapons  as requested   A peaceful resolution and the winding down of sanctions would be a major plus for the world economy and also for equity markets  Since the negative impact has built up gradually  it is much greater than most realize  To be fully informed  you could start with the  
The ISM index declined to 53 5 from 55 1  missing expectations  Some key internal factors also looked weak   has a full account  I like his analysis since it includes detail on the component breakdown  As he notes  this is still expansion territory  The  has several references to the West Coast port issues and also notes that the data imply a GDP increase of 3 3  

Greece  No real progress and signs of intransigence   has a stern criticism of the Greek position   the possible policy links to Russia 
The Ugly
Measles  Libya again  Medical records hacking  Discussion welcome 
The Silver Bullet
I occasionally give the Silver Bullet award to someone who takes up an unpopular or thankless cause  doing the real work to demonstrate the facts  Think of The Lone Ranger  No award this week  but nominations are welcome  I am seeing plenty of bad charts  but little refutation 
Quant Corner

How to Use the Weekly Data Updates
In the WTWA series I try to share what I am thinking as I prepare for the coming week  I write each post as if I were speaking directly to one of my clients  Each client is different  so I have five different programs ranging from very conservative bond ladders to very aggressive trading programs  It is not a  one size fits all  approach 
To get the maximum benefit from my updates you need to have a self assessment of your objectives  Are you most interested in preserving wealth  Or like most of us  do you still need to create wealth  How much risk is right for your temperament and circumstances 
My weekly insights often suggest a different course of action depending upon your objectives and time frames  They also accurately describe what I am doing in the programs I manage 
Insight for Traders
Felix continues a  neutral  posture for the three week market forecast  but it continues to be a close call  The data have improved a bit  but are still marginally neutral  There is still plenty of uncertainty reflected by the high percentage of sectors in the penalty box  Our current position is still fully invested in three leading sectors  and we have gotten more aggressive  For more information  I have posted a further description     You can sign up for Felix s weekly ratings updates via email to etf at newarc dot com 
Brett Steenbarger has typically wise advice for traders   thinking about trading as an entrepreneur would a new business   
A sadder note for many of us is the end of floor trading in many contracts at the Merc  The several Chicago floors at one time had over 10 000 traders  To be successful required a unique blend of spirit  fast thinking  intelligence  athleticism  integrity  and courage  You also had to be impervious to distractions like people spitting on you  poking you with a pencil  or getting in your face  Trades were cleared at the end of the day  If you did not honor a trade  you were soon gone

As I have noted for five weeks  Felix continues to feature selected energy holdings  Felix is not just a momentum trader 
Insight for Investors
I review the themes here each week and refresh when needed  For investors  as we would expect  the key ideas may stay on the list longer than the updates for traders  Major market declines occur after business cycle peaks  sparked by severely declining earnings  Our methods are focused on limiting this risk  Start with our  and follow the links 
We also have a new page summarizing many of the   If you read something scary  this is a good place to do some fact checking 
My bold and contrarian prediction for 2015   that the leading sectors would lose and the laggards would win   looked a lot better this week  If I am correct  there is a very  very long way to run for the cheapest market sectors   energy  technology  cyclicals  and financials 
Other Advice
Here is our collection of great investor advice for this week 
Being Contrarian

If you were going to pick one link to read this week  I recommend this   It will take a few minutes  but be worth your time  He explains  using some great examples  why it is not enough to be contrarian  You also must have edge  Sometimes  often   the crowd is right  Markets may be accurately priced  Can you spot the difference  Will you be patient enough to let your system work   I confess that part of my love for this work is that it is exactly what I and other value managers try to do  

The Quest for Yield

 does a great takedown of the new eBonds  We see another version of financial alchemy  turning risky assets into something with an AAA rating  Even if you cannot see a flaw  it might simply mean you need to look farther  Risk must be reflected somewhere  and you need to know whether counter parties can pay 

On the positive side in the quest for yield   makes the case for REITs  He explains why this should be a diversification for many and an alternative to bond funds 
Or maybe not  Oliver Renick and Brian Louis explain   Expect bond like  rate sensitive performance

Market Outlook
 calls out the doom and gloomers  Here is a key quote 

One result of this global monetary policy activism has been a rebellion among pseudo economists and market hacks in recent years  This assortment of  Austrian  economists  radical monetarists  gold bugs  and bitcoin fanatics has repeatedly warned that such a massive increase in global liquidity would lead to hyperinflation  the U S  dollar s collapse  sky high gold prices  and the eventual demise of fiat currencies at the hands of digital cryptocurrency counterparts 


None of these dire predictions has been borne out by events 

 says that Dow Theory is now flashing a  sell signal  
Final Thought
Risk  Many investors wisely begin by thinking about risk  That is how I start each interview with a potential client  Everyone has the need to protect a portion of the investment portfolio  with the assurance that any losses will be modest 
It is not always easy to identify safety  Last year s most successful investments were bonds and bond proxies  The quest for safe yield has become a crowded trade  Those celebrating the success of bond mutual funds and their utility payouts should look at this week s results  It is a very small taste of what will happen when interest rates return to more normal levels 
Reward  And we all need some investment reward  either to keep pace with inflation or to increase the retirement nest egg  There is excessive focus on arguments about the overall market valuation  There are plenty of cheap stocks and sectors 
Take only one example  The energy names that I mentioned in the annual preview   refiners and integrated oil companies that actually can benefit from lower oil prices   are all up about 10  in less than a month   Valero Energy Corporation  NYSE VLO   Marathon Petroleum Corporation  NYSE MPC   Chevron Corporation  NYSE CVX

179229,400745,VLO,C Tracks Miller Howard Dividend Reinvestor  New Strategies for Elevated Markets,opinion,Stock markets in most regions of the world continue to press forward in their bullish trends  and this has left many investors wondering whether or not there are still opportunities to be found in equity markets  There are legitimate questions that should be asked here  because it was not long ago that benchmarks like the S P 500 were posting new record highs only to fall back toward long term lows in a very volatile fashion  So it might not be the best idea to simply buy into any selection of stocks simply because the momentum is still positive  Instead  new investors must do their research and implement a strategy that is appropriate for the current market environment  One approach that is likely to benefit is to find well positioned stocks that have a strong performance history and a sustainable dividend approach  Many investors view these types of strategies as a way of generating income  but there are variations on this approach that can be helpful in growing a broader equity base over time  Specifically  dividend reinvestment strategies will take the dividend payout that would normally be distributed to the investor and instead use those funds to add to the original position  Over time  this enables investors to grow an asset base without adding any money to the original outlay  Reinvestment as a Dividend Strategy AlternativeFor those considering alternative dividend strategies  one of the best positioned instruments is the Citigroup C Tracks ETN

strategies in a number of different asset markets  in areas like master limited partnerships  dividend growth  and energy infrastructure investments   and its position in the industry is firmly established The Miller Howard Strategic Dividend Index tracks the performance of 30 US stocks selected using fundamental factors and quantitative criteria that is updated quarterly  These factors include elements like dividend yield  yield sustainability  expected capital growth  and current valuations relative to book value  In addition to this  the stock selections are vetted base on high returns on invested capital relative to P E ratios and 26 week momentum trends in the underlying stock price  When we look at the specific stock selections that can be found in DIVC  some interesting trends start to become apparent  One trend in particular can be seen in the focus on energy markets  with names like Exxon Mobil  NYSE XOM   Ford Motor  NYSE F   and Valero Energy  NYSE VLO  rounding out the list  These are companies that stand to benefit from potential reversals in energy markets    areas have seen significant weakness over the last year  If we start to see sector changes here that are more in line with the historical trends  DIVC could benefit given its strong exposure in energy markets  Additionally  these stocks are some of the most stable performers in the dividend space  so there is potential for enhanced returns via more than one route  Chart Source   Miller Howard s strict selection process helps to ensure that only the best performers in the dividend category make it into the fund  This is important  given the fact that the current low interest rate environment makes suitable choices in this category more difficult to find   Currently  dividend yields in the S P 500 are seen near 1 9    said George Mahshigian  CEO at    This is well below the historical average of 4 4  for dividend yields in the S P  so there are clear deviations between what is seen now and the long term averages   For dividend investors  this is important information because there is still no real indication of when the US Federal Reserve will start raising interest rates and this makes it much more difficult for investors to capitalize on yield producing assets  Since it began trading  the C Tracks ETN Miller Howard Strategic Dividend Reinvestor has shown dividend yields above 3     well above what can be captured by investors that are looking to invest in benchmarks like the S P 500  It should be remembered that these cash dividends are not paid out directly  and instead are notionally reinvested back into the index  In this way  positions are designed to grow as a reflection of the elevated dividend payouts associated with each stock in the Miller Howard Strategic Dividend Index  This conservative approach to dividends offers a new and incentive method for investors to generate returns in stock markets that are trading near record highs  Overall  the outlook for DIVC remains positive given its advantages over most of the commonly employed stock strategies and I expect solid returns into the second half of this year ,2015-04-09,Richard

179230,400746,VLO,3 Top Ranked Stocks Likely to Beat Earnings This Quarter,opinion,"As the first quarter earnings season unfolds  investors will stop obsessing about what the Fed s going to do for some time  and confront the ground reality of the performance of the companies  The first quarter earnings season is carting along with it a gloomy shroud of declining earnings estimates  While negative estimate revisions have been a recurring theme for several quarters now  the sheer magnitude of this quarter s revisions is something that the market hasn t seen since the Great Recession 

Current estimates for the S P 500 stocks are portending consecutive negative earnings  growth  for the first two quarters of 2015  Two back to back quarters of negative growth is what we call an  earnings recession    something the market hasn t seen in quite some time 

Never Ending Negative Revisions

Till the very end of 2014  analysts were expecting earnings growth of 4 3  in the first quarter of this year  In a matter of a few months  that projection has slumped to  4 6   Even more alarming is the markdown in the second quarter expectations  S P 500 companies that were expected to deliver earnings growth of 5 3  are now expected to chart negative growth of 1 9   What s more  there is still ample amount of time left for more downward revisions  which could potentially push the full year 2015 growth rate into the negative territory 

For the first quarter  a significant part of the drag comes from the energy sector  as it grapples with relentlessly plunging oil prices  However  almost all sectors are expected to be impacted by a strong dollar  a fragile global economy and the recent flurry of sub standard data back home  The few sectors that look somewhat buffered are Healthcare  Financials  Utilities and Telecoms 

Sifting out the Winners

There could be another  slightly warped reason for the disappointing estimate revisions as well  Recent trends suggest that management teams have shown a penchant for the art of expectations management   by under promising and over delivering  To that end  they consistently provide weak earnings guidance  thus dragging estimates down 

Be that as it may  it is indisputable that there will be plenty of companies that will conquer all odds and emerge as winners this season  Although not all companies that post positive earnings surprises see their stock price appreciate  studies indicate that on an average  earnings beats drive strong returns in share prices for several weeks following the report  This is what we call the post earnings announcement drift  Picking out and investing in such stocks before they report earnings can substantially boost your portfolio returns 

The Zacks Advantage

While it is impossible to know with complete conviction which stocks have the potential to beat estimates this earnings season and which ones will disappoint  our proprietary   Expected Surprise Prediction  system makes it a relatively easy ride 

Earnings ESP   the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate   is our proprietary methodology for distinguishing stocks that have a high chance of beating estimates in their next earnings reports 

A straightforward way to narrow down such stocks is to screen them with a favorable Zacks Rank   Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy    2  Buy  or  3  Hold    and a positive Earnings ESP  The combination of a favorable Zacks Rank and a positive Earnings ESP usually heralds an earnings beat  Our research shows that the chance of a positive earnings surprise for such stocks is as high as 70  

To refine our screen further  we are considering only those stocks that have an impressive history of beating estimates in the past four quarters  Also  these champions have been seeing positive estimate revisions of late  flying in the face of the general trend 

Our Potential Outperformers

179254,400770,VLO,Plunging Oil Prices Lead To U S  Refining Boom,opinion,"Sliding oil prices are generally bad for most companies in the oil and gas industry 

But one segment is loving the current conditions of low oil prices  surging supply  and motivated exporting 

It s also being boosted by cheap natural gas  which it uses as a power source  I am  of course  talking about refineries   they re in the midst of a major boom 

U S  refineries are running at well above 90  of capacity  Refining capacity has reached approximately 17 8 million barrels a day  an increase of 400 000 barrels a day from just two years ago 

John Auers from the energy consultancy  Turner  Mason   Company  said to the Financial Times   They re running refineries as hard as they can  

This war between certain producers has left two refining companies  in particular  sitting in the catbird seat 

Canada vs  Mexico and Venezuela

According to Bloomberg  the heavy oil producers in Canada  Mexico  and Venezuela are battling it out via oil prices 

The latter two countries have traditionally provided Gulf Coast refineries with heavy crude  But Canada  which increased its oil exports to the United States by 63  in the past five years  is now muscling its way in 

This month the new Seaway Pipeline   owned 50 50 by the Canadian Enterprise Products Partners LP  NYSE EPD  and the American Enbridge Inc  NYSE ENB    will nearly double the amount of heavy crude oil coming to Gulf Coast refineries to almost 400 000 barrels a day 

This heavy crude shipping through the pipeline from Canada will now cost roughly the same as heavy crude shipped via oil tankers from Mexico  thanks to discounts offered by Canadian producers 

In response  Mexico s state owned oil company  Pemex  is raising its discount to U S  buyers to  3 70 a barrel from  0 90 in January  That is the biggest discount rise since August 2013 

But why is Mexico doing this 

Well you see  U S  refiners can handle heavy crude  while most refiners elsewhere in the world cannot  On the Gulf Coast alone  there are 2 4 million barrels a day of heavy oil refining capacity 

So if Mexico and Venezuela can t sell their oil here  much of their oil revenues will dry up  Brazil and Saudi Arabia are working on their own large heavy oil refineries  but they re still several years away from being finished 

The Mexican Institute of Finance Executives said in an interview with El Economista   Mexico will need to make adjustments to face this new situation  lower prices  in the oil market  

These adjustments are greatly benefiting the American oil refiners 

The Two Main Beneficiaries

Two refining companies have spent heavily on the necessary equipment to refine heavy crude  making them poised and ready to process  Valero Energy Corporation  NYSE VLO   the largest U S  refining company  and Marathon Petroleum Corporation  NYSE MPC  

Valero is particularly interesting  having increased its overall refining capacity by 277  between 2000 and 2013  The company also has the 57  of its refining capacity on the Gulf Coast  more than any of its competitors 

In September  Valero began operating a new rail offloading facility at its Port Arthur Refinery  which allows it to obtain cheap Canadian heavy crude without a pipeline  Its overall expansion is continuing  too  with the planned addition of refining units in Houston and Corpus Christi  Texas 

Marathon also has projects in the works to make it easier to get heavy crude from Canada to its refining facilities  

It s contemplating reversing the flow of the Calpine pipeline system   owned by MPC  BP Plc  NYSE BP   and Plains All American Pipeline LP  NYSE PAA    in 2016 from Louisiana to the Midwest  repurposing it to bring heavy oil from Alberta to its Gulf Coast refineries  

Approximately 1 2 million barrels a day of Canadian crude could be shipped via this pipeline to the Gulf Coast 

In general  both companies continue to look at more ways to leverage the price war between Canada and Mexico  In the carnage that is the energy sector  these two companies stand to benefit greatly 

And  the chase  continues

179273,400789,VLO,3 Energy Funds To Buy Amid Keystone XL Debate,opinion,"The Keystone XL pipeline debate has been around for a while  The latest development has now brought a new challenge for Obama  Louisiana Democrat Mary Landrieu and North Dakota Republican John Hoeven have introduced pro Keystone XL bill bypassing the President s nod  Thus  work is supposed to begin immediately for 1 660 mile pipeline construction  The vote is expected early next week  result of which is uncertain  The Keystone XL pipeline  if approved  would connect the oil sands of Alberta to the US Gulf  Proponents of the project cite job creation and economic benefits  while detractors point at environmental costs as well as the dangers associated with pipelines  However  the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline expansion has got both Democrats and Republicans fired up  The choice between Republican pragmatism and greener Democrats is a tough call for the incumbent White House  Obama administration is reported to have been delaying the project  The construction phase would generate more than 40 000 temporary jobs but fewer than 100 permanent positions after the pipeline is put in place  Critics have also pointed out that if a pipeline extension is not permitted  the U S  would have to rely more on foreign sources like Venezuela  The Republicans  along with a cross section of Democrats  are pushing for approval of the pipeline which they believe would pump the U S  economy with multi millions in revenues  Several energy firms are expected to benefit from the pipeline  The beneficiaries include Valero Energy Corporation  NYSE VLO  and Exxon Mobil Corporation  NYSE XOM   This is particularly true because there is busy trade between the Western Canadian Select  WCS  hub and the U S  Gulf Coast regardless of whether or not the pipeline is approved by President Obama  Among the broader advantages for the energy sector  positive economic data and geopolitical fears have helped oil prices stay above the major psychological threshold of  100 per barrel  The immediate outlook for oil  however  remains positive given the commodity s constrained supply picture  In particular  while the Western economies exhibit sluggish growth prospects  global oil consumption is expected to get a boost from sustained strength in China  which continue to expand at a healthy rate despite some moderation  Thus  investors may consider some top ranked energy funds at this point  It s a good idea to focus on energy sector funds that have a healthy year to date return  Then one should zero in on funds that sport a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank  1  Strong Buy   Remember  the goal of the Zacks Mutual Fund Rank is to guide investors to identify potential winners and losers  Unlike most of the fund rating systems  the Zacks Mutual Fund Rank is not just focused on past performance  but the likely future success of the fund BlackRock Energy   Resources Investor A    seeks capital appreciation over the long run  It invests a lion s share of its assets in small cap companies related to sectors including energy  natural resources and utilities  The fund has no limit on number of companies it can invest in  but it will invest in a minimum of three countries  The fund has returned 9 8  year to date and 26 9  over the last one year Top holdings include EOG Resources Inc  Cimarex Energy Co and Consol Energy Inc Fidelity Advisor Energy A    invests a lion s share of its assets in companies associated with the energy sector  These companies may deal with both conventional and newer sources of energy like nuclear and solar power among others  It invests in companies irrespective of their location  Company s financial condition  industry rank and overall market condition are considered for investment decisions  The fund has returned 7 8  year to date and 23 8  over the last one year  Top holdings include Exxon Mobil Corporation  Chevron Corp and EOG Resources Inc Vanguard Energy    seeks capital growth on a long term basis  Majority of the investment are parked in companies whose primary operations are involved in energy and energy fuels  The fund may also invest all its assets in foreign companies  The fund has returned 7 9  year to date and 22 6  over the last one year  Top holdings include Exxon Mobil Corporation  Chevron Corp and Royal Dutch Shell PLC ADR Class A

179275,400791,VLO,What Is Chen Selling  One Of His Tenbaggers,opinion,"What Is Chen Selling  One of His Tenbaggers  What is Chen Buying  Two Others with Tenbagger Potential
Chen Lin doesn t get attached to stocks  only to profits  The author of What is Chen Buying  What is Chen Selling  buys low  sells high  then tells his subscribers what he s doing and why  In this interview with The Energy Report  Lin describes a recent success and explains his high expectations for two oil and gas producers  Savvy investors  Pay attention 
The Energy Report  Chen  recent U S  Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  actions with regard to ethanol blending requirements have been unsettling to the ethanol space  What are you expecting from the EPA and when 
Chen Lin  I expect an EPA ruling by the end of June  It will likely increase the mandate from last year s proposal  but will be less than the original mandate  which was established a couple of years ago  It will be in the middle because it s an election year  and the agency does not want to make anybody angry 
TER  Will the domestic market or the export market be stronger for ethanol in the future 
CL  The domestic market is still the largest and most important for the ethanol industry  However  export is getting more significant  Right now we export to Canada  to Brazil  to Asia over the world  Europe s still banning the purchase of American ethanol because it wants to protect its domestic agriculture  so is Japan  That leaves China  which l see as potentially the most important  for American ethanol  This will benefit farmers and the renewable energy industry 
I had a discussion about ethanol use in China in my last interview with The Energy Report  I ve done a lot more research on that subject lately  Look at gasoline usage in China  China has a huge automobile market  which translates to a huge gasoline market  Unfortunately  ethanol use is only 1 2   The Chinese are still using MTBE  which is banned in the United States  Canada and all over the developed world  We know the problem  MTBE pollutes the groundwater  However  big oil in China  PetroChina Co  Ltd   NYSE PTR  continues to mislead Chinese citizens  saying ethanol is bad for car engines and promoting use of MTBE  because it is heavily investing in MTBE  That s actually preventing the export of American ethanol to China 
We should immediately start an information campaign to educate Chinese citizens about the danger of MTBE  We have a lot of evidence that it s polluting groundwater  and it costs billions of dollars to clean that up  Chinese citizens are very sensitive to pollution and to water quality  If they get that information  they will likely start protesting big oil in China  Also  the United States should have high level talks with China with the Premier because big oil wouldn t listen to popular opinion  It doesn t care  It cares about profit  But big oil does listen to the Premier  That s probably the only way  Educate the people and then go to the top level to push China to gradually retire MTBE and use ethanol  That will benefit American farmers and the American renewable industry for decades to come 
TER  Are you saying that China will be the main export buyer of ethanol 
CL  Potentially it would  Right now China is using very little ethanol  If China begins to use more ethanol to cut pollution  the only loser would be big oil in China  China could provide a very bright future for ethanol producers and farmers  in the United States  But we need a strategy and need to push that hard 
TER  There s been a lot of confrontation in relations between China and the U S  recently  as the U S  has indicted Chinese officials for cyber espionage and has resisted China s claims to areas in the East China and South China seas  In response  China is banning or limiting operations by U S  based companies  How will these issues affect the companies you cover 
CL  China remains a big challenge  as well as a big opportunity  for U S  businesses  China itself is changing because of the rise of the middle class  Believe it or not  the Chinese are very Internet savvy  Most people I met last year when I was visiting China had Internet VPN  virtual private network  access  They bypass the firewall of the Chinese government and browse the Web freely  because nobody wants to read censored news 
The issues right now in China are the popping of the housing bubble  pollution and corruption  Those are the top concerns of Chinese citizens  I think they re probably more interested about fixing those than they are about fixing external confrontations  I don t think citizens would support confrontation 
But there could be some win win situations  I think ethanol is the perfect example  It could be a win win solution on both sides  We are living on the same Earth  so carbon emissions in China are the same as carbon emissions in the United States  The Obama administration has been very tough on reducing carbon emissions in the U S  I think he can push China to reduce emissions as well  There s where I see the opportunities 
TER  How is the narrowing spread between West Texas Intermediate  WTI  and Brent affecting the companies you cover 
CL  The narrowing of WTI Brent is very negative for the refiners  their margins are very sensitive to WTI Brent  Fortunately  I sold all my refiners for a very nice profit  I don t own refiners at this time  even though I made very good money before  On the plus side  the spread will benefit the domestic oil producers  because the narrowing of WTI to Brent will increase what the producers sell  Also  we had a very cold winter  so the natural gas price is high  Domestic producers are in a very sweet spot right now because the oil price is higher  and the natural gas price is even higher 
TER  What is the status of Mart Resources Inc  s  TO MMT  pipeline project in Nigeria 
CL  According to the company  it will finish pipeline construction by the end of June and start commissioning right after  I expect it will commission the new pipeline in Q3 14  The pipeline will potentially triple Mart s oil production  That will make Mart a completely different producer 
Another part of the news is that Mart is bidding on some huge oil fields being sold by majors  like Royal Dutch Shell Plc  NYSE RDSa   Nigerian media is saying that Mart has already won one or more of the bids  I think the company still needs to work on the details  as well as financing  The big advantage for Mart and its local partners is that when they buy from big oil companies like Shell  they enjoy a five year tax holiday as an indigenous company  That s the same as Mart enjoyed with its current field  though that holiday just expired 
You can understand why the major is willing to sell  and why Mart and other indigenous companies are willing to buy  It s a big opportunity  With the new pipeline  and then potentially with the new concession  there will be new marginal field programs for Mart in the future  The company s future looks very bright  By the end of 2014 we ll be looking at a very different company 
TER  Why did you call Pan Orient Energy Corp  s  TO POE  East Jabung farm out one of the most significant milestones in the company s history 
CL  I ve been waiting for this for the past few years  Pan Orient acquired East Jabung during the financial crisis  It has the potential of half a billion barrels of oil equivalent  0 5 Bboe   It s oil and gas  That could make it one of the largest onshore conventional oil discoveries in the world  It s one of the best Indonesian fields  if not the best 
The fiscal terms are very important  It s split 35 65 with the Indonesian government  Pan Orient and Pan Orient s potential partner will get 35   and the government will get 65   The majority of the fields in Indonesia split 15 85  That makes a huge difference  This discovery is very valuable 
A recent report estimates each barrel equivalent will be worth  20 40  If you just take the low end  at  20  and multiply that by the potential of this possibly huge discovery again  0 5 Bboe then figure Pan Orient will try to farm out 50  for carried interest  you can calculate roughly  5 billion   5B   Convert that to Canadian dollars and divide it by shares  and it comes to almost  100 share  The stock right now is only  2 share  You can see the potential of this development 
If the company can farm out the drilling in the next couple of months it needs to build a road first  and then can start drilling at the first half of 2015  if not earlier that will be one of the most anticipated wells in the junior space 
Pan Orient is investing in some other important catalysts in the near term  One is in Canada  the heavy oil  It should start first oil in August  The company also has a high impact well in Thailand  waiting for a permit from the government  Once Pan Orient gets the permit  it can potentially drill the wells in Q3 14  In Indonesia  another company  Singapore listed Ramba Energy Ltd   R14 SGX   discovered sizable oil on the other side of the border with Pan Orient s property  Pan Orient needs to drill one well on its side of the border  and then the companies will redraw the boundary of the oil  The oil is already discovered  The other company has already filed the plan for development  for up to 50 000 barrels per day  50 Kbbl d   It s a big oil field  and Pan Orient has the crest of the discovery  These catalysts are all going to happen before East Jabung 
In terms of the timeline  Pan Orient has many  very important  company changing catalysts in the next 6 12 months  In the past few years  the company has had very bad luck drilling in Indonesia  Almost every one of the past five or six wells it drilled was dry  Expectations of the investment community have been very low  Some people even stated publicly that every well from now on would be a dry hole  That s why the stock price is a rock bottom  2 share because Pan Orient stock price is just above its current cash and its 2P reserve  which is worth about  2  The upside is not priced in by the market  That s why the next 6 12 months could be very exciting 
TER  Has the farm out been appealing to investors  Has it affected the share price 
CL  Not much  Just in the last quarter  the company announced it was close to a 49  farm out  I assume in the next couple of months  it will announce who the partner is and how much money the partner will pay for the 49   I think when investors take a look at the terms  they will react differently 
TER  Pacific Ethanol Inc   NASDAQ PEIX  has had an exciting year  with a sevenfold increase in its share price  What s behind that  and what s ahead for Pacific Ethanol 
CL  Pacific Ethanol was one of my biggest winners in the past 6 12 months  It was a great turnaround story  thanks to the low corn price  At the end of last year  the corn price suddenly dropped  For a highly leveraged company like Pacific Ethanol  this was a huge opportunity  because it went from not making money to suddenly making a lot of money  I was very fortunate  I was able to load up on the shares  as well as its call options  at the end of last year  I was able to book huge profits when the share price popped to double digits with the Q4 13 earnings release  That s when I sold my call options  I sold most of my shares at around  16 share  ahead of Q1 14  because at that time I felt the market was a bit frothy  The market expectation was very high  I d rather take a profit off the table 
I started buying shares when the price fell close to  10 share  After the earnings  I bought back Pacific Ethanol at  11   10 50  I told my subscribers I would buy at  11   10 50 and  10  but  10 was never reached maybe because my subscribers were also buying  That s life  I feel the stock has a lot of room to grow  The company raised money at  16 share  It strengthened its balance sheet  It restarted Madera  another ethanol plant  in this quarter 
Right now the ethanol margin is very high  It dipped a couple of months ago  now it s very high again very volatile  Pacific Ethanol is trading with no hedge  That s a great opportunity to make a lot of money in Q2 14 
TER  Green Plains Renewable Energy Inc   NASDAQ GPRE  began a growth spurt in December 2013 that has continued  What was the catalyst for that 
CL  Green Plains had a good run  I also own the stock  Again  the ethanol industry had a boom because of the low corn price  Green Plains remains the cheapest publicly traded ethanol producer in terms of capacity versus market cap  However  because of an aggressive hedging program  the upside was very limited  the company s earnings were not strong 
If you compare the Green Plains margin versus Valero Energy Corp  s  NYSE VLO  ethanol division margin  though they are similarly sized  Valero s margin is almost three times higher than Green Plains  That s how bad the hedging program was  On the other hand  Green Plains is the largest independently traded ethanol producer  It could be a very good takeover target  For company refiners on the West Coast  Pacific Ethanol is a better takeover target  Both Green Plains and Pacific Ethanol are excellent targets  and I m quite excited about both companies 
TER  Are you expecting Green Plains  growth spurt to continue 
CL  Yes  It s well run  The only problem is the hedge at the  0 20 0 30 margin  when the company could get  0 70 0 80 margin in the spot market  But the company still makes a lot of money at the  0 20 0 30 margin  It probably will pay off all of its debt by the end of 2015 
TER  Were you surprised that Wells Fargo   Co   NYSE WFC  downgraded Swift Energy Co   NYSE SFY  from outperform to market perform and lowered its target price 
CL  That s a good question  I was a little bit surprised  I would say those analysts are busy counting the trees but missing the big forest  Years ago  most analysts were pushing every oil company to take on more debt to show growth  Now it s just the opposite  They re severely punishing companies with debt  Analysts demand that companies sell their assets at whatever cost to bring their balance sheets to the level the analysts want to see  Personally I see opportunity 
As we discussed earlier  WTI is on the rise and natural gas is on the rise  I heard liquified natural gas  LNG  export terminals will be ready by 2016  We had a very cold winter  natural gas storage is very low  It will take a few years to refill natural gas storage facilities  Before we can finish the refill  LNG exports will start  Natural gas looks brighter than oil  if you look ahead a few years  But both commodities oil and natural gas are looking good  A lot of businesses are looking to get into the North American oil and gas opportunities 
In addition  there has been very active deal making  In the last month or so  when Swift Energy farmed out its natural gas property  it sold half its assets for about  175 million   175M   which is about  70 000   70K  per acre  It had estimated only  20 30K  That s a perfect example of how  in a rising commodity environment  which I believe we are in  leverage is a good thing  Swift Energy has a big acreage at Eagle Ford  and it s trading at two times cash flow when most companies are trading at five or more  Many assets recently sold for ten times cash flow  There are a lot opportunities 
Analysts have a fancy term  They call it EBITDA  earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization   They use that to analyze value  Basically  they add the debt to the market cap  That s only one side of the story EBITDA versus EV  enterprise value   How about the asset  How about acreage  How about 2P reserve  That s my experience  The analysts tend to be overly bearish when the market starts to turn  when you should buy  and be overly optimistic at the top of the market  Again  that s my opinion  Maybe the best analysts are not working for the hedge funds 
I had a very good run last year  I bought Penn Virginia Corp   NYSE PVA  below  5 late last year  It more than tripled in less than a year  I also have a big run on Lightstream Resources Ltd   TO LTS   I still hold Lightstream  I sold Penn Virginia  They re quite similar to Swift Energy  They re heavily shorted  They have a sizeable debt  They have no love on Wall Street  It s a little like the housing market  When it goes down big time  you don t want any leverage  when it goes up  leverage is good  When the energy outlook looks brighter  as I see it is  a company can sell assets at good prices  Then the funds will get in  The shorts will try to get out  The stock can have a big run  and I see similar situations to that of Swift Energy 
TER  Do you have any other companies that you re excited about right now 
CL  I still like international plays  I like companies with good balance sheets  I like companies with good cash flow  I like companies that can grow on their own  Also  right now  I feel the North American market has stabilized enough that companies with a reasonable amount of debt look very good  The market has been going to extremes on debt 
I m also very bullish on ethanol  Finally  I want to emphasize that every commodity China needs went through the roof  Oil  liquefied natural gas  copper you name it  If the United States can open up the ethanol market in China  the ethanol boom will go on for years  if not decades

179291,400807,VLO,Roger Wiegand On The Profit From Seasonal Energy Cycles,opinion,For short term traders  understanding cyclical markets is the key to profits  And with the hottest summer months ahead  natural gas could get a price boost when air conditioners start to hum  says Roger Wiegand  publisher of the Trader Tracks investment newsletter  In this interview with The Energy Report  Wiegand shares some promising names for investors who are ready to read the technical charts and mark their calendars  The Energy Report  How are the supply demand fundamentals playing out for North American energy resources   Roger Wiegand  Fortunately  supply is strong  The U S  has substantial reserves of natural gas and oil  Shale gas in West Texas is a big  wide new program  The Bakken region in the Dakotas and Eastern Montana sports 7 000 producing wells  Because domestic oil and gas production in the U S  is increasing  we are buying less petroleum from the Middle East  much to the chagrin of the dominant forces there   The big oil producers in the Middle East want to hold the Brent price  which is worldwide oil  at around  100 per barrel   100 bbl   In the U S   the floor price for West Texas Intermediate  WTI  is  85 bbl  Oil production is up 10   which normally would push the price down  But the increase in supply is offset by inflation within the energy sector  Oil could go as high as  110 115 bbl before the end of the year   The price of oil is tied to security based fears  Things are ugly in Syria and Turkey right now  The oil price in the U S  could increase in response to fear of war or increasing turmoil in the Middle East  When things really get scary  as they did in Afghanistan and Iraq  there is often a  10 bbl premium in the oil price  which is a lot   TER  Is the oversupply of gas in the U S  an opportunity for export   RW  Exporting liquid natural gas  LNG  with ships is very expensive  But shipyards in South Korea and Europe are actively building LNG carrying vessels  The primary buyer of LNG is Japan  Japan overreacted when it shut down its 25 nuclear power plants after the tsunami  The price of electricity went through the roof  When I was there last year  the temperature in office buildings was kept at a toasty 80 degrees  Japan needs to turn to LNG across all of its energy fronts  Some of its nuclear power was turned back on  and it has old plants that run on coal  Electricity generation from coal is leveling off  though   For a while  China was starting up a new coal fired power plant every week  That is a stunning fact  but it reflects just how much power the Chinese economy requires  A lot of these plants operate with no environmental protection restrictions  Consequently  the air and water are terribly polluted in industrial and urban areas of China  But the government is doing the best it can to stimulate the provision of electricity from a range of resources  wind  solar  coal  nuclear and natural gas   TER  Let s focus on opportunities in the junior oil and gas sector  What promising names do you have for us today   RW  New Zealand Energy Corp   NZ TSX V   is a good company  Its price recently backed off because after three major drilling expeditions performed well  the company s share price went up tremendously and investors took profits  But the company is well funded and it controls important reserves  We advise holding on to New Zealand Energy  because the price is likely to go back up   We recently found a solid petroleum service company in the Calgary region of Canada  Enterprise Group Inc   E TSX V   It is a pipeline and construction company that provides equipment and services to regional oil and gas drillers  It was formed from a combination of three smaller companies and management has plans to expand  Keep in mind that Enterprise Group is not exploring  which can be risky  Enterprise is a pick and shovel operation and its business is very steady  If one element of its trade slows down  the other two revenue sources can pick up the slack  It had tremendous new net profits on the last report  The managers are very sharp guys  I spent an hour with them and I was very impressed  We recommended Enterprise Group at CA 0 60  The floor is CA 0 20  The intermediate price is about CA 0 45  but the current price is way above that based upon good performance   TER  Do you think holding onto a company is a good way to hedge against cyclical downturns in the energy markets   RW  A diversified company that performs really well is worth hanging onto it as a long term investment  However  we are not long term investment recommenders  I encourage people to trade if they have gained or lost a sizable amount in a stock  Of course  some folks just do not want to trade  They want to hold onto a stock for 10 or 20 years  But those who want to trade need to understand how the cycles work in the shorter term  For example  commodities generally go higher into the fall before selling off  A trader who watches the charts will take profits before the fall selling event   I still read the old Jesse Livermore books his investment psychology is excellent  His attitude is that a trader should not be in the market all the time  He can pick his spots and go for the best  either long or short  Personally  I have not had a lot of luck trading short  so I do not do it  and I stopped recommending it  We have had good luck with call options in the right time of year  however  But a word of caution  If you do not have the technical expertise to deal with puts and calls  do not try to do it at home   TER  Is it wise for junior investors to put together a large portfolio under the assumption that some percentage of them will pay off over time   RW  I advise being selective  pick a handful of good stocks with the right fundamentals and technicals  Buy and sell them in sync with the seasonal cycles for each industry   TER  What other oil and gas service industries are out there   RW  In a word  railroads  The Keystone pipeline has been delayed  but there is still a pressing need to transport oil and gas from the Bakken region to petroleum refineries at the Gulf of Mexico  A lot of that oil is being moved by rail  It costs more money to transport by rail  but overall it is economic right now  A big refiner in Texas  Valero Energy Corp   VLO   recently announced its intention to own a fleet of 12 000 rail cars by 2015  And in 2009  Warren Buffett bought the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad  which transports oil by tank car  Buffet does not want to see the Keystone Pipeline built because that would ruin his tank car business   With so much oil and gas drilling in Canada and in the U S   the service sector is where we are seeing major growth  The drillers need exploration backup  pipes  general servicing and hauling all the things that allow the drillers to drill  Even some of the largest firms like Exxon Mobil Corp   XOM  buy specialized services  as it is cheaper to outsource than to create internal capabilities to do these types of jobs   TER  What do you think about the future of coal in North America   RW  We have liked coal for a long time  Environmentalists have tried to prevent construction of new coal fired power plants in the U S   and generally they ve been successful  But we think that energy sources for the U S  should include every type of energy  Coal still supplies 40 45  of all power produced in the U S  Some plants are better than others  Clean coal can be done  although it costs a lot  Some utilities find it more economic to convert coal fired plants to operate using natural gas   TER  What s the future of nuclear energy in the U S    RW  There is a future for nuclear in North America  but it is darn slow  It takes 12 15 years to even get a permit to start up  Fifteen years is a long wait  Some of the old reactors are ready to be shut down because it costs too much to repair and update them   TER  Please sum up the state of the energy market for short term investors   RW  The energy cycle doldrums do not last very long  For example  natural gas usage goes up dramatically in July and August on air conditioning demand  And many of the coal fired power plants in the U S  that were converted to natural gas cannot be reconverted  because it costs too much money  So the utilities are increasingly dependent on burning natural gas  which was trading way under  2 per thousand cubic feet   2 Mcf   and now it s up to  4 Mcf  It is headed toward  5 Mcf this year  Now is a good time to

179316,400832,VLO,Keith Schaefer  Refineries Will Be Big Winners When Price Gaps Widen ,opinion,The Street thinks oil price differentials stem from lack of pipelines  That s only partly true  says Keith Schaefer  editor of Oil   Gas Investments Bulletin  arguing that limited refinery capacity is just as big a challenge  Schaefer expects most investors to be caught completely off guard when the Brent WTI gap widens and light oil prices plummet later this year  and in his nuanced interview with The Energy Report  he tells us who stands to profit  who stands to lose and why select natural gas companies are getting a lot of love right now   The Energy Report  There s been a lot of talk about the spread between West Texas Intermediate  WTI  and Brent narrowing considerably this year  What are you expecting to happen   Keith Schaefer  The Street is expecting a narrower spread  but I have the opposite view for a pretty straightforward reason  It starts with light oil  The amount of light oil being produced in the U S  due to the shale revolution is going to completely overwhelm the refineries as early as July  Over the last 25 years  oil refineries in the U S  have been moving away from light oil to heavy oil   But more recently  light shale oil has been replacing expensive  Brent priced imports in the Gulf Coast  providing a relief valve for high Brent prices  But there is only so much capacity  over the last five to seven years  about 0 5 million barrels  MMbbl  of refining capacity for light oil has been lost in the States just from switching to heavy  Thus  the light oil price in North America depends on the very limited light oil refinery capacity   Meanwhile  an extra 250 350 thousand barrels a day  Mb d  will come out of the Bakken this year and easily that same amount out of Texas  Louisiana Light Sweet  LLS  crude could easily drop at least  5 10 bbl once supply overwhelms capacity  and the whole energy complex is unprepared  The big question is if that is going to become a regional differential  or if light oil prices up the mid continent through to Canada will drop  Right now  the most expensive oil in North America is LLS at the Gulf Coast  Light oil gets cheaper the farther north you go   The next domino after LLS will be WTI at Cushing  Oklahoma  All these new pipelines that everyone is expecting to narrow the Brent WTI spread are only going to move the logjam from Cushing down to the Gulf Coast  That logjam will start to build due to again limited refining capacity  and back right up to Cushing again  So I see a much higher WTI Brent spread at the end of this year going back to the highs around  20  and this could catch the Street off guard  The Street thinks it s a problem with pipelines with WTI  it s not  We just don t have the refining capacity to handle all this stuff  I hope these light oil producers are hedging like mad right now because I think there could be a bit of a surprise coming in Q3 13   TER  Do you expect a shale production falloff   KS  The amount of drilling right now is crazy  At least 0 25 MMb d more are expected out of the Bakken  adding up to just a hair under 1 MMb d this year  Over the last three years everybody has been drilling what s required to hold their land base  Most of that is now done  and at this point  many will get to drill where they want to  therefore increasing Bakken production  Plus  pipeline constraints have been alleviated by rail  which is now the preferred source of takeaway out of the Bakken  relieving infrastructure constraints   In Texas  the amount of pipeline building between the Eagle Ford and the refineries is unbelievable  I m reading that there is about four times the amount of pipeline capacity needed right now for all the Eagle Ford  So there s absolutely no barrier to super high growth in oil production in the two main U S  plays   TER  Assuming that this does happen  what s the effect going to be on the industry   KS  There are going to be winners and losers  like always  The big winners are going to be the Gulf Coast refineries  That s why I ve made Valero Energy Corp   VLO  one of my top picks  It has seven Gulf Coast refineries  Three are light oil and four are heavy oil  I think you re going to see the light oil side of the refinery business get way more profitable  That s starting to get priced in now  in a big way  into the refinery stocks  Valero  which is the largest independent refinery company in the U S   has cash flow that is absolutely on fire  If I m right about Q3 13 oil prices  it s going to get an absolute turbocharge in profitability  They re going to be the big winners   The losers are obviously going to be the light oil producers  That s why I m hoping that they re hedging like mad  so that they can keep their margins for a long time   TER  You ve recently written about condensates produced in connection with gas  Can you explain their importance   KS  Condensate  which is a both a natural gas liquid and a very light oil  is used by producers to dilute thick tar sands oil  Oil sands production growth is continuing at a very high rate and Canadian oil producers need a lot of condensate to make oil flow smoothly in the pipelines  Canada is producing a very flat amount of condensate  and needs to import as much as possible from the States  In the U S   condensate sells at a discount  but Canada is a totally different market wherein condensate trades at  15 above WTI   In Canada  most of the condensate is produced with gas  With Canadian gas producers  the number one question to ask is how much condensate they are producing along with gas  This situation should continue for at least another two years  At around  110 bbl compared to about  85 90 bbl oil  condensate gives these natural gas producers even better economics than oil   In Canada  they re building new processing facilities to handle it  and in the U S   they re building new pipelines  reversing pipelines and using railcars to get condensate up to Canada  The Canadians then load those same railcars with heavy oil and send them back to the Gulf Coast  There are very few natural gas companies that are getting high amounts of condensate in their gas and those stocks can make investors lots of money   TER  Which gas companies are rich in condensate   KS  Most of the Montney producers are doing really well  One would be NuVista Energy Ltd   NVA TSX   Contact Exploration Inc   CEX TSX V  is also a great junior for that play  Bellatrix Exploration Ltd   BXE TSX  down in the Cardium is getting decent condensate rates  Anybody with good condensate levels is getting a lot of love on their stock right now  The natural gas producers are actually starting to get some good looking charts due to those high condensates   TER  Do you expect this situation to continue for a while  or is it short term   KS  I see very high prices for condensate producers for another two years until industry is able to truly organize infrastructure changes  reverse pipeline flows and get enough railcars to move sufficient condensate from the Eagle Ford in Texas to match Canadian demand   TER  Canaccord Genuity just came out with a report showing that the stocks of junior producers in their coverage universe went from trading at 9 3 times their debt adjusted cash flow in 2011  to 1 8 times in 2012  What are the implications of that   KS  The junior market is seeing a narrowing of the deals that are able to raise money  Unless you re one of the best teams in Calgary  you re not getting funded  Even though the big boards are having a bull market  the juniors are not  The shale revolution mania is now three years old on the junior side and there is enough data at this point to understand that these plays don t recycle cash fast enough for the juniors  The beauty of these wells is that they re easily repeatable over a large area  They produce for 30 years  but at a very low rate  We see that despite high initial production rates  most wells just don t recycle enough early cash to allow organic growth for small cap companies   The investment community is realizing it can t keep giving these juniors so much dilutive equity because we re not going to get payback  They ve stopped buying junior shale plays  causing valuations to fall quite dramatically  Only the best companies that are able to produce cash flow fast enough to allow them to drill another well without going to the market are getting any love  Former market darlings like Pinecrest Energy Inc   PRY TSX V  and Surge Energy Inc   SGY TSX  have fallen out of bed and are having trouble getting back up  The market has become much pickier  Investors looking to invest in junior oil plays have to understand the new reality  You have to look at what the management teams are doing to address that cash flow problem   TER  Some of the juniors are paying out significant dividends to attract investors  Do you think this strategy will work  and which companies might benefit by doing so   KS  Trying to put a Blue Chip dividend model on a junior  high risk play makes no sense to me because you have the same management teams drilling the same plays  just more slowly  What they re saying to investors is   We re going to pay out some of this money to shareholders  which means we re not going to have as much money to drill  so we re going to grow more slowly   They don t recycle cash fast enough to do this  So  unless they are able to change how they do business to get more oil out of the ground  faster and cheaper nothing s changing  To me  this is a fairly desperate attempt to keep their valuations  I don t think it s going to work   When you add up their dividend payments and their drilling budgets  these companies are paying out over 100  of their cash flows  That s a very risky game  especially if we see a  10 15 bbl drop in light oil prices in North America this year  which would reduce your profitability by about 25   So if you re getting  90 bbl for your oil and that suddenly goes to  75 bbl  that s a huge percentage coming out of your profits  These guys will have to raise a lot of money or cut their dividends  Either way  it equals lower stock prices  I m avoiding all dividend plays in the junior and intermediate side in Canada right now  except for Argent Energy Trust  AET UN TSX    TER  So we know what you re avoiding  Let s talk about some companies that look interesting at this point   KS  Strategic Oil   Gas Ltd   SOG TSX V  is a very interesting story  It has a play called Keg River right on the border of the Northwest Territories in Alberta  There s this statistic called the recycle ratio that s basically the profit per barrel divided by the cost per barrel  Most of these companies run anywhere between 1 8 3 1  This Keg River play is 10 1  where every dollar that goes into the ground produces  10  This is one of the highest recycle ratio plays I ve ever seen in my life  With 50 60 well locations like that  it can really pay for a lot of its other development work  It has been able to secure railcars to go down into the U S  to deliver its oil  giving it a better price than it otherwise would have to the pipelines  It s run by a very smart guy  President and CEO Gurpreet Sawhney  He had his own reservoir engineering company in Calgary  so he s very technical  He knows how to model these reservoirs  and he s very bright  I really like that story and the Street is starting to reward it   Raging River Exploration Inc   RRX TSX V   Neil Roszell s company in the Viking  has the absolutely top blueblood management team in the junior sector right now  It has great cost discipline  It knows how to use the premium in its stock as currency to get what they call  tuck in  acquisitions small land packages right beside and adjacent to where it is  That s a quality name   Novus Energy Inc   NVS TSX V  is also in the same play and is probably my number one takeout target for the year  It s put itself up for sale  and I really do believe that sometime this quarter we re going to see a bid from somebody  That s a great stock for investors to look at  Also  if your readers are interested in learning more about a specific company that I m following right now  one that I believe has a lot of potential in 2013  I have put together a special free report that Energy Report readers can download for a limited time   TER  Great  thanks Keith  Do you have updates on any of the companies you ve mentioned in the past   KS  Lynden Energy Corp   LVL TSX V  is a really interesting story  It s a Permian play in West Texas and has this asset called Mitchell Ranch  with more than 100 000 gross acres in the heart of the Cline shale  Net  it owns about one third of that  That big a land package in that location in one big block is very rare  If it spun out that asset and IPO d it  it could probably get  250 million for it  worth  2 50 share  Lynden is just going to sit on the land for a little while and let everybody else prove up the ground around it  That asset could double or triple the current stock price if it gets one really good well out of that play  It raised its own money  so it doesn t need the Street  Because it doesn t pay the Street  there s not a lot of research on it  It s a bit of an undiscovered gem   TER  Do you think it may be contemplating a spinout on Mitchell   KS  That s what I d be thinking  Its Wolfberry production justifies the price of the stock on its own  so you re basically getting Mitchell Ranch for free   TER  What are the prospects in general for the junior and mid tier Canadians and what should investors be doing   KS  Investors need to be very cautious right now  The junior market is starting to bubble and get some life  So this is a time when investors can get sucked into the wrong deals  Because I see a light oil price drop later this year  investors need to be taking quite a bit of money off the table in these junior producers in the next three months and buy refinery stocks  They ve had a great run already  but I think they re going higher   TER  We greatly appreciate your time and ideas today  Keith   KS  Thank you very much   Keith Schaefer is editor and publisher of the Oil   Gas Investments Bulletin  which finds  researches

179334,400850,VLO,Signs Of Demand Destruction  The US Consumer Is Saying No To High Gasoline Prices,opinion,The NYMEX gasoline futures price hit another recent high last week and is sure to push up gasoline prices at the pump  This development will add to the lingering concerns about the nascent US consumer recovery Crack spreads  spread between distillates and crude oil price  have recovered from the lows of December  It means that refinery margins are now quite high  with refineries enjoying fat profits once again  As an example Valero Energy  VLO   a major US refiner is up 27 6  year to date on a total return basis But it seems there is only so far the US consumer can be pushed before demand declines and possibly demand destruction sets in  As prices have risen over time  US gasoline demand visibly came off  US drivers are just buying less of it these days And that trend is starting to be reflected in the levels of gasoline inventories  According to the latest EIA data  US gasoline inventories are materially above the 5 year range for this time of the year  Given the warm US winter  this can not be blamed on the weather With recent spikes in gasoline prices  the consumer has been able to adjust the driving patterns as well invest in more fuel efficient vehicles  NEW ENGLAND CABLE NEWS  MasterCard SpendingPulse says gasoline consumption across the United States has been on the decline every week for the past year  showing a total drop of 4 2 million gallons  That s a 3 percent decline   Higher gas prices seem to be the main factor  AAA puts the average price of a gallon at  3 89 today  That s the highest ever for this time of year  and analysts say it could reach  4 25 by the end of April  That s prompting Americans to make fewer daily trips and staying closer to home when they take vacations But the man who oversees MasterCard SpendingPulse s weekly consumption report says that s not the only factor  John Gamel points to rising sales of fuel efficient vehicles A recent survey by J D  Power and Associates found new vehicle owners rated good gas mileage higher than reliability  stylishness or a great deal in their car buying decisions This pattern  if continues  will cap crack spreads and limit profits for companies such as Valero  might be time to take profits   But as a whole  the concept of gasoline being an  inelastic  commodity in the US is starting to change  The consumer is now able to dial down the demand  only partially of course  when prices rise too far  In the long run the introduction of Compressed Natural Gas  CNG  as an alternative fuel for US transport   initially as a diesel substitute for trucks  will create competition for US refiners ,2012-03-26,Sober Look,https://www.investing.com/analysis/signs-of-demand-destruction:-the-us-consumer-is-saying-no-to-high-gasoline-prices-118147,118147

179342,400858,VLO,Reversing Refiners,opinion,Small independent oil refiners  stocks had great runs higher throughout the summer  Straight up in many cases  No chance to get in  Then they all started to rollover  Now there are signs that these two are ready to reverse back higher  Take a look  Phillips 66  PSX Phillips 66 consolidated for a month at in the 45 47 range before pulling back  Last Friday though it printed a potential bullish reversal candle  a Hammer  which it confirmed higher Monday  But in addition to that the Relative Strength Index has turned back higher and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicator  MACD  has leveled  It also halted at the 50 day Simple Moving Average  SMA   It could certainly continue lower  but with all these signs lined up it is worth considering a long trade entry against a stop near 43  Valero Energy  VLO Valero Energy is a little bit dicier  but also worth a look  The two Hammers back to back with long tails as the volume is decreasing after the climax selling on Wednesday last week  along with a RSI that is nearing oversold territory suggest that dipping your toe into a long trade against a stop at 28 is worth considering Disclaimer  The information in this blog post represents my own opinions and does not contain a recommendation for any particular security or investment  I or my affiliates may hold positions or other interests in securities mentioned in the Blog  please see my  page for my full disclaimer ,2012-10-16,Gregory W.
