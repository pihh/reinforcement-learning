137612,359127,OKE,Scramble for propane marks Mother Nature s latest challenge for U S  farmers,news,"By P J  Huffstutter
CHICAGO  Reuters    Months after historic floods ravaged the U S  Midwest  farmers scrambling to harvest their crops face a new headache  finding fuel to dry their soaked grains 
Normally  farmers use propane as fuel for grain dryers to reduce moisture levels in corn crops to ready for sale or to safely store the grain 
But the extraordinarily wet spring delayed planting  and a waterlogged fall delayed harvesting and produced wet crops  That caused a surge in propane demand among crop farmers  even as livestock producers are buying to keep their barns warm and rural homeowners try to heat their homes   all of which is straining aging infrastructure used to deliver that fuel  And keeping people and animals warm takes precedence over grain drying 
It adds to the season of woe for Midwestern farm communities  which are contending with rising bankruptcy rates  slumping farm incomes and lackluster exports as the U S  China trade war drags on 
 Everyone is trying to harvest all at the same time  and they need more propane to keep their dryers running   said Dan Smith  owner of Smith Propane   Lube Inc in Lake Crystal  Minnesota   I ve got two trucks from farmers parked outside  waiting  
As of Friday  his tanks were dry  His drivers were scattered across the Midwest  with one as far as Kansas  in search of fuel  He s not alone  Propane suppliers in Wisconsin  Minnesota and Iowa are experiencing increased demand from out of state fuel sellers  trade groups said 
Propane prices have surged by about 20  in October as sellers scramble to find enough fuel across the Midwest to satisfy customers  For example  propane for delivery at the Conway hub in Kansas soared to 51 cents a gallon on Monday from 37 5 cents a month ago 
Much of the U S  corn belt relies on a fragmented supply network of pipelines  trains and trucks to keep pace with propane demand  That infrastructure this year has not been able to keep pace with the unexpected spike in demand 
By this time of year  three fourths of the corn crop has typically been harvested  and the fuel demand would have been staggered  But only 52  of the corn crop has been harvested as of Sunday  according to federal data  as farmers are inundated with wet fields 
 EVERYONE IS HARVESTING WET CORN 
The longer these crops sit out in the field  or are stored wet in a storage bin  the greater the risk of them being damaged and facing steep discounts from buyers 
 Because the corn is wetter  we have to dry it all night to try to keep up   said Shane Goplin  45  who farms 1 700 acres of corn in Trempealeau County  Wisconsin  He has been sleeping inside a shed next to his corn dryer to keep an eye on the machine and make sure not a drop of fuel is wasted 
 The problem is everyone is harvesting wet corn   he said 
The supply crunch prompted the governors of Iowa  Minnesota  North Dakota and Wisconsin in recent days to sign executive orders temporarily lifting regulations restricting what hours commercial drivers can transport propane  gasoline and diesel fuel to retail suppliers  to try to get the fuel to farmers and farm cooperatives as fast as possible 
The unexpectedly high demand resulted in two propane terminals in Iowa on ONEOK s  N OKE  North System to have temporary inventory outages recently  company spokesman Brad Borror said in a statement  The outages lasted less than 24 hours  Borror said  and the company  is working diligently to timely deliver propane to the region  
As of last week  overall U S  propane inventories were 99 8 million barrels  20  more than at this time last year  But most of that growth is in the U S  Gulf Coast 
In the Midwest  stocks are 3 3  lower than last year  according to U S  Energy Department figures  and pipeline infrastructure is not robust enough to get those barrels to the corn belt quickly enough 
Deb Grooms  chief executive of the Iowa Propane Gas Association  said supply is not the problem  It is demand and existing infrastructure 
 We are now in a world where the pipeline  which hasn t been updated  was fine in the 1960s   Grooms said   The system hasn t kept up  We re seeing a perfect storm  ",2019-11-05,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/scramble-for-propane-marks-mother-natures-latest-challenge-for-us-farmers-2012149,2012149

137896,359411,OKE,Are You Looking For A Top Momentum Pick  Why Oneok Inc   OKE  Is A Great Choice,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic  it can be tough to define  Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy  but the Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Oneok Inc   OKE   a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of A  We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions  two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Oneok Inc  Currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
In order to see if OKE is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this natural gas company holds up 
Looking at a stock s short term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum  since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment  It is also useful to compare a security to its industry  as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area 
For OKE  shares are up 1 73  over the past week while the Zacks Utility   Gas Distribution industry is flat over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 3 5  compares favorably with the industry s 2 07  performance as well 
Considering longer term price metrics  like performance over the last three months or year  can be advantageous as well  Over the past quarter  shares of Oneok Inc  Have risen 4 42   and are up 7 51  in the last year  In comparison  the S P 500 has only moved 1 77  and 3 64   respectively 
Investors should also take note of OKE s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  Right now  OKE is averaging 2 133 541 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with OKE 
Over the past two months  3 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 1 lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost OKE s consensus estimate  increasing from  3 08 to  3 12 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  4 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Given these factors  it shouldn t be surprising that OKE is a  2  Buy  stock and boasts a Momentum Score of A  If you re looking for a fresh pick that s set to soar in the near term  make sure to keep Oneok Inc  On your short list ",2019-09-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/are-you-looking-for-a-top-momentum-pick-why-oneok-inc-oke-is-a-great-choice-200469165,200469165
137897,359412,OKE,3 Reasons Growth Investors Will Love Oneok  OKE ,opinion,"Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all 
In addition to volatility  these stocks carry above average risk by their very nature  Also  one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end 
However  the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects  makes it pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks 
Oneok Inc   OKE  is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system  In addition to a favorable Growth Score  it carries a top Zacks Rank 
Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market  And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  
While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this natural gas company is a great growth pick right now  we have highlighted three of the most important factors below 
Earnings Growth
Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor  as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors  For growth investors  double digit earnings growth is highly preferable  as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Oneok is 14 2   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 12 1  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 6 9  
Cash Flow Growth
While cash is the lifeblood of any business  higher than average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Oneok is 68 9   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 8  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 15 8  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 7 8  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above  investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is a plus here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
There have been upward revisions in current year earnings estimates for Oneok  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0 3  over the past month 
Bottom Line
While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Oneok a Zacks Rank  2 stock  it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above 
You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
This combination positions Oneok well for outperformance  so growth investors may want to bet on it ",2019-10-02,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-reasons-growth-investors-will-love-oneok-oke-200469870,200469870
137898,359413,OKE,Why The Earnings Surprise Streak Could Continue For Oneok  OKE ,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Oneok Inc   OKE   which belongs to the Zacks Utility   Gas Distribution industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This natural gas company has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 9 05  
For the last reported quarter  Oneok came out with earnings of  0 75 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 70 per share  representing a surprise of 7 14   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  0 73 per share and it actually produced earnings of  0 81 per share  delivering a surprise of 10 96  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Oneok  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Oneok currently has an Earnings ESP of  0 60   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-10-02,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-the-earnings-surprise-streak-could-continue-for-oneok-oke-200470379,200470379

What s Next for Oneok 
While Oneok has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

137959,359474,OKE,Oneok  OKE  Is An Incredible Growth Stock  3 Reasons Why,opinion,"Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task 
By their very nature  these stocks carry above average risk and volatility  Moreover  if a company s growth story is over or nearing its end  betting on it could lead to significant loss 
However  it s pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Our proprietary system currently recommends Oneok Inc   OKE  as one such stock  This company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market  And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  
Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this natural gas company a great growth pick right now 
Earnings Growth
Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth  as surging profit levels is what most investors are after  For growth investors  double digit earnings growth is highly preferable  as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Oneok is 14 2   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 11 7  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 6  
Cash Flow Growth
While cash is the lifeblood of any business  higher than average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Oneok is 68 9   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 8  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 15 8  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 7 8  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above  investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is a plus here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
There have been upward revisions in current year earnings estimates for Oneok  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 1 3  over the past month 
Bottom Line
Oneok has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above  but it also carries a Zacks Rank  2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions

137992,359507,OKE,Has ONEOK  OKE  Outpaced Other Utilities Stocks This Year ,opinion,"Investors focused on the Utilities space have likely heard of ONEOK  NYSE OKE   but is the stock performing well in comparison to the rest of its sector peers  By taking a look at the stock s year to date performance in comparison to its Utilities peers  we might be able to answer that question 
ONEOK is one of 122 individual stocks in the Utilities sector  Collectively  these companies sit at  9 in the Zacks Sector Rank  The Zacks Sector Rank considers 16 different sector groups  The average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups is measured  and the sectors are listed from best to worst 
The Zacks Rank is a proven system that emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions  highlighting a variety of stocks that are displaying the right characteristics to beat the market over the next one to three months  OKE is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  
Over the past 90 days  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for OKE s full year earnings has moved 1 98  higher  This is a sign of improving analyst sentiment and a positive earnings outlook trend 
According to our latest data  OKE has moved about 28 99  on a year to date basis  In comparison  Utilities companies have returned an average of 13 98   This means that ONEOK is outperforming the sector as a whole this year 
Looking more specifically  OKE belongs to the Utility   Gas Distribution industry  which includes 18 individual stocks and currently sits at  105 in the Zacks Industry Rank  This group has gained an average of 20 36  so far this year  so OKE is performing better in this area 
OKE will likely be looking to continue its solid performance  so investors interested in Utilities stocks should continue to pay close attention to the company ",2019-07-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/has-oneok-oke-outpaced-other-utilities-stocks-this-year-200436447,200436447
137993,359508,OKE,Oneok Inc   OKE  Beats Q2 Earnings Estimates,opinion,"Oneok Inc   OKE  came out with quarterly earnings of  0 75 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 70 per share  This compares to earnings of  0 68 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 7 14   A quarter ago  it was expected that this natural gas company would post earnings of  0 73 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 81  delivering a surprise of 10 96  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times 
Oneok  which belongs to the Zacks Utility   Gas Distribution industry  posted revenues of  2 46 billion for the quarter ended June 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9 02   This compares to year ago revenues of  2 96 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Oneok shares have added about 23 8  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 20 5  
What s Next for Oneok 
While Oneok has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Oneok was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

138019,359534,OKE,ONEOK Sees Hammer Chart Pattern  Time To Buy ,opinion,"ONEOK  Inc    NYSE OKE   has been struggling lately  but the selling pressure may be coming to an end soon  That is because OKE recently saw a Hammer Chart Pattern which can signal that the stock is nearing a bottom 
What is a Hammer Chart Pattern  
A hammer chart pattern is a popular technical indicator that is used in candlestick charting  The hammer appears when a stock tumbles during the day  but then finds strength at some point in the session to close near or above its opening price  This forms a candlestick that resembles a hammer  and it can suggest that the market has found a low point in the stock  and that better days are ahead 
Other Factors
Plus  earnings estimates have been rising for this company  even despite the sluggish trading lately  In just the past 60 days alone 8 estimates have gone higher  compared to 1 lower  while the consensus estimate has also moved in the right direction 
Estimates have actually risen so much that the stock now has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  suggesting this relatively unloved stock could be due for a breakout soon  This will be especially true if OKE stock can build momentum from here and find a way to continue higher of off this encouraging trading development  You can see

announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Middlesex Water Co    NASDAQ MSEX    SJW Group   NYSE SJW    Brookfield Renewable Partners L P    NYSE BEP    ONEOK Inc    NYSE OKE   and Chesapeake Utilities Corp    NYSE CPK   Here are highlights from Tuesday s Analyst Blog 5 Utility Stocks for a Capricious MarketWall Street lost a good chunk of value in May that it gained in the first four months of 2019 after facing a devastating fourth quarter of 2018  The reason for the stock market mayhem in the last seven trading days is nothing but the U S China trade conflict  which suddenly escalated this month Meanwhile  the fundamentals of the U S  economy remain firm  First quarter GDP registered record growth buoyed by solid consumer and business spending  The labor market is robust with record low unemployment  And inflation is well under control despite wage hike However  market participants seem clueless about the direction in which the market will go even in the near term  At this juncture  it is important to take precautionary steps to safeguard one s portfolio  Utilities are a safe bet during times of market turmoil  as they are relatively stable due to the essential nature of the products they offer  Consequently  it will be prudent to invest in utility stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank to stay safe  Wall Street CollapsesOn May 13  the blue chip Dow 30 Index plunged 617 38 points or 2 4   The market benchmark S P 500 Index also plummeted 2 4   Both the Dow and S P 500 posted their worst ever  single day loss since Jan 3  Furthermore  the tech laden Nasdaq Composite tumbled 3 4   its biggest single day drop so far this year Notably  in the week ended May 10  the Dow  S P 500 and Nasdaq Composite shed 2 1   2 2  and 3   respectively  due to intensifying trade war between the two largest trading countries of the world Uncertainty Looms Large    Markets are uncertain about when the U S  China trade tension will be resolved or if at all it will be  President Trump added to the prevailing ambiguity on May 13  when he said that people will come to know whether a trade deal is at all possible in next three to four weeks If negotiations continue  there is no timeline specified on when the parties should reach an agreement  However  an agreement will certainly bode well for both economies  On the other hand  if no progress made at all and a full  fledged trade war rages  then in addition of these two countries  the global economy will also see a slowdown Utilities are Immune to Vagaries of Economic Cycle   The Utilities sector is mature and fundamentally strong as demand for such services is generally immune to vagaries of the economic cycle  It s because these companies provide basic services like electricity  gas and water  which can never go out of demand Consequently  adding stocks from the utility basket usually lends more stability to a portfolio in an uncertain market  Moreover  the sector is known for stability and visibility of its earnings and cash flows  Stable earnings enable utilities to pay out consistent dividends  making them more attractive to income oriented investors Utility companies enjoy a reputation for safety given the regulated nature of their business  which lend their revenues a high level of certainty  These companies also benefit from the domestic orientation of their business  which shields them from foreign currency translation issues that have been plaguing the other industries of late Despite the stock market rout  S P 500 s Utilities Select Sector SPDR  XLU  gained more than 1  and was the only sector out of 11 to remain positive  In the last one month as well  XLU has gained more than 0 6  just behind 1  gain for Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR  XLP   The remaining 10 sectors finished in the red Our Top PicksStock markets are likely to remain volatile in near future due to trade concerns  geopolitical conflicts and global economic activities

138021,359536,OKE,3 Reasons Why Oneok  OKE  Is A Great Growth Stock,opinion,"Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above average financial growth  as this feature helps these securities garner the market s attention and deliver solid returns  But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task 
That s because  these stocks usually carry above average risk and volatility  In fact  betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss 
However  the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects  makes it pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks 
Oneok Inc   OKE  is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends  The company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market  And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  
Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this natural gas company a great growth pick right now

Cash Flow Growth
While cash is the lifeblood of any business  higher than average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Oneok is 68 9   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 10 8  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 15 8  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 7 8  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above  investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is a plus here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
There have been upward revisions in current year earnings estimates for Oneok  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 2 5  over the past month

138069,359584,OKE,5 Utility Stocks To Protect Portfolio In A Capricious Market ,opinion,Wall Street lost a good chunk of value in May that it gained in the first four months of 2019 after facing a devastating fourth quarter of 2018  The reason for the stock market mayhem in the last seven trading days is nothing but the U S China trade conflict  which suddenly escalated this month Meanwhile  the fundamentals of the U S  economy remain firm  First quarter GDP registered record growth buoyed by solid consumer and business spending  The labor market is robust with record low unemployment  And inflation is well under control despite wage hike However  market participants seem clueless about the direction in which the market will go even in the near term  At this juncture  it is important to take precautionary steps to safeguard one s portfolio  Utilities are a safe bet during times of market turmoil  as they are relatively stable due to the essential nature of the products they offer  Consequently  it will be prudent to invest in utility stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank to stay safe  Wall Street CollapsesOn May 13  the blue chip Dow 30 Index plunged 617 38 points or 2

its biggest single day drop so far this year Notably  in the week ended May 10  the Dow  S P 500 and Nasdaq Composite shed 2 1   2 2  and 3   respectively  due to intensifying trade war between the two largest trading countries of the world Uncertainty Looms Large     Markets are uncertain about when the U S  China trade tension will be resolved or if at all it will be  President Trump added to the prevailing ambiguity on May 13  when he said that people will come to know whether a trade deal is at all possible in next three to four weeks If negotiations continue  there is no timeline specified on when the parties should reach an agreement  However  an agreement will certainly bode well for both economies  On the other hand  if no progress made at all and a full  fledged trade war rages  then in addition of these two countries  the global economy will also see a slowdown Utilities are Immune to Vagaries of Economic Cycle    The Utilities sector is mature and fundamentally strong as demand for such services is generally immune to vagaries of the economic cycle  It s because these companies provide basic services like electricity  gas and water  which can never go out of demand Consequently  adding stocks from the utility basket usually lends more stability to a portfolio in an uncertain market  Moreover  the sector is known for stability and visibility of its earnings and cash flows  Stable earnings enable utilities to pay out consistent dividends  making them more attractive to income oriented investors Utility companies enjoy a reputation for safety given the regulated nature of their business  which lend their revenues a high level of certainty  These companies also benefit from the domestic orientation of their business  which shields them from

138103,359618,OKE,Oneok Inc   OKE  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on lower revenues when Oneok Inc   OKE  reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 30  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This natural gas company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 73 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  14 1  
Revenues are expected to be  2 70 billion  down 13  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Oneok 
For Oneok  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  4 11  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Oneok will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Oneok would post earnings of  0 74 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 70  delivering a surprise of  5 41  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Oneok appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/oneok-inc-oke-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200409446,200409446

138134,359649,OKE,Is Oneok  OKE  A Solid Growth Stock  3 Reasons To Think   Yes  ,opinion,"Growth stocks are attractive to many investors  as above average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all 
That s because  these stocks usually carry above average risk and volatility  In fact  betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss 
However  the task of finding cutting edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Oneok Inc   OKE  is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system  In addition to a favorable Growth Score  it carries a top Zacks Rank 
Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market  And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  
Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this natural gas company a great growth pick right now 
Earnings Growth
Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor  as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors  And for growth investors  double digit earnings growth is definitely preferable  and often an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Oneok is 8 5   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 6  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 2 3  
Cash Flow Growth
Cash is the lifeblood of any business  but higher than average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Oneok is 68 9   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 10 4  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 15 8  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 7 1  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above  investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is a plus here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
There have been upward revisions in current year earnings estimates for Oneok  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 1 4  over the past month 
Bottom Line
Oneok has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above  but it also carries a Zacks Rank  2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions

138136,359651,OKE,Here s Why Oneok Inc   OKE  Is A Great Momentum Stock To Buy,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic  it can be tough to define  Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy  but the Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Oneok Inc   OKE   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Oneok Inc  Currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period

Set to Beat the Market 
In order to see if OKE is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this natural gas company holds up 
A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short term price activity  as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand  It is also useful to compare a security to its industry  as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area 
For OKE  shares are up 3 23  over the past week while the Zacks Utility   Gas Distribution industry is up 0 27  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 7 78  compares favorably with the industry s 3 23  performance as well 
While any stock can see its price increase  it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market  That is why looking at longer term price metrics    such as performance over the past three months or year    can be useful as well  Shares of Oneok Inc  Have increased 28 43  over the past quarter  and have gained 21 65  in the last year  In comparison  the S P 500 has only moved 14 97  and 8 14   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to OKE s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  OKE is currently averaging 2 690 927 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things  including estimate revisions and a stock s price movement  Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank  and a nice path here can be promising  We have recently been noticing this with OKE 
Over the past two months  7 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 1 lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost OKE s consensus estimate  increasing from  2 88 to  2 97 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  5 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 1 downward revision in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Given these factors  it shouldn t be surprising that OKE is a  2  Buy  stock and boasts a Momentum Score of A  If you re looking for a fresh pick that s set to soar in the near term  make sure to keep Oneok Inc  On your short list ",2019-03-26,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/heres-why-oneok-inc-oke-is-a-great-momentum-stock-to-buy-200401524,200401524

138171,359686,OKE,3 Top Ranked MLPs Set To Explode In 2019,opinion,Energy prices have been witnessing a downside for a while now  Prices have declined around 30  from multi year highs of above  76 a barrel in early October  Oil is facing a two pronged attack   rising supply from major producers and apprehension of economic slowdown that will dampen demand  Also  the OPEC led supply cuts are unlikely to offset the market surplus While the direction of crude s movement is anybody s guess  it will be prudent for investors to maintain caution in these uncertain times and withdraw for a while  Meanwhile  Master Limited Partnerships  MLPs  are a safer bet amid the commodity price volatility and offer considerable returns with low risk As the name implies  MLP is a form of partnership that regularly pays attractive distribution yields  MLP includes a variant of stock market investment  where investors buy units  not shares  of the partnership  not company  that trade on exchanges  The benchmark Alerian MLP Index  tracking 40 partnerships  is an appropriate tool to follow the movement in MLPs   The surge in oil and natural gas production in the past few years have made pipelines  storage and associated energy infrastructure MLPs as attractive bets in the energy midstream space  This is because these network providers generate a major portion of their revenues from fee based contracts based on volume and are not affected by commodity price fluctuations What are MLPsMLPs differ from regular stocks as interests in them are referred as units and the unitholders  not shareholders  are partners in the business  Importantly  these hybrid entities bring together the tax benefits of a limited partnership with the liquidity of publicly traded securities Finally  the assets that these partnerships own   oil and natural gas pipelines and storage facilities   typically provide stable fee based revenues and have limited  if any  direct commodity price exposure  This enables these MLPs to pay out higher distributions There are two types of ownership involved with MLPs   the general partner and the limited partners  The general partner is responsible for taking all decisions related to the company s operations and is reimbursed per performance  The limited partner provides capital and receives a share in the profits from cash flows Importantly  these hybrid entities bring together the tax benefits of a limited partnership with the liquidity of publicly traded securities The FERC Tax Ruling of 2018On Mar 15  2018  the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission   FERC   ruled that the interstate oil and natural gas pipelines owned by MLPs can no longer avail credit for income taxes that are not paid  Revising 2005 Policy Statement for Recovery of Income Tax Costs  the federal regulators found that the longstanding income tax allowance in their cost of service fees will lead to double recovery of costs for the asset class that are not subject to corporate income taxes On Jul 18  2018  the FERC issued a final rule on the Income Tax Allowance Policy for these MLPs  This included amendments from the original ruling on Mar 15  to which the market reacted positively  Particularly  FERC incorporated two major concessions to MLP pipeline owners  Firstly  the entities were permitted to include a tax allowance in their cost of service pricing under certain circumstances for a three year period  Also  FERC removed accumulated deferred income tax balances for MLPs and the same won t be reimbursed to customers Impact on MLPSConsequently  partnerships charging cost based rates for interstate transportation service will be compelled to lower customer tariffs to move oil  gas and refined products around the country by the amount of their income tax allowances  A reduction in cost recovery is likely to affect cash flows While the FERC ruling is a headwind for MLPs  it must be noted that the move will not affect all partnerships and assets  In particular  the changes are not likely to have any impact on pipeline companies that are structured as  C Corporations  like Kinder Morgan  Inc   NYSE KMI   and ONEOK  Inc   NYSE OKE     The federal revision will not be applicable to MLPs owning midstream assets that begin and terminate within the same state Meanwhile  MLPs with significant  cost of service  exposure and large amounts of interstate pipelines  including Energy Transfer Partners and Spectra Energy  F SEP  Partners   NYSE SEP    are in troubled waters  The change in income tax policies will result in rate reduction and lower cash flow for pipelines owned by these MLPs Higher Returns   Low RiskMost MLPs are involved in processing and transportation of energy commodities such as natural gas  crude oil and refined products under long term contracts   These partnerships have relatively consistent and predictable cash flows  unlike exploration and production  E P  companies  whose profits are highly correlated with commodity prices MLPs are an attractive investment option for income focused investors in the current environment  Along with high yields ranging from 4 6   MLPs have low correlations with many other asset classes including equities as well as commodities and provide diversity to the portfolios What NextThough a number of MLPs came out with press releases claiming negligible or no material impact from the FERC ruling  the tax policy change has led to wide ranging concerns and uncertainty  With the new rule expected to be adopted by 2020  the issue is likely to be a concern in the future Investors are always seeking stocks that offer upside as they have double benefits  Their growth can attract investors and generate significant gains  Considering these parameters  we have selected three MLP s that are likely to deliver exceptional growth in 2019 Our ChoicesAllentown  PA based CrossAmerica Partners L P    NYSE CAPL   is involved in the distribution of motor fuels  consisting of

When looking at the last two reports  this natural gas company has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 3 56   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the most recent quarter  Oneok was expected to post earnings of  0 71 per share  but it reported  0 75 per share instead  representing a surprise of 5 63   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  0 67 per share  while it actually produced  0 68 per share  a surprise of 1 49  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Oneok lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Oneok has an Earnings ESP of  1 65  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on February 25  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss

138176,359691,OKE,Oneok Inc   OKE  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Oneok Inc   OKE  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 25  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This natural gas company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 74 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  42 3  
Revenues are expected to be  3 09 billion  down 18 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 48  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Oneok 
For Oneok  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  3 87  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Oneok will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Oneok would post earnings of  0 71 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 75  delivering a surprise of  5 63  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Oneok doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-02-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/oneok-inc-oke-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200389359,200389359

138195,359710,OKE,North Dakota Oil Output To Hit Record In 2018  Here s Why,opinion,"As per North Dakota s oil regulator  the state s daily crude output fell 1 1  in March after edging down 0 4  in the previous month  The North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources    DMR   latest data said that oil production in March averaged 1 162 071 barrels a day  down 13 245 barrels a day from February 
But unlike crude  natural gas output went up   from February s 2 106 121 thousand cubic feet per day to 2 116 294 thousand cubic feet per day   a new all time high  As operators scramble to the core areas of the Bakken  wells here tend to produce more gas along with crude  present gas flare rate of around 12   
Record Number of Producing Wells
Meanwhile  North Dakota s total number of producing wells numbered 14 457 at the end of March  the highest on record 
While the slight drop in oil activity   primarily attributed to windy weather   is the fourth month over month production decrease in a row  daily output remained above 1 million barrels for the fourteenth month 
Therefore  notwithstanding the temporary blip  the newest numbers confirm the resurgence in volumes extracted from North Dakota  centered on the Bakken Shale formation 
Rig Count Improves
Some 59 drilling rigs were active in the state in March  up two from the February average  The drilling rig count increased further to 60 in April  The all time low of 27 was set in May 2016  while a year ago  North Dakota had just 46 rigs operating 
A closely watched yardstick of North Dakota oil industry s strength  the improvement in the number of units searching for oil and gas in the region indicates rebounding drilling activities and production  Going by the outlook of crude producers  seven to ten more rigs are likely to join the fleet by the end of this year  
Though the current rig count is still down considerably from the peak of May 2012 when North Dakota had 218 units drilling  one must note that sophisticated drilling rigs have enabled producers to get more oil out of each well  In other words  modern rigs have helped boost the per unit output 
Shale Industry Adjusts to the New Reality
More rigs in operation and stable production not only confirms the positive developments for the state of North Dakota  but also points to the rising flood of U S  shale driven production 
Now at a financial equilibrium  the shale firms are putting more rigs and employees back to work  Throughout the downturn  producers  in North Dakota and particularly the Permian Basin in Texas  worked tirelessly to cut costs down to a bare minimum and look for innovative ways to churn out more oil from rock  And they managed to do just that by improving drilling techniques 
With these efforts  many upstream companies have repositioned themselves to adapt to the new  50  60 oil reality and even thrive at those prices  In other words  while OPEC s moves to trim output and rebalance the demand supply situation has stabilized the market to a large extent  in the process it has incentivized shale drillers to churn out more 
Crude Prices on a Steady Climb Upward
The U S  West Texas Intermediate benchmark hit a three and half year high of  72 24 recently  Also  we are confident that improving fundamentals have probably put a floor under crude prices for the time being  While we do not rule out chances for short term pullbacks on surging domestic production and a stronger U S  dollar  we remain extremely confident of an extended period of gains in the near future 
In this context  the steady recovery in North Dakota s production bode well for the region  With oil prices likely to head higher  the monthly output in the second largest oil producing state after Texas is expected to stay above the psychologically important one million barrel a day mark for the time being 
Dakota Access Pipeline Increased Takeaway Capacity
Apart from the strength in crude prices  there is another factor that is set speed up Bakken output growth   the 1 100 mile long Dakota Access Pipeline 
Making good on his campaign promises to rev up infrastructure spending  President Trump ignored bitter opposition from environmental activists and signed executive order to smooth the way for Energy Transfer Partners    NYSE ETP    3 7 billion Dakota Access Pipeline just a few days into his new Administration 
As a result  disregarding the censure from environmental groups and the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe  the sponsor   carrying a Zacks Rank  3  Hold    brought the controversial conduit  in early June 2017  You can see  
With the project s arrival  operators have scrambled to use the Dakota Access Pipeline to send a major portion of their product to market  In fact  around 73  of oil shipments out of North Dakota are now being carried by pipelines  with the costly railroad share dropping from over 24  in the early part of 2017 to some 17  
Market players believe that the pipeline has helped in bettering the region s drilling economics by lowering transportation costs for operators  Set to carry about 520 000 barrels of oil daily  or more than 50  of North Dakota s output  the commencement of the Dakota Access Pipeline has bridged the gap between Bakken players and producers in other U S  oil producing areas like the Permian Basin 
The geographically constrained Bakken Shale s crude has now better access to Gulf and East Coast refineries and also reaches international markets  As expected  the pipeline  where energy majors like Phillips 66   NYSE PSX    Enbridge Inc    NYSE ENB   and Marathon Petroleum Corp    NYSE MPC   have invested  has helped to improve the region s drilling economics by lowering transportation costs for operators and benefit the state financially 
Products from companies like Continental Resources  Inc    NYSE CLR     and Hess Corp    NYSE HES   were among the first to reach the international markets  China and Netherlands   with the help of Dakota Access 
While there are apprehensions that growing North Dakota production could outpace the pipeline capacity again sometime next year leading to widening discount for the regional crude  current prices continue to exceed breakeven costs by around  30 per barrel 
But there is definitely a case to build more infrastructure for the ever increasing natural gas volumes  Recently  North Dakota Public Service Commission green lighted Tulsa based ONEOK Inc  s   NYSE OKE   suspended Demicks Lake processing plant  The 200 million cubic feet per day facility  costing around  400 million  is likely to be completed by the fourth quarter of next year  The conduit will enhance processing capacity in North Dakota s Williston Basin  where wells churn out the maximum gas 
Oil Production Expected to Hit Record in 2018     
Overall  rebounding oil prices  together with the start of the Dakota Access Pipeline  are expected to support further increase in Bakken output by providing the companies a chance to push their produce outward at a lower cost 
In fact  Lynn Helms   the director of DMR   feels that a conducive oil pricing environment is likely push the state s output beyond the all time high of 1 227 483 barrels day sometime by mid 2018

138272,359787,OKE,Investors Can Buy Selective Energy Stocks At Bargain Prices,opinion,"Both oil and natural gas have rebounded from their multi year lows reached in 2016 and while the commodities may not be at levels many thought they would be at the end of the year  even at today s prices certain companies are in a position to earn profits 
As a proof  over the past four quarters  the number of rigs searching for oil and gas in the country have been surging  According to Baker Hughes  the GE owned company s closely watched weekly report  the oil rig count was 765 last week and the natural gas rig count was 187   each of them more than doubling from year earlier levels 
Throughout the downturn  energy firms worked tirelessly to cut costs down to a bare minimum and look for innovative ways to churn out more oil and gas  And they managed to do just that by improving drilling techniques and extracting favorable terms from the beleaguered service producers 
Oil s recovery to  45 and natural gas touching the magic  3  predictably  has had a positive effect on stocks in the sector  In particular  savvy investors might view the price bump as the impetus the stocks need after freefalling for three years  Undoubtedly  still a long way to go  but improving crude and natural gas prices may have already primed certain energy producers and linked entities for upward momentum 
True  the energy market faces many uncertainties and it may not be time to buy stocks indiscriminately  but there are players that look like pretty compelling investments 
Good Time to Buy High Quality E P Names
Oil prices have gained almost 10  since falling to a ten month low in late June  The recent rebound has been fueled by multiple weeks of strong inventory draws in the U S  crude and gasoline stockpiles 
While all crude focused stocks stand to gain from the nascent oil rally  companies in the exploration and production  E P  sector are the best placed  as they will be able to extract more value for their products 
Moreover  the firms boast conservative balance sheets with enough cash on hand and manageable leverage  This provides them ample flexibility to make acquisitions or grow internally  Moreover  driven by operational efficiencies  these entities have been able to reduce unit costs    an impressive achievement amid the low realization scenario 
Apart from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  Canadian Natural Resources Ltd   CNQ   we advocate the likes of Jones Energy Inc   JONE  and Gulfport Energy Corp   GPOR   You can see  
Jump in Exports to Support Natural Gas
Despite the uncertain natural gas fundamentals and the understandable reluctance on the investors  part to dip their feet into these stocks  the year on year comparison for the commodity is looking good  Prices this year are up around 10  from where they were twelve months back  while natural gas inventory is 289 Bcf  or 8 9   below the year ago figure 
New pipelines to Mexico and the startup of the Sabine Pass LNG terminal in Louisiana   North America s first large scale liquefied gas export facility   have meant that exports out of the U S  have taken a quantum leap  In fact  as per the Energy Department  gross liquefied natural gas exports are set to average 1 9 billion cubic feet per day in 2017  almost quadrupling from last year 
While domestic natural gas production is expected to rebound this year  replacing coal fired power plants and higher demand from industrial projects will likely take care of the increased output 
The resulting effect will ensure natural gas storage keeping pace with the 5 year average in the near future  with deficits piling up later on  Over the summer  these secular headwinds will start to have a positive impact on natural gas sentiment and price 
As a result  the EIA projects natural gas prices to average  3 10 per million British thermal units  MMBtu  in 2017  compared with a 2016 average of  2 51 MMBtu  This bodes well for companies like Cheniere Energy Inc   LNG   Range Resources Corp   RRC  and Antero Resources Corp   AR    those that produce and market the fuel  Gas focused partnerships like Williams Partners L P   WPZ  and distributors like ONEOK Inc  NYSE OKE    OKE  tend to benefit too  from rising sales for their natural gas liquids  NGL  processing 
Pipeline Stocks Continue to Be a Great Investment Opportunity
The surge in oil and natural gas production over the past few years have made pipelines  storage and associated infrastructure attractive bets in the energy midstream space  This is because these network providers derive a major portion of their revenues from fee based contracts based on volume and are largely insensitive to commodity price fluctuations 
Moreover  the pipelines transporting liquids and natural gas enjoy steady demand for their services even if the overall economy slows down  As a result  many pipeline stocks can produce consistent cash flows and shell out generous payouts 
As it is  units of energy infrastructure master limited partnerships  or MLPs  have seen renewed interest from investors after President Trump took steps to fast track two controversial oil pipeline projects 
In his short time as President  Donald Trump is being credited with the revival of the U S  MLP sector that was reeling under the twin forces of a prolonged oil price slump and bitter opposition from environmental activists 
Making good on his campaign promises to rev up infrastructure spending  President Trump signed executive orders to smooth the way for TransCanada Corp  s  TRP  Keystone XL Pipeline and Energy Transfer Partners L P  s  ETP  Dakota Access Pipeline just a few days into his new administration 
With the U S  government indicating that it will expedite approvals of future developments as part of new energy infrastructure projects  the benchmark Alerian MLP Index  AMLP  is currently up more than 55  from its Feb 2016 lows 
Moreover  given the current volatility in petroleum stocks  MLPs are probably the best method of investing in the sector  They also offer liquidity and tax benefits  which add to their appeal  This is why these stocks would make good additions to your portfolio 
With capital market access remaining tough for most sector components  we suggest buying stocks with clean balance sheets  Our picks would include the likes of Enbridge Energy Partners L P   EEP   Boardwalk Pipeline Partners L P   BWP  and Crestwood Equity Partners L P   CEQP

138274,359789,OKE,The Best Dividend Investing Strategy For Today s Market ,opinion," 0     Dividend Investing Strategy  What Does it Provide Investors  3     Dividend Paying Companies  High Yield vs  Dividend Growth 5     QuantShares Hedged Dividend Income Fund  DIVA 9     How Does DIVA Fit Into An Investor s Portfolio  11     QuantShares Market Neutral Funds 14     Episode Roundup  In today s growth focused market  many investors have put dividend paying stocks on the backburner  Instead  the focus has largely been on the FANG group and sexy stocks in hot technology areas 
However  with increased concern over the market lately  is it time to once again consider dividend securities  After all  dividends account for a sizable percentage of long term investor returns  and getting paid to hold a stock is certainly a plus too  But how do you decide which to focus in on and which to avoid 
Dividends in Focus
Well  today s podcast takes a closer look at this topic with Chuck Martin  the Portfolio Manager at AGFIQ for QuantShares  Chuck s focus today is on the dividend market  and we discuss some of the key things that he looks for when it comes to yield producing securities 
We also take a closer look at why some investors might want to consider dividend stocks in today s market  and what the impact of rising rates could be on this type of stock as well  Chuck and I don t just focus on high yielding stocks though  as we also discuss the dividend aristocrat market and what investors need to know about these stocks as well 
DIVA Strategy
The bulk of the discussion centers on the QuantShares Hedged Dividend Income Fund  DIVA  though  as we take a closer look at this strategy  The fund looks to give investors the spread return between high and low dividend paying stocks  going long in companies that pay the highest yields  and shorting those that have unstable or limited yield prospects 
This approach helps to reduce risk  and it results in a corporate bond like risk profile for the fund  That makes it somewhat comparable to funds like LQD or VCIT  albeit with lower interest rate risk and credit risk for DIVA  It also makes this QuantShares fund a way to strip out some of the equity market volatility while still capturing yield from some of the best dividend companies in the market today 
Top holdings right now focus in on energy at about 20  of the portfolio  while it accounts for a sizable short percentage too  This includes companies like ONEOK  NYSE OKE  and HollyFrontier  HFC  for long exposure  though the fund is well spread out from a company specific perspective  Two other key areas for the fund right now are utilities and financials  but check out the podcast for more on the fund s construction  and how this type of strategy can fit into a portfolio 
We also take a look at two issues which should be especially important to investors in these types of funds  and those are expenses and yields  The expenses might appear extremely high here at first glance  but Chuck walks us through this aspect  while we also talk about the current yield of the fund too   
QuantShares
Finally  we also take a closer look at some of the other funds from QuantShares which are focused on a market neutral strategy  We discuss their US Market Neutral Anti Beta Fund  BTAL   which looks to provide a spread return between low and high beta stocks  while we also investigate their US Market Neutral Momentum Fund  MOM  which seeks to provide a spread return between high and low momentum stocks  something that may be of particular interest in today s market environment 
But make sure to check out the podcast for more information on these funds  as well as the dividend hedged strategy  in this week s Dutram Report 
Bottom Line
But what do you think about DIVA and this hedging strategy  Make sure to write us in at podcast   zacks com or find me on Twitter  to give us your thoughts on this  or anything else in the fund market

138295,359810,OKE,Southern Company  SO  To Post Q1 Earnings  What To Expect ,opinion,"Electric utility firm Southern Company   NYSE SO   is set to release its first quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Wednesday  May 3 
In the preceding three month period  the Atlanta  GA based service provider reported weaker than expected earnings due to increased operations and maintenance costs 
However  coming to earnings surprise history  Southern Company has a good record  its beaten estimates in 3 of the last four quarters Southern Company  The  Price and EPS Surprise
 

   Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to Consider This Quarter
A leading utility holding entity in the U S   Southern Company dominates the power business across the Southeast  With a strong rate base growth and constructive regulation  we expect the firm to generate steady earnings 
Also  with operations in a stable and growing industry  Southern Company has a steady stream of cash flow  The utility s history of consistent dividend payments indicates its confidence in itself 
We further believe that the AGL Resources  NYSE GAS  acquisition will be accretive to Southern Company earnings  
However  with customer growth tepid and likely to remain so for some time  sales might be affected  This together with a large base  might make it difficult for Southern Company to manage rates  Higher operating and maintenance expenses is another concern 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Southern Company will beat estimates this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  to be able to beat consensus estimates  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
That is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is 0 00   This is because the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate both stand at 58 cents 
Zacks Rank  Southern Company s Zacks Rank  4  Sell  further decreases the predictive power of ESP  making us less confident of an earnings surprise call  
As it is  we caution against Sell rated stocks  Zacks Ranks  4 and 5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Stocks to Consider
While earnings beat looks uncertain for Southern Company  here are some utilities you may want to consider on the basis of our model  which shows that they have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter 
NiSource Inc    NYSE NI   has an Earnings ESP of  4 69  and a Zacks Rank  2  The firm is expected to release earnings results on May 3  You can see  
ONEOK Inc    NYSE OKE   has an Earnings ESP of  4 35  and a Zacks Rank  3  The utility is anticipated to release earnings on May 2

138312,359827,OKE,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  HollyFrontier  Weatherford International  Natural Gas Services  Chesapeake Energy And ONEOK Partners,opinion,"For Immediate Release

Chicago  IL   August 18  2016   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Oil   Gas  part 3  including like HollyFrontier Corp      Weatherford International plc     Natural Gas Services Group Inc      Chesapeake Energy Corp  NYSE CHK      and ONEOK  NYSE OKE  Partners L P      

Industry  Oil   Gas  part 3

Link  

Stuck in a long term bear market  money managers are warning of more pain ahead for energy stocks  In fact  fundamentals   as in ample stockpiles  plentiful refined products and rising production in Iraq and Saudi Arabia   suggest that the odds are firmly stacked against a sustained rally and point toward  lower for longer  commodity price expectation 

After several industry biggies came out with abysmal quarterly results  some sector observers feel that the door is open for one more retest of the multi year lows that oil and natural gas fell to in the first quarter 

With no guarantees that things will improve in the near to medium term  investors would be better off ignoring the following set of stocks 

Challenging Refining Backdrop Weighs on Downstream Operators

Till recently  U S  downstream  refining and marketing  stocks were seen notching up healthy gains and earnings beats  This is because the companies use oil as an input from which they derive refined petroleum products like gasoline  the prime transportation fuel in the U S  Hence  lower the oil price  higher will be their profits 

But with the cost of gasoline  heating oil  and other refined products catching up on the beaten down crude price  crack spreads  or refining margins  are under pressure  This is expected to impact the refiners  near term profitability 

As per the U S  Energy Department  the existing stock of gasoline is significantly higher than the year earlier level and is comfortably above the upper half of the average range  This refers to low demand for the most widely used petroleum product and has cast a deep shadow over the performance of refiners

As a result of these bearish factors  the tendency for a downward estimate revision has been more obvious in recent times  Companies like HollyFrontier Corp     look to be in most trouble 

E P Cuts Hurting Oilfield Equipment Suppliers

With new competitors entering the market and shrinkage of capital expenditure spending by the drilling contractors  oilfield machineries and equipment suppliers have seen their pricing fall drastically  In particular  the companies  margins have been hit hard by the ongoing North American drilling slump  The situation   characterized by tepid demand and weak pricing   is not expected to normalize anytime soon 

While firms catering to North American land drillers have been the worst affected  lack of new deepwater drilling orders are starting to haunt the subsea part of the industry  As it is  the commodity price rout has made a number of deepwater drilling projects uneconomical  With contract backlog down  most of the players are facing continued pressure on revenues  earnings and cash flows 

In particular  we suggest avoiding exposure to Weatherford International plc    and Natural Gas Services Group Inc      

Depressing Prices Make It Difficult for Gas Weighted Companies

Natural gas has rebounded strongly  by around 60   since hitting 17 year lows of around  1 6 per million Btu  MMBtu  in the first quarter  The phenomenal run up notwithstanding  the commodity is struggling to reach the psychologically important  3 per MMBtu level  And with expectations of surging supplies in North America amid tepid demand  there appears no reason to believe that the supply glut will subside and natural gas will be out of the dumpster in 2016 

Consequently  natural gas weighted exploration and production companies like Chesapeake Energy Corp     are in for a tough time  Gas focused partnerships like ONEOK Partners L P     tend to suffer too  from falling sales for their natural gas liquids  NGL  processing

138314,359829,OKE,6 Companies Profiting From U S  Natural Gas Exports Taking Off,opinion,"A couple of months ago we wrote about how the U S  had sent a shipment of Liquid Natural Gas  LNG  to the United Arab Emirates  see Coals to Newcastle   The notion of natural gas being extracted under a field in Pennsylvania  processed and then transported by pipeline to Louisiana  chilled and condensed to liquid form  loaded onto an LNG tanker and then sent to a part of the world that s the world s major hydrocarbon supplier is amazing 
It probably reflects better than most things how the worlds of natural gas and crude oil have been upended by the Shale Revolution  So far this year  U S  sourced LNG has also shipped to Brazil  Chile  Portugal  China  India  Jordan and Kuwait 
Ten years ago when the U S  was importing around 10 BCFD  Billion Cubic Feet per Day  of natural gas  the idea that some of that would arrive by LNG tanker was uncontroversial  Cheniere Energy Inc  NYSE LNG  began planning facilities such as Sabine Pass to accommodate such flows  As natural gas became steadily more abundant in the U S   Cheniere reversed themselves and planned for its export via LNG tanker 
Although their chosen site had deep water access and connectivity to the domestic network  switching a facility from LNG imports to exports isn t trivial  Former Cheniere President Charif Souki  who led the company through this metamorphosis  is one of the industry s most colorful characters 

The U S  is within sight of being a net exporter of natural gas  Additional LNG export facilities are at various stages of development  However  other countries are also increasing their export capability and it s quite possible the world will have  for several years  So far  virtually all the shift in the U S  balance of trade in natural gas has taken place through pipelines  Canada has long been a net exporter to us although flows go both ways and our net imports from Canada are down by almost half in ten years  We ve exported to Mexico for thirty years but in recent months volumes have really taken off  Early last year exports to Mexico exceeded those to Canada and the gap keeps growing 

Several new pipeline projects are at various stages of development  Between supplying gas for LNG export facilities and increasing Mexican exports  there s a lot of energy infrastructure being built  One of the clear beneficiaries is Williams Companies  NYSE WMB   whose Transco pipeline is the main recipient of their capital expenditures to accommodate growing demand 

But other midstream infrastructure companies involved in Mexican trade include TransCanada  NYSE TRP   Spectra  NYSE SE   Energy Transfer Equity  NYSE ETE  and Oneok  NYSE OKE  

In many cases their Master Limited Partnership  MLP  will build the assets and then share the Distributable CashFlow with their General Partners  GPs  via Incentive Distribution Rights as is common  This asset growth will benefit the GPs  Just as asset growth for a hedge fund benefits the hedge fund manager  or GP  so does asset growth for an MLP benefit its GP  An MLP GP is like a hedge fund manager

138315,359830,OKE,ONEOK  OKE  Q3 Earnings  Stock Poised To Beat Estimates,opinion,"We expect ONEOK Inc    NYSE OKE   to beat expectations when it reports third quarter 2016 results after the closing bell on Nov 1  Last quarter  this stock had reported a negative surprise of 2 38  
Why a Likely Positive Surprise 
Our proven model shows that ONEOK is likely to beat estimates this season because it has the right combination of two key ingredients  A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy    2  Buy  or  3  Hold  to be able to beat estimates  and ONEOK has the right mix 
Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is  2 33   This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands 44 cents  while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 43 cents  This is a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise ONEOK INC Price and EPS Surprise

   Please check our  that enables you to find stocks that are expected to come out with earnings surprises 
Zacks Rank  ONEOK s Zacks Rank  3  when combined with its positive ESP  makes us reasonably confident of positive surprise this quarter 
Conversely  Sell rated stocks   4 or  5  should never be considered going into an earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Factor to Consider
Rising popularity of natural gas due to its clean burning and affordable nature resulted in excessive production in the third quarter  This will likely add to ONEOK s top line in the third quarter as higher natural gas production will warrant higher use of the company s services  Moreover  ONEOK s contract restructuring initiatives and cost reduction efforts will continue through the third quarter  boosting its cash flows 
ONEOK anticipates natural gas liquids volume growth to be higher in the second half of 2016 than the first  driven by higher demand  Further  an increase in ethane demand due to a rise in petrochemical facilities and higher exports to Mexico spurred by growing demand in the third quarter will boost third quarter revenues 
ONEOK has contracted 92  of its transportation capacity and 71  of its storage capacity  thereby increasing visibility on third quarter revenues 
Other Stocks to Consider
Here are a couple of other operators in the same space worth considering on the basis of our model  which shows that they also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter 
UGI Corporation   NYSE UGI   has an Earnings ESP of  20 00  and a Zacks Rank  3  The company is slated to report fourth quarter fiscal 2016 results on Nov 9 
ONE Gas  Inc    NYSE OGS   is scheduled to report third quarter 2016 results on Oct 31  The company has an Earnings ESP of  31 58  and a Zacks Rank  2  You can see  
Apart from these two  you may also consider the following utility stock  which is poised for an earnings beat this quarter 
Avista Corp    NYSE AVA   has an Earnings ESP of  4 76  and a Zacks Rank  2  It is slated to report earnings on Nov 1

138343,359858,OKE,Eroding Hopes For Some Energy Stocks In Tough Environment,opinion,"Stuck in a long term bear market  money managers are warning of more pain ahead for energy stocks  In fact  fundamentals   as in ample stockpiles  plentiful refined products and rising production in Iraq and Saudi Arabia   suggest that the odds are firmly stacked against a sustained rally and point toward  lower for longer  commodity price expectation 
After several industry biggies came out with abysmal quarterly results  some sector observers feel that the door is open for one more retest of the multi year lows that oil and natural gas fell to in the first quarter 
With no guarantees that things will improve in the near to medium term  investors would be better off ignoring the following set of stocks 
Challenging Refining Backdrop Weighs on Downstream Operators
Till recently  U S  downstream  refining and marketing  stocks were seen notching up healthy gains and earnings beats  This is because the companies use oil as an input from which they derive refined petroleum products like gasoline  the prime transportation fuel in the U S  Hence  lower the oil price  higher will be their profits 
But with the cost of gasoline  heating oil  and other refined products catching up on the beaten down crude price  crack spreads  or refining margins  are under pressure  This is expected to impact the refiners  near term profitability 
As per the U S  Energy Department  the existing stock of gasoline is significantly higher than the year earlier level and is comfortably above the upper half of the average range  This refers to low demand for the most widely used petroleum product and has cast a deep shadow over the performance of refiners
As a result of these bearish factors  the tendency for a downward estimate revision has been more obvious in recent times  Companies like HollyFrontier Corp   HFC   Valero Energy Corp  NYSE VLO    VLO  and Phillips 66  NYSE PSX  look to be in most trouble 
E P Cuts Hurting Oilfield Equipment Suppliers
With new competitors entering the market and shrinkage of capital expenditure spending by the drilling contractors  oilfield machineries and equipment suppliers have seen their pricing fall drastically  In particular  the companies  margins have been hit hard by the ongoing North American drilling slump  The situation   characterized by tepid demand and weak pricing   is not expected to normalize anytime soon 
While firms catering to North American land drillers have been the worst affected  lack of new deepwater drilling orders are starting to haunt the subsea part of the industry  As it is  the commodity price rout has made a number of deepwater drilling projects uneconomical  With contract backlog down  most of the players are facing continued pressure on revenues  earnings and cash flows 
In particular  we suggest avoiding exposure to Dril Quip Inc   DRQ   Weatherford International plc  WFT  and Natural Gas Services Group Inc   NGS  
Depressing Prices Make It Difficult for Gas Weighted Companies
Natural gas has rebounded strongly  by around 60   since hitting 17 year lows of around  1 6 per million Btu  MMBtu  in the first quarter  The phenomenal run up notwithstanding  the commodity is struggling to reach the psychologically important  3 per MMBtu level  And with expectations of surging supplies in North America amid tepid demand  there appears no reason to believe that the supply glut will subside and natural gas will be out of the dumpster in 2016 
Consequently  natural gas weighted exploration and production companies like WPX Energy Inc   WPX   Rice Energy Inc   RICE   Chesapeake Energy Corp  NYSE CHK    CHK  are in for a tough time  Gas focused partnerships like Williams Partners L P   WPZ  and ONEOK  NYSE OKE  Partners L P   OKS  tend to suffer too  from falling sales for their natural gas liquids  NGL  processing

138387,359902,OKE,Rate Hike Or Not  The Same Problems Persist,opinion,"On May 22  2013 then Fed chairman Ben Bernanke inadvertently added  taper tantrum  to the lexicon of terms used to describe the impact of the Fed s activities  That date marks the formal beginning of the Fed s efforts to prepare financial markets for an eventual tightening of policy   or the start of the removal of accommodative policy  to use their description  In the belief that transparent policy deliberations reduce the possibility of a monetary surprise with its consequent financial market upheaval  the Fed s public statements  release of projections and even the ubiquitous  blue dots  showing the rate forecast of each FOMC member have all been provided to help us  In fact  for almost four years I ve been constructing an  FOMC Futures Curve   which is what short term interest rate futures would look like if FOMC members were the only participants  It s been absorbing for brief moments around four times a year when they provide updated information  Many might find it a nerdy preoccupation  but having spent a good part of my career in Fed engineered darkness over their intentions  the shift to greater openness begun under Greenspan has been fascinating 
Forward guidance presumably is intended to let us know what the Fed will do before they do it  As we head into a two day FOMC meeting on September 16 17  opinions are evenly split about whether they ll raise rates  Perhaps we ought not to be surprised in either outcome  but it seems to me that if there s no consensus after years of openness  the communication strategy has failed  The problem with providing meaningful forward guidance is that it involves a commitment  and a commitment reduces your ability to change your mind  The window into the Fed s deliberations has simply revealed that they want to retain maximum flexibility until the day they meet  Announcing a hike with a delayed effective date would soften the blow  see   but it s too late for that 
Following the FOMC s announcement and the elimination of near term uncertainty  investors will be faced with the same dilemma as before  how are they to invest so as to preserve the purchasing power of their assets after taxes and inflation  Whether ten year treasury yields move up 0 25  or not this week  the paucity of assets offering acceptable returns will remain Dilemma  1 
Suppose a taxable investor visits her financial advisor with the objective of constructing a portfolio with a 6  return and moderate risk  Assuming our investor is facing a 30  average tax rate  combination of Federal and state taxes on capital gains  dividends and ordinary income   a pre tax 6  is 4 2  afterwards  2  inflation  the Fed s target  knocks that return down to 2 2   Then there are the advisor s fees  and the possibility that returns won t be as hoped  6  doesn t seem that demanding given all of this  and yet the building blocks with which to achieve it are limited 
Public equities yield around 2   and assuming the fifty year average dividend growth rate of 5  prevails  for a total return of 7    stocks clearly are part of the portfolio  Bonds  as defined by the iShares Core US Aggregate Bond ETF  NYSE AGG   which tracks the Barclays  LONDON BARC  Aggregate Index  yield 2 4   Since the yield at which you buy a bond heavily impacts your total return  it s going to be hard to do much better than 2 4  with investment grade debt  Moreover  the ability of bonds to offset a falling equity market is limited given their already low yields  Backward looking models may justify them  but to us they look like returnless risk  Moving up the risk spectrum to High Yield gets you 5 5   as defined by the iShares High Yield Corporate Bond ETF  LONDON IHYU   There is some chance for capital appreciation   but this year capital losses have more than wiped out coupon income reflecting the preponderance of energy names in the index 
REITs yield 4 4   as defined by the Vanguard REIT ETF  NYSE VNQ    and this  combined with some modest growth may deliver a return that at least equals the investor s 6  target 
Regular readers can by now guess where this is going  The Alerian MLP Index  yields 7 25   and MLP distributions even grew in 2009 following the financial crisis  However  MLPs are down 23  so far in 2015  In fact  they ve fallen that much since the end of April  creating an unpleasant backdrop to an otherwise glorious Summer for anyone more than tangentially involved 
There is a bear story to MLPs  as those prescient enough to sell at the highs of August 2014 well know  A 33  drop can t happen without a fundamental story  and the collapse in oil is challenging the expected production growth of U S  shale plays with its attendant reduction in needed infrastructure  The growth story that has driven MLP prices is in doubt 
It s therefore instructive to examine metrics on a number of businesses as they were in August 2014 and how they appear today  The table below shows forecasts for 2016 distributions from selected MLPs  chosen unscientifically because we are invested in them or the General Partners that control them   and shows how those 2016 forecast distributions have changed from the market peak in MLPs 13 months ago to now  The data is from JPMorgan  NYSE JPM  but such figures are typically heavily influenced by company guidance 
Looking at the numbers  you certainly wouldn t think we d seen a collapse in oil  The 2016 forecast distribution for this group is modestly lower at  2 90  cap weighted  versus  2 99 a year ago  The market cap of these companies  excluding Kinder Morgan  NYSE KMI  since during the intervening period it combined with its two outstanding MLPs to create a substantially larger entity  has fallen by 16   hence the 2016 yield has risen from 5 2  to 6 8   Just looking at the General Partners in this group  KMI  OKE  PAGP and WMB  provides a similar result  The operations of these firms and their cashflow generating abilities have on average not shifted that much  Plains All America  PAA  and its GP  PAGP  have seen forecast reductions because of their crude oil exposure  The same is true of Oneok  NYSE OKE  
But overall  the fall in their security prices has simply driven up their yields  These names are representative   they re all midstream  which is to say they operate toll like business midels with limited direct commodity exposure  There are MLPs concentrated in Exploration   Production  upstream  and others that run refineries  variable distribution MLPs   but we don t care about those 
So for the investor seeking a 6  portfolio return  the most compelling reason to exclude MLPs is the 23  drop since April  which has made few people happy  However  looking beyond the undoubted voting by many investors who have abandoned the sector  7  yields combined with 8  9  growth rates  the cap weighted forecast on the group of names listed  seems pretty compelling for long term investors willing to look beyond recent price action and focus on the fundamentals by including MLPs  perhaps even with an overweight  in their portfolios ",2015-09-14,Simon Lack,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/rate-hike-or-not,-the-same-problems-persist-264903",264903

138389,359904,OKE,Dividend Death Watch Update  BBEP Suspends Distribution,opinion,"Try to imagine a zebra without stripes  Thanksgiving without turkey  or a pair of Nike s without the iconic  swoosh  
Of course  it s nearly impossible to envision certain things without their distinguishing characteristics 
Which is why a master limited partnership  MLP  without a distribution is such a strange entity  These tax advantaged vehicles were basically created to provide yield   the more the better 
But MLPs like Breitburn Energy Partners LP  O BBEP   once coveted by yield hogs for their high payouts  have become a slow motion train wreck within the financial markets 
Just last month  Breitburn suspended its distribution  thus joining Linn Energy  LLC  O LINE  as the second member of my Dividend Death Watch to go yield less 
Here s an update on this list of securities with dividend distribution sustainability issues 

As you can see  their performance has been abysmal  In just under a year  the average return is  50   distributions included but not reinvested  
A few of the MLPs have continued to increase their distributions  Enbridge Energy Partners  LP  N EEP   for instance  has increased its distribution by 2  this year  MarkWest Energy Partners  LP  N MWE   which merged with MPLX LP  N MPLX  on Friday  has hiked by 3  
Sunoco Logistics Partners LP  N SXL  has increased its payout the most of any security on the list  However  over the last four quarters  operating cash flow   never mind free cash flow   has been insufficient to cover cash distributions  This shortfall is partly due to the 19  increase in the number of units  shares  outstanding this year  which increases the amount of cash being distributed 
The management of SXL seems to have a dividend death wish 
ONEOK Partners  LP  N OKE and Williams Partners LP  N WPZ  have held their payouts steady in 2015  This is interesting because both previously had long strings of distribution increases 
Vanguard Natural Resources  LLC  O VNR  and Legacy Reserves LP  O LGCY  have both slashed their distributions  rightfully earning their places near the top of the list 
Diamond Offshore Drilling  Inc   N DO   the only common stock listed  eliminated its special dividend in February 2015 
Atlas Pipeline Partners  LP  APL  was acquired by Targa Resource Partners LP  N NGLS  in March 2015  Yes  these partnerships will continue to buy each other in an attempt to hide the fact that they re dying 
Finally  it s worth noting that the shares of Kinder Morgan  Inc   N KMI  have come under significant pressure lately  and its 4 3  bonds due 2025 have declined from above  100 earlier this year to below  85 
Kinder Morgan is no longer an MLP  but it s still an industry bellwether 
The End Game
Investors are still missing an important point  When the cost of capital spikes  capital intensive businesses suddenly have a big problem 
A company can reduce this risk by issuing debt and locking in a borrowing rate  However  if it s already highly levered  issuing more debt simply hastens eventual liquidity problems  Also  if the company s bonds are in free fall  then it s too late 
This precipice is where many energy companies find themselves today 
And don t expect a rebound in the price of crude oil to come to the rescue  either  We have oil coming out of our ears and storage capacity is running out 
Ultimately  the overinvestment and excessive leverage in the energy sector will end in tears 
By this time next year  we ll witness further distribution cuts and suspensions  as well as defaults 
Once a major MLP default occurs  true panic will pervade  At that point  we ll be better able to assess which players will survive the massacre

138390,359905,OKE,Adapting To New Circumstances,opinion,"Investors are focusing carefully on the response of Master Limited Partnership  MLP  managements to the impact of a higher cost of equity on their growth plans  Those firms that moderate their growth forecasts in response so as to rely less on issuing equity and maintain their distribution coverage are acting thoughtfully with the best interests of their investors  To that end  ONEOK Inc  N OKE  announced that they don t anticipate issuing any equity at their MLP  Oneok Partn  N OKS  until well into 2017  Their distribution coverage at OKE is expected to rise to 1 3X  It currently yields 10 2   OKS yields 10 9   both based on trailing distributions  
MLPs are reconciling their growth plans with the constrained appetite of investors to provide financing  MLP investors don t tend to trade their positions that frequently because the tax deferral benefits grow over time for direct investors  Selling causes the recapture of income previously received and a corresponding tax liability  Their long term investment horizon is rare today  with so much focus on the near term trend  OKE and OKS are recognizing the multi year partnership with their investor base and behaving in a way that s consistent with retaining their stakeholders 
The lifting of the U S  ban on oil exports was quickly followed by an announcement by Enterprise Products Partners LP  N EPD  that it would provide pipeline and marine terminal services for the export of domestic  light crude  The first shipment is expected next month  It s not a game changer for midstream infrastructure  but is clearly good for them as well as for domestic crude oil producers 
We have concluded that an overlooked but important factor behind the collapse in MLP prices this year relates to capital flows and the investor base  In our first blog of 2016 we will publish a more detailed analysis of why understanding MLP capital flows is important and what it means for the sector going forward

138391,359906,OKE,Best Stocks For 2016  ETE Is Beaten Down And Ready,opinion,"This piece first appeared on InvestorPlace as part of its  contest  There are several excellent picks this year  and the competition promises to be fierce 

If you ve read my work for any length of time  you know I m not a major risk taker  In my experience  slow and steady wins the race 

That was my rationale for recommending Prospect Capital Corporation  O PSEC  in last year s  contest  I reasoned that a diversified private equity portfolio trading at a deep discount to book value was a low risk investment with a high probability of generating a market beating return  Between a return to book value and the high dividend  I expected total returns of as high as 40  within 12 to 18 months 

Well  we didn t quite get there  or at least not yet  The value investor s eternal problem is that a cheap stock can stay cheap for a lot longer than you expect  But at least we were paid handsomely to wait with PSEC s dividend 

This year  I m recommending another beaten down value stock with a high dividend  technically a  distribution  in this case   MLP general partner Energy Transfer Equity LP  N ETE  

A look at Energy Transfer Equity s stock chart will give you heartburn  Serious heartburn  ETE shares lost more than half their value between July and December  as the entire midstream MLP space got hammered  But at today s prices  Energy Transfer Equity gives us exposure to one of the world s premier energy transportation company at prices I do not expect to see again in our lifetimes  Furthermore  I believe that much of the drop we saw in December was due to indiscriminate selling by investors fleeing the entire sector rather than due ETE s prospects 



Background
Energy Transfer Equity is an MLP  but it s a peculiar kind in that  rather than own pipeline interests itself  its primary role is to serve as a general partner to a collection of other MLPs  In this sense  ETE has a lot more in common with Kinder Morgan  N KMI  before its reorganization late in 2014 than it does with most other  traditional  MLPs 

You can explain Energy Transfer s company structure with two words   It s complicated   Energy Transfer Equity is the head of a sprawling energy empire consisting of six companies that are currently traded today  Energy Transfer Equity  Energy Transfer Partners LP  N ETP   Williams Partners LP  N WPZ   Sunoco LP  N SUN   Sunoco Logistics Partners LP  N SXL   and Williams Companies  N WMB   which is not shown in the chart below because it is in the process of being rolled into ETE  A final entity   Energy Transfer Corp      is to be formed in 2016 and will be similar in structure to other corporations operating in the midstream MLP space  such as Kinder Morgan and ONEOK Inc  N OKE  


Taken together  the consolidated Energy Transfer empire will has bigger network of pipelines that either Kinder Morgan or Enterprise Products Partners LP  N EPD   at 104 000 miles  It s the largest transporter of natural gas in the U S   moving 35  of all natural gas in America   the third largest natural gas liquids business  the third largest MLP crude oil transporter  and has the second largest liquefied natural gas export facility planned  Quite simply  Energy Transfer is the proverbial 800 pound gorilla in the midstream energy space 
Looking at ETE Stock
When I evaluate a stock  I like to have four basic criteria in place 
The stock should be on the right side of a durable macro trend 
The stock should be cheap 
The stock should be shareholder friendly 
Management should have  skin in the game  in the form of insider ownership and buying 
Not every stock I buy will have all four criteria in place  but ETE most certainly does 
I ll start with the most controversial point  That ETE is on the right side of a durable macro trend  That might sound like an odd thing to say given that crude oil prices are in free fall and the entire energy industry is in a state of crisis right now  While ETE has virtually no direct exposure to falling crude oil prices  some of its subsidiaries have at least indirect exposure in that a prolonged depression in energy prices would affect domestic energy production and the volume of oil and gas flowing through their pipelines 
I consider this exposure manageable  Meanwhile  I still consider U S  natural gas exportation to be one of the major macro themes of the years ahead  as importers look to lessen their dependence on Russia and the volatile Middle East   I m not alone in this belief  Consider Seth Klarman and  s massive investments in Cheniere Energy Inc  N LNG   which I highlighted here  
Moving on  let s look at value  After losing more than half its value  value investors are bound to start sniffing around ETE  But are the shares truly cheap at these prices 
Yes  I start with the distribution yield  which at 9 6   is about as high as its ever been in the company s history  Yes  as we saw with Kinder Morgan  even sacrosanct dividends can be cut  But in ETE s case  the underlying MLPs fueling the distribution are a lot less levered and thus at less risk of a cut  As an example  Energy Transfer Partners is leveraged about 4 75 times  debt EBITDA   Kinder Morgan is leveraged over 6 times  though it is in the process of deleveraging itself 
As of last quarter  ETE s distribution coverage ratio was 1 09  ETP s coverage ratio was lower last quarter    Yet management was confident enough that cash flows will improve in 2016 that they raised the distribution by 2 cents per share last quarter 
Using the trailing four quarters of distributable cash flow   DCF    ETE trades at a price DCF ratio of 9 9  That is remarkably cheap for any MLP  particularly a general partner growing its distribution at a rapid clip 
That brings me to my next criteria  Shareholder friendliness  ETE has been an absolute monster when it comes to raising its cash payout 

Over the past year  ETE has raised its dividend by a full third  and it s more than doubled its payout since 2011 
In a   CFO Jamie Welch hinted that distribution growth might slow a little in 2016  owing to the company s desire to keep leverage under control in this credit environment  ETE doesn t want to be  the next Kinder Morgan  and be forced to cut its payout later   I recommend you watch Welch s interview  It s gives a decent bit of insight into ETE s prospects over the coming years   But Welch makes it clear that ETE will still have  significant  distribution growth in 2016 
We ll see about that growth  Energy Transfer might decide to play it safe  hoard cash  and keep its payout constant  But even with zero distribution growth in 2016  you re looking at fantastic potential total returns 
And finally  we come to insider activity  ETE s executives have a massive amount of skin in the game  Company founder Kelcy Warren dropped over  41 million of his own money into the stock in early December  This is after he already dropped  63 million in July   19 million in January  and  80 million last fall 
That s about  200 million in insider buying by just one man  Yes  Warren is a billionaire  Forbes pegs his net worth at   But that still shows major commitment from one of the smartest men in the energy industry 
What kind of returns do I expect for Energy Transfer Equity in 2016 
Starting at today s prices  I would say returns of 50  100  in 12 24 months is very realistic and may even prove to be conservative 
So  what are the risks 
Alas  there are no free lunches in this business  The entire MLP space is currently under attack  and as we saw with Kinder Morgan  bad things happen when the credit markets turn negative on a company  Should Wall Street decide that the entire MLP model needs to be scrapped  and all existing MLPs need to deleverage  then ETE will get hit along with the rest of the sector 
That said  at today s prices  there is a lot of fear already priced in  ETE is a steal  and I expect it to trounce the competition in InvestorPlace s contest this year

The S P 500 continues to march on with prices now pressuring the psychological 2100 barrier  While this suggests that investors are maintaining long equity positions    and money managers are overweight US names    all is not well relative to the commodity space    especially oil and the energy sector 
The monthly chart below  which shows the S P 500 relative to oil  is exhibiting early signs of trend exhaustion  suggesting increased risk of a break lower and a reversal of the bullish equity trade  Cross asset managers are likely to take advantage of this by reducing equity exposure and increasing their exposure in both oil and the energy sector 
This fresh inflow of funds would help to buoy already improving oil prices    and extend the current rally from the February lows    as well as offer fresh trade ideas in energy stocks  which have  until recently  proven to be sharp underperformers 
Energy Stocks To Watch
Within the equity space  we have seen strong April rallies in Chesapeake Energy  NYSE CHK   ONEOK  NYSE OKE   Murphy Oil  NYSE MUR   Range Resources  NYSE RRC  and Southwestern Energy  NYSE SWN   And we anticipate further price improvement in the coming months as cross asset and equity managers gradually move cash into the energy sector

138425,359940,OKE,Sandy s Aftermath,opinion,It turns out that a state of increasing anger at the demonstrated fragility of our energy infrastructure may not be the best place from which to write objectively about the subject  nonetheless that is what I m going to attempt   Dark evenings huddled around a gas fireplace hoping the laptop s battery lasts the length of the movie before 9 30 bedtime  well what else is there to do   can become boring pretty quickly   indeed  I can report that it has done so already for many people Such discomforts of course are trivial by comparison  We are fortunate in that everybody we know is safe  The stories of tragic deaths are heartbreaking and far too numerous  The flooding and destruction are way beyond our expectations We were mercifully spared water damage since we re not close to the ocean and rainfall was less than expected  We suffered only minor property damage from this 100 year storm even though the extended loss of power is testing in its own way  There may be a bulge in births nine months from now  but don t expect many babies to be named Sandra Energy infrastructure has long been recognized as in need of greater investment  For our part we have focused on its impact on MLPs and in particular the need for new pipelines  storage facilities and so on to move shale natural gas and oil from where it s found to where it ll ultimately be consumed  Several months ago for example we added Oneok Partners  OKS  to our MLP portfolio based on the strong growth prospects from their exposure to the Bakken in North Dakota  We re also invested in the domestic natural gas theme through E P names such as Range Resources  RRC  because of its abundance and low cost  While reliable delivery wasn t a consideration  it s ironic that 19th century style gaslight never ceased for those quirky enough to use it  Gas lines are underground In August 2003  wide areas of the northeast U S  and Canada suffered a loss of electricity as a result of cascading failures caused by an evident weak point in the grid  Cross border interconnectedness and minimal redundancies are no doubt efficient most of the time  but like just in time inventory there s little room for error or Mother Nature  Much hand wringing ensued about the aging U S  power grid and need to upgrade its infrastructure  No doubt some work was done although the issue slipped from public attention soon after Nine years later the devastation wrought by Sandy has exposed a form of tail risk  though not the one familiar to investment professionals  Although the U S  is in many ways the most advanced country on the planet  many Europeans express surprise at the 19th century technology that relies on aboveground delivery of power using wires strung between utility poles  It increasingly looks like an overly optimistic way to deliver a service that needs to be available 100  of the time  Many other rich countries have buried the wires underground  whereas one of the less attractive features of suburban life in America includes the regular risk of power loss when a modestly vigorous wind blows down trees and cuts supply lines  It s so predictable that one wonders why such vulnerability persists Industry estimates are that putting power lines and transformers below ground and therefore out of harm s way  assuming they re also protected from flooding  can cost up to ten times the cost of aboveground infrastructure and presumably utility customers or taxpayers are unwilling to meet the cost  This type of analysis relies both on accurate estimates of the probability of unlikely events as well as both the cost of those events and of mitigating against them  In many cases there s more guessing than estimating involved  European population areas tend to be more dense  but not all of America is the wide open prairie and large metropolitan areas such as New York aren t much different from London in that regard As people move to population centers  the per capita expense falls and studies have found the cost to be closer to five times such as this one prepared in the UK last year by the Institution of Engineering and Technology  an organization that promotes the exchange of ideas on science  engineering and technology   Besides  we will be spending more to compensate for the current delivery system in at least two ways  insurance coverage for anything related to a disruption of power such as business interruption and property damage will assuredly become more expensive as the revised loss history and increased demand drive up rates  In addition  many more businesses and an increasing number of private homes will invest in back up generators to assure the reliability they need that the public system currently cannot provide  Installing a generator in one s home is not a trivial undertaking  and yet the sound of their engines providing power to those neighbors whose risk assessment was accurate proves that reliable electricity is highly valued by many  I ve never visited Baghdad  but apparently the noise of generators is a familiar evening chorus there  Enough said Mike Cembalest of JPMorgan s Private Bank recently noted a London School of Economics study  evidently they think harder about this stuff in the UK  which revealed the relatively low threshold of New York City s flooding preparedness compared with other major cities  an issue picked up by New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo in the days immediately following Sandy  New York s standard of preparation is to withstand a 1 in 100 years flood  Contrast this with Osaka  1 300   London and Tokyo  1 1 000  or Amsterdam  1 10 000   New York s relatively low standard appears even less acceptable when compared with the value of assets exposed and higher per capita GDP  i e  financial capacity  to improve protection  Inevitably when the rare event happens the ex ante forecast appears flawed and yet statistically the sighting of one black swan doesn t imply another  unless the future won t reflect the history on which such forecasts are necessarily based  The black swan may have a family  Our weather appears to be changing in ways that make it less predictable and more volatile  yes  let s buy weather volatility   As a power refugee living in what seems like 19th century discomfort  it s hard not to embrace the idea that a more robust energy infrastructure will draw greater political attention and support than it has in the past  and correspondingly more investment One positive outcome at least for financial markets is that the hit to 4Q12 GDP  estimated as high as 0 5   is likely to make at least a short term resolution of the fiscal cliff far more probable than it appeared pre Sandy  The legislated tax hikes and spending cuts that are set to occur automatically on January 1st  2013 without new legislation to avert them have been looming as an unresolved issue in recent months  There was little reason to be optimistic about a negotiated compromise to delay the sharp fiscal contraction that would result until Sandy showed up  Now  facing a regional economic catastrophe big enough to produce a stumble even at the nationwide level of economic output  a lame duck  post election Congress is likely to put partisan wrangling aside for once  One weather related tail event is likely to head off another  following the pattern of 2012 for financial markets in avoiding each of the shocks that lurked in the wings while confronting a natural disaster none of us contemplated  Predictability is a virtue in many things  as it relates to power deliverability it s probably now valued a little more highly  We regained power after six days  and as cold and miserable an experience as that was you quickly realize how much worse it has been for many others ,2012-11-06,Simon Lack,https://www.investing.com/analysis/sandy’s-aftermath-142400,142400
138426,359941,OKE,Will The IEA s Oil Forecast Be Wrong Again ,opinion,The famous Danish physicist  once humorously observed   Predictions are very difficult  especially about the future   And so  as the world considers yet another rosy oil supply forecast  from the Paris based International Energy Agency  IEA   it is worth reviewing the agency s record  Back in the year 2000  that by 2010  liquid fuel production worldwide would reach 95 8 million barrels per day  mbpd   The actual 2010 number was 87 1 mbpd  The agency further forecast an average daily oil price of  28 25 per barrel  adjusted for inflation   The actual average daily price of oil traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange in 2010 was  79 61   The IEA included in its 2000 supply projections not only crude oil plus lease condensate  which is the definition of oil  but also natural gas plant liquids  only a small fraction of which can be substituted for oil  and refinery processing gain which is the result of applying energy to break oil into its components  causing the final volume to expand  The agency refers to the resulting number as  oil  supply  But  clearly this number is not really just oil supply  and to confuse policymakers and the public   So  what made the IEA so sanguine about oil supply growth in the year 2000  It cited the revolution taking place in deepwater drilling technology which was expected to allow the extraction of oil supplies ample for the world s needs for decades to come  But  deepwater drilling has turned out to be more challenging than anticipated and has not produced the bounty the IEA imagined it would  This is not to say that it hasn t been a critical adjunct to world oil supplies  It s just that deepwater oil production hasn t been able both to make up for declines in production elsewhere AND grow supplies beyond that  something that has resulted in for world oil production  crude plus lease condensate  starting in 2005  Now  the IEA tells us that a  revolutionary  new technology called hydraulic fracturing  actually  a newly deployed variant called   is going to cause what it calls a  supply shock  that spells ample and rising oil supplies  But  despite years of such drilling in the United States  which the agency says will be the center of this  shock   world oil prices remain as measured by the average daily price  And  world oil production  crude plus lease condensate  has only occasionally bounced above 75 mbpd in the last seven years before retreating downward  Perhaps the IEA means that using these new techniques to unlock so called  deposits beyond the United States will bring about this supply shock  Nope  The report states specifically that over the forecast period through 2018  the IEA does not expect significant development in other countries of these deposits using the new type of hydraulic fracturing  Perhaps the agency noticed the  last year from Poland  The company said it could not find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons in what had been billed as Europe s most promising shale gas deposits  Shale gas  of course  is extracted using the same fracking techniques as tight oil  And  both oil and natural gas tend to appear together in such deposits  And then  just prior to the release of the IEA s latest forecast    The point is not that there is no exploitable tight oil or shale gas outside the United States  Rather  the quality of those resources varies far more than the industry has led the public to believe  At first  the oil and gas industry portrayed such deposits as subject to what it called the  manufacturing model   The notion was that a company could drill anywhere within known deposits and extract commercial quantities of oil and or natural gas  The reality is far different  Even in the United States  the center of the putative boom  drillers have ended up focusing on a few  sweet spots  that yield commercial quantities of  or   These can represent as little at 15 percent of the total area of the formation  The IEA seems to be unaware of certain key information that is publicly available or doesn t understand the significance of that information  And  the agency doesn t seem to remember what it said in its last forecast  Here is a sampling The production decline rate of hydraulically fractured tight oil wells is around  in the two most prolific plays  Eagle Ford in Texas and Bakken in North Dakota  This means that drillers must replace 40 percent of last year s production capacity EACH YEAR before they can increase the overall rate of production from their tight oil wells  The average annual production decline rate for existing wells worldwide is around 4 to 5 percent  Essentially  the IEA doesn t appear to understand that it is expecting oil extracted from wells that decline at a rate 10 TIMES FASTER than average wells worldwide to make up for worldwide declines elsewhere AND provide significant growth in world oil supplies  But  the agency apparently did not look at publicly available well data from each state to determine annual decline rates and their implications for future supply  The IEA seems simply to have taken self interested industry forecasts on their face  forecasts made with an eye toward engendering confidence among investors and lenders and thereby pumping up the value of lucrative stock options held by company insiders The IEA expresses concerns about adequate infrastructure for the tight oil producers  Yet  the agency does not seem to be aware that the   Contrary to their public pronouncements  could it be that the oil producers don t really believe they have enough oil in the long term to support a pipeline and therefore did not want to make long term shipping commitments to a pipeline company  Perhaps the oil companies would rather saddle the railroads with the capital costs of new tank cars so the oil producers won t be on the hook for any long term infrastructure costs associated with transporting their oil The IEA talks about a surge in U S  natural gas production  Yet  it seems unaware that  even as domestic gas prices rose from  1 82 per thousand cubic feet to above  4 today  The so called shale gas boom has ended  and we are now finding out just how costly it will be to bring that gas out of the ground  Correspondingly  the rate of extraction will not be so great as promised either In just a few months time  the IEA has dramatically altered its view about the trajectory of world consumption of liquid fuels  Its 2012 World Energy Outlook released in November prophesied that   The more recent report mentioned at the beginning of this piece  the   now projects that world demand will reach 96 7 mbpd just five years from now  implying a growth trajectory far in excess of that projected in the agency s 2012 report The IEA says it does not forecast prices and then tells us it uses the futures prices for its model  What its model implies is continuing high prices for oil and oil products  The IEA makes no attempt to understand the effect that high prices have on the world economy and its ability to grow under such circumstances  Nor does it address the dampening effect of high prices on demand  calling into question its projection of rapid increases in demand The IEA then tells us that so called oil production  capacity   the basis of which is never described  will grow faster than demand  This would imply falling prices as excess capacity overhangs the oil markets  But that would mean that the high prices which it agrees are needed to extract tight oil profitably would disappear  So  how would this allow tight oil volumes to grow dramatically if extraction is unprofitable or only marginally profitable  This contradiction is never addressed Burning all the known reserves of fossil fuels would put us on a path to a climate catastrophe  something the IEA acknowledged in  saying   No more than one third of proven reserves of fossil fuels can be consumed prior to 2050 if the world is to achieve the 2 C goal  unless carbon capture and storage  CCS  technology is widely deployed   CCS technology is not being widely deployed  nor is it likely to be  By contrast the agency s  reads like a promotional brochure for the North American oil and gas industry  How does that square with the agency s concern about climate change It s not unusual for government sponsored organizations such as the IEA to be given contradictory directives  in this case  to promote adequate energy supplies and also to warn about climate change  There has been little mention of this contraction in the media because the media has focused on what it perceives as sensational news about oil and natural gas supplies in North America  Given that focus  it is troubling that neither the agency nor the media have bothered to revisit past forecasts  It turns out such forecasts fail so often that it s puzzling that the media  governments  corporations  and the public put so much faith in them  Those whose plans were based on the IEA s 2000 forecast were completely blindsided by developments just a few years later We would be much better served by looking at what we know right now from publicly available figures about actual trends  It s not as exciting as dramatic predictions about a future of plenty  or one miserable from want  But it s a far firmer basis for sound policy ,2013-05-20,Kurt Cobb,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-the-iea's-oil-forecast-be-wrong-again-167557,167557

138433,359948,OKE,MLPs Start Reporting 1Q Earnings ,opinion,"Several Master Limited Partnerships  MLPs  announced their quarterly earnings last week  The overall picture continues to be one of businesses performing well with good distribution coverage and continued plans to grow their infrastructure networks while responding appropriately to shifts in the domestic production landscape 
Enterprise Products Partners  NYSE EPD   an MLP with no Incentive Distribution Rights  IDR  drag detracting from its investors  returns  announced their 43rd consecutive distribution increase of 5 6  compared with a year earlier  Their payout is also covered at 1 4X by Distributable Cash Flow 
Oneok Inc    NYSE OKE  the General Partner  GP  for Oneok Partners  NYSE OKS  was a more nuanced story  The stock price fell following the earnings release as the distribution remained flat on a quarterly basis   8  on a year ago   Of note was that cash flows to OKE from OKS  reflecting its role as OKS s GP  were  169MM   16  on a year ago  Interestingly  Net Income and DCF at OKS itself fell in 1Q15 compared with the prior year  They explained it so   Variances in financial performance between the first quarter 2015 and first quarter 2014 were primarily a reflection of significantly higher weather related seasonal demand  resulting in higher prices for propane and natural gas  in the Midwest due to severely cold weather during the first quarter 2014 and the continued impact of commodity price declines in the first quarter 2015  
A cold 2014 winter and lower commodity prices this year affected earnings  The GP experienced more stability in its earnings than was reflected in the underlying MLP it controls  Nonetheless  full year guidance was confirmed as unchanged both for OKS and OKE  OKE s coverage of its distribution was 1 2X which prompted one analyst to ask on the earnings call whether OKE might even use some of its cash to buy OKS units on the open market  You could interpret the absence of a dividend hike by OKE as symptomatic of a tougher business environment  or you might regard their resulting comfortable distribution coverage as reflecting an abundance of cauti0n  We lean towards the latter 
Overall  for these two MLPs  business seems to be going well  We are invested in EPD and OKE ",2015-05-12,Simon Lack,https://www.investing.com/analysis/mlps-start-reporting-1q-earnings-251377,251377

138453,359968,OKE,Bruno Del Ama  Do ETFs Offer Value For MLP Investors ,opinion,The Energy Report  Bruno  since Global X Funds brought its first exchange traded fund  ETF  to market in 2009  you have added another 30  the latest being the Global X MLP ETF  MLPA NYSE   What is the appetite among investors for ETFs  and specifically those featuring master limited partnerships  MLPs   Bruno del Ama  Investors continue to migrate to the ETF asset class  and we are big fans of energy MLPs  Energy transportation is an infrastructure play with a couple of benefits  First  it provides significant diversification to complement investors  portfolios  second  it provides income in a low interest rate environment  ETFs are an innovation in the MLP asset class  We at Global X focus on asset classes where we are the first provider of a particular ETF  In our last interview  for example  we talked about our uranium ETF  which provides focused exposure to that market in a way that did not exist before  Innovation is in our DNA  In the energy MLP space  we saw that the expenses from existing MLP investment vehicles were pretty high  For a fund comprised exclusively of U S  exposure  notwithstanding the tax complexities with MLPs  there is really no reason for a product to be priced at 0 85   or even higher in the case of mutual funds and closed end funds  We saw an opportunity to bring a product to market at a much lower cost base than the existing products  We are by far the lowest cost investment product in the MLP marketplace  at 0 45   compared to an average of 0 85  for other MLP ETFs or exchange traded notes  ETNs   TER  That is lower than some of Global X s other ETFs  Is that profitable  BD  We only need a certain scale of assets  not a lot of assets  for the fund to be profitable  MLPs are all U S  listed securities and the fund operating expenses are much lower compared to our international and global funds  We provide cost effectiveness to investors on a product where we can make a reasonable margin  We realized we could offer this exposure at a much lower cost  so we did  By having expense ratios that may be 40 basis points less than the average expense ratios of other MLP ETNs and ETFs  we have more money to distribute to investors  resulting in a higher dividend yield  TER  Why does your MLP ETF track the Solactive MLP Composite Index instead of the Alerian Index or the equal weighted Cushing 30 MLP Index  BD  In our opinion  the Solactive MLP Composite Index is better constructed for several reasons  First  it has 30 components  not 25  as in the Alerian MLP Index  This gives Solactive more diversity  consistent with Cushing  Secondly  Solactive is market cap weighted  with certain limits that ensure the concentration in the fund s top holdings is much lower than the concentration you would find in the Alerian MLP Index  There  the top 10 components represent 66  of the fund  In our case  the top 10 components represent about 50  of the fund  TER  By my count  there are at least seven or eight other MLP ETFs  including the Yorkville High Income MLP ETF  YMLP NYSE  and the Alerian MLP ETF  AMLP NYSE   How does the Global X MLP ETF differ  BD  The Yorkville High Income MLP ETF focuses on the companies that pay the highest yield  That is a different type of exposure  The Alerian MLP ETF is a little more concentrated  but otherwise quite similar and highly correlated to our MLP ETF  the main difference really is the much lower management fee  TER  Why should investors choose your fund instead of investing directly in MLPs  BD  To gain broad  diversified exposure  an investor would need to invest in more than one MLP  But here s the thing  The MLP itself does not pay corporate taxes  investors receive a K 1 report and pay the taxes themselves  So if an investor invests in 25 or 30 individual MLPs  he would have to incorporate all of those 25 or 30 K 1s into his or her individual tax return  That can get complex and expensive  Investors on an MLP ETF would receive a simple 1099 and avoid K 1s  but on the other hand  would be subject to corporate taxes for capital gains inside the ETF  Both options direct investment and MLP ETFs are attractive  depending on the investor particulars and preferences  TER  Under U S  federal tax law  a regulated investment company cannot have more than 25  of its portfolio in MLPs  To be structured as an ETF  some MLP ETFs must select C corporation status  Because an MLP ETF under that designation is taxed as a regular corporation  it will collect a deferred tax liability if the underlying securities appreciate  which usually happens  Is this the case for MLPA  BD  Correct  investors need to be aware that when investing in MLP ETFs  mutual funds and closed end funds  including MLPA  the funds will be paying capital gains taxes  Investors that want diversified access to MLPs have a number of choices  For taxable accounts  investors can buy a basket of individual MLPs and receive the K 1s and incorporate them in their tax return filings  Alternatively  investors can buy an MLP mutual fund or ETF that will do all the K 1 work on their behalf  so investors receive a 1099 instead of multiple K 1s  but the fund will be subject to capital gains taxes  Or investors could buy an MLP ETN  which would avoid K 1s and capital gains taxes  However  ETNs have a couple of important drawbacks  First  it subjects investors to the risk of the ETN issuer  as the assets of the investors are not segregated and they are instead exposed to a promissory note from the bank issuing the ETN  Second  after tax returns could be lower for ETNs than ETFs  depending on the composition of returns and the tax brackets of investors  This is because payments from an ETN are equivalent to interest payments from a fixed income instrument because they are structured as notes  And one of the big drivers of returns for MLPs is the income they generate  So if your effective tax rate is higher than the dividend tax rate  as is typically the case  you will pay higher taxes on income distributions from an ETN versus an ETF  For qualified accounts  such as 401 k s and IRAs  you cannot get direct access to MLPs  The MLP ETF structure allows qualified accounts to invest and get access to the MLP asset class  So this is an important consideration for investors  So in summary  investors have a number of options to invest in MLPs  all of which have pros and cons depending on the specifics and preferences of each investor  TER  Basically  investing in an MLP ETF simplifies the tax structure  but investors lose some of the tax advantages inherent to MLPs  BD  That is exactly right for a taxable account  For a qualified account  for example a 401 k   that is not the case  A qualified plan that invests directly in MLPs would be subject to unrelated business income tax  UBIT   This is because both MLPs and qualified plans get beneficial tax treatment and the IRS wants to ensure that taxes are paid at some level  One of the benefits of MLP ETFs is that they act as tax blockers for MLPs and therefore make them eligible for 401 k  and IRA plans  TER  MLPA offers a quarterly dividend  Do you have an idea what the percentage will be in the next quarter  BD  If you look at the underlying components and the index  it is very comparable to the Alerian Index or the Cushing Index  although you save 40 basis points in expenses  That gives you a sense of what the payment will be versus these other products  The current distribution yield for MLPA is 6 35  and the 30 day SEC yield is 6 08   TER  The Solactive Composite Index that MLPA tracks is comprised of 30 MLPs engaged in the transportation  storage  processing  refining  marketing  exploration  production and mining of natural resources  What are some of the MLPs that investors would own indirectly if they bought your fund  BD  The largest components of the Global X MLP ETF are Magellan Midstream Partners L P   MMP NYSE   Plains All American Pipeline L P   PAA NYSE   ONEOK Partners L P   OKS NYSE   El Paso Pipeline Partners L P   EPB NYSE   Kinder Morgan Energy Partners L P   KMP NYSE   Enbridge Energy Partners L P   EEP NYSE   Energy Transfer Partners L P   ETP NYSE   Williams Partners L P   WPZ NYSE  and MarkWest Energy Partners L P   MWE NYSE MKT     TER  Which are offering the best yield now  BD  The top two yielding MLPs in MLPA are Inergy L P   NRGY NYSE   yielding 10 54  and Natural Resource Partners L P   NRP NYSE   yielding 9 89   TER  About 80  of your Top 10 is involved in the transportation of natural resources  Why that particular sector  BD  Most of the market capitalization of the MLP universe is in the midstream sector  or infrastructure used for energy transportation  The transportation sector has a number of benefits for investors  As long as the natural gas or the oil is flowing through those pipelines  you charge a toll no matter what  These infrastructure  toll type investments tend to have low correlations to the general economy and the equity markets  They are nice diversifiers in portfolios  Most of the fund s remaining exposure is in upstream exploration type operations or downstream refining operations  We see a lot of the growth in upstream exploration  particularly with the continued surge of natural gas exploration in North America  TER  What other energy ETFs does Global X have in store for investors  BD  We filed for a junior MLP ETF that would focus on the small cap segment  where we see significant value  While some of the money that has come into MLP ETFs and ETNs has increased the valuations of MLPs in general  that has been less of a factor in the junior MLP space  That is an area where we see  from both a valuation and a growth perspective  significant upside related to the energy renaissance that s taking hold in the U S   particularly with natural gas discoveries and new technology  We are very excited about that new fund and we expect to bring it to market soon  TER  How long does it typically take from the time you file to the time you launch a new fund  BD  From filing until the prospectus becomes effective with the SEC typically takes two and a half months  We filed a month or so ago  so we are probably a couple of months away from that product being effective  We cannot comment on an exact date  but that gives you a sense of the typical product launch timeframe  TER  Are you working on other ETFs  BD  There is the Global X Uranium ETF  URA NYSE  and the Global X Lithium ETF  LIT NYSE MKT   which is a component of energy because lithium is a critical component of the most advanced battery technology  Our lithium ETF includes the largest lithium ion battery manufacturers  It has seen significant growth with the increase of remote connectivity with iPhones  iPads and laptops  Growth in the electric vehicle or hybrid vehicle space could also drive growth in that fund  TER  Have any of your funds stopped trading  BD  We liquidated a few funds because of lack of interest in the marketplace  We are focused on the long term prospects of our ETFs and on our clients  needs  We want to build the business organically and continue to deliver value to our investors  TER  Bruno  thank you for your time   is the co founder and chief executive officer of
