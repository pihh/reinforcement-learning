2046,223561,DAIO,Semiconductor Shares Slammed After Earnings  Sector Rotation ,opinion,"Many semiconductor stocks have had a rough time after earnings  Advanced Micro Devices  NASDAQ AMD   Ultra Clean Holdings  NASDAQ UCTT   FormFactor  NASDAQ FORM   Advanced Energy Industries Inc  NASDAQ AEIS   and now RTR position Nova  NASDAQ NVMI  have all been hit 

While NVMI is still in Stage 2 I ve decided to close out my position in the stock today  Fortunately I reduced position sizes in all of my stocks that had upcoming earnings 

This allowed me to take profits in stocks like NVMI and Cohu  NASDAQ COHU  ahead of earnings  NVMI was up over 20  since   I ll take a small loss though on my remaining shares in NVMI unless it moves a little higher later today 
I m also going to close out COHU and inTest Corporation  NYSE INTT   They both have earnings after the close today  and based on the way other semiconductor shares have traded I m not sure its worth the risk holding into earnings  I have no idea how those stocks will trade after earnings  they could go up or down  COHU I ll take a small gain on and INTT I ll be taking losses on  INTT hasn t traded well since it gapped higher and it has closed the gap since then  and it is about to fall below the gap support 
It s certainly possible these stocks just consolidate and keep moving higher  But since I have other trades that are working better  Data I O Corporation  NASDAQ DAIO   Atlassian  NASDAQ TEAM   Twitter  NYSE TWTR    I d rather either add to those positions or find other setups without the overhead resistance that now exists in these semiconductor shares  TEAM and DAIO especially are turning into monster winners  and TWTR is trading well so far the week after it surged higher  It s quite possible we are seeing a rotation out of semiconductor names after earnings which isn t surprising since they have been performing so well 
Had I not taken any profits on the way up in NVMI I d have nothing to show for it after holding for a couple months  Which is another example of why I m a big fan of taking partial profits off the table when you get them  All of the positions I take in stocks I trade in increments  if a stock continues to go up I will increase my position size but also take a portion of the profits and reduce position size when I get them ",2017-11-02,Justin Smyth,https://www.investing.com/analysis/semiconductor-shares-slammed-after-earnings-200257715,200257715

Corcept Therapeutics Incorporated  NASDAQ CORT   after a difficult start this morning  had a big pop  and then a big pullback  It went from under 19 to almost 20  popping 79 cents  or 4   to 19 69  on 1 6 million shares traded  Looking at the daily chart  you ll see that the wedge was broken on Tuesday  and I think it broke out  On Wednesday  I d be watching the 20 00  10 range  If it gets through that you could see it run to 22  and then 24  It has 5 4  
Melco Resorts   Entertainment L  NASDAQ MLCO  broke out of key resistance on Tuesday that it s been in for 5 weeks  jumping 1 64  or 7   to 25 28  on 7 million shares traded  It looks to me like it s headed up toward 28 9 
NovoCure Limited  NASDAQ NVCR  snapped back to test the highs from September  running 1 25  or 6   to 21 60  on 1 5 million shares traded  If it can get to 22 30  you may see it run to the 29 target  There s 8 6

2099,223614,DAIO,Recapping My Trading Year For 2017,opinion,"I ended 2016 and started 2017 with a big focus on uranium stocks  This was because they were ripping out of a Stage 1 base on huge volume towards the end of 2016  Uranium stocks had been destroyed for the last 5 years so this had the potential to be a monster trade 

The stocks did well for a few months and by taking some partial profits I made money on some of my uranium positions  But I also held onto a few uranium miners too long as the rally started to fizzle out in March and gave back some profits  I ended up moving on to other sectors as the uranium miners eventually broke down and went back into a Stage 1 base until the end of the year 
I made huge profits in gold miners in 2016 which enabled it to be my best year performance wise since I ve been trading  But fortunately using my Stage Analysis system I avoided gold miners for the most part in 2017 as they were simply drifting sideways in a consolidation the entire year  Even when many were turning bullish on gold in September I looked at the charts of many gold and silver miners and saw no volume increase that almost always accompanies a new rally  You can see that in the chart below of GDX  NYSE GDX  where even though it started rallying back then volume was still well below average  By avoiding gold miners I was able to trade other sectors that were in strong uptrends in 2017 

One of the other mistakes I made early in 2017 was being a little too focused on uranium  This made me miss some awesome Stage 2 breakouts early in the year in stocks like Applied Opt  NASDAQ AAOI  and Square Inc  NYSE SQ   shown below   If I would have diversified and taken trades in those stocks when they broke out  I could have added to those positions at the same time I cut back my uranium positions  This was a good lesson to learn in that if you see multiple sectors breaking out then there s no reason not to take trades in each of them  since it s impossible to know which rally will be stronger 


I applied this lesson for the rest of 2017 and it worked well for the last 4 months of the year since there were so many sectors breaking out such as tech stocks  bitcoin related stocks  cannabis stocks  and some commodities producing stocks towards the end of the year 
Data I O Corporation  NASDAQ DAIO  was my biggest winner for the year and a stock I detailed in the Real Trading Report  I made money in every stock I discussed on the Real Trading Report in 2017 except for INTT  This included the tech stocks Atlassian Corp Plc  NASDAQ TEAM   Twitter Inc  NYSE TWTR   Cohu Inc  NASDAQ COHU   and Nova  NASDAQ NVMI   Many of these stocks have pulled back since November but by selling and taking partial profits on the way up I was able to capture gains in these stocks  For example for DAIO I sold shares in the 13s  14s  15s  and 16s on the way up and now it has pulled back to the 12s  but it is still above the 30 week MA  If I had not taken profits on the way up then I would have left a good portion of my gains on the table 

Bitcoin was another lesson learned for me in 2017 because I totally avoided it  I did make some money on some bitcoin related stocks but even then I let a little bias against Bitcoin derail me from staying in longer on some of the trades  The lesson I m taking away from Bitcoin  just trade the charts  fundamental opinions on any market are totally worthless  It s amazing how many Bitcoin experts there are now compared to 12 months ago when no one cared about Bitcoin  and the only reason for this is because of what has happened on the chart  If you  you can get in early and profitably trade any market  including a totally new asset class like Bitcoin 
For example if you look at the chart of Bitcoin Investment Trust  OTC GBTC  below it broke out of a beautiful Stage 1 base in May  then consolidated and broke out again multiple times  Even as late as early November it had another nice consolidation from which it broke out from and more than tripled  and that was after Bitcoin had made some monster gains for the year 

Even some of the  Bitcoin  stocks which many could be nothing more than scams could have been traded easily with a system like Stage Analysis  If you look at RIOT below it broke out of a beautiful Stage 1 base in late September  Then consolidated for a few weeks and had another monster run after breaking out above the 8 9 area 

The last two months of 2017 the biggest winning sector   and fortunately I ve been all over this sector  I highlighted Aurora Cannabis Inc  OTC ACBFF  in a post in November and this stock has blasted off along with stocks like TWMJF and APHQF  all three of which I traded 

This sector has been a great example of   I ve traded probably at least 10 other cannabis related stocks over the past two months since so many of them have broken out of bases but not at the same time  When I m scanning and evaluating stocks in a sector I m always on the look out for stocks that haven t broken out yet if they are in a strong sector where most of the other stocks have already moved  A strong sector can lift all boats including stocks that lag  and sometimes the lagging stocks can turn out to be just as big if not bigger winners than the initial stocks that start breaking out first 
I recorded a cumulative 50 4  gain for my trading in 2017 which was 31  higher than the S P 500 at 19 4   The most important lessons I m taking away from 2017 are 
Taking partial profits on winning trades is an absolute necessity
If multiple sectors are breaking out of Stage 1 bases diversify across them  It s possible some won t work out while others will  but impossible to predict
Just trade the charts and the Stage Analysis system  they can be applied to any market and have no bias
Opinions  fundamental analysis  and predictions are not useful and should be ignored
I have no predictions for 2018 and I would highly encourage anyone reading this to ignore every single prediction they read anywhere since none of them are necessary or helpful  For example no one predicted what happened to Bitcoin this year but that wasn t at all necessary to make money on Bitcoin ",2017-12-31,Justin Smyth,https://www.investing.com/analysis/recapping-my-trading-year-for-2017-200276746,200276746
