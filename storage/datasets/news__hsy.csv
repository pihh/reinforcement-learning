13166,234681,HSY,Nestle  Hershey at odds with farmers over U S  GMO labeling,news,By Chris Prentice NEW YORK  Reuters    The world s top food companies and farmers of crops such as beet sugar are pitted against each other as they lobby the U S  government over plans to label genetically engineered ingredients  At the heart of the issue is transparency over ingredients used in food  Packaged foods makers are facing flagging consumer trust and stagnating demand for some core products as consumers opt for foods with simpler ingredient lists   Many food companies want the government to require manufacturers to include on labels all ingredients that have been genetically modified  known as GMO   But farmers want the labels to exclude ingredients that have been so refined and processed that they no longer contain any trace of the transformed genes when they are used for food  GMO crops have had their genes altered using biotechnology  Nestle  S NESN   the world s largest food maker  and rivals including  Hershey Co   N HSY  and  Unilever  Plc  L ULVR  want the U S  Department of Agriculture to include on the label ingredients from crops that were genetically modified such as canola and soybean oils and sugar from beets  The USDA has asked for feedback on a proposal for required labeling of genetically engineered ingredients after a battle over the issue in states including Vermont sparked the U S  Congress to pass legislation  The USDA has proposed a plan for applying the law  The deadline for public comment is July 3  For farmers  facing a GMO backlash from consumers  the fact that the ingredients no longer contain transformed genes by the time they make their way into chocolates  pasta sauce and cereal should mean they are excluded from the labeling   The law has been very clear that the required disclosure is going to be for those crops or ingredients that contain the genetic material   said Luther Markwart  head of the American Sugar Beets Association in Washington   The entire U S  sugar beet crops is genetically engineered   For things like sugar and other refined products that don t contain the genetic material  the law does not apply to us   Markwart said  But Nestle  which makes Stouffer s frozen prepared foods and Lean Cuisine frozen entrees  and Hershey  whose confections include Reese s Peanut Butter cups  disagree   Consumers want to know what is in their food and beverages and we believe that they deserve transparency  It s at the core of our business   Nestle spokeswoman Kate Shaw said in an emailed statement  noting the company believes those highly refined ingredients should fall under the requirements  Hershey s global head of scientific and regulatory affairs  Martin Slayne  said labeling these ingredients is both important for consistency as well as for  meeting consumer expectations on transparency   The Grocery Manufacturers Association  which helped lead many of the food company efforts to prevent state labeling initiatives  said in prepared comments on Tuesday that excluding refined ingredients would result in 78 percent fewer products being disclosed under the federal law  About 90 percent of U S  corn  soybean and beet sugar crops are bioengineered  the trade group noted  Unlike other regions  the United States has embraced the technology  For farmers of sugar beet in states such as Michigan  North Dakota and Idaho  the herbicide tolerant seeds have boosted yields and profits  and curbed some of the uncertainty of farming   But many Americans have said they want to know more about what is in their food  including whether bioengineered seeds have been used  Should the USDA not require those ingredients be labeled as genetically engineered  the onus would be on food companies to decide how to label them  That could heighten tension between the companies and their ingredient suppliers  How a food manufacturer chooses to label bioengineered ingredients that do not fall under the scope of the government requirements could be susceptible to challenge   We don t have any problem with transparency  but there s been a lot of misinformation out there   Markwart said   The challenge is there s not a lot of space  on a label  GMO labeling has caused rifts between farmers and foodmakers in the past   In late 2016  a coalition of farmers criticized Dannon Co for marketing non GMO products after the U S  subsidiary of  Danone  SA  PA DANO  made moves to overhaul its supply chain to reduce the use of the biotechnology in its yogurt products  The farmers said Dannon s advertising misled consumers  The Center for Science in the Public Interest  a consumer advocacy group in Washington  agrees with the farmers that their finished ingredients are no different scientifically from their non GMO counterparts  but said the products should still require labeling   USDA should read the statute broadly and provide consumers with as much information as possible  but it should be scientifically accurate   said Gregory Jaffe  director of the center s Project on Biotechnology   They need a different disclosure for those highly refined ingredients

13185,234700,HSY,Zacks com Featured Highlights Include  Hershey  Synopsys  Jones Lang LaSalle  TransUnion And OneMain,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   September 18  2019   Stocks in this week s article are Hershey   NYSE HSY    Synopsys   NASDAQ SNPS    Jones Lang LaSalle   NYSE JLL    TransUnion   NYSE TRU   and OneMain Holdings   NYSE OMF   Robust Sales Growth Makes These 5 Stocks Worth Buying NowStrong sales growth is one of the most important characteristics of potential winners in the stock market  The companies that put emphasis on sales management have a competitive advantage  as strong sales generally get converted into growth Revenues are often more closely monitored than earnings when assessing the growth of a business  This is because investors want to make sure that a business has the capability of generating more sales over time to cater to an expanding customer base Flat or declining sales growth indicates obstacles at the company and offers limited scope for sustained growth  Stagnant companies may generate near term profit  but do not ensure enough growth to attract new investors Without impressive top line growth  bottom line improvement may not be sustainable over the long term  While a company can show earnings strength by reducing expenses  a sustainable bottom line improvement requires robust sales growth However  sales growth in isolation doesn t indicate much about a company s future performance  Though it provides investors an insight into product demand and pricing power  a huge sales number is not necessarily translated into profits So  taking into consideration a company s cash position along with its sales number can prove to be a more dependable strategy  Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and potential investments  Most importantly  an adequate cash position suggests that revenues are being channelized in the right direction

13187,234702,HSY,Tyson Foods Gains From Protein Packed Brands  Costs High,opinion,Tyson Foods  Inc    NYSE TSN    a renowned meat products manufacturing company  is attracting investors on the back of a robust portfolio of protein packed brands  Moreover  efforts such as acquisitions and efficiency building programs have been yielding  However  the company continues to witness challenges in the ongoing fourth quarter of fiscal 2019  Moreover  persistent weakness in the Prepared Foods segment is a worry  Let s take a closer look Efforts to Boost Portfolio Bode WellTyson Foods boasts a rich portfolio of protein packed brands that are growing rapidly across the globe  During the first  the second and the third quarter of fiscal 2019  the company delivered higher sales in the chicken and beef categories year over year  Moreover  during the third quarter  the Pork segment performed well  Solid performances across these categories boosted the top line in the said quarter We note that acquisitions have played an important role in boosting the company s portfolio  The company expects to keep gaining from the integration of Keystone and the newly acquired Thai and European assets  Recently  the company entered into an agreement to invest in the foods segment of Brazil s Grupo Vibra  Vibra Foods   The move is likely to bolster Tyson Foods  access to Brazilian poultry supplies Apart from this  the company is steadily expanding fresh meat offerings on consumers  rising demand for food without added hormones or antibiotics  In this respect  Tyson Foods  buyout of Tecumseh is quite noteworthy  The company is venturing into alternative sources for meat and protein products  evident from investments in Memphis Meats and New Wave Foods  Further  the company is on track with new plant based and blended products launches under the Raised   Rooted brand Tyson Foods expects demand for protein to rise consistently  It is well positioned to benefit from all opportunities in the space  For fiscal 2020  USDA expects overall domestic protein production  chicken  beef  pork and turkey  to rise roughly 2  year over year  A similar rate of growth is expected for fiscal 2019 as predicted by the USDA earlier  Such upsides along with optimistic sales view for fiscal 2019 are encouraging and boosting investors  optimism  The Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company s shares have gained almost 15  in the past three months compared with the  s rise of 10 1  Headwinds in Q4The ongoing fourth quarter fiscal 2019 is turning out to be worrisome  thanks to challenges triggered by adverse business conditions  Management has highlighted challenges such as reversal of a gain on mark to market grain derivatives  adverse impacts of a fire breakout in a beef processing plant and implementation of certain food safety initiatives  Management has expressed concerns over slower than expected operational improvements in the chicken unit and commodity market volatility Thanks to these adversities  management lowered its fiscal 2019 earnings view  It now expects the bottom line in the range of  5 30  5 70 per share compared with the earlier projection of  5 75  6 10 Coming back to the headwinds  commodity market volatilities are likely to lead to higher input costs  as witnessed in the third quarter for the beef  pork and prepared foods units  Moreover  lower sales in the prepared foods category  triggered by business divestitures  have been exerting pressure on Tyson Foods  performance Wrapping UpDespite these headwinds  we are encouraged about the company s strong portfolio that includes well known brands  Moreover  the company is on track with the Financial Fitness Program  which focuses on boosting operational efficiencies  Earlier  management stated that it expects the program to generate savings worth  400 million by 2019 and  600 million by 2020  All said  such upsides are likely to maintain Tyson Foods  position in investors  good books

13232,234747,HSY,Top USA Gymnastics board members bow to resignation demands,news,"By Keith Coffman  Reuters    Three USA Gymnastics board members resigned on Monday  bowing to demands for a shake up at the sport s governing body after revelations that the long time national team doctor sexually abused dozens of female athletes  some as young as 10 years old  The resignations came during the fifth day of stinging testimony by some of the sport s biggest stars at an extended pre sentencing hearing for the doctor  Larry Nassar  who pleaded guilty in November to 10 counts of molesting female gymnasts  Many of the dozens of athletes and former athletes who testified said they felt angry at and betrayed by USA Gymnastics for ignoring their complaints  The young women accused the governing body of seeking to suppress their accounts in bid to avoid bad publicity about the national program  After the announcement of the resignations  John Manly  a lawyer who represents 2012 Olympic gold medalist McKayla Maroney and some of Nassar s other victims  said the change at the top was not sweeping enough and called on the federation to change its position that it had no duty to warn athletes about Nassar    Until that happens  this move is simply a public relations ploy to save a sinking ship   he said in a statement  The board announced the resignations of chairman Paul Parilla  vice chairman Jay Binder and treasurer Bitsy Kelley  who comprise the gymnastics governing body s executive leadership team  No replacements were named   We believe this step will allow us to more effectively move forward in implementing change within our organization   USA Gymnastics Chief Executive Katy Perry said in a statement  Last March  USA Gymnastics Chief Executive Steve Penny resigned his post  A federation spokeswoman said the departing board members did not have any comment   But Manly said the resignations did not go far enough and called on the remaining 18 board members to step down  saying they were also aware of the federation s mishandling of the Nassar allegations   He called on Congress to investigate the federation  the U S  Olympic Committee  USOC  and Michigan State University  where Nassar  54  worked for years as a physician in a sports clinic   The USOC s chief executive  Scott Blackmun said his organization has pressed USA Gymnastics to change its culture and leadership    New board leadership is necessary because the current leaders have been focused on establishing that they did nothing wrong   Blackman said on Twitter   USA Gymnastics needs to focus on supporting the brave survivors   STAR TESTIMONY During Nassar s hearing in Ingham County Circuit Court in Lansing  Michigan  Olympic gold medalist Aly Raisman last week called for an independent investigation into U S  Gymnastics and Olympic officials  who she said had the power to stop Nassar   It s clear now that if we leave it up to these organizations  history is likely to repeat itself   Raisman  23  said   Raisman was one of about 160 victims who are expected to make statements before the hearing wraps up later this week  Prosecutors have asked for a sentence of 40 to 125 years for Nassar  who is already serving a 60 year sentence in federal prison on child pornography convictions  Rick Burton  sports management professor at Syracuse University  said the leadership changes were crucial for USA Gymnastics to retain its sponsorships  which provide about a third of its funding   You can t have elite athletes make those kinds of statements and not do anything   he said in a telephone interview

13234,234749,HSY,5 Consumer Staples Stocks To Weather The Trade War,opinion,"The stock market is reacting to President Trump s latest round of tariffs and China s retaliation  White House representatives have been talking about how we shouldn t worry because China is hurting more and because margins have held up relatively well across sectors so far this earnings season  So the feeling is that China won t be able to keep up with the obviously stronger U S  economy  especially since its growth numbers over the last few years may have been  cooked up  
Whatever be the case  this definitely isn t a good time to get into stocks with China exposure because heaven knows where the trade war is headed or how long it will continue  And while we can have lots of confidence in the consumer given the jobs report and essentially steady profitability of companies  it s obvious that people are going to prioritize their spending  And the top priorities no matter where the market goes  have always been things like food  clothes  personal care products and other fast moving consumer goods  FMCG   That s what makes the consumer staples sector a really good defensive play in uncertain times 
The sector has returned 16 4  year to date  Moreover  of the 67 consumer staples companies that have reported this quarter  48 or 72  have topped estimates  6  9   have met expectations while 13  19   missed  That s a pretty good showing considering all the problems  not only from the trade war but also the escalating input cost  There are 28 positive estimate revisions and 19 negative revisions 
Nearly half the sub industries within the sector are currently in buy territory and some of the others also have things going for them  While the Food confectionery  Textile apparel  Funeral Services  Publishing books  Publishing newspapers  Cosmetics and Agricultural operations sub industries remain attractive  Textile apparel and Cosmetics being larger  have a greater influence

You can see 
Bristol Myers  shares have underperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry in the year to date period  losing  9  vs   1 2   Bristol Myers reported impressive second quarter results  It beat on both earnings and sales largely due to robust sales of immuno oncology drug Opdivo and blood thinner drug Eliquis  Label expansion of Opdivo into additional indications continues to drive sales  The Zacks analyst thinks impending acquisition of Celgene Corporation  NASDAQ CELG  will broaden Bristol Myers  portfolio but associated delays are disappointing  Moreover  the company s decision to divest Celgene s blockbuster drug Otezla raises questions about targeted synergies  Also  pipeline setbacks are a concern  The failure of part 2 of the Checkmate 227 study was a disappointment  given the potential of the NSCLC market  Additionally  the approval of Merck s Keytruda for first line NSCLC adds to Bristol Myers  woes 
 You can   
Shares of CME Group have outperformed the Zacks Securities and Exchanges industry over the past three months  gaining  15 4  versus  14 5   CME Group s second quarter EPS beat estimates  The Zacks analyst thinks the company remains well poised for growth given its strong market position  which is attributable to varied derivative product lines  Efforts to expand and cross sell through strategic alliances  acquisitions  new product initiatives and a stable global presence bode well  Product innovation and a growing proportion of volume from customers outside the United States have been aiding results  The company intends to focus more on over the counter clearing services  However  its diversified product portfolio has significant exposure to interest rate volatility and currency fluctuations  Firm government regulations and limited credit availability in the current unstable capital and credit markets are the other negatives  Moreover  the company has been witnessing escalating expenses 
 You can   
Chubb s shares have gained  22 2  year to date  outperforming the Zacks Property  Casualty and Title industry  which has increased  3 2  over the same period  Chubb s second quarter EPS beat estimates on prudent underwriting  premium growth and better pricing  The Zacks analyst thinks the insurer will benefit from a suite of compelling products and services  Its inorganic growth story is also impressive  helping it to achieve a higher long term return on equity  Increased scale  efficiency and a solid balance sheet will continue to lend a competitive edge  Chubb estimates solid growth in Overseas General operations  both commercial and consumer lines  going forward  A strong capital position will allow it to boost shareholder return and invest in strategic growth initiatives  However  exposure to cat loss remains a concern  Also  mounting expenses will curb margin expansion

13248,234763,HSY,Top 5 Things to Know in the Market on Monday,news,"Investing com   Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Monday  December 18 
1  CME launches bitcoin futures amid UBS skepticism
The Chicago Mercantile Exchange  CME  launched its own Bitcoin Futures on Sunday following rival CBOE s own version just a week earlier 
As the world s largest exchange jumps into the mix  it s thought that the CME launch could garnish even more interest for the underlying digital currency 
Starting Monday  the CME product will allow investor to make bets on whether they believe the price will rise or fall  The second U S  bitcoin futures launch is seen as another step towards big institutional investors warming up to a volatile asset that had until recently been accessible only via largely unregulated markets 
Bitcoin continues to have its detractors after having skyrocketed more than 1 800  year to date among the furor for alternative currencies in general  While many investors still bet that the rally will continue  UBS chairman Axel Weber said Monday that the digital currency was neither  valuable or sustainable  
 As soon as small investors invest  the regulators are required     I would welcome a discussion with regulators about cryptocurrencies   Weber told Swiss newspaper NZZ 
2  Tax bill remains major market focus
The U S  tax overhaul continues to be a major market focus with its final passage expected to happen this week 
On Friday  two wavering Republican senators through their weight behind the compromise bill  essentially cementing its approval  Both the House and the Senate are expected to pass the proposal by mid week  paving the way for U S  President Donald Trump s signature 
Debate over the effectiveness of the measure still rages  While corporate and individual taxes are expected to initially fall  the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation calculated that the bill would increase federal deficits by  1 46 trillion over 10 years  before accounting for any economic growth that might result 
Economists have widely proclaimed that the tax cuts will not result in improvements to the economy based on their calculations that the bulk of the benefits will be for corporations and the wealthiest Americans 
However  Trump proclaimed that  tax cuts will increase investment in the American economy and in U S  workers  leading to higher growth  higher wages  and more jobs  
3  Global stocks celebrate U S  tax reform as holidays arrive
Global stocks were broadly higher across the board on Monday as investors celebrated the imminent approval of Trump s tax overhaul  U S  stocks closed at record highs on Friday as news that Republicans holding out on approval gave their support 
U S  futures looked set to continue the celebration on Monday in what will likely be a slow week as the Christmas holidays are just around the corner  At 5 58AM ET  10 58GMT   the blue chip Dow futures rose by 120 points  or 0 49   S P 500 futures gained 9 points  or 0 34   while the Nasdaq 100 futures traded up 37 points  or 0 56  
Elsewhere  European bourses shared the bullish feeling with M A activity also helping to pump prices with the benchmark Euro Stoxx 50 rising around 1   as revisions to euro zone inflation in November showed no changes made 
Earlier  Asian shares edged up on Monday  with sentiment boosted by expectations U S  lawmakers will pass a long awaited tax bill this week  while Chinese stocks were soggy on concerns about liquidity and tighter regulations in the world s second largest economy  Japan s Nikkei 225 closed with solid gains of 1 63   but China s Shanghai Composite ended Monday up a meager 0 05  
4  Oil gains supported by pipeline outage  Nigeria strike
Oil prices moved higher on Monday amid an ongoing North Sea pipeline outage while a strike by Nigerian oil workers threatened its crude exports and weekly data showed a decrease in U S  shale output 
North Sea operator Ineos declared force majeure on all oil and gas shipments through its Forties pipeline system last week after cracks were found 
In Nigeria  the Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria  whose members mainly work in the upstream oil industry  started industrial action on Monday after talks with government agencies ended in deadlock  potentially hitting the country s production and exports 
Additionally  data from energy services firm Baker Hughes released after the market close on Friday showed that U S  energy companies cut rigs drilling for new production for the first time in six weeks  to 747  in the week ended December 15 
U S  crude oil futures rose 0 52  to  57 63 at 5 59AM ET  10 59GMT   while Brent oil traded up 0 33  to  63 44

13251,234766,HSY,Investors binge on China s appetite for healthier snack foods,news,By Farah Master and Donny Kwok HONG KONG  Reuters    Chinese venture capital and private equity funds are pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into local start ups serving up snack food products of the healthier kind  and threatening the market share of larger Chinese and global food companies  Backed by savvy marketing and online promotions targeting the increasingly health conscious among China s burgeoning middle class  brands such as nuts seller Three Squirrels and Le Pur  a maker of Greek yoghurt  are nibbling away at the sales of the big corporations in the country s more than  500 billion food and beverage industry  The start ups are recording double and triple digit sales growth leading to rocketing valuations as they dominate the rapidly growing online market in particular  Investment by venture capital firms in China s food and beverage start ups is close to doubling to nearly  2 billion over the past two years  said Wang Xiaolong  managing director of Hony Capital  one of China s biggest private equity firms and owner of PizzaExpress  a global pizza restaurant company   For local Chinese food and beverage brands to turn into international brands  it is only a matter of time   Wang told Reuters  adding that the trend was unstoppable  Increasing numbers of Chinese taking up sport and exercise and a greater awareness of lifestyle diseases like obesity and diabetes has helped to accelerate the demand for healthier products  especially among the millennial generation  Scandals over tainted food in China in the past 10 years has also contributed to the trend  Local Chinese food and beverage brands are gaining in popularity as they focus not only on health benefits of their offerings but the quality of their production  said Nicholas Cator  executive director at Belgian investment firm Verlinvest  which last year set up a  300 million joint venture with Chinese state owned conglomerate China Resources  Cator said his firm is interested in investing in brands such as Three  Squirrels and Le Pur and would aim to help them with distribution  brand building and technology   It s heating up     branded food and beverage was lagging on the tech and healthcare valuations but valuations in F B have been increasing   he said  Products such as Greek yogurt  nuts and probiotic drinks have seen big gains in growth at the expense of those laden with sugar and preservatives said analysts and food company executives  Some specialty Chinese products or concepts  such as hot pot  chili sauce and milk tea  have also recorded rising sales  Zhou Hei Ya  HK 1458   for example  is turning braised duck into a premium snack food  emphasizing its quality  Le Pur  Three Squirrels  dried fruit and nuts company Be   Cheery  which was acquired by health food company Haoxiangni  SZ 002582  in 2016  and Zhou Hei Ya did not respond to requests for comment for this story   MOBILE CAMPAIGNS  Many of the niche brands have swiftly expanded their pool of millennial customers through interactive online and mobile campaigns that place a big emphasis on quality ingredients and showing customers their production methods and supply chain networks  analysts said  This has helped them to outpace traditional sector leaders such as instant noodle maker Tingyi  HK 0322  and fried rice cracker producer  Want Want China Holdings  Ltd  HK 0151   which are both grappling with lackluster sales   Want Want Chairman Tsa Eng Meng said in August the company had introduced various healthy products  such as  premium high protein Hot Kid milk  and the  Aiyo buckwheat noodles       Tingyi announced a new noodle product in August  promoting it as a  non fried  healthy soup base option targeted at young families and athletes  A report by U S  consultancy Bain   Company released in October said chocolate  chewing gum and candy had all registered double digit negative volume growth in China in the first half of 2017  Categories   such as yoghurt and packaged water   have been doing  exceptionally well   Bain said adding this as  evidence of Chinese consumers  continuing passion for health and wellness and their rejection of products considered less healthy  such as chewing gum and confectionery    U S  chocolate giant  Hershey Co   N HSY  has been struggling for growth in China  Its Chief Financial Officer Patricia Little told an earnings conference call in October that it expects its China chocolate sales in stores to be flat to slightly up this year  though its online sales are projected to rise 15 percent  On Alibaba s online platform T Mall  which is China s biggest retail portal  some of the most popular food brands are Three Squirrels  Be   Cheery  Yili Greek yogurt and Taetea  a specialty tea brand  rather than major international confectionery brands

13280,234795,HSY,Here s Why Hershey  HSY  Is A Great Momentum Stock To Buy,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  this can be very tough to define  There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance  The Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Hershey  HSY   a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B  We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions  two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Hershey currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
In order to see if HSY is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this chocolate bar and candy maker holds up 
Looking at a stock s short term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum  since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment  It is also useful to compare a security to its industry  as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area 
For HSY  shares are up 0 73  over the past week while the Zacks Food   Confectionery industry is up 0 73  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 9 48  compares favorably with the industry s 7 59  performance as well 
While any stock can see its price increase  it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market  That is why looking at longer term price metrics    such as performance over the past three months or year    can be useful as well  Over the past quarter  shares of Hershey have risen 17 97   and are up 34 17  in the last year  In comparison  the S P 500 has only moved 10 88  and 12 34   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to HSY s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  HSY is currently averaging 927 582 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things  including estimate revisions and a stock s price movement  Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank  and a nice path here can be promising  We have recently been noticing this with HSY 
Over the past two months  3 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost HSY s consensus estimate  increasing from  5 65 to  5 67 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  1 estimate has moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of  0 79   A quarter ago  it was expected that this chocolate bar and candy maker would post earnings of  1 56 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 55  delivering a surprise of  0 64  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once 
Hershey  which belongs to the Zacks Food   Confectionery industry  posted revenues of  1 99 billion for the quarter ended December 2018  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 22   This compares to year ago revenues of  1 94 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Hershey shares have lost about 1 5  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 7  
What s Next for Hershey 
While Hershey has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Hershey was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Food   Confectionery is currently in the top 14  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2019-01-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/hershey-hsy-q4-earnings-and-revenues-lag-estimates-200381797,200381797

13305,234820,HSY,Hershey  HSY  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Hershey  HSY  reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 31  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This chocolate bar and candy maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 27 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  23 3  
Revenues are expected to be  2 01 billion  up 3 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Hershey 
For Hershey  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 91  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Hershey will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Hershey would post earnings of  1 56 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 55  delivering a surprise of  0 64  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Hershey doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/hershey-hsy-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200378907,200378907

13327,234842,HSY,Hershey Gains On Buyouts   Innovation  Cost Inflation A Worry,opinion,"The Hershey Company   NYSE HSY   appears to be a preferred pick  given this renowned chocolate maker s dedicated efforts to strengthen brand portfolio through innovation and buyouts  Further  the company is focused on making productivity improvements and cost saving initiatives  which are likely to help it counter escalated cost woes Markedly  Hershey has rallied 17  in the past six months compared with the  s growth of 16   Let s delve deeper and see how this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock is positioned  Buyouts a Major DriverHershey has been conducting buyouts to augment portfolio strength and boost revenues  In fact  net impact from buyouts and divestitures boosted sales growth by 2 5 points during the third quarter of 2018  Notably  Hershey s sales gained 3 7 points and 5 9 points during the third and the second quarters of 2018  respectively  from the acquisition of Amplify Snack Brands 
To go beyond chocolate and gain a solid footing in the fast growing market for healthy snacks  Hershey acquired Amplify in January 2018  With several plans rolled up its sleeves to further strengthen the Amplify brands  Hershey expects greater yields from this buyout in the forthcoming periods 
Also  in September 2018  the company acquired Pirate Brands  which marks its second high growth and high margin buyout that is aimed at augmenting the snacking business  Net benefits from buyouts and divestitures are expected to be 3 5 points in 2018  Clearly  such well chalked buyouts are likely to continue supporting Hershey s performance Brand Strength   InnovationHershey s five core brands   Hershey s  Reese s  Hershey s Kisses  Jolly Rancher  Brookside  Sofit and Ice Breakers   have been growing strongly on the back of advertising investments  in store merchandising  and programming and innovation  In fact  Hershey regularly brings innovation to its core brands to meet consumer demand and needs that are not addressed by its current portfolio 
In this regard  Hershey s Gold and Reese s Outrageous  which were launched in 2018  have been doing well  Further  the company is excited regarding the launch of Reese s Thins in March 2019  An important strategy of the company is to create a unique and holistic portfolio for every season  which can meet consumers  seasonal shopping needs Cost Saving Initiatives to Help Counter HurdlesHershey is on track with its Margin for Growth multi year program  Per this initiative  Hershey will reduce its global workforce outside the United States by 15   This is also intended to improve overall operating margin through supply chain optimization  a streamlined operating model and reduced administrative expenses with savings primarily being achieved in 2018 and 2019 
These moves are anticipated to boost efficiency  leverage global shared services and common processes  and increase capacity utilization  Management expects to reap savings of approximately  150  175 million from this program  Additionally  the company has undertaken strategic pricing initiatives to improve mix  which are likely to benefit performance in 2019 These efforts along with the aforementioned upsides should help Hershey tide over cost related headwinds  Incidentally  during the third quarter of 2018  adjusted gross margin shrunk 130 basis points  bps  due to escalated freight and logistics expenses along with greater trade and packaging investments 
Prior to this  in the second and first quarters of 2018  adjusted gross margin declined 260 bps each  Persistence of such pressures is a threat to the company s profitability  Also  the company has low international presence in comparison to various other players  Nevertheless  Hershey is accelerating its business in key markets like China  India  Brazil and Mexico where consumer spending growth is positive All said  we expect these drivers to help Hershey continue with its growth story Don t Miss These Solid Food StocksChefs  Warehouse   NASDAQ CHEF    with long term earnings per share growth rate of 19   carries a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see McCormick   Company  Incorporated   NYSE MKC   has long term earnings per share growth rate of 9  and a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  Lamb Weston   NYSE LW    with a Zacks Rank  2  has long term earnings per share growth rate of 11  Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana Ignited by new referendums and legislation  this industry is expected to blast from an already robust  6 7 billion to  20 2 billion in 2021  Early investors stand to make a killing  but you have to be ready to act and know just where to look ",2018-11-26,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/hershey-gains-on-buyouts--innovation-cost-inflation-a-worry-200362475,200362475
13328,234843,HSY,5 Stocks With Solid Sales Growth To Buy Amid High Volatility,opinion,There is an age old Wall Street saying  uncertainty is the enemy of investors   Therefore  selecting stocks based on key fundamentals is always prudent  Conventional strategies are not only safe  but are also worthwhile in the present volatile and uncertain market conditions  One such strategy is to focus on sales growth A healthy business with stable sales growth is vital for survival in today s fast changing and highly competitive operating environment  Hence  superior revenues are required to drive growth  and most companies look for a strong relationship between sales growth levels and the value of an enterprise Revenues are income generated by a company through business activities  Though a company might not be profitable over a particular time period  it usually generates revenues  So  in cases when companies tend to incur a loss temporarily  they are valued on the basis of revenues  This is because sales growth  or decline  is usually an early indicator of the company s future earnings performance While sales growth is an important metric for any corporate for the purpose of growth projections and strategic decision making  this in isolation doesn t indicate too much about a company s future financial performance  Though it provides investors an insight into product demand and pricing power  a huge sales number does not necessarily convert into profits Hence  a consideration of a company s cash position along with its sales number can be a more dependable strategy  Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and further potential investments  Also  an adequate cash position suggests that revenues are being channelized in the right direction Choosing the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance  we have selected 5 Year Historical Sales Growth     greater than X Industry and Cash Flow more than  500 million as our main screening parameters But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks  So  we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy Price to Sales  P S  Ratio less than X Industry  This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company s revenues  The lower the ratio  the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales   Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions  four weeks  greater than X Industry  Estimate revisions  better than the industry  are often seen to trigger an increase in stock price Operating Margin  average last five years  greater than 5   Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company s sales translates into profits  A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs   an optimal situation for it Return on Equity  ROE  greater than 5   This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash  A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment  You

1  Google on tap as S P companies continue to roll out earnings
The second quarter earnings season continues in full swing on Thursday with a slew of reports 
The reporting season thus far has been better than expected in general with experts easing forecasts on the drop in earnings for S P 500 companies to just 3 0   compared to the 4 7  decline expected ahead of the season  according to Thomson Reuters 
For Thursday s session  the principal focus will be after the close with numbers from Google s parent company Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL  or Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN

2  Fed rate hike back off the table for 2016
Fed fund futures have taken a rate hike back off the table for this year after the Federal Reserve  Fed  made no changes to monetary policy on Wednesday 
In its monthly policy statement  the Fed said that  near term risks to the economic outlook have diminished  and that the labor market has  strengthened  
Yet experts suggested that markets had been looking for a stronger hint for a possible move in September and instead the U S  central bank said  only what it had to say  
The odds on a move in December dropped below the 50  threshold  according to Fed fund futures  only passing that mark now for the March 15  2017 decision  According to CME Group s FedWatch tool  the probability of a hike in September eased to 18  from the prior day s 19 5  
3  Gold spikes 1  to hit 2 week highs
The lack of a signal from the Fed on any move in September spiked the price of gold more than 1  higher on Thursday 
The yellow metal is sensitive to moves in U S  interest rates  A gradual path to higher rates is seen as less of a threat to gold prices than a swift series of increases 
Dollar weakness also benefitted gold on Thursday as the U S  dollar index  which measures the greenback s strength against a trade weighted basket of six major currencies  traded lower 
4  BoJ under pressure to ease monetary policy
Nerves were on edge ahead of the Bank of Japan s  BoJ  monetary policy meeting with the decision to be released after the U S  market close 
Referring to the recent announcement of a 28 trillion yen   267 billion  stimulus package on Wednesday by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe  the country s minister of economy Nobuteru Ishihara stated that the BoJ would take it into account  make an appropriate decision  
However  some observers suggested that Abe s package was watered down with only 7 trillion yen in direct fiscal spending and that the BoJ would be hesitant to act with further asset purchases due to rising risks 
5  Global stocks mixed post Fed and ahead of BoJ
Asian stocks were mostly lower on Thursday despite a more positive outlook from the Fed on the American economy as investors worried that the BoJ may not ease monetary policy as much as hoped 
European stock markets were also mostly lower on Thursday while digesting the Fed statement and a slew of earnings reports 
U S  futures however pointed to a slightly higher open on Thursday after Friday s mixed close as the S P showed hesitation within less than 10 points of all time highs  At 9 53AM GMT  or 5 53AM ET  the blue chip Dow futures gained 27 points  or 0 15   S P 500 futures rose 4 points  or 0 17   and the Nasdaq 100 futures traded up 5 points  or 0 11  ",2016-07-28,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/top-5-things-to-know-in-the-market-on-thursday-417089,417089

 Groupon Inc   NASDAQ GRPN  spiked nearly 24  following the company s better than expected second quarter earnings release 
 GoPro Inc   NASDAQ GPRO  gained almost 2  after the camera maker said quarterly revenue plunged 47 4   but still beat analysts  estimates 
On the downside  Whole Foods Market  NASDAQ WFM  dropped 5  after the organic food retailer posted weaker than expected second quarter revenue and same store sales 
U S  listed shares of Royal Dutch Shell  NYSE RDSb  lost nearly 5  after the oil producer reported a more than 70  fall in quarterly profit  well below analyst estimates 
The second quarter earnings season continues in full swing on Thursday  with pharma  consumer products  big oil  financials and autos all reporting throughout the day 
Ford  NYSE F   Mastercard  NYSE MA   Colgate Palmolive  NYSE CL   Bristol Myers Squibb  NYSE BMY   Celgene  NASDAQ CELG   Hershey  NYSE HSY   ConocoPhillips  NYSE COP  and TransCanada  TO TRP  are among those reporting ahead of the opening bell

Meanwhile  the Fed left interest rates unchanged on Wednesday and said near term risks to the U S  economic outlook had diminished  However  the central bank stopped short of signaling a near term rate rise

There is little economic data on Thursday  with most of the focus on weekly jobless claims figures at 12 30GMT  or 8 30AM ET 
With the Fed meeting over  attention now turns to the Bank of Japan  which begins its two day policy meeting on Thursday 
Political pressure is mounting on the BOJ to expand stimulus  with the economy minister calling on the central bank to work with the government to boost growth 
But some in the nine member board feel the central bank has done enough for now and thus are expected to dissent to any proposal for expanding monetary stimulus  according to a report in influential Japanese business daily Nikkei 
In Europe  stock markets were mostly lower in choppy trade  as market players digested the Fed statement and a slew of earnings reports

13341,234856,HSY,Hershey Trust reaches in principle reform agreement,news,"By Lauren Hirsch and Greg Roumeliotis
 Reuters    The board of the charitable trust that controls  Hershey Co   N HSY  said on Friday it had reached an in principle agreement with the Pennsylvania Attorney General s office that would avoid a legal row in exchange for reforms in how it is run 
The settlement could provide stability to the trust following months of infighting and confrontation with the attorney general s office  It could also offer the clarity needed for  Mondelez International Inc   O MDLZ  to make a new approach to acquire Hershey 
The  12 billion trust  set up by company founder Milton Hershey over a century ago to fund and run a school for underprivileged children  must approve any sale of the company  It rejected a  23 billion cash and stock offer for Hershey by Mondelez  the maker of Oreo and Cadbury chocolate  last month 
The Pennsylvania Attorney General s office  the trust s sole overseer  had threatened legal action to remove trustees unless a settlement over its governance was reached by the end of July 
 We have reached an agreement in principle and are working on the final details in productive discussions with the Office of the Attorney General   Kent Jarrell  a spokesman for the trust s board  said 
 Yesterday  I met with board members and a lawyer for the Trust  along with our people  and I agreed on behalf of the Attorney General in principle to a series of changes that the Trust would implement   said First Deputy Attorney General Bruce L  Castor Jr   When that is reduced to writing  and if it is signed by us and them  Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen Kane will make the terms public  
The agreement will impose 10 year term limits on trustees  according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified because the settlement s details have not been announced  Three trustees   Joseph Senser  Robert Cavanaugh and James Nevels   will have to step down by the end of the year  the people said  Senser and Cavanaugh had been trustees since 2001  while Nevels has been a trustee since 2007 
Hershey Trust board Chairwoman Velma Redmond  who joined the trust in 2003  will stay on to ensure continuity  but will step down by the end of 2017  along with James Mead  a trustee since 2007  the sources added  Mead  Nevels and Cavanaugh are the trust s three representatives on Hershey s board of directors 
Caps on trustees  compensation are also part of the settlement  though these exclude salaries of trustees at Hershey and other affiliates  the people said  The Pennsylvania Attorney General s office will also be given a 30 day window to object to new trustees  the people added 
The agreement is unlikely to please many Milton Hershey School alumni that had been calling for deeper reforms  said Ric Fouad  a prominent alumnus and a board member for Protect the Hersheys  Children  an organization that calls for significant changes at the trust 
 They have squandered the ability to get reforms  A broken oversight office can t fix a broken charity   said Fouad  referring to the fact that Attorney General Kathleen Kane has had her legal license revoked and will not be seeking re election in November 
TURMOIL
The trust has been rocked by internal dissent and turnover since it last reached a reform agreement with the attorney general s office in 2013  Trustee Joan Steel resigned earlier this month  following the departures of Richard Zilmer  John Fry and Stephanie Bell Rose over the past year 
The trust normally has 10 board members 
Cavanaugh was the subject of an internal conflict of interest investigation stemming from his role in helping secure a summer internship for his son at one of the trust s investment management firms  Cavanaugh  appointed to the board in 2001  was the trust s chairman at the time 
This year  the trust fired its executive vice president  after he pleaded guilty to wire fraud associated with campaign contributions  It also fired its chief compliance officer  after placing him on leave  when a letter he wrote detailing the trust s bitter feuds leaked to the public 
Stability at the trust could make it more open to reviewing its ownership of Hershey  The trust owns close to a third of Hershey  but the company accounts for more than two thirds of its investment holdings 
In 2002  the trust cited the need for diversification as a reason of putting Hershey up for sale  Hershey then attracted a  12 5 billion offer by chewing gum maker Wm  Wrigley Jr  Co  However  the deal was abandoned after Pennsylvania s Attorney General successfully petitioned a court to block the offer amid opposition from the local community 
 This portfolio that is meant to rescue needy children is being exposed to needless risk that could be diversified away without compromising expected return   said Robert Sitkoff  a Harvard Law School professor specializing in wills  trusts  estates  and fiduciary administration

13352,234867,HSY,Cocoa Market Shift Afflicts Bulls  Relieves Candy Makers,opinion,"It was the best performing commodity in the first quarter  Now  cocoa might be lucky to remain in the tenth spot the rest of the year after weaker grinding results and confectionery demand cost it its biggest tumble since 2011  suggesting no imminent price hikes  at least in Hershey  NYSE HSY  s products 
 The selling over the last couple of weeks has been dramatic   Jack Scoville at Chicago s Price Futures Group wrote ahead of the market s open on Wednesday  stressing  the need for a corrective rally  

Cocoa futures did rise in the previous session  settling up 0 5  in New York  Scoville s argument for a bounce came after the market s 14  drop in July  its most since a 20  plunge in November 2011 
Thanks to a first quarter gain of 32   the raw material for beverages and candy remains up 10  on the year  But compared to its top ranking for commodity returns in the first quarter  cocoa was now at the ninth spot  a Barchart analysis showed 
After cocoa s runaway first quarter rally  Hershey reported that higher shipping and commodities costs would shave 1 25  from its profit margins compared with last year  But by the second quarter  the giant confectioner said commodity inflation was  not a huge driver  anymore for costs 
Bearish Trend Extends
The market has also extended its bearish trend from July  sliding in four out of the six sessions so far for August 
And while the current month to date loss was only 0 5   technical charts indicate things could get worse for cocoa before they get better 
Investing com s daily technicals maintain a  Strong Sell  on New York cocoa s front month contract for September  after the Wednesday intraday peak of  2 185 a tonne remained well short of the 200 day moving average of  2 295 12 
Fibonacci patterns  meanwhile  signal strong resistance at around  2 183  explaining September cocoa s retracement after it crossed that threshold by  2  Strong support was only expected at around  2 129  meaning it could drop another  18 from its last settlement of  2 146  The current front month is also about  300 off from the 19 month high of  2 447 50 set by US cocoa in May 
 The market s turned spectacularly  in a way only cocoa can   observed James Cordier  broker and analyst at Optionsellers com in Tampa  Florida 
 Like practically all cocoa rallies  the move up was overdone  speculative in nature and headline driven  Now cocoa is probably trading closer to fair value  as a matter of fact  it s probably a  100 below fair value  But trend following speculators continue to punish the market  selling it regardless what the fundamentals are   Cordier added 
Sellers Ignore Fundamentals
Fundamentally  first half grind results in Europe and Asia should hold cocoa prices in good stead due to the higher cocoa powder and butter volumes they ve produced  While cocoa powder goes into making almost every confection from chocolate to icecream  the butter  vegetable fat obtained from the grinding  is what gives them their smooth taste and velvety texture  Unlike other commodities that get depressed by higher supplies  the more beans are ground  the higher the prices cocoa fetch  European grinds increased by about 6  in the first half of 2018 versus the same period a year ago  In Asia  they rose about 10  
But North American grinds by companies including Hershey  Mars  Barry Callebaut  SIX BARN   Ghirardelli  Nestle  SIX NESN   ECOM and Cargill  were down about 2  compared to the first half of last year  That  and benign weather for the global cocoa crop  which translates again into more beans than the ground product  gave market bears reason to short 
 Ideas that current weather conditions are good for the next crops continue   nurturing projections of big yields  said Price Group Futures  Scoville   Showers and more seasonal temperatures have been seen in the last few weeks to improve overall production conditions in West Africa  Conditions also appear good in East Africa and Asia  
Recovery By Year End 
So  can the market recover 
 Longer term  I think the grinding numbers are going to be supportive   said Cordier of Optionsellers   And it could easily range about  100 to  200 more than where it is right now  If not now  we ll definitely see that happen in the third or fourth quarter  
ADM Investor Services seems to concur with that view  saying in a recent note that while momentum in cocoa remained bearish  the market was  now at oversold levels and will tend to support reversal action if it occurs  
Till that happens  candy makers will feel less pressure from raw material costs to alter their prices ",2018-08-09,Barani Krishnan/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cocoa-market-shift-afflicts-bulls-relieves-candy-makers-200337584,200337584
13353,234868,HSY,4 Dividend Blue Chips Everyone Owns  But Shouldn t  ,opinion,"How much money do you need to retire on dividends alone 
This is a better question to ask than the typical  magic number  formula that most  first level  thinking firms tout  Let s review why their approach is fatally flawed  so that we can derive a more reliable method of our own based in actual reality  and funded by actual dividend payments  
Fidelity Says What 
 You should aim to have 10 times your final salary in savings  
Buy why  I suppose they are claiming that  if you earned  100 000 in your final year working  that you ll want to earn this much in income every year for the rest of your life 
So  Fidelity says save a million bucks and you re in good shape 
But how exactly is  1 000 000 supposed to throw off  100 000 in excess income annually 
Fidelity Strategic Dividend   Income pays 2 45  today  Which means  if you follow their advice to a tee  and buy their flagship income fund  you are earning  24 500 per year in income from your million dollar stake 
That s a start  But where exactly is the other 75 5  of your income supposed to come from 
Fade the 4  Fallacy for a Smarter  Magic Dividend Number 
Our retirement approach is grounded in reality versus fantasy and false math  So  let s begin with the value of your actual portfolio 
Back to the  1 million example  Let s say we saved that money like Fidelity said to  and we still want  100 000 per year 
We ll ditch the flawed notion of selling capital for income  and live on dividends alone  This means our portfolio s  magic yield  is 10  annually 
So  we re faced with a decision  We can 

Settle for less income  or
Save  or make  more money 

There s actually a third  superior option   earn more yield on your money  I ll show you how to bank 6   7  and even 8  yields with less risk than buying a blue chip stock 

First let s look at four of these  flawed dividend payers  that simply don t pay enough  or have sufficient growth prospects  to belong in any retirement portfolio  If you own any of these stocks  I would recommend selling them and replacing them with the higher paying ideas we ll soon discuss 
Mondelez International Inc  NASDAQ MDLZ  Dividend Yield  2 5 
Back in September 2017  I called out global foods blue chip Mondelez  MDLZ  as one of several renowned dividend payers to sell 
And Here s What Mondelez Has Done Since Then 
If you didn t heed my advice then  here s your second chance 
Mondelez   once part of the former Kraft Foods  NASDAQ KHC    is a snacks titan whose brands include Oreo  Nabisco  Chips Ahoy   Triscuit  Ritz  Cadbury  Trident  Dentyne  Belvita and everyone s favorite space drink  Tang 
At a glance  Mondelez would seem to be doing well  Earnings are expected to grow by about 13  this year  and a decent 7  next  and MDLZ beat profit estimates in its most recent report 
Better still  Mondelez is cranking out some nice dividend hikes  including a 13  payout raise announced in July 
But if you look under the surface  the math starts to get ugly  Specifically  that dividend growth is running laps around earnings growth   it s not even close 
Mondelez s  MDLZ  Dividend Growth Isn t Sustainable 
Also  Mondelez s bottom line growth is being built on balsa wood stilts  While earnings growth projections for the next couple years are nice  revenues are projected to climb less than 2  annually this year and next 
MDLZ has traded flat for almost three years now  and while it might pick up in the short term  I have serious concerns about its ability to produce for retirement investors over the next decade plus 
Hershey Company  NYSE HSY  Dividend Yield  3 0 
Hershey  HSY  is an American classic and one of the foremost names in chocolate  Brands including its namesake chocolate  not to mention Kisses  Reese s  KitKat  York  Jolly Rancher  Twizzlers and Bubble Yum 
In fact  candy and gum is all Hershey does   and that s a problem 
The company is coming up against major headwinds here in the U S   where sugar is increasingly getting the tobacco treatment  Obesity and diabetes have exploded in American  and companies dealing heavily in sugary products are feeling the pinch  Coca Cola Company  NYSE KO  and PepsiCo Inc  NASDAQ PEP  primary products are being directly targeted by soda taxes across the nation  but health consciousness is also directing Americans away from the candy aisle 
 Chocolate confectionery  and by extension of cocoa s plight  does not look set to improve  with our forecast figures suggesting a volume decline of 1  between 2016 and 2021   says Euromonitor Ingredients Analyst John George  And the U S  market is expected to grow more slowly compared to the global market 
Hershey s top line has moved ahead  albeit at a glacial pace  and profits are actually down from where they were back in 2014  Shares have been understandably flat over that time   and that bodes poorly for HSY going forward considering top line growth is expected to slow to a mere 1 4  next year 
There s Nothing Sweet About Hershey s  HSY  Shares 
General Motors  NYSE GM  Dividend Yield  4 1 
 All indicators tell us that we have reached peak market and it won t be getting any better from here  
This statement from Cox Automotive Senior Economist Charlies Chesbrough  ironically made amid a slight upgrade to the company s expectations for 2018 auto sales  tells you much about the perils of investing in the automotive industry right now 
That even goes for General Motors  GM   the Little Value That Could   But Never Did 
Automakers have been an infuriating industry for years  sporting eye poppingly cheap prices but never really achieving their  value  potential  Consider the P Es in the space right now 

General Motors  GM   6 0
Ford  F   5 6
Toyota  TM   8 2
Honda  HMC   5 5
S P 500  24 4

This isn t some odd anomaly  P Es have been this depressed for quite some time  And the yields have only gotten plumper 
General Motors  GM   Bigger Yield  Same ol  Sluggishness 
Ford  which has been pummeled by 40  in the same time  throws off dividends like a telecom  yielding a fat 6   Even GM  which has traded flat for five years now but keeps growing its dividend  yields an ample 4  
But that s the problem  If you buy into General Motors  you re buying into a value trap   one that has dug its claws into investors for years  and is primed to continue doing so  GM is standing still in a declining industry  Wall Street expects a slight revenue decline this year and a marginal uptick in 2019  Worse  over the next two years  profits are expected to decline 8  from 2017 levels 
Give up on the GM  long game   Everybody loses 
Procter   Gamble Company  NYSE PG  Dividend Yield  3 5 
I beat up on Procter   Gamble  PG  on occasion  and that s because it truly is a dangerous blue chip stock 
I get the allure  I do  The company deals in consumer staples such as toilet paper  razors  laundry detergent and soap   products you simply need to buy no matter what the economy is doing  And it s the dominant force in so many of the fields it s in  boasting 23 billion dollar brands  most of which hold the No  1 or No  2 position in their category 
It s a juggernaut   but it s also not invincible  and the cracks in its armor are becoming increasingly more evident 
Stifel analysts warned   Overall we view the  third quarter  result as disappointing and suggestive the company continues to lose share in the majority of markets categories  with prestige beauty brand SK II accounting for the majority of growth   following the company s Q1 earnings report in April  Then in July  P G produced a revenue miss for Q2  with several of its brands   especially its Gillette razors   suffering at the hands of lower priced and generic brands  And activist Nelson Peltz  who won a seat on Procter   Gamble s board  is increasingly making headway into convincing the company to restructure 
As if that wasn t enough  the company has an Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN  problem  I ve previously written that the e tailer  which once was viewed as a potential boon for P G  is a growing threat to this consumer staples giant 
And while Procter   Gamble is indeed a Dividend Aristocrat boasting 62 consecutive annual dividend increases  that growth is slowing to a crawl  at less than 4  annually over the past half decade 
Does this sound like a  safe  retirement holding 
Without Meaningful Growth  P G Is a Gamble 
How to Earn 4x the Market s Dividends Forever
The math is pretty simple   18 000 from the S P 500 or  29 000 from  high yield  blue chips  even when combined with Social Security money  will barely be enough to cover your monthly expenses 
Low cash flow like that will force you to claw away at your nest egg year after year just to make ends meet  And every time you do that  you slash your annual income potential  which means you ll have to sell off even more the following year 
It s a vicious cycle that practically guarantees you ll outlive your money 
But  80 000 in annual income from dividends alone  That s a retirement you can look forward to   and that s the kind of retirement you ll enjoy with the picks in my  8  No Withdrawal Portfolio  
This high yield  retirement focused portfolio features a number of income dynamos that not only more than double or triple the dividends of the stocks we just discussed  but also have the potential for 25  plus upside thanks to their bargain valuations 
That extra income is vital to the quality of your retirement years  Every additional dollar in annual income is another dollar you don t have to take out of your portfolio   which means it can sit around generating dividends and growing your nest egg so it s there when you really need it 
My 8  No Withdrawal Portfolio not only includes these can t miss bargain picks  but also a few free bonus reports that include 

Preferred stocks for high income that s also safe and uncorrelated to the market

Stocks gained at the open Wednesday  thanks in large part to strong earnings results from key bellwethers  Notably  Facebook   NASDAQ FB   got some reprieve after its report on Tuesday afternoon  and General Motors   NYSE GM   posted a much needed strong quarter before the bell today 
Facebook managed to tally adjusted earnings of  1 76 per share and revenue of  13 7 billion  These results marked year over year growth of 10  and 33   respectively  That revenue figure did miss estimates  but Wall Street was impressed by Facebook s ability to grow earnings in the face of rising operating costs 
Mark Zuckerberg also spent time outlining the future of Facebook  highlighting the potential of the Stories feature in terms of new audience engagement and advertising  Zuckerberg mentioned that users like this non permanent sharing and he wants to  make sure that we  at Facebook  fully embrace this  
Elsewhere  GM posted earnings of  1 87 per share  crushing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by over 40   Revenue improved 6  year over year to  35 8 billion  despite total auto sales slumping in key markets like the U S  and China 
GM managed to offset this decline by selling more SUVs and trucks  which sell at higher price tags and are more profitable for the company  Management also said that it expects full year earnings to come in at the high end of its guidance and potentially even higher  breathing some life into the struggling stock this morning 
On other hand  cereal giant Kellogg   NYSE K   missed earnings estimates and saw its shares decline in morning trading today  Quarterly profits at the company came in at  1 06 per share  lagging the Zacks Consensus by a penny  Wall Street punished this earnings missed  even though revenue was ahead of expectations 
Ryan covers all of these headlines on the first half of today s show 
Later  he has a little Halloween fun  highlighting consumer spending trends during the holiday and investigating a few candy stocks  How much money does the average person spend on Halloween  and where do they spend it  How do analysts feel about Hershey   NYSE HSY   right now  Did everyone know Tootsie Roll   NYSE TR   was a publicly traded company 
Ryan explores all of these questions  and more  only on today s episode of Free Lunch

13363,234878,HSY,Exclusive  In your sugary shake  Mars may not be lovin  it,news,"By Chris Prentice and Lisa Baertlein NEW YORK LOS ANGELES   Mars Inc  the one time maker of king sized chocolate bars  is considering taking its M Ms out of sugary dessert treats  including McDonald s McFlurry  An industry source familiar with Mars  thinking said the company has had talks with the world s largest fast food chain and other partners about its candies  inclusion in super sugary products  The elimination of M Ms   which contain 7 5 teaspoons of sugar  about a third as much as the large McFlurry  per serving   is just one idea on the table  also under consideration with McDonald s  N MCD  and other partners  are recipe reformulations  the source said  Mars is concerned desserts that feature its candies   such as the McFlurry  Burger King s Snickers pie and Dairy Queen s Blizzard   exceed in a single serving the amount of sugar the U S  government recommends anyone eat in a day  the source said  That kind of sugar load conflicts with Mars  public stance that sweets are best enjoyed in moderation  The company has promised publicly to limit sugar in all of its products to match guidelines from the world s leading health authorities  including the World Health Organization and nutrition committees in the United States and United Kingdom  A Mars spokesman declined to discuss details of any discussions with partners  But  in a statement to Reuters  the spokesman said   We are now working alongside our suppliers and customers to bring this commitment to life   That the world s largest confectioner is fretting about the inclusion of its marquee candy in popular fast food concoctions is the latest reflection of how the sugar backlash is roiling the industry  To some  Mars  qualms miss the bigger picture   This is all junk food   said Michele Simon  public health attorney and author of  Appetite for Profit   a critique of the food industry   It s kind of silly   SUGAR STRATEGY Among candy companies  a group known for promoting super sizing rather than restraint  any move that could hurt sales stands out  Mars sells an estimated  25 billion in sweets a year  according to data firm Euromonitor International Ltd  Mars  examination of brand marriages  such as M Ms and the McFlurry  is part of an evolving strategy to shield its products from growing concerns about the health effects of sugar and address higher scrutiny from regulators and consumers  according to sources at rival companies  former employees and industry experts  As a private company  Mars has had more leeway to make riskier moves than competitors  such as  Hershey Co   N HSY  or Mondelez International  O MDLZ   and it has been ahead on issues  such as sustainability  those sources said  In 2008  Mars was the first confectionary company in the United States to list calories and sugar on the front of chocolate bars and other products  Competitors  initially baffled  later followed suit   In 2013  Mars stopped selling king sized candy bars and limited candy packages to 250 calories per serving  And earlier this year  Mars advised customers to eat its most indulgent Dolmio pasta sauces and macaroni and cheese no more than once a week because of their high levels of salt  sugar and fat  The company spokesman said Mars was promoting transparency and factual labeling  so that customers can enjoy its chocolate and confections as  occasional treats  in a balanced diet  When Robin Schepper ran Michelle Obama s  Let s Move   campaign aimed at improving children s health  she said Mars executives were very interested  wanting to know   What did the Administration want  What did the first lady care about   Their strategy of early engagement was unusual among food companies  Schepper recalled   They were doing the research to take it into consideration for their business planning   Mars has made what Marion Nestle  professor of Nutrition  Food Studies  and Public Health at New York University  described as  significant steps    They must think it s to their marketing advantage   she added  The private U S  company does not disclose detailed financial results  so the bottom line impact of its decisions is unknown  SWEET BITE Candy has gotten something of a pass in the war on sugar as health advocates focused on  hidden  sugar in beverages and food  such as pasta sauce and salad dressing   The National Confectioners Association said chocolate  candy  gum and mints account for less than 2 percent of the average American s overall caloric intake  But U S  guidelines adopted in January amid a growing body of evidence linking sugar to obesity and diabetes could put the bite on sweets  The new guidelines recommend added sugars be less than 10 percent of caloric intake  which works out to about 12 5 teaspoons of sugar per day in a 2 000 calorie diet  Last month  the U S  government required packaged food makers to begin disclosing the amount of added sugar in products   a change Mars publicly supported  Restaurants are not subject to the disclosure rule  But industry experts said Mars  conversations with McDonald s could prompt the fast food chain to voluntarily list the amount of added sugar in the McFlurry and other products  It s better to  err on the safe side so the food police don t get to them   said Bob Goldin  who leads the food industry consulting and research group at Technomic  Representatives from McDonald s and Burger King  TO QSR  declined to comment   
A spokesman for American Dairy Queen Corp said the company has not had discussions with Mars on the topic  but it anticipated having them with the confectioner and other suppliers in the near future  Dairy Queen is in constant conversations with its vendors and partners on a variety of topics  he added ",2016-06-15,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusive:-m-amp;m-maker-may-shake-up-mcflurry,-blizzard,-snickers-pie-408505",408505

reduce global workforce outside the United States by 15   The program is intended to improve overall operating margin through supply chain optimization  a streamlined operating model and reduced administrative expenses  Savings from the Margin for Growth program are estimated in the range of  55  65 million in 2018 Also  under its continuous improvement and productivity  CIP  program  management has optimized its North American manufacturing footprint  added manufacturing capabilities in international markets  increased supply chain productivity and improved the sales mix significantly  The productivity and cost savings from these efforts are being invested in brand building as well as to support growth and gain marketplace insights  which in turn are boosting the

Products like Cookie Layer Crunch  Popped Snack Mix and Chocolate Dipped Pretzels have significantly contributed to the company s growth in 2017  The trend is likely to continue in the to be reported quarter  The launch of Hershey s Gold in an instant consumable pack type is expected to contribute to revenue growth in the first quarter Meanwhile  the implementation of Margin for Growth program in China is driving majority of the improvement  However  China SKU analysis and optimization efforts have dented gross sales volume in 2017 and will persist in 2018 Packaging  Freight   Logistics Costs to Hurt MarginsThe introduction of innovative products is not enough to offset sluggish sales performance  Packaging and marketing initiatives are also required to ensure strong customer outreach  The company is transitioning from lay down bags to stand up pouches on core chocolate candy products  These ensure that products get on the shelf quicker with less in store labor and improve shopping experience  These packaging initiatives along with higher freight and logistics cost hurt margins adversely and affect gross margin Nevertheless  Hershey s productivity and cost saving initiatives is likely to offset higher costs  Overall  Hershey s bottom line is likely to increase 7 6  to  1 06 in the first quarter of 2018 Here is what our quantitative model predicts Hershey has the right

13368,234883,HSY,Trump Tariffs Put These Sector ETFs   Stocks In Focus,opinion,"Trump s announcement that the United States will impose a 25  tariff on steel imports and a 10  tariff on aluminum imports has become the latest cause of concern for the U S  economy and Wall Street  The tariffs are likely to result in an increase in raw material cost for manufacturers that use these metals 
Against this backdrop  with the help of  on npr org  we highlight some sectors that could be impacted the most from the tariffs  read    
Auto
Both steel and aluminum are vital to the production of cars and trucks sold in America and would push up the sale prices of those vehicles considerably  The American Automotive Policy Council believes that the change would put the U S  auto industry at a    
However  the price hike won t be the same for all  CNBC reported that General Motors   NYSE GM   sees only a modest impact because it buys 90  of  steel for U S  production from U S  suppliers   On the other hand  Honda Motor Co   NYSE HMC   said that  imprudent tariffs imposed on imported steel and aluminum would raise prices on both domestic and imported products  thus causing an unnecessary financial burden on customers  
In this situation  First Trust NASDAQ Global Auto Index Fund  should be monitored closely  However  since the fund invests only 19 67  in the United States  severe threat to the product is unexpected  read    
Alternative Energy
Solar projects  wind turbines and energy storage units are also likely to be pricier  The tariff could result in a hike in the cost of offshore platforms and pipelines  In any case  the Trump administration s  and modules was put into effect this year  read    
Now with extra price increases on steel and aluminum   which are used in  racking systems   the sector could be hit hard  Alternative ETFs including Guggenheim Solar ETF   LON TAN   and First Trust ISE Global Wind Energy Index Fund   LON FAN   should thus be followed with extra caution  read    
Aerospace
U S  aerospace industry thrives on steel and aluminum imports to construct aircraft  About  of an aircraft is made of aluminum  Companies like Boeing Company   NYSE BA    Lockheed Martin   NYSE LMT   and Northrop Grumman   NYSE NOC   may come under pressure  Aerospace and defense ETFs like iShares U S  Aerospace   Defense ETF   HM ITA   and SPDR S P Aerospace   Defense  NYSE XAR  ETF   LON XAR   may also feel the pinch 
Candy
Aluminum foils are used to wrap chocolates  So  the tariff could lead to high costs for Hershey Company  NYSE HSY   and Mondelez International Inc  NASDAQ MDLZ      Such a broad and sweeping order could have a negative impact on the entire U S  economy  potentially costing U S  jobs and ultimately  hurting American consumers through higher prices for everyday products   according to the Hershey spokesman  as quoted on npr org 
Beer
Last but not the least  how can investors forget the beer industry   to make beer cans  Companies like Molson Coors Brewing Company   NYSE TAP    Anheuser Busch Inbev SA   NYSE BUD    Constellation Brands Inc   NYSE STZ   and Diageo  LON DGE  Plc   NYSE DEO   may face the rising cost issue  At the same time  the announcement puts Spirited Funds ETFMG Whiskey   Spirits ETF  in focus 
Consumer
Along with most market watchers  we too believe that companies will try to pass on some cost escalation to consumers  As a result  consumer ETFs like iShares U S  Consumer Services ETF  may get slightly hurt

13370,234885,HSY,Can Improved Sales Aid Procter   Gamble  PG  In Q3 Earnings ,opinion,The Procter   Gamble Company   NYSE PG   is set to report third quarter fiscal 2018 results on Apr 20  before market opens  Last quarter  the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3 48  In fact  this consumer goods company delivered a positive earnings surprise in each of the trailing four quarters  the average beat being 4 11  Factors to ConsiderWeak volumes and slowing market share growth have been hurting sales of Procter   Gamble for quite some time  However  the company has been witnessing improved sales environment and thereby earnings in the recent times  thanks to higher volumes driven by innovation  proficient distribution  and in store activity In the last reported quarter  sales grew 3   increasing in 14 of the 15 largest markets and 8 out of 10 categories  Overall organic sales were up 2  comprising 2  volume growth  Market share trends are improving modestly  with Procter   Gamble holding or growing shares in 27 50 top category country combinations  versus 22 last year   In fact  the company s sales grew 2  in the first six months driven by 2  volume growth We expect this improving sales trend to follow in the to be reported quarter as well  driven by growth in key markets  product categories  as well as e commerce and in store operations  Notably  the company s premium offerings like Olay have been registering solid growth in China  In the fiscal second quarter  Olay in China achieved its third consecutive quarter of double digit growth That said  various top line headwinds continue to persist  Overall  the soft category growth rate in developed countries and higher competition in the United States from brands like Dollar Shave Club and Harry s Razor in the male grooming category are likely to hurt the company s razors and blades  sales  Again  challenges in the baby care category  lower pricing owing to increased competition in the shave care category and higher commodity costs are added woes  Meanwhile  the Algerian government s import ban on finished products and lower subsidies in Saudi Arabia are added concerns Despite the above mentioned headwinds  Procter   Gamble reiterated its fiscal 2018 sales projection  The company expects organic sales growth in the range of 2 3  for fiscal 2018  All in sales growth is expected about 3  Overall  for the fiscal third quarter  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at  16 2 billion  reflecting year over year growth of 3 5  Apart from the sales improvement  let s take a look at the company s margin story  Despite muted sales growth  the company has exceeded analysts  expectations on earnings for the 11th consecutive quarter  Procter   Gamble has managed to post higher earnings despite tepid sales owing to productivity and cost saving plans in order to boost margins  thereby lifting profit level However  the company failed to expand margins in the last three reported quarters  as productivity savings were more than offset by headwinds such as increased commodity costs  unfavorable geographic and product mix  and product reinvestments  Then again  the company s focus on reducing its SG A  selling  general  and administrative  costs  and lowering its marketing and advertising spending has helped it in supporting its operating margins to some extent  The trend is unlikely to change in the to be reported quarter as well Overall  for the quarter to be reported  the company s margins are likely to remain subdued due to higher input costs  The company expects higher commodity costs including pulp  kerosene  ethylene and propylene to adversely impact its profitability by  300 million in fiscal 2018 Again  unfavorable mix and lower pricing in the shave care category are likely to impact margins further  Procter   Gamble s investing in price to drive sales of its razors and blades  due to increased competition from shave clubs  have affected its market share  Yet  productivity savings and share repurchases will partly offset these woes For the fiscal third quarter  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 98 cents  reflecting growth of 2 1  year over year Here is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts Procter   Gamble does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients   a positive  and a Zacks

bell  Last quarter  the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2 63  In fact  this beverage giant delivered a positive earnings surprise in three of the trailing four quarters  with the average beat being 1 48  A Look at Coca Cola s Revenue PerformanceCoca Cola has been struggling to boost sales amid weak demand in certain emerging and developing markets  and shifting consumer preferences  The company has been witnessing a decline in revenues for the last 11 quarters  primarily due to weak volumes especially in the sparkling beverage category  and structural changes Last quarter  Coca Cola s revenues declined 20  year over year due to the negative impact of structural items  Acquisitions divestitures and structural items had a 26  impact on revenues  This time again  the company expects the same degree of adverse impact on net revenues from acquisitions  divestitures and other structural items  Moreover  the first quarter will have one less day than the same period last year  However  the company expects currency to have a positive impact on quarterly net revenues by 2   Again  revenues will be positively impacted by 1  from Accounting Standards Update 2014 09 That said  the company s organic revenues grew across the board in the last reported quarter  Coca Cola has been firing on all cylinders to rejuvenate its portfolio  It has ramped up its efforts to transform into a total beverage company with a broad  consumer centric brand portfolio and an asset light business model  Coca Cola is pursuing investments in newer revenue platforms to boost long term sales and profits Coca Cola witnessed solid growth in the preceding quarter in its developed markets  mainly in Europe and North America  buoyed by improving execution in recently refranchised territories  higher pricing  improved product innovations and packaging strategies  Although other emerging markets were more challenging in the first half of 2017  the company saw an

sequentially but 9 4  growth year over year  On the other hand  the consensus estimate for Europe  Middle East and Africa segment revenues of  1 73 billion indicates a decrease from  1 75 billion in the last quarter but an increase from  1 63 billion a year ago  Bottling Investments revenues are likely to decrease to  1 1 billion from  3 9 billion a year ago and  1 1 billion last quarter  Again  Asia Pacific revenues are expected to increase 0 1  on a year over year basis and 17 3  sequentially Cost Savings to Drive GrowthThe cola giant has been focusing on increasing efficiency and improving its margins amid tough business conditions  To that end  Coca Cola s strategy to refranchise its bottling operations facilitated improved margins by reducing its exposure to the capital intensive

performance  the company s total organic revenue growth was modest at 2 3   driven by 2  pricing on 2  volume growth in food snacks  offset by a 2  volume decline in beverages  However  its total revenues remained unchanged from the year ago level Notably  results of North America Beverages  NAB  segment   comprising beverage businesses in the United States and Canada   remained soft in Q4  The company s NAB segment was negatively impacted by higher input costs  operating cost inflation and restructuring charges that substantially offset productivity gains  Moreover  the 53rd reporting

PepsiCo s First Quarter Performance Coming to the company s margins  PepsiCo had earlier indicated that as commodity inflation is expected to continue in 2018  the company s gross margin might face

needs   HOOPS AND HURDLES For the small food players  that makes getting the right placement on shelves critical  Steve Hersh  co founder of Utmost Brands Inc  started selling the company s GuS Grown Up Soda to retailers out of his Subaru in 2003  A year later  single bottles of GuS were lost among other options in the aisles of Stop   Shop Supermarket Company LLC  which eventually stopped offering the product  GuS contains less sugar than the average soda and is marketed to adults  Retailers are now catching on to its appeal and giving it prime placement    Now you go to a Wegmans or Food Emporium  you re going to see our four packs on a four foot  wide  shelf  and you re going to go   oh  that s a brand   rather than three little bottles in a sea of soda   Hersh said   Finding the right distributor can also help small players build scale  Months after GuS launched  Hersh was contacted by Big Geyser  a major beverage distributor in New York that helped get the soda into Whole Foods and Fairway    Food makers may still have to jump through hoops to satisfy retailers  One hurdle is the fees that major stores charge food makers to gain shelf space  which can run into the hundreds of thousands of dollars   Retailers may waive such fees depending on the number of options in the category and the ability of a novel brand to draw shoppers  But they may also make companies change the packaging of the product  a potentially costly move   For instance  nutrition bar company Mediterra Inc received interest from Target Corp  N TGT  to join a trial run of new brands in its stores   Target asked for the bars to be sold in a five pack that Mediterra didn t offer  The company designed the new packs with the help of its contract manufacturer and produced them in about 45 days  said Paul Pruett  Mediterra s CEO   The trial at Target concluded in April  and the product is no longer on the shelves  It did  though  raise the brand s profile  and the bars will

13394,234909,HSY,The Big Money Behind The Winter Olympics In Pyeongchang,opinion,"Welcome to a Winter Olympics edition of the Full Court Finance podcast from Zacks Investment Research  On this week s episode  we explore the companies driving the 2018 Games in Pyeongchang  South Korea 
The next two weeks are massively important for NBC Universal and its parent company Comcast   NASDAQ CMCSA    as the media conglomerate has spent billions of dollars to broadcast the Olympics for years to come 
NBC outbid Fox   NASDAQ FOXA   and Disney s   NYSE DIS   ABC and ESPN to earn its domestic broadcast rights  The company has since sought to innovate its coverage through a recent streaming push and future looking partnerships with firms such as Snap Inc   NYSE SNAP  
One of the main reasons NBC can justify spending this money is because advertisers are willing to shell out the cash to promote their brands during the global athletic showcase  This year  Google   NASDAQ GOOGL    Famers Insurance  Hershey   NYSE HSY    and many others are official NBC partners 
But there are also 13 top dogs  the firms that spend over  100 million to become official International Olympic Committee sponsors  This list includes Visa   NYSE V    Coca Cola   NYSE KO    Procter   Gamble   NYSE PG    and General Electric   NYSE GE    along with recently added tech giants Alibaba   NYSE BABA   and Intel   NASDAQ INTC   which will give fans a taste of its virtual reality capabilities from Pyeongchang 
The Olympics are also a time for companies and apparel brands to attach themselves to athletes  Ralph Lauren   NYSE RL   outfitted Team USA with gear for the opening ceremonies  while medal winners will sport Nike   NYSE NKE   on the podiums  Even Under Armour   NYSE UAA   got back in the action after some athletes panned its gear in 2014 
And this year s games were awarded to South Korea  due in large part to a push from the former head of one of the world s most well known technology companies  Make sure to check out the show to hear more

13395,234910,HSY,Will Weak Sales Hurt Hershey  HSY  This Earnings Season ,opinion,The Hershey Company   NYSE HSY   is slated to report fourth quarter 2017 results on Feb 1  before the opening bell We expect the top line to remain subdued in the to be reported quarter  as has been the case for quite some time now owing to changes in consumer preference in North America and soft international sales Food companies are suffering as the North American food industry is experiencing changes in consumer preference  shift toward products with less artificial sweeteners  sodium and saturated fat   consumer dynamics  such as increased demand for portable and on the go products  and increased demand for lower priced products  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for North America segment revenues  comprising 89  of total revenues  is pegged at  1 67 billion  reflecting a decline of 1  year over year in the fourth quarter To add to the woes  Hershey has been witnessing weakness in international markets since 2015  International sales declined 14   including acquisitions divestures and currency headwinds  in 2015 and 0 5  in 2016  primarily due to weakness in China  Again  in the first nine months of 2017  sales increased a meager 0 3  year over year  The trend is expected to continue in the fourth quarter as well  International and Other segment is likely to witness 1 4  increase in sales  per the consensus estimate Overall  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter revenues stands at  1 98 billion  implying 0 3  year over year growth Let as delve deeper into other factors that are likely to impact Hershey s Q4 performance To combat weak sales  Hershey regularly innovates core brands to meet consumer demand and needs that are not addressed by its current portfolio  In the fourth quarter  the company launched Hershey s Gold and Cookie Layer Crunch Triple Chocolate  However  sales of these products are not expected to be as great as the Cookie Layer Crunch sale in the prior year quarter In the fourth quarter  the company had plans of introducing retail ready packaging at select outlets  This initiative enables products to get on the shelf quicker  with less in store labor and also improves the shopping experience in the aisle  Also  Hershey is transitioning the packaging of its core chocolate products  Though these initiatives will improve shelf presence and visibility over the long haul  it is expected to affect fourth quarter gross margin Moreover  higher advertising expenses in China and the United States related to product innovation are expected to impact results in the to be reported quarter  Again  supply chain costs that dented third quarter operating profits are expected to remain an overhang in the fourth quarter as well Overall  Hershey s bottom line is likely to decline 9 4  to  1 06 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017  Last quarter  the company s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 9   The company surpassed the consensus mark in all of the last four quarters  resulting in an average earnings beat of 9  On the bright side  we are encouraged by Hershey s productivity improvement and cost saving initiatives  The company expects  25 million in savings from the Margin for Growth program  As part of this multi year program  it will reduce its global workforce outside the United States by 15   This program is intended to improve overall operating margin through supply chain optimization  a streamlined operating model and reduced administrative expenses International and Other segment s operating income increased substantially in the third quarter on the implementation of the Margin for Growth program and the favorable timing of select investments and expenses  The trend is expected to reflect in the fourth quarter results as well Quantitative Model PredictionHere is what our quantitative model predicts Hershey has the right combination of the two key ingredients   a positive  and Zacks Rank  3

13398,234913,HSY,Watch This Stock On Valentine s Day,opinion,"The Hershey Company  NYSE HSY   a chocolatier in Pennsylvania probably loves Valentine s Day more than anyone else  For Hershey  increasing demand for its chocolates this time of year is a big part of its business model  Hershey devotes an entire part of its website to Valentine s Day  where it advertises many different types of special products such as personalized labels and heart shaped chocolate boxes 
Famous investor Warren Buffett said one of the secret formulas to a successful business is to  buy commodities and sell brands   That is exactly what Hershey is doing  It purchases sugar  milk  cocoa  etc  and sells products that have major brand recognition  About half of the chocolate consumed in America is milk chocolate  and that is what Hershey is known for  If someone goes into a candy store to buy a Hershey chocolate bar and the store owner says  sorry  we don t have Hershey  but we have this other generic brand that is 20  cheaper   then the customer will probably leave and try to find another store to get his Hershey fix  That is the power of brand loyalty  It automatically puts a 20  value premium over other businesses offering the same food  Check out some of the awesome brands Hershey is responsible for 
Hershey s global reach is surprisingly wide and Forbes has ranked the Hershey brand 5th overall  Hershey is America s largest chocolate producer with 43  of the U S  chocolate market  It sells products in over 2 million retail outlets in 50 different countries under 60 brand names and growing  Most of its sales come from the U S 
One of the metrics I use when analyzing a stock is its earnings growth and sales growth  in other words  the bottom line and revenue trends  So let s take a look at its financials  Revenue   total sales  Earnings   after tax profit 

The revenue seems to have stopped expanding  but at least it s stable  The current EPS of Hershey is about  3 5  The stock is trading at roughly  100 today  If we divide the stock price by the EPS we get the P E ratio of 28 5 times  The lower this number is the more undervalued the stock is  Let s see if Valentine s day can boost up the price of this stock 
Another factor I look at is how many institutional investors have stakes in the investment  For Hershey about 77  of the shares are held by pension funds  sovereign wealth funds  and other large institutions so I m more confident in holding HSY for a long time 
The final variable I look at is the analyst s recommendations  According to Thomson Reuters there are 15 stock analysts who have opinions about HSY  Most of them give Hershey a  hold  rating  but there are a few positive sentiments as well  Ideally I would have liked to see more optimism from analysts on HSY  At the moment it appears Wall St  doesn t see a lot of future growth with HSY  but at least there is no  sell  recommendation  Other than this neutral outlook  I still believe Hershey is a good stock to buy and hold because of the other positive signals I ve mentioned 
Hershey also has a large charity network  Its founder   Milton Hershey  created the Milton Hershey School in 1909 and since then the company has focused on giving underserved children the skills and support they need to be successful  Today  the company continues this social purpose through  Nourishing Minds   a global initiative that provides basic nutrition to help children learn and grow  From neighborhoods across the United States to the streets of Shanghai and Mumbai and villages of West Africa  our goal is to nourish one million minds by 2020

13405,234920,HSY,Lindt s Acquisition Of Russell Stover  Wise Or Disastrous  Experts Say,news,"By    The hierarchy of the confectionery world shifted this week with the announcement that Swiss chocolate maker Chocoladefabriken Lindt   Spr ngli will acquire the Kansas City based chocolatier Russell Stover Candies 
By adding the privately held Russell Stover to its growing holdings  which already include the San Francisco based mainstay Ghirardelli Chocolate Company  Lindt  will become the third largest chocolate maker in the United States 
The move  which Lindt announced on Monday  will give the company greater access to the vast American chocolate market  as Russell Stover is the country s largest boxed chocolate manufacturer  with numerous popular products including the Whitman s Sampler  famously featured in the film  Forrest Gump  
Russell Stover had revenue of about  500 million last year  and its acquisition will bring Lindt s annual North America revenue to  1 5 billion in 2015  according to Lindt  which reported revenue of about  3 2 billion last year 
But some experts and observers say the move is not necessarily a savvy one for Lindt  given current trends within the chocolate industry 
Lindt s announcement comes amid a recent rise in cocoa  dairy and nut prices  as well as transportation and packaging costs  The increase in these key costs has been so significant that it led Hershey Company  NYSE HSY  to announce Tuesday that it will raise the price of its candy by an average of 8 percent 
Meanwhile  prices and demand for boxed chocolate    Russell Stover s bread and butter    are not keeping up with the jumps in commodity prices  suggesting that there is limited potential for big profits in the sector 
Craig Wolfe  president of the San Rafael  California based chocolate company Cocoa Canard and a student of chocolate history  said he does not consider Lindt s purchase of Russell Stover to be  a wise branding move   Russell Stover  said Wolfe  is seen as a less high end product than Lindt 
 The cheap value chocolates to me are going to continue to lose market share  I think it goes against the core branding of a more quality upscale brand for Lindt   he said   I have no idea what they are thinking  It does not really get them huge extra market penetration as they are already in a lot of the places that Russell Stover is in   To combine with Russell Stover not only cheapens the overall brand  but makes them that much more vulnerable to fluctuations in the confectionery industry  
Omar Tatum  founder of Louisville Kentucky based AmeriCandy Company  Inc   also said that the acquisition of Russell Stover will not do much for the Swiss chocolatier in growth terms  That assertion is borne out by a November report by Euromonitor  which predicted that the value of the American boxed chocolate market will fall from  1 95 billion last year to  1 9 billion by 2018 
 Lindt is a very active Internet chocolate company while Russell Stover is mired in the  drugstore  trade with very little to look forward to as to growth   he said   The candy industry as a whole has been losing direction for years with no hi tech excitement moving it forward at home or abroad  
But some experts believe that the acquisition will be a net positive for Lindt  Becca Niederkrom  a marketing consultant and head of the chocolate website ireallylovechocolate com  called it a smart move given the economics of the American chocolate industry 
 As the middle classes are growing in other countries to now be able to afford these smaller luxuries  we see companies such as Hershey s    who picked up Dagoba and Scharffen Berger in the last decade    and Mars Company continue to grow and tap in on this steady climb upward of the chocolate customer   she said  
 And some might even say as the middle class declines in size in the U S   many low end products are flourishing along with an increased demand of luxury products    a true divide that I believe Lindt is smart to cash in on  

According to Red Peak Branding chief executive James Fox the Russell Stover acquisition will likely turn out to be a boon for Lindt  as long as it ensures  that from a branding perspective the brands seem separate   
 As we re seeing in the market now post recession  there s a lot of bifurcation of brands   Fox told the Wall Street Journal    People want to save and buy high end luxury goods and compromise on lower end goods  so mid tier brands are getting squeezed out of the equation   From a business perspective  to have that lower end priced item really helps  
And overall chocolate profits are not expected to drop off anytime soon  according to the November Euromonitor report  which stated that  chocolate confectionery is expected to register constant value growth of 7   to reach sales of US 18 6 billion  
But the report did state that  higher prices and smaller pack sizes are expected to drive retail volume sales down by 1  over the forecast period   Some observers believe Lindt would have been better off either expanding into growing and emerging chocolate markets in places like Asia or South America or entering new industries outside of confections  rather than pursuing a greater stake in the American market 
 Look at chocolate history and you will see companies from Hershey  Kraft  Nestle  Rowntree s  etc   always trying    if they are going to expand    to also expand out of the chocolate market to diversify   Wolfe said   The reason the cheaper companies can hold up prices when cocoa prices rise is they use cheaper ingredients to compensate  I agree  better to pursue moving the Lindt brand stronger into other countries and build up the quality angle in the U S  
Jon Cox  European consumer equities head at Kepler Cheuvreux  told Confectionery News that  strategically  the acquisition  probably makes sense  as it will help Lindt improve its position in the U S  market  But he agreed with Wolfe s contention that investing in another market may have been a better move 
 I would have preferred them to go for a Brazil or Russia where they don t have so much penetration   he said ",2014-07-18,International Business Times,"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/lindt's-acquisition-of-russell-stover:-wise-or-disastrous,-experts-say-296213",296213

13407,234922,HSY,Why Is Facebook s Stock Soaring  ,news,"By    When To Buy Shares Of Apple  Microsoft   Facebook
Facebook Inc  NASDAQ FB  shares jumped over 5 percent on Wednesday in extended hours trading after the social media giant reported fiscal 2014 second quarter earnings of 42 cents per share  excluding items  on revenue of  2 91 billion  compared with a profit of 19 cents a share on revenue of  1 8 billion in the year ago period 
Wall Street had expected the company to issue second quarter EPS of 32 cents on revenue of  2 8 billion  according to analysts polled by Reuters 
 We had a good second quarter   Mark Zuckerberg  founder and chief executive officer at Facebook  said in the company s second quarter earnings statement   Our community has continued to grow  and we see a lot of opportunity ahead as we connect the rest of the world  
Net income for the quarter ended June 30 jumped 138 percent to  791 million  compared to  333 million during the same period in 2013 
Revenue for the second quarter of 2014 totaled  2 91 billion  an increase of 61 percent  compared with  1 81 billion a year earlier 
Mobile Ad Growth   Active Users 
Facebook beat Wall Street earnings and revenue estimates thanks to its strong mobile advertising business that soared  over 151 percent year over year  and now makes up 62 percent of the company s advertising revenue   
 It s all about digital ads   Keith Bliss  senior vice president and director of sales   marketing at Cuttone   Co   Inc  said to IBTimes   The big thing with Facebook is all about how are they acquiring new users onto the platform and how are they retaining new users   Bliss added  
Facebook said daily active users on average for June 2014 were 829 million  an increase of 19 percent year over year  Meanwhile  mobile daily active users came in at 654 million on average last month  an increase of 39 percent compared to a year earlier 
As of June 30  2014  the firm said monthly active users were 1 32 billion  up 14 percent year over year  and mobile active users rose 31 percent to 1 07 billion from the same period in 2013 
Meanwhile  revenue from advertising was  2 68 billion  a 67 percent increase from the same quarter last year  Mobile advertising revenue represented approximately  1 66 billion  or 62 percent of ad revenue  compared to approximately  660 million  or 41 percent of ad revenue in the second quarter of 2013  Desktop ad revenue was up 8 percent from last year 
 That  mobile advertising growth  was the big complaint about Facebook three quarters ago   Bliss said   They seem to have rectified that situation  
World Cup 
Facebook also weighed in on how the World Cup this summer impacted their growth  The company said over 350 million people made over 3 billion interactions during the global event  To enable even more of these conversations  Facebook said it improved the ranking of videos and newsfeeds and has launched new APIs  application programming interface  to help television and media organizations use Facebook content in their productions 
 It s pretty impressive   Mark Newton  chief technical analyst at Greywolf Execution Partners  said to IBTimes   The company obviously makes money based on not only total number of users  but also interactions  I think they re hitting on all cylinders  
The World Cup final was the single most talked about sporting event in Facebook history  the company said during its earnings call  generating 280 million interactions from 88 million people 
Small Businesses   Brand Marketers
The company now has more than 30 million active small business pages and over 19 million of them are active on mobile  The social media giant also has 1 5 million active advertisers 
 We continue to focus one three key areas of investment  Capitalizing on the shift to mobile  growing the number of marketers using Facebook and building our ad products   Sheryl Sandberg  chief operating officer at Facebook  said during the company s second quarter earnings call with shareholders 
In addition  the social media network is hosting  Facebook Fit workshops  within the U S  in cities such as New York  Chicago and Miami to help small businesses and is also working with larger brands to recognize how the company s scaled targeting and measurement capabilities can  help drive results  
Facebook said the World Cup also provided an opportunity for brand building on the site  including companies such as Visa Inc  NYSE V   Nike Inc  NYSE NKE   Ford Motor Company  NYSE F  and McDonald s Corporation  NYSE MCD  
 McDonald s worked with agencies OMD  Framestore and Arc Sponsorship as well as Facebook s Creative Shop to produce 30 videos that used French fries as players   Fry Futbol  recreated the most spectacular World Cup moments and ran them as videos the very next day with the French fries acting as the players  This campaign reached 125 million people in 158 countries   Sandberg said 
LiveRails  WhatsApp   Oculus Acquisitions 
Earlier this summer  Facebook announced it agreed to acquire LiveRail  an advertising technology company founded in 2007 that helps companies such as Major League Baseball  MLB com   ABC Family  A E Networks  Gannett  and Dailymotion serve better ads in the videos that appear on their websites and apps 
 We have a lot to do here  but with LiveRail we are investing in tools that can help improve the relevance of video ads across the web   Sandberg said 
In February  Facebook announced it reached a definitive agreement to acquire WhatsApp  a cross platform mobile messaging company  for a total of nearly  16 billion  including  4 billion in cash and approximately  12 billion worth of Facebook shares  The company said during the conference call it expects to close the deal with WhatsApp later this year 
Additionally  Facebook closed its acquisition earlier this week of Oculus VR  a virtual reality technology company  Facebook ended the second quarter with approximately  14 billion in cash and investments  which excluded the impact of the Oculus acquisition  and included an approximately  400 million cash payment 
Separately  Facebook made one of its biggest updates last month to the Instagram app  which the company acquired for  1 billion in 2012  by adding new creative tools that allow people to  refine exactly how their photos look and feel   Facebook said Instagram has now passed over 200 million monthly active users and that it is still in the early stages of building advertising on the online mobile photo sharing platform and expects revenue from its contribution to remain small in the near term 
 We re also seeing positive early demand from marketers for ads on Instagram  and we re rolling these ads out carefully as well   Sandberg said 
Forward Looking Guidance
Facebook expects the company s total 2014 GAAP expenses  including cost of revenue and stock compensation  will likely grow in the neighborhood of 30 35 percent  The social media company expects its total non GAAP expenses  including cost of revenue but excluding stock compensation  will grow at a similar rate 
 We expect shares outstanding to grow from around 2 6 billion at the end of 2013 to approximately 2 9 billion at the end of 2014  again assuming WhatsApp closes by the end of the year   Dave Wehner  chief financial officer at Facebook  said during the earnings call 
Facebook s year over year growth rate declined from 72 percent in the first quarter to 61 percent in the second quarter  or 59 percent on a constant currency basis 
 We expect this trend to continue over the course of the second half of the year   Wehner said 
Shares of Facebook rose 5 51 percent to  75 22 in after hours trading on Wednesday following the company s earnings announcment

13408,234923,HSY,Hershey warns of sticker shock from chocolate price hike ,news,"By Marcy Nicholson NEW YORK  Reuters    Hershey Co  one of the world s best known names in chocolate  expects its first price hike in three years to crimp short term sales  but over the long haul the popularity of chocolate will prevail  the company s chief executive said on Thursday 
President and CEO John Bilbrey said the 120 year old maker of Hershey Kisses and Reese s Peanut Butter Cups will be particularly alert to any reduction in sales caused by the increase  which averaged 8 percent  among low income consumers 
Bilbrey told analysts on a conference call to discuss second quarter financial results that in the past many consumers adjusted to higher prices  over time   but he said more expensive chocolate would lower volume for the rest of the year  primarily in the fourth quarter and into 2015 
Hershey announced its price increase on July 15  saying it was in response to soaring cocoa and dairy prices  The hike comes at a critical time for candy makers  as some of the world s best known brands are fighting for U S  consumers in a shrinking market 
One of Hershey s biggest competitors Mars Chocolate North America said on Wednesday it was raising prices 7 percent 
Three months ago  Swiss based Nestle SA  the world s biggest confectionery business  warned of price changes 
But Swiss chocolate maker Lindt   Spruengli has said its main priority was to gain market share globally by absorbing some commodity price increases 

U S  demand for chocolate has declined annually since 2006  with the exception of 2013 when there was slight growth  according to data from Euromonitor International  In contrast  world consumption has increased 
    This is in part because of the increasing popularity of premium products and bite size chocolates that weigh less than many chocolate bars  Global demand is increasing and there are reports that prices are getting higher because cocoa farmers are not going to be able to increase production enough to meet the demand for chocolate 
    In its results  Hershey said full year net sales were expected to rise around the low end of its long term target of 5 to 7 percent and growth in its candy and mint category would be around 3 percent in 2014  slightly below the long term projection of 3 to 4 percent

13411,234926,HSY,U S  readies duties on Mexican sugar in win for sugar lobby,news,"By Adriana Barrera and Krista Hughes
MEXICO CITY WASHINGTON  Reuters    The United States is set to slap import duties as high as 17 percent on Mexican sugar in a victory for the powerful U S  sugar industry but a blow to U S  candy and soft drink makers who face paying more for the sweetener 
Mexican producers urged a deal to end the spat while the government hinted at retaliation  highlighting the potential for Tuesday s Department of Commerce ruling to increase tensions in a months long trade dispute over claims cheap subsidized sugar is flooding the heavily protected U S  market 
The duties mean companies like sweets and food makers Hershey Co  Mondelez International Inc  General Mills Inc and drinks makers such as Coca Cola Co will have to pay up to 5 cents per pound extra for imported Mexican sugar  based on current prices 
The United States is a net importer of sugar and Mexico is one of its largest suppliers  Mexican imports are estimated at 2 1 million short tons for the 2013 14 crop year that runs through Sept  30 
The preliminary decision could still be overturned but is only the first stage of a case which could lead to a further round of levies  It underscores the influence that U S  cane and beet growers  a relatively small but politically engaged sector in U S  farming  have over domestic farm and trade policy 
    Out of a total 2 2 million U S  farms  less than 4 700 grow cane and beet  according to data from the Washington based Heritage Foundation  a conservative think tank 
But the sector accounts for a third of the crop industries  campaign donations and 40 percent of crop industries  lobbying expenditures  it said 
    Tuesday s decision is a victory for the American Sugar Alliance  ASA   which represents U S  sugar farmers and processors and has pushed for an end to free trade with Mexico since sweetener was included in the North American Free Trade Agreement  NAFTA  six years ago 
The ASA said on Tuesday it expects final countervailing duties would be even higher than the preliminary decision 
 The finding validates our claim that the flood of Mexican sugar  which is harming America s sugar producers and workers  is subsidized by the Mexican government   a spokesman said 
Still  one U S  sugar importer described the duties as  devastating   and warned that U S  prices would likely rise in line with the new tariff 
U S  prices are already above the global market because of a government subsidy program that sets minimum prices 
Under the ruling  sugar from state owned Mexican mills   which account for a fifth of production   will attract duties of 17 01 percent  compared to 2 99 percent for private sector Grupo Azucarero Mexico producers and 14 87 percent for all other producers 
Mexico sugar chamber president Juan Cortina said the industry was prepared to cap exports in exchange for suspending duties  as long as any deal allowed minimum exports of 1 million tonnes per cycle 
The chamber believed a deal could be reached before the U S  rules on the anti dumping section of the case in October   which could lead to more duties  U S  producers claim Mexican sugar is sold at 45 percent or more below fair value 
The U S  International Trade Commission is also conducting a parallel investigation into whether the imports injure local growers  Its final verdict is due in February 
CONSUMERS PAY THE PRICE
U S  Agriculture Secretary Thomas Vilsack has said he would encourage a settlement  but U S  lawmakers  food manufacturers and commercial users of sugar have warned a deal would inflate food prices and threaten U S  food manufacturers 
 The likely result is that the growers  particularly in the United States  will make more money  and the consumers will pick up the tab   said National Foreign Trade Council president Bill Reinsch 
The Sweetener Users Association said Mexico had become a scapegoat for the failings of the U S  sugar program and critics argue the case could prompt retaliation against U S  high fructose corn syrup 
Mexico s Economy Ministry said the decision was a setback in trade relations and that Mexico will defend its rights and exhaust the legal options to protect its interests under NAFTA and the World Trade Organization 
Concerns about tightening supplies in the United States have pushed domestic prices up 18 percent since the case was filed in March 
Second month U S  domestic raw sugar futures traded in New York jumped to a two week high of 26 75 cents a lb in thin trade after the news but pared the gains by the close 
In the meantime  traders braced for volatile and uncertain trading conditions ahead of the government s decision on antidumping duties on Oct  24 

 The dumping duty is the big one  This  Tuesday s ruling  should encourage Mexico to try to get a deal  and strengthen the conviction of the  U S  sugar industry    said Frank Jenkins  president of Connecticut brokerage JSG Commodities

13412,234927,HSY,U S   Mexico sign deal to end sugar spat  avert import duties,news,"MEXICO CITY WASHINGTON  Reuters    Mexico and the United States reached a deal on Monday to avert potentially steep duties on Mexican sugar imports to the United States  defusing a months long dispute that threatened to escalate into a major trade war 
In the deal hammered out hours before U S  regulators were going to slap penalties on Mexican imports  the U S  Department of Commerce said that Mexican and U S  officials and Mexican sugar exporters initialed a draft agreement that would suspend both anti subsidy and anti dumping duties on the goods  if adopted in full 
The deal included provisions that will prevent imports from being concentrated during certain times of the year  limit the amount of refined sugar that may enter the U S  market and establish minimum price mechanisms to guard against undercutting or keeping U S  prices artificially low  it said 
Mexican producers agreed to sell at a minimum of  0 2357 per pound for refined and  0 2075 for raw sugar 
The concessions will help resolve a dispute that threatened to spiral into a tit for tat trade war after Mexico warned it would take U S  support for its sugar industry to the World Trade Organization and might consider retaliatory duties on U S  fructose 
The spat started when U S  sugar producers filed a claim   the first of its kind   in March contending that cheap  subsidized sugar from Mexico was flooding the heavily protected U S  market and costing them nearly  1 billion in net income in 2013 14 
 The agreements should provide critical stability in a market that is important to both countries  while also ensuring that farmers and sugar refiners in the United States have an opportunity to compete on a level playing field   said Stefan Selig  under secretary of Commerce for international trade  in a news release 
But the deal prompted Mexican mills to brace for new restrictions on sales to one of their biggest markets  The world s mills are struggling to break even with prices near the cost of production amid four back to back years of surplus 
 How can you think that this is positive when before we had free trade and now we ll have restrictions    said Carlos Rello  head of the FEESA fund that runs Mexico s nine state owned mills which produce about a quarter of the country s output 
The U S  Department of Commerce had recommended anti subsidy duties on Mexican sugar of up to 17 01 percent and on Monday made a preliminary determination that imports should incur dumping margins ranging from 39 54 percent to 47 26 percent 
Those duties would be suspended under the agreement  Commerce released draft texts of the deal for a 30 day public comment period  after which it can be finalized 
Mexico is one of the United States  largest suppliers of sugar  as local producers cannot meet demand from companies such as sweets and food makers Hershey Co  N HSY   Mondelez International Inc  O MDLZ   General Mills Inc and drinks makers such as Coca Cola Co  N KO   as well as consumers

13416,234931,HSY,Top Stock Reports For Morgan Stanley  Kraft Heinz   Lockheed Martin,opinion,"Friday  December 29  2017
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS   Kraft Heinz  KHC  and Lockheed Martin  LMT   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Morgan Stanley s shares have outperformed the Zacks Investment Banking industry  over the last twelve months   24 6  vs   20 3    The performance was supported by the company s impressive earnings surprise history  having surpassed expectations in all the trailing four quarters  
The Zacks analyst likes the company s efforts to lower balance sheet risk  strengthen wealth management operations and reduce costs  Project Streamline  and believes these initiatives will continue to support profitability  Given a solid capital position  it will likely enhance shareholder value through efficient capital deployment activities  
However  continued fall in net interest income despite rise in interest rates remains a matter of concern  Also  overall trading woes are expected to hurt the company s bottom line growth in the near term 
 You can   
Shares of Kraft Heinz have declined  10 8  year to date  underperforming the Zacks Diversified Food industry which is down  4 7  during the same period  owing to continued softness in sales  However  Kraft Heinz s cost savings have led to better profits amid a soft sales environment  
The company expects between  1 7 billion and  1 8 billion of cumulative Integration Program savings by the end of 2017  primarily focused on work force reductions  factory closures and consolidations  Also  with growing awareness of the nutritional value of food products  the company is emphasizing on organic ingredients  reshaping its existing products and expanding into new categories  
However  the trend in current quarter and year earnings estimate revisions is not satisfactory as it has remained stable over the past 30 days 
 You can   
Lockheed Martin s shares have gained  28 9  over the past year  underperforming the Zacks Aerospace Defense sector  which has gained  45 3  over the same period  However  the Zacks analyst emphasizes that being the largest defense contractor in the world  Lockheed Martin witnesses strong demand for its high end military equipment in both domestic as well as overseas markets  
Strong order growth has been a primary growth driver for this company  The latest  7 billion deal for the sustainment of F 22 air vehicle is one such order  An encouraging defense budget proposed by Trump government further buoys optimism for the stock s growth  
However  the F 35 program  despite being a prime defense project for the U S  government  has been facing criticism for being overtly expensive for the past few years  Moreover  the company s limited commercial exposure and almost complete government dependence may prove fatal in maintaining its margins and bottom line 
 You can   
Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Hershey s  HSY   Waste Connections  WCN  and Discovery Financial  DFS  
More Stock News  This Is Bigger than the iPhone  
It could become the mother of all technological revolutions  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years  creating a  1 7 trillion market 
Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it  If you don t buy now  you may kick yourself in 2020

relatively healthy job data    As investors employ a wait and see approach in a classic example of  backing and filling  in the market  they could benefit from  cash cow  stocks that garner higher returns However  singling out cash rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless they are backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity  ROE   A high ROE

and is useful in determining the financial health of a company  In other words  this financial metric enables investors to identify stocks that diligently deploy cash for higher returns Moreover  ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry   the higher  the better  It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk adjusted returns Parameters Used for ScreeningIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash rich with high ROE  we have added Cash Flow greater than  1 billion and ROE greater than X Industry as our primary screening parameters  In addition  we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy Price Cash Flow less than X Industry  This metric measures how much investors pay for one dollar of free cash flow  A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow generating stock Return on Assets  ROA  greater than X Industry  This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset  which includes cash  accounts

 By David Jones and Megan Davies
 ZURICH NEW YORK  Sept 8  Reuters    Kraft is the most
logical buyer for British chocolate firm Cadbury  but the U S 
rival will remain  financially disciplined   one of the
company s executives said on Tuesday 
  The simple fact is that Cadbury is worth what someone is
willing to pay for it   nothing more   said Michael Osanloo 
Executive Vice President  Strategy  Kraft Foods in a regulatory
statement issued by the company following a media interview 
 Cadbury rejected Kraft s 10 2 billion pound   16 7 billion 
offer for the world s No  2 confectionery group  and speculation
is swirling about whether the American rival will raise its
offer 
 The storied chocolate firm is seen as either attracting a
higher bid with more cash from Kraft  or a possible counterbid 
analysts say  but some think it unlikely that Cadbury will be
able to extract a much higher price 
  We expect Cadbury s management to mount an aggressive
defence  but confess to seeing few options on the table as a
standalone company that would get the share price to 745p  let
alone if there were a higher offer   said Warren Ackerman at
Evolution Securities 
 There is  however  the chance of counterbidders  and the
names seen most likely are U S  firm Hershey Co and
Switzerland s Nestle AG  Some analysts say they could make a
joint offer for Cadbury and then split the business to get
around anti trust problems in chocolate 
 Hershey is being advised by U S  bank JPMorgan on a possible
strategy regarding Cadbury  a source familiar with the situation
told Reuters on Tuesday  which indicates it could be considering
a run for the chocolate maker 
 Under a joint bid scenario  Nestle is seen as taking
Cadbury s gums and Hershey the chocolate  For Hershey  an
acquisition would also expand the U S  focused company
internationally 
 Hershey and JPMorgan declined comment 
 Nestle Chief Executive Paul Bulcke said on Monday he was
open to opportunities if they fit strategically  but reiterated
the group did not plan any big acquisitions in 2009 or 2010 
 His comments were seen as making it less likely Nestle will
bid  Kepler analyst Jon Cox said he did not believe a bidding
war will emerge  given that Nestle  which is pretty much the
only company with the financial resources to make a bid  has
signalled it is not interested 
 
 LOW SHOT 
 Kraft s bid was seen by analysts as an opening low shot in a
bidding battle  and Cadbury s shareholders will not be keen on
60 percent of the price  or around  10 billion  coming in the
form of Kraft s U S  listed shares  analysts said  adding that
investors would prefer more cash 
  We think Kraft is underbidding the potential synergies and
see the high Kraft equity component to the consideration as a
deterrent for Cadbury shareholders   said Martin Deboo at
Investec Securities 
 Kraft launched its bid on Monday at 300p cash and 0 2589 new
Kraft shares per Cadbury share  valuing the British group at
745p at Kraft s Friday closing share price  with the U S  group
seeing annual deal cost savings of  625 million 
 Cadbury shares closed up 0 4 percent at 786p on Tuesday
after a hefty rise of 38 percent on Monday when they touched
808p  Kraft shares were 5 percent lower at  26 69 
 Kraft is looking at a Cadbury deal to become the world s
biggest confectionery group  tapping into Cadbury s big emerging
market exposure  and boosting the U S  group s overall growth
rate in a deal which should encounter few anti trust problems 
 The move would catapult Kraft to global No  1 in
confectionery with a 14 8 percent share ahead of Mars Wrigley s
14 6 percent as it would join together Kraft s No  5 position
with a 4 7 percent share and Cadbury s No  2 global position

13441,234956,HSY,4 Solid Stocks To Make The Most Of All Hallows  Eve,opinion,"The U S  stock market seems to have defied the eerie All Hallows  Eve by maintaining its bull run  and the  Halloween Strategy   a technique in which investors start placing big bets on All Hallows  Eve after restraining in the preceding six months  gives us even more optimism right now 
Demand for candies and costumes in the Halloween season drives sales at U S  retailers  including discount stores  Sales of such items are poised to beat the previous year numbers  courtesy of upbeat consumer sentiment  The finances of consumers have  largely  benefitted from an improving economy with lower unemployment and better wages 
Spooky Stock Market Ghosts  Goblins and Ghouls
The fears and apprehensions concerning the broader market are unsubstantiated 
For instance  has the war of words between North Korea s Kim Jong Un and Trump scared investors  Apparently not  as the market continues to gain unhindered 
Another fear is that the Fed will hike rates  killing a bull market fueled by cheap borrowing  But  policymakers haven t hiked rates yet  They fear that a rate hike will strengthen the dollar  eventually denting U S  exports and hampering economic growth 
Finally  should a lofty valuation give you goosebumps  Nope and nope  Bull markets often scale to a string of record highs  So  if you succumb to the fear of highs  you eventually lose money 
Halloween Drives Record Sales of Candy
With more money expected to pour in  candy sales are expected to rise  In fact  Halloween accounts for about 10  of the industry s total annual sales  which in turn leads to fierce competition among confectioners 
According to IHS Markit data  candy sales are set to rise 4 1  from last year  reaching a seasonally adjusted  4 1 billion  This is particularly impressive given that candy prices have declined 0 9  from last year  marking the second successive drop in Halloween candy prices 
Halloween is like Super Bowl Sunday for North America s largest chocolate maker   Hershey Co   NYSE HSY    Banking on this upbeat sales forecast  the maker of Kisses  Reese s  Krackel  Symphony and Mr  Goodbar expects sales to go up 8  from last year  The company has seen its earnings grow over the last five years  driving its share price from  70 to nearly  105 
Another major player  Mondelez International Inc   NASDAQ MDLZ    is expected to gain immensely from this year s rise in candy sales  It is a successor to Kraft Foods  NASDAQ KHC  Inc  which owns household names in the candy industry like Nabisco  Cadbury and Toblerone  It has seen its share price climb from around  27 the year it was introduced to almost  40 today 
Halloween to Boost Costume and Discount Store Sales
A large chunk of Halloween spending will go to costumes as well  According to a survey by the National Retail Federation  NRF   Americans are expected to spend  3 4 billion on costumes  The survey also shows that majority of consumers will shop online for costumes  while about 30  will do so at retail stores 
In fact  as per the NRF  spending on All Hallows  Eve this year will be more than  9 billion  This marks a rise from around  8 5 billion last year 
Consumer Confidence Rides High
The upbeat reading on Halloween sales says a lot about consumer sentiments  which have been improving on a strengthening economy  The U S  economy expanded at a solid seasonally adjusted 3  annual rate in the third quarter of 2017  according to the Commerce Department  Such an expansion came on the heels of 3 1  growth in the second quarter  It also marks the first time of two consecutive quarters of 3  growth or more since mid 2014 
The economy was boosted by solid consumer spending  and a steady job market buoyed household optimism  The unemployment rate declined to 4 2  in September  the lowest since February 2001  while wages increased 0 5  to an average of  26 55 an hour  per the Labor Department  In fact  in the last 12 months  hourly pay increased 2 9   up from 2 7  in the prior month and also in line with a post recession high  read more  US GDP Hits 3  Despite Twin Hurricanes  5 Top Gainers

13454,234969,HSY,SCENARIOS Decision time nears for Kraft in Cadbury bid,news,"  Put up or shut up deadline likely soon
   Options for Kraft  raise bid  walk away  go hostile
   Analysts say going hostile soon is unlikely
 
 By Rhys Jones and Victoria Howley
 LONDON  Sep 28  Reuters    The UK Takeover Panel is widely
expected this week to set Kraft a deadline by which it must put
a firm offer on the table for UK rival Cadbury or walk away for
six months 
 It is now three weeks since Cadbury  the world s second
largest confectionery group  rejected a 745 pence a share or
10 2 billion pound   16 7 billion  approach by Kraft  North
America s biggest food group 
  The indications are that the UK Takeover Panel will impose
a  put up or shut up  deadline giving Kraft four to six weeks to
make an offer   said Shore Capital analyst Clive Black 
 Bankers and analysts say that it still early days in the
battle  casting doubt on a report in Britain s Observer
newspaper that a hostile bid was imminent  Many feel Kraft will
try and avoid going hostile given the complexity of any tie up 
 Here are the various ways the deal could unfold 
 
 KRAFT RAISES OFFER
 Kraft s only move so far is an informal approach  which
Cadbury rejected as too low  Bankers say Kraft s dilemma is
where to pitch a formal bid in the hope that it can win a
recommendation from Cadbury s board and gain access to the
company s books  
 Credit Suisse estimates that the current 745 pence a share
proposal is worth about 12 5 times 2009 EBITDA but analysts
believe an offer of closer to 14 times 2009 EBITDA    or about
850 pence per share    could lead to an agreed deal 
  Based on the average valuation for previous deals  Kraft s
debt capacity and the potential for upgraded synergies  we see
an 850 pence offer fully valuing Cadbury  This would be 16 3
times 2008 EBITDA and 13 4 times expected 2009 EBITDA   said
Orianna Segaud  an analyst at Natixis Securities 
 A senior banker told Reuters 850 pence would  probably be
enough for Cadbury to accept and give them a recommendation  
 One analyst downplayed the likelihood of Kraft coming out
with a  knock out bid   He said the company is unlikely to  blow
all its ammunition at the first go   adding that Kraft would
likely come back with a second offer if its first attempt was
rejected 
  If Kraft is knocked back the next offer would probably have
a higher cash element but would not be a full cash bid   the
analyst said 
 
 KRAFT WALKS AWAY
 Kraft is unlikely to walk away from Cadbury before making a
formal bid because there are sound strategic reasons for the
deal  For Kraft  the transaction is a natural extension of a
product strategy to push into high growth and high margin areas 
  This is the start of a long campaign and the one thing we
can rule out at this stage is Kraft walking away very soon  
said the senior banker 
  There has to be a chance that Kraft walks away    we don t
think that chance is nil   but we would also suggest that it is
part of current shareholders  thinking that if Kraft did walk
away where would Cadbury shares go to and it would prob start
with a 6   said Black  Cadbury shares  which were at 568 pence
before the bid  ended Monday at just over 800 pence 
 
 A COUNTER BIDDER COMES IN
 Large Cadbury investors are worried Chief Executive Todd
Stitzer may overplay his hand in fending off Kraft s offer  with
no obvious rival in sight to spark a bidding war 
 But Black expected Cadbury to be  courting counter bidders
like mad  at the moment and sees the  often talked about
combination of Nestle and Hershey Co  as the most likely source
of that counter bid  
 Analysts at Evolution believed a Hershey Nestle bid could be
a  possibility  and have also mentioned private equity group KKR
as another source of interest 
 But most were sceptical about a bidding war  and also
believe Cadbury would struggle to find a white knight  
 Natixis  Segaud didn t see Hershey and Nestle combining
because the Hershey Foundation    its majority shareholder   
would not want to see its stake diluted  For Nestle  competition
issues in the chocolate market in the UK or Brazil would
complicate matters 
 
 KRAFT GOES HOSTILE
 Britain s Observer newspaper on Sunday reported that Kraft
was poised to launch an 11 billion pounds hostile bid for
Cadbury 
 Major UK based Cadbury shareholders declined to comment on
the deal  However  one top 25 investor  who declined to be
named  told Reuters that Kraft had not contacted his firm about
the reported hostile bid 
 Another senior banker said it would be strange for Kraft to
go hostile before they have their financing in place 
  Market speculation suggests Kraft are not yet there on the
financing  They could argue with the Takeover Panel that they
need a longer period in which to make a bid to get the financing
in place   the banker said  
 One analyst covering Cadbury said he thought Kraft would go
hostile eventually but added that the best thing for them to do
would be to wait and see some of the air come out of the Cadbury
share price rather than go hostile right away 
  If they go hostile  it will be towards the end of the
Takeover Panel timeframe  They would do this hoping that the
Cadbury share price has come down and to trigger a 60 day offer
period   said another analyst

 LONDON  Sept 30  Reuters    Kraft Foods Inc has until Nov  9
to make an offer for British confectioner Cadbury Plc or must
walk away for six months  Britain s Takeover Panel said on
Wednesday 
 The world s second largest confectionery group  maker of
Dairy Milk chocolate  Creme Eggs and Wispa bars  three weeks ago
rejected a cash and shares approach from North America s biggest
food group  initially worth 745 pence per Cadbury share  or 10 2
billion pounds   16 3 billion  
 Kraft  whose brands include Milka chocolate and Oreo
biscuits  said it noted the Panel s decision and understood the
implications  while Cadbury repeated its rejection of Kraft s
approach 
  Cadbury has a strong position in the global confectionery
market and the board is confident in Cadbury s standalone
    strategy and growth prospects   Chairman Roger Carr said in
a statement following the Panel s announcement 
 However  major Cadbury investors are worried Chief Executive
Todd Stitzer may overplay his hand in fending off Kraft  with no
obvious rival in sight to spark a bidding war 
 Stitzer was last week reported to have said he saw some
sense in a Kraft deal  but argued previous deals in the sector
had been made at higher multiples than implied by Kraft s offer 
Stitzer subsequently said he did not believe the bid made
strategic or financial sense 
 Cadbury shares were flat at 800 pence by 1425 GMT  while
Kraft was 0 1 percent lower at 17 70 euros in Frankfurt and 0 8
percent down at  25 80 in New York 
 Bankers say Kraft s dilemma is where to pitch a formal bid
in the hope it can win a recommendation from Cadbury s board and
gain access to the company s books 
 Some analysts have said there is compelling logic to a
potential deal adding Cadbury s high growth emerging market
business into Kraft s wide ranging distribution system  with few
overlaps which might prompt competition concerns 
 
 HIGHER BID 
 Credit Suisse estimated Kraft s proposal was worth about
12 5 times Cadbury s 2009 earnings before interest  tax 
depreciation and amortisation  EBITDA   but some analysts
believe an offer closer to 14 times 2009 EBITDA    or about 850
pence    could lead to an agreed deal 
  We think Kraft will come in with an offer starting with an
 8  so maybe  it will make a bid  at around 850 pence plus or
minus a few pennies   said analyst Clive Black at brokerage
Shore Capital   We re not convinced that in the absence of clear
evidence of a counter bid that we re looking at something
beginning with a  9  or a  10   
 Analysts believe what Kraft would have to pay for Cadbury
ultimately depends on whether a counter bidder enters the fray 
with a Nestle AG and Hershey Co the most talked about potential
contenders 
  It s probably worth Kraft hanging on as long as they can to
see how things develop in terms of other bidders coming in  
said analyst Graham Jones at brokerage Panmure  who saw a
Nestle Hershey combination as possible rather than probable 
 There s also a theory suggesting the longer Kraft leaves it
without noise coming from another bidder the stronger hand it
has got   Jones said 
 One banker not involved in the situation but who covers the
sector said Kraft would probably leave any bid until the last
minute to iron out its financing arrangements  but rival bidders
would likely emerge 
  The deadline will draw out any rival bidders because they
know the clock is ticking and if Kraft makes an attractive offer
that appeals to shareholders Cadbury could fall beyond their
grasp indefinitely  Most people expect Kraft to bid   the banker
said 
 Takeover Panel rules mean that if Kraft makes a formal offer
before the deadline  there is then a period in which it must
post the offer document  typically 28 days  It must then within
60 days get acceptances representing more than 50 percent of
Cadbury shares or the offer lapses 
 If that happens Kraft cannot offer again for another year 
Such rules are designed to prevent companies coming under siege
from predators for long periods

13463,234978,HSY,Palantir s IPO Plans Are Just As Secretive As The Company Itself,opinion,"Palantir Technologies is a privately held software and services company that has taken Silicon Valley by storm since its launch back in 2004  It was founded by Peter Thiel  Nathan Gettings  Joe Lonsdale  Stephen Cohen  Garry Tan  and Alex Karp  now CEO    creating the world s best user experience for working with data  one that empowers people to ask and answer complex questions without requiring them to master querying languages  statistical modeling  or the command line  
While its name is derived from the   a  seeing stone  in J R R  Tolkein s fantasy series Lord of the Rings even its motto is  Save the Shire   in reference to the home of the hobbits of Middle Earth Palantir actually emerged from mobile payments giant PayPal s   NASDAQ PYPL   anti fraud efforts  its co founder Thiel also co founded PayPal  
It s also often considered to be one of the most secretive tech unicorns out there today  And by secretive  I mean a couple of things  For one  many people just haven t heard of the company  especially outside of the tech and investing worlds  its Big Data focus is not nearly as flashy and exciting as  or   For another  Palantir and its technology is still best known for antiterrorism and spycraft  two avenues that must be secretive in order to thrive  It s  Minority Report come true    
What They Do
If you have heard of Palantir  then you know that the company s technology has been used in several notable cases  including the discovery of the infamous Chinese espionage networks   and the   There s also their rumored but never confirmed efforts to help take down Osama Bin Laden 
Even though its role in Bin Laden s takedown will likely never be established as fact  what can be recognized  however  is Palantir s extensive relationship with the U S  government  Just as recently as six years ago  Palantir sold exclusively to the government sector   The FBI  CIA  IRS  CDC  Department of Homeland Security  Department of Defense  and several branches of the armed forces have all been customers  and  of the company s business is tied to the public sector  Even In Q Tel  the CIA s venture arm  was an early investor 
For instance  The Guardian goes on to note that the Pentagon  used Palantir software  in Iraq  to track patterns in roadside bomb deployment and worked out garage door openers were being used as remote detonators by predicting it  
Palantir also has commercial customers that rely on them to detect fraud  study consumer behavior  and search for a competitive edge against rivals  these clients include JPMorgan Chase   NYSE JPM    Hershey   NYSE HSY    and Bridgewater Associates  a global investment management firm  among others  Overall  private customers make up about 75  of Palantir s revenue   
Big Data Pioneer
As a whole  Palantir prides itself on being one of the world s Big Data solutions experts  It s a term that refers to a collection of structured and multi structured data from traditional and digital sources inside and outside a company  representing a source for ongoing discovery and analysis  Examples of structured data include tweets   NYSE TWTR   and other social media posts  while multi structured data is something that can be derived from interactions between people and machines 
To help tackle Big Data  Palantir created two software suites for which it s best known for  Formerly known as Palantir Finance   is software for data integration  information management  and quantitative analytics  The software connects to commercial  proprietary  and public data sets and discovery trends  relationships and anomalies  including predictive analytics  And yes  this software suite is named after the home city of Superman 
For users like hedge funds  banks  and financial services firms  Metropolis provides a number of integrated applications in order to build up interactive models using all the data that is available in their system  This includes Custom Metric  Dashboard  Date Set  Explorer  Regression  and Spreadsheet applications 
The other is   formerly known as Palantir Government  This software integrates structured and unstructured data  provides search and discovery capabilities  knowledge management  and secure collaboration  Like Metropolis  Gotham is named after the home city of fellow superhero Batman 
Gotham provides a suite of tools that are optimized for semantic  temporal  geospatial  and full text analysis  Users can seamlessly drag and drop data objects from one application to the next  and applications include Graphs  Maps  Object Explorer  Browser  and Mobile 
IPO Buzz
With a valuation at  20 billion  Palantir is one of the world s most valuable venture backed tech startups  but the company has yet to lay out any specific plans for an initial public offering  However  that hasn t stopped IPO buzz from building  and investors have been excited for a while now about the potential for a Palantir market debut 
The hype grew even more once President Trump took office  as co founder Thiel is his closest tech advisors and CEO Karp joined with some of the industry s biggest names including executives from Apple   NASDAQ AAPL    Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN    Alphabet   NASDAQ GOOGL    and Facebook   NASDAQ FB    just to name a few during the president s transition period earlier this year 
Despite its impressive valuation and presidential connections  Palantir is still not profitable  though the company expects to reach profitability this year  Palantir doesn t report current revenue  but   it brought in over  1 billion in 2014  and that commercial bookings in 2015 almost doubled year over year 
But with buzz certainly comes controversy  In September 2016  Palantir was sued by the U S  Department of Labor for discriminating against Asian applicants by routinely eliminating them in the screening process  Palantir   and will need to pay nearly  1 7 million in  back pay and other monetary relief  
For now  talks of a Palantir IPO remain a combination of speculation and anticipation  Last October  Karp told The Wall Street Journal that the company was  positioned so  it  could go public   a positive sign that Palantir could hit the market in the near future  And with its Big Data focused business something that will only become more prevalent with the rise of artificial intelligence unique user base  and fundamentally secretive operations  Palantir s potential IPO could be one for the books

13464,234979,HSY,5 Overvalued Stocks With Earnings On The Way,opinion,"Stocks At Record Highs  Again
For the 56th time since the 2016 presidential election  the Dow Jones industrial average closed at a record high on Wednesday  September 20th  The market continues to rise which has surprised many as President Trump has failed to enact promised legislation such as corporate tax cuts  The S P 500 also closed at a record high on Wednesday 
While stocks reached new highs  the U S  central bank announced it will begin rolling off its  4 5 trillion balance sheet in October  This illustrates how the Fed believes that the U S  economy has emerged safely from the Great Recession that devastated the economy a decade ago  However  analysts are now warning investors with increasing frequency of a potential pullback as stock valuations reach new heights 
A Pullback On The Horizon 
In this recent MarketWatch article  Thomas H  Kee Jr  warns that without the central bank s  help   i e  quantitative easing   the S P 500 would not be trading at 24x earnings which is where it is today  Historically  the S P 500 has traded closer to 14 5x  He argues that markets become more and more overvalued when the Fed continuously pumps it with liquidity 
CNBC just reported that Brad McMillan  who counsels independent financial advisors representing  114 billion in assets under management  said that the market  would have to drop somewhere between 30 and 40 percent to get to fair value  based on historical standards  Even Barron s went on record in early September stating how the eight year bull market will end 
Timing a widespread pullback is near impossible  However  staying clear of specific securities that are overvalued based on their underlying earnings and fundamentals is not  Finbox io s fair value estimates are derived from pre built valuation analyses and make this process easy  Using this stock screen  we found five stocks expected to report earnings next week  9 25 9 29  and have 20  or more downside

increase in organic growth to 3 6 percent from a disappointing
3 5 percent in the first half  according to a Reuters poll 
 Shares in Nestle  which makes Nescafe coffee and KitKat
chocolate bars  makes were up 3 6 percent to 44 98 Swiss francs
at 1305 GMT  outperforming a 2 2 percent rise in the DJ Stoxx
European food and beverage index 
 UBS said while it expected unemployment to continue to
pressure profits in the developed world  it sees strong demand
in emerging markets  upgrading the stock to  buy  from  neutral 
and lifting its price target to 50 francs from 43 francs 
 It also said the fact that Alcon s share price has risen to
the point where Nestle s  put  option is almost equivalent to
that of the  call  of Swiss drugmaker Novartis made it likely
that a sale would happen  sooner rather than later  
 Doubts were raised after last year s market slide over
whether Nestle would sell its remaining 52 percent Alcon stake
to Novartis  which bought 25 percent last year and agreed an
option to buy the rest from January next year 
 UBS said if Nestle were to sell on Jan  1  it could have net
cash of close to 8 billion Swiss francs   7 90 billion  and
noted that stripping out Alcon would make Nestle the lowest
valued large cap consumer staple stock 
 Nestle has said it does not plan any big acquisitions in
2009 and 2010 and has declined comment on whether it may enter
the fray for Britain s Cadbury Plc  subject to a bid proposal
from Kraft Foods Inc 
 Analysts have speculated that Nestle might be drawn into a
bid for Cadbury  but due to competition issues it might look at
a joint offer with U S  chocolate maker Hershey Co  with the
U S  group looking to take Cadbury s chocolate interests leaving
Nestle with Cadbury s Trident chewing gum business  
 Cadbury gives a third quarter trading update on Wednesday 
 Nestle missed first half sales growth forecasts and trimmed
its 2009 outlook  but its operating margins were boosted by
Alcon 
 Nine month sales were expected to have taken a 4 3 percent
hit from foreign exchange effects  largely due to the strong
Swiss franc  which also hit first half sales 
 Analysts on average forecast price rises to contribute 2 7
percent to organic growth while volume growth should strengthen
slightly to 0 9 percent 
 Nestle Chief Executive Paul Bulcke told Reuters last month
he expects the global economy to recover a little faster than
first thought  helping to boost the company s sales growth 
especially in late 2009 
  The outlook statement may once again prove the catalyst on
the day   said Credit Suisse analyst Alex Molloy  adding that
the market consensus for full year organic growth of 3 8 percent
suggested analysts were not convinced by Bulcke s optimism

13481,234996,HSY,All eyes on chocolate maker Ferrero s next generation  ,news,By Martinne Geller and Giancarlo Navach LONDON MILAN  Reuters    The death of Italian billionaire Michele Ferrero could ultimately herald a deal involving the chocolate empire bearing his name  with the family s third generation leading it into a future of increasingly hungry multinationals   The maker of Nutella spread and Ferrero Rocher chocolates has long been viewed as an appetizing target for rivals such as Mondelez International  O MDLZ   Nestle  VX NESN   Mars and Hershey  N HSY   But given the strength of its brands  the high margins on chocolate and sluggishness of packaged food overall  the Italian business could feasibly be on the shopping list of any global food company   Certainly there s more chance of a deal now than there was before  that absolutely must be true   said Andrew Cosgrove  EY s global lead analyst on consumer goods   It was widely rumored that no deal would happen until this event   Ferrero International  a conservative and secretive 69 year old company  has largely shied away from the dealmaking that has marked the consumer goods sector s search for growth over the past decade  But that could change  insiders say  Sources familiar with the company say that Ferrero had once considered a move on Cadbury but pulled back after the family patriarch rejected a push by his sons  Similarly  there were reports in 2013 that it held talks about a takeover by Nestle   The idea of a tie up with Nestle could come back   a Ferrero manager told Reuters on condition of anonymity   Giovanni  Ferrero  the CEO  always says the company is big but does not have critical mass to really be an international player  so sooner or later he could announce an acquisition  It was the father who blocked everything   Other sources also said Ferrero could turn acquisitive to balance its portfolio  noting that it had considered buying United Biscuits and U S  chocolate company Russel Stover  which ended up going to Swiss rival Lindt   Spruengli  S LISN   Apart from Western confectionery groups  Ferrero could also attract the attention of Turkey s Ulker Biskuvi  IS ULKER   Korea s Lotte  KS 071840  or private equity firms such as 3G Capital  which teamed up with Warren Buffett to buy Heinz   DEAL BREAKERS  Giovanni Ferrero  the son who took over sole leadership in 2011 after older brother Pietro died suddenly  would need a majority of shares to give him a stronger hand in any mooted change of course  the manager said   A Ferrero spokesman  meanwhile  said nothing would change    The company is not listed and ownership is all in the family   the spokesman said  adding that he did not know details of Michele s will  nor how his shares would be distributed  Some analysts have expressed doubts  too  pointing out that more than half of Ferrero s sales come from Western Europe  where economic weakness has curbed growth  while many food companies have been looking to push into healthier products  MainFirst Bank analysts estimate that Ferrero could fetch between 16 billion euros   18 2 billion  and 20 billion euros  based on annual sales of 8 billion euros and the multiples in recent chocolate deals  Accounts to August 2013 report EBITDA of 1 3 billion euros  But for all the hungry predators and investor speculation  external moves to change the status quo face a large stumbling block in the powerful emotional ties in a family business that has fostered great mutual respect between its owners and staff  The company began in 1946 when Michele s parents transformed an Alba pastry shop into a factory  It has more than 30 000 employees across more than 20 countries and holds almost 8 percent of the global chocolate market  Yet it is still held dear in its home town of Alba  where it commands the loyalty of 3 000 employees with practices such as company buses that transport workers from remote villages and the award in 2014 of a 6 000 euro bonus spread over three years   We are confident Ferrero will continue on the same path   Alba s mayor  Maurizio Marello  told Reuters  Others who know the family were even stronger in their assertions   There is a less than zero chance they will sell   said one who asked to remain anonymous    1   0 8807 euros ,2015-02-16,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/all-eyes-on-chocolate-maker-ferrero's-next-generation-328293,328293

The Week That Was
US Stock Market  The Bullish Case

Earnings Support Rallies

Underlying this policy and liquidity driven markets  Fundamentals are apparently driving this rally  All time highs in earnings in line with S P 500  First quarter earnings came in much stronger than expected  Heading into the second quarter  expectations weren t as high   Forecasts had expected 8 percent growth 80 percent of the 20 percent that has been reported so far have beaten expectations  but earnings are tracking nearly 10 percent  However  that is partly due to the base effect of the energy sector recovering last year  On the other hand  if the energy sector is removed  Q2 results are mid single digits and more modest than the first quarter 
However  that is partly due to the base effect of energy recovering from last year  When removing energy  however  Q2 results are softer  in the mid single digits and more modest than the first quarter 
For the technology sector  even though a lot of the upside has been driven by mega caps  the sector as a whole is enjoying a wide breadth of strength  Even on an equal weighted basis in which small companies are given equal weighting with large companies it is growing more than 20 percent
US Stock Market  The Bearish Case

Largest US Outflows Since 2009
Global Markets Have Lower Multiples

While the S P 500 index closed at a second  consecutive weekly record  within a third consecutive gain  capital outflows have been increasing  The SPDR 500 Trust  NYSE SPY   the biggest exchange traded fund tracking the US equity benchmark  shrank by  3 8 billion in July  on pace for its fourth consecutive monthly outflow  and the longest streak since the start of our current bull rally  which began in 2009 
SPY isn t the only fund that s thinning  US mutual funds and ETFs in the week ending July 12  have lost  2 1 billion  Contrast that with  5 1 billion that went into global funds  The US market is at its most underweight since 2008 
As stated above  strong earnings growth kept price to earnings multiples below the March peak  even as prices soared  While this in itself may be considered bullish  as earnings support the prices  US multiples are much higher than European multiples  German and French shares trade at trailing P E as low as 18 9  Japanese shares are as low as 19 2  and emerging market equities tracked by MSCI Inc  trade at 16 1  Finally  the MSCI World Index ex US trades at 19 7  Compare all of them with the S P 500 s expensive 21 6 P E 
US Market  Technical Perspective
The leadership among this string of records is tech  Both the NASDAQ Composite and the NASDAQ Tech formed confirmed hanging men  A hanging man occurs when a stock or index dips but manages to close near its open  at the top of the range That particular recovery is considered bullish  and resembles a hammer pattern  which follows a decline  However  a following session with a lower close seals the bearish sentiment  a correction after a rally 
The background psychology is that traders who were rewarded by going long find themselves in losing positions with the lower close  They exit their positions  pushing the price further down  When prices begin to slip after a meaningful rally The NASDAQ Composite advanced 5 percent and the NASDAQ Tech 100 advanced 7 35 percent  since July 6 investors get nervous and begin unloading their shares 
This starts a snowball effect into a selloff  The hammer s location on the NASDAQ 100 Technology is telling  It formed as the rally was nearing its June 9 all time high 
European Strength And The End To ECB QE
The key takeaway from ECB President Draghi s remarks last week  while the eurozone s economy has vastly improved  the ECB is not yet ready to end QE 
Let s take a step back for context  Three weeks ago  Draghi spoke of the eurozone s economic strength  path to inflation and how  as the recovery progresses  extreme monetary stimulus may be unnecessary  This hawkish message caused a mini taper tantrum   a spike in bond yields and the euro  His goal this past week was therefore not to rattle the markets again and add some nuance to his previous statements 
With regards to growth  while he s proud of the economic recovery  he acknowledges its due to  and therefore still dependent upon  easing monetary policy  Additionally  no matter how robust the growth may be  it has yet to lead inflation up   the buttress to a growing economy  Therefore  the ECB will keep its monetary policy loose for the time being  until the economy can show that it is able to ride without QE  training wheels  and is strong enough to go uphill on rising rates 
Emerging Markets At 25 Percent Discount
China s real GDP growth recorded a 6 9 percent growth for the second quarter YoY  This read demonstrated both an economic durability  as well as beating expectations  Retail sale  industrial production and investments demonstrated the same   all steady and coming in above expectations  China has been demonstrating resilience  despite increasing regulations  which scared investment away  That s a very bullish statement for the world s second largest economy 
Plus  it isn t good news just for China  it s the key driver for emerging markets growth  This economic strength  even while emerging markets  valuations are at a 25 percent discount relative to US equities  with a 16 1 per MSCI compared to the 21 6 of the US 
Oil has been rallying on falling stockpiles but fell 2 5 percent  below  46  after a report of rising OPEC oil output  While the US oil rig count fell by 1 rig to 764  bullish for oil  OPEC s July oil supply was set to rise by 145 000 barrels per day MoM  which is bearish 

Technically  it fell hard by the resistance of the previous  July peak at the same price level 
Gold advanced  crossing over its 50 dma  for the first time since June 15  as the dollar fell 0 20 percent Friday  closing a weekly loss of 0 33 percent   after Draghi mentioned the unmentionable  he will actually discuss monetary policy tightening in September 

Technically  gold is catapulting upon the double top failure  turning it into a bullish consolidation pattern  with an aim back toward  1 300 levels

Key Events

FOMC on second day of policy meeting
Trump Jr   Manafort appear before Senate
Oil has best rally since November  providing a better short entry
Ford  Coca Cola  Hershey  PayPal and Whole Foods release earnings reports

Yesterday s US Close
After yesterday s mixed Asian and European markets  investors drove up US stocks on upbeat earnings reports from McDonald s  NYSE MCD  and Caterpillar  NYSE CAT   The S P 500 closed at a record even as Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL  dragged the tech sector down 
Meanwhile  bonds fell more than they had in months  ahead of the FOMC meeting  causing banks to advance on rising sovereign debt yields and a rally in copper via miners  Ironically  the tech sector fell just one day after it was largely responsible for preventing a broader decline in the market 
Global Affairs
The euro reached its near two year high  after German business confidence beat expectations with a rise to 116 0 instead of falling to 14 9  a record  According to the Institute for Economic Research  a Munich based think tank  the business climate in Germany  Europe s economic engine  improved for a sixth month in July  This reading  however  is at odds with the latest economic indicators 
Both Germany s manufacturing and service output declined to their lowest levels  and the eurozone is experiencing its slowest pace of growth over the previous six months  As proof  its Composite PMI fell to 55 8 in July from 56 3  However  German business confidence has risen to its highest level over the same six month period 
Looking ahead  Germany s stock index fell to three month lows this week amid fears that a strong euro would hit export reliant firms 
How does an investor interpret this apparent dichotomy  Can the data be flawed  or if it s correct  are investors still bullish because the EU is experiencing its fastest and most robust growth since the 2008 crash  If that s so  might this be a case of irrational exuberance  signifying classic market top psychology 
The CBOE Volatility Index  the VIX  known as Wall Street s  Fear Gauge   measures the implied volatility of S P 500 options  Fear  or the lack thereof  is very contagious in a global economy  Yesterday  the VIX closed below 10 for an eighth straight day  settling at 9 43  but not before reaching 9 04 intraday  This is only 13 points above its record low  when it reached 9 30 on December 22  1993  and extremely close to its all time low of 8 89 on December 29  1993 
It has been argued that an extreme low read on the VIX suggests complacency  which increases downside risk  Others argue that implied volatility and fear have been decoupled  due to extremely low volume  However  extremely low volume on a record high may actually suggest that demand is running dry and a large correction may be impending  if not a full fledged bear market 
Oil
Oil surged 4 5 percent in  its biggest rally since it rose 9 3 percent on November 29  after Saudi Arabia announced it will deepen crude export cuts  Even after Monday s St  Petersburg meeting  Nigeria and Libya  the two countries that were the focus of the recent glut  are still exempt from these limitations 

This is the second time that oil has rallied  after it entered a bear market  From a technical standpoint  oil is in a downtrend  As long as the price doesn t rise above  50 a barrel  but still continues to climb  the better the risk reward ratio will be for a short 
The Market Today

The rally in oil  as well as copper which broke out of a consolidation  solidifying a bottom since its 2011 top along with other commodities  gave a boost to producers of raw materials  even with a rising dollar 
The rising dollar demand is positively correlated with a lower demand for bonds  ahead of the Fed s second day policy meeting 
Stocks continued to rally today  after yesterday Caterpillar and McDonald s beat their earnings expectations  Equities in Asia and Europe also continued to climb  led by energy shares which were ignited by oil s strongest rally since November  after rising above  48 a barrel for the first time since early June  and copper extended its gains on a higher outlook for Chinese demand 

While Caterpillar s share price surged almost 6 percent to  114 54  overcoming its July   11 46 peak  it couldn t overcome its  116 95 all time high from February 2012 
Wall Street Fueled by Earnings Despite Lukewarm Data
While investors have been disappointed time and again  as almost all the US economic data disappointed this year  more than 80 percent of the S P 500 s earnings have beaten expectations  These earnings beats are supporting optimism about the global economy and reducing volatility to fresh record lows 
Up Ahead
Huge Dollar Volatility Potential

 9 45  US   Markit Services PMI  July  flash   expected to fall to 53 1 from 54 2 
10 00  US   New Home Sales  June   expected to slide to an annual rate of 580K from 610K 
14 00  The FOMC concludes their rate decision meeting  which is expected to remain unchanged  Investor focus is on the timing of its balance sheet unwinding  According to a Bloomberg survey of 41 economists  the majority believe that this will happen in September  while the Fed will wait until December to raise interest rates again 
President Donald Trump s son in law Jared Kushner and former campaign Chairman Paul Manafort will appear before Senate committees today  which could create huge dollar volatility

 have already released their quarterly numbers  Procter   Gamble reported third quarter fiscal 2017 results  wherein earnings exceeded expectations  while revenues missed the same  On the other hand  Hershey s first quarter 2017 earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate  while sales missed the same The food industry within the consumer staples sector saw sluggish growth and slowdown in consumption in the last few quarters  The industry is experiencing changes in consumer preference  for example  a shift toward products with less artificial sweeteners  sodium and saturated fat   changes in consumer dynamics  such as increased need for portable and on the go products   demographic shifts and also a shift in demand for low priced products Against this backdrop  let s try to determine how these players   Mondelez International  Inc    NASDAQ MDLZ    Archer Daniels Midland Company   NYSE ADM   and Fresh Del Monte Produce  Inc    NYSE FDP     are placed ahead of their earnings release on May 2 Mondelez International  Inc   which is slated to report first quarter 2017 results  delivered a negative earnings surprise of 4 08  last quarter  In the three quarters prior to that  the Oreo maker came up with positive earnings surprises  with the four quarter average beat being 11 71  Our proven model does not conclusively show that Mondelez is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Mondelez has an Earnings ESP of  2   This is because the Most Accurate estimate of 49 cents stands below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 50 cents   This leaves our prediction inconclusive even though the company carries a favorable Zacks Rank  3  You can see  Mondelez s volumes have been hurt since 2014 mainly due to soft consumer demand  The company has been struggling due to shifting consumer s preference toward natural and organic ingredients over packaged and processed food Macroeconomic headwinds in the Middle East and Brazil  the post demonetization impact in India  and adverse currency fluctuations could further restrict sales growth in the to be reported quarter  Foreign exchange is a major headwind for Mondelez with about 75  of its revenues coming from outside the U S  We expect these headwinds to continue in the to be reported quarter Nonetheless  Mondelez has been focusing on expanding margins through cost savings and productivity improvement  These initiatives are paying off and could boost the company s margins and thereby its bottom line in the first quarter  read more    Mondelez International  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise

all the other three negative surprises and has a positive average surprise of 2 53  Our proven model shows that Archer Daniels Midland may beat earnings because it has the right combination of the two key components  Currently  the company has a Zacks Rank  3 and an Earnings ESP of  1 64  as the Most Accurate estimate of 62 cents is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 61 cents Further  the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 61 cents per share for the first quarter reflects growth of 45 6  from the year ago quarter  Also  analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of  15 3 billion for the quarter

company surpassed estimates in all of the past four quarters and has an average positive surprise of 166 74  Our proven model does not conclusively show that Fresh Del Monte is likely to beat earnings this quarter  Fresh Del Monte has an Earnings ESP of 0 00   This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are currently pegged at  1 17  However  the company carries

13512,235027,HSY,Technical Analysis  C COCOA   2017 05 01,opinion,"Cote d Ivoire reduced the export of raw cocoa beans
The Cocoa prices declined by 44  over the last 12 months  Meanwhile  Cote d Ivoire  the world s largest cocoa producer  decreased the export of raw beans in 2016 17 season by 2 3  compared to the same period of the previous season  Will the  ocoa prices rise 
The 2016 17 agricultural season started from October 1  2016  From that time till the end of March of the current year  the export from Cote d Ivoire amounted to 892 7 thousand tonnes compared to 914 thousand tonnes for the same period of the previous season  Deliveries of cocoa semi finished products on the world market from the Cote d Ivoire have slightly increased by 2 5  and amounted to 219 3 thousand tonnes since the beginning of 2016 17 season 
Meanwhile  market participants expected a considerable growth in the world cocoa production  Recently  its prices have slumped to the lowest in 9 and a half years  According to the U S  Commodities Futures Trading Commission  the net short position on cocoa reached the highest in 11 years  which may indicate a significant activity of speculators 
Cote d Ivoire accounts for 36  of the world production of this agricultural product  Theoretically  a weak growth of exports from this country may cause an upward correction of cocoa prices  Note  that the US Hershey Company  NYSE HSY  reported an increase in the quarterly revenue from the sales of chocolate products by 2 8  to  1 88 bn  It may be assumed that this indicates about a stable high demand not only in the US but also in other developed countries 

On the time frame  the Cocoa  D1 is in a downtrend  but  at the same time  it is trying to correct upwards  The price growth is possible in case of a decline in world harvest with a stable high demand for chocolate 
The Parabolic indicator gives a bullish signal 
The Bollinger bands have widened which means higher volatility 
The  is below 50  No divergence 
The  gives bullish signals 
The bullish momentum may develop in case Cocoa exceeds the last fractal high at 1900  This level may serve as a entry point  The initial stop loss may be placed below the Parabolic signal and the last fractal low at 1750 
After opening the pending order  we shall move the stop to the next fractal low following the Bollinger and Parabolic signals  Thus  we are changing the potential profit loss to the breakeven point  More risk averse traders may switch to the 4 hour chart after the trade and place there a stop loss moving it in the direction of the trade  If the price meets the stop level at 1750 without reaching the order at 1900 we recommend cancelling the position  the market sustains internal changes that were not taken into account

13525,235040,HSY,A Post Fed Market Still In Bullish Position ,opinion,"AT40   56 7  of stocks are trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs AT200   57 5  of stocks are trading above their respective 200DMAsVIX   10 4  volatility index Short term Trading Call  cautiously bullish
Commentary The Federal Reserve gave the permission to the stock market that I awaited well  sort of 
On Wednesday  June 14  2017    The statement included another rate hike of 25 basis points   25   and the official launch of the Fed s effort to reduce the size of its balance sheet  During   Fed Chair Janet Yellen had the opportunity to knock down stocks but instead took a pass 

 We have certainly noticed the stock market is up considerably over the last year  That usually shows up in financial conditions indexes and is an important reason why some of them show easier financial conditions  

With the Fed ever so slowing tightening monetary conditions  Yellen could have easily noted a relative loftiness of stock valuations 
The S P 500  SPY  NYSE SPY   ended that day flat but lost a few points going into the end of the week  Its 20 day moving average  DMA  uptrend held up as support  Another Bollinger Band   BB  squeeze seems underway  but I am guessing the index is in for an extended period of consolidation until at least earnings next month  Investors will likely want to confirm all is well  or not  on the earnings front before making any decisive post Fed moves 

The S P 500  SPY  looks like it has started another consolidation period that will include marginal all time highs 

For the first time in a while  the NASDAQ is under performing the S P 500  The tech laden index has yet to mount a serious reversal of the big 1 day sell off from June 9th  Its 50 day moving average  DMA  is still holding as support  the same for the related PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ  which represents the biggest 100 stocks of the NASDAQ 

Despite a sudden and sharp 1 day plunge  the NASDAQ  and QQQ  is holding support at its uptrending 50DMA 

AT40  T2108   the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 40DMAs  fell from its high pre Fed perch of 64 2  and closed the week at 56 7   This performance is still impressive given the recent calamities in big cap high tech  AT40 did not get quite close enough to overbought status  above 70   for me to declare this pullback a bearish moment  AT200  T2107   the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 200DMAs  is performing similarly to AT40 
To underline the overall strength of the market  the volatility index remains comfortably seated in extreme lows  Each visit above 12  and even each stretch to solid intra day gains  has been met with a subsequent implosion of volatility  In the wake of the Fed on Thursday  I departed from my strategy of quickly locking in profits from my call options on ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures  NYSE UVXY   I thought maybe  just maybe  the market might churn further  even if just for one more day  in angst over the implications of the Fed s latest move  I am now sitting on a small loss as a sharp reminder to stick to the script 

The volatility index  the VIX  has a path of least resistance down to 14 year lows 

The ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures ETF  UVXY  continues to be attracted to all time lows like a moth to a flame 

There are a lot of sub themes I want to cover for additional color on the market and for my strategy going forward  for at least the next month or so until earnings   I have divided these into sections 
Tech stocks As I stated   I used the swoon on big cap tech to trade the call options and or shares of PowerShares QQQ Trust  QQQ   Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   and NVIDIA Corporation  NASDAQ NVDA   Seeing AAPL continue to weaken  I decided on Thursday to speculate on a hedged  swing trade  approach  I bought call options on Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL  and put options on Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX   While I eked out a small gain in GOOG  NFLX was a complete bust as it rallied into the end of the week   the exact opposite of what AAPL did 

Apple  AAPL  has yet to recover form the swoon in big cap tech stocks 

Netflix  NFLX  broke down below 50DMA support but sellers have yet to follow through  Based on trading volume  buying interest is starting to take shape over selling interest 

Alphabet  GOOG  has yet to test uptrending 50DMA support  However  sellers still have the advantage in trading volume 
It just so happened Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN  was the best big cap tech stock to play for the week  On Friday  AMZN even came within  0 25 of returning to the psychologically important  1000 level  I wish I had AMZN call options in play  but at least I did not leave the AMZN story of the week empty handed 
Retail Groceries The biggest news from Friday was the move by Amazon com  AMZN  to buy out Whole Foods Market Inc  NASDAQ WFM   AMZN offered to buy WFM for  13 7B in an all cash deal  While this deal sent WFM soaring 29 1   the truly remarkable reaction was the parallel 2 4  gain in AMZN which added about  11 1B in market cap 

Whole Foods Market  WFM  completed a breakout from a very extended consolidation period  Ironically enough  M A speculation was rampant at the beginning of this period 

Amazon com  AMZN  essentially purchased WFM for  free  with a 2 4  gain in its stock as a reward for offering to buy WFM  AMZN s 50DMA survived as a firm support for the swoon in big cap tech stocks 

The stock market essentially made the deal a no brainer for AMZN as the company received WFM almost for free  Yet  industry wide there were PLENTY of costs which turned the AMZN WFM gain into a giant sucking sound   that outlined a slew of casualties  The collateral damage ranged from grocery stores 

Grocers suffered substantial losses on the day thanks to Amazon s offer for Whole Foods Market 
 to any store which sells food  trading down on heavy volume were Wal Mart  NYSE WMT  by 4 7  although up notably from its low of the day  Costco  NASDAQ COST  by 7 2   and Target Corporation  NYSE TGT  by 5 1  which was down as much as a whopping 12 4  at its low of the day  I wish my trading radar was up on THAT move   
 to packaged goods companies which now face potentially tougher negotiations from a robust Amazon grocery business  Hershey Company  NYSE HSY  lost 2 7   my buying radar is up    Kellogg Company  NYSE K  lost 1 7   and Mondelez International Inc  NASDAQ MDLZ  lost 1 5  all on heavy trading volume 
 to shopping center REITs which include grocers as tenants  considered by many to be stable renters 

Shopping center REITs took major hits thanks to the Amazon offer for Whole Foods
Even payment processor Vantiv Inc  NYSE VNTV  took a 3 8  hit on high volume because presumably it will lose business due to the combined AMZN WFM entity  The one sliver of sympathy benefit came from Impinj  PI  which soared 19 1  on high volume  This is a gain I will not chase  the move seems like an extremely speculative bet on a gain in business from WFM transactions that will presumably use RFIDs  Radio Frequency Identity tags  thanks to Amazon s prowess in inventory automation  PI went public a year ago  The stock now sits at a fresh all time high 

Impinj Inc  NASDAQ PI  soared to a new all time high thanks to the Amazon for Whole Foods deal 
The ironic component of the market action was the large dip in WFM the previous day  Presumably in sympathy with a poor earnings report from Kroger Company  NYSE KR   WFM plunged 6 7   KR sank 18 9   I happened to be holding a substantial amount of WFM stock from an accumulation I made after fresh buyout talk rumors in April  If I had not just gone through  with Nordstrom  NYSE JWN  where that stock plunged ahead of fantastic news and a big one day jump  I would have cut my losses and bailed on WFM  Instead  I bit my lip  ground my teeth  and held  Thank goodness I did  I sold my shares into the post Amazon gap up 
On Friday  I decided to start accumulating KR  The grocery business has been a rough business for a very long time  It has gone through cycles like the current one  Sure AMZN is poised to put a new twist on the competitive pressure  but the history for grocers is one of adaptability  To start my bet on a future rebound  I sold a single put option on KR expiring in January  2018  I will be looking for additional opportunities to accumulate  likely using long term call options   I have yet to figure out how to play the rest of the ripple effects of AMZN WFM  but I strongly suspect some good value will emerge from the rubble  There are likely even good pairs trades in the mix 

The Kroger Company  NYSE KR  suffered a double whammy on its way to losing as much as a third of its value in two days  Buyers stepped in at Friday s lows in a move that looks like an early attempt at bottoming 

Autos In   I introduced my thoughts on plays in the market for used cars  Since then  I made major changes to my positioning  With earnings approaching on Wednesday  June 21st for CarMax Inc  NYSE KMX   I decided to take a small profit in my short position  I will be watching the results closely and looking for a reason to get short again  I also took profits and sold my latest tranche of shares in Carvana  CVNA   With CVNA trading above its upper Bollinger Band  BB   I figured it would pull back  and I would buy back shares relatively quickly  That trade turned out to be premature in a big way  CVNA is up another 27  and running 

Carvana Co  NYSE CVNA  is on the verge of going parabolic in the wake of an earnings report that has clearly excited investors and traders 

The spin off Cars com Inc  NYSE CARS  finally showed some life  On Friday  CARS jumped 3 2  off its lows on slightly higher volume  I am still looking for this stock to challenge  and then surpass  its highest trading level to date 

Cars com  CARS  finally stirred again  Is this the beginning of a recovery from a brief pullback 

Snapchat Snap Inc  SIX SNAPC deserves its own section  I covered my last short position on June 7th as I figured SNAP was  close enough  to its IPO price and thus presented a poor risk reward for staying short  Moreover  margin interest continued to creep higher  I think when I locked in profits  interest charges had gone up as high as 32   annualized   I am now 100  long again as I fully speculate that by next earnings SNAP will figure out a way to re excite investors and traders about its shares  perhaps with some timely help from underwriters   I just hope the stock does not break below its  17 IPO price again  otherwise SNAP could be launching through earnings from much lower levels  Also at stake will be pricing the deluge of shares sure to come after insider lock ups expire starting sometime in September  I assume  

Snap  Inc   SNAP  closed the week with a 3 2  pop  but the stock is in a precarious position now that it managed to close below its IPO price  every post IPO bull is now a loser in this stock  
Fed Rate Trades Now I bring things all the way back to where I started the Fed  As has been the case for some time  the market reacted to the Fed s rate hike in exactly the opposite intended direction  long term rates decreased further  The iShares 20  Year Treasury Bond ETF  NASDAQ TLT  gapped up above 200DMA resistance and closed at its highest point since election day  TLT seems perfectly poised to join the long and growing list of Trump trades that have completely reversed 
The iShares 20  Year Treasury Bond ETF  TLT  GAINED from the Fed s rate hike and has confirmed a bullish breakout above 200DMA resistance 
The decline in rates made the going tough for financials  The Financial Select Sector SPDR  NYSE XLF  remains in a bullish breakout from a previously ominous head and shoulders pattern  Yet  XLF has also failed to follow through on the breakout 
The Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund  XLF  is still looking for follow through on its bullish breakout 
Strangely enough  gold  GLD  NYSE GLD   and iShares Silver  NYSE SLV  failed to gain from the decline in interest rates  Both precious metals gapped higher along with TLT and maintained a correlation that I would expect  Yet both faded hard into the day s close and closed the week with a slight post Fed loss  I will be watching this divergence closely for a new opportunity to execute pairs trades 

The SPDR Gold Trust  P GLD  is struggling to hold 50DMA support 

The iShares Silver Trust  NYSE SLV  confirmed resistance at its now downtrending 50 and 200DMAs 
And then there is the U S  dollar index  The dollar had to rally off its intraday low to close flat on Wednesday  The dollar rallied the next day and sold down on Friday  It sits on a very marginal post Fed gain that I am betting will melt away in due time with the dollar index returning to its previous  grinding  downtrend 

The US Dollar Index is churning below its level from its close on election day 
Note well that the market disagrees with the Fed on the timing for the next rate hike  Yellen is still talking up at least one more rate hike this year  The 30 day Fed Fund futures say another rate hike is not coming until at least March  2018  this behavior may explain how and why long term rates decreased   

 The median projection for the federal funds rate is 1 4 percent at the end of this year  2 1 percent at the end of next year  and 2 9 percent at the end of 2019  about in line with its estimated longerrun value  Compared with the projections made in March  the median path for the federal funds rate is essentially unchanged  


Despite another Fed rate hike and messaging indicating another should come this year  the 30 Day Fed Fund futures market has pushed out the 50 50 point on the next rate hike from January to March

 Our statement indicates that we expect inflation to remain low in the near term  But on the other hand  we continue to feel that with a strong labor market and labor market that s continuing to strengthen  the conditions are in place for inflation to move up  Now  obviously we need to monitor that very carefully  
Business people and consumers have yet to plan for any economic impact from President Trump s wishes for fiscal policy 
 I would say that based on my observation of actual spending behavior and my discussions with our wide range of contacts that I haven t seen very much evidence that thus far expectations of policy changes have driven substantial changes in either consumer spending or investment spending  
Monetary policy remains accommodative 
 We re not moving so aggressively as to put a break on continued improvement in the labor market  
No one has any good idea on where the neutral Fed rate sits 
 And also the fact  we re quite uncertain ourselves about what the likely  what the evolution will be of the neutral federal funds rate  So  we do try to write that down and provide the public with information about our current expectations  And the median now stands at around 3 percent but we have uncertainty about that  Many of my colleagues  and I  think that the current neutral level is lower than that  And as I said in my opening statement  the fed funds rate path reflects an expectation that that neutral rate will be moving up some in future years  But that remains uncertain and I think that s something that market participants are trying to assess and we will be as well  
Balance sheet reduction will have no market impact  emphasis mine 
 So that when this plan does go into effect  no one is taken by surprise and market participants understand how this will work  I think that we  the plan is one that is consciously intended to avoid creating market strains and to allow the market to adjust to a very gradual and predictable plan  My hope and expectation is that when we decide to go forward with this plan  that there will be very little reaction to it  that it s clear how we intend to proceed and that this is something that will just run quietly in the background over a number of years  leading to a reduction in the size of our balance sheet and in the outstanding stock of reserves  and that it s something that the committee will not be reconsidering from time to time  We think this is a workable plan and it will  as one of my colleagues  President Harker described it  it will be like watching paint dry  that this will just be something that runs quietly in the background  
The best estimate for the launch of balance sheet reduction is  soon  
  if the economy evolves in line with our expectations which  you know  we will be watching  always are  we could put this into effect relatively soon  
Dodd Frank regulations have not impeded credit growth 
  with respect to the impact of credit conditions and bank regulation on slow growth  I previously in testifying indicated that I don t think that our regulations have played an important role at least broadly speaking in impeding credit growth and the growth of the economy  And I ve pointed in the past to a number of statistics suggesting that credit growth continues to be healthy  including among small  smaller community banks that are most concerned with regulatory burden

13532,235047,HSY, Sweetest  town clings to Hershey  adding to takeover hurdles,news,"By Koh Gui Qing HERSHEY  Pennsylvania  Reuters    The town of Hershey  Pennsylvania  calls itself the  sweetest place on earth   But if chocolate giant  Hershey Co    N HSY  considers any new acquisition offer in the coming weeks  it could face bitter opposition from some in its namesake town  where residents have prospered from its presence and tend to be fierce defenders of its independence  The impact of such views goes beyond sentimental in the wake of Mondelez International Inc s  O MDLZ   23 billion bid to buy the company  which Hershey said on June 30 it had rejected  The town of Hershey  where the company s staunchest loyalists are referred to as  Hershey ites   has real influence over corporate decisions  The Hershey Trust  a  12 billion school charity and the company s controlling shareholder  has become increasingly involved in the local community over the decades  and has appeared to listen to its concerns in the past  Pennsylvania s attorney general  who supervises the trust and can ask a court to block any deal  holds an elected office and is sensitive to local concerns  though the current office holder is not planning to seek reelection  Pennsylvania law requires any charitable trust to consider  when selling an asset  the  special relationship of the asset and its economic impact as a principal business enterprise on the community  and the  special value  of its ties to the community  Since the company was founded by Milton Hershey 122 years ago  residents here have fought many plans that would have changed Hershey Co  and  in turn  a community built around one of the world s most famous confectioners  Although the Hershey Trust rejected the bid by the maker of Oreos cookies  a spike in Hershey s share price above the bid of  107 per share has indicated investors expect a new offer  Many in the rural town of around 14 000 people voiced apprehension to Reuters about a sale  despite apparent reassurances from Mondelez   The food and beverage multinational has offered to keep Hershey s name  move its headquarters to Hershey  and preserve jobs  according to people familiar with the matter who declined to be identified because Mondelez has not disclosed details of the bid  Most residents declined to give their full names  citing local sensitivities around discussing the firm  which employs 4 800 people here   I don t think they should sell the company   said a 76 year old woman who gave her name as G C   as she guided visitors through Hershey s Chocolate World  a sprawling candy store stocked with giant chocolate bars   Hershey is Hershey  It should always be Milton Hershey  He did good for the community   said the woman  who has worked at Chocolate World for eight years        IT S ALWAYS BEEN HERSHEY  A 3 5 hour train ride from New York  Hershey stretches out across verdant fields between delectably named streets such as Chocolate Avenue and Cocoa Avenue  Between well tended lawns and street lamps shaped like the popular Hershey s Kisses Chocolate  Hershey is dotted with landmarks from a theater to a cemetery that are tied to the confectioner  Residents point to houses built by Milton Hershey for his factory workers and extol the  Hershey legacy   where a successful business looks after the people  the way Hershey did at the height of the Great Depression in the 1930s by embarking on a construction spree in town to create jobs   House prices and income levels in Hershey are substantially higher compared to neighboring towns in Pennsylvania  according to government data  Today  the heart of the  Hershey legacy  is arguably found in the Milton Hershey School  a private boarding school for around 2 000 students from low income families  Their education and living expenses are paid for by the Hershey Trust  which is funded by the Trust s stake in the chocolate maker   Everyone who worked for Mr Hershey always had a job   said Ernie  a 69 year old Hershey worker who declined to give his last name   It s always been Hershey   Asked about the town s role in the company  Hershey Co  said   We are proud of the company s rich heritage and the Hershey community   Spokespeople at Mondelez were not immediately available for a comment  The town s devotion to its roots has led to confrontations in the past  Back in 2002 when Wm  Wrigley Jr   renowned for its chewing gum  attempted to buy Hershey for  12 5 billion  irate local residents signed petitions and staged rallies to stop plans to sell the company  The then attorney general sought to block the deal  prompting the Trust to call off the sale at the last minute  When some residents complained about the planned demolition of parts of an old Hershey factory in 2012  the company went ahead anyway   People like things to stay the way they are   said a 63 year old resident who has lived in Hershey since 1978   To be sure  not all Hershey residents are attached to the status quo  Some younger residents voiced indifference to the future of the candy maker  saying practical business considerations should take precedence  On paper  a sale to Mondelez could benefit Hershey   Hershey has a strong U S  presence while Mondelez has a global network  A marriage of the two would create the world s largest confectionary company with an estimated 18 percent of the market share  said market research firm Euromonitor International Ltd  While Mondelez has vowed to keep Hershey s name and preserve jobs  some said such promises would ring empty with loyal  Hershey ites   U S  food giant Kraft  now known as Kraft Heinz Co  O KHC   drew controversy in 2010 after it shut a factory in southwest England following its takeover of Cadbury  now owned by Mondelez  reneging on an earlier promise to keep the factory open    Would I like it to be sold  No   said the 63 year old resident

13534,235049,HSY,Earnings And Macro Data To Drive Financial Markets This Week,opinion,"Last week s robust U S  corporate announcement indicated that there s a high chance for corporate America to get out of its five consecutive quarter long profit recession  According to factset  78  of S P 500 companies reported earnings that beat on the bottom line and 65  beat on the top line 
Upside earnings surprises its way above the historic average of 66   which could be interpreted as good news for the overstretched equities valuations  however earning guidance is not showing the same trend with 10 out of 17 S P 500 companies issuing a negative EPS guidance so far 
Another worrying signal is the level of cash sitting on the sidelines now  According to Blackrock   50 trillion of worldwide holdings are in cash now  showing that many investors are concerned about the markets next move whether it s in equities or fixed income 
The week ahead is very busy on the corporate front  with more than third of S P 500 companies reporting results  Many investors would like to know how many iPhones Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  sold in the third quarter  while others are more interested in the energy sector  which was the main drag on earnings with companies such as Exxon Mobil  NYSE XOM  and Chevron  NYSE CVX   General Motors  NYSE GM   Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL   Caterpillar  NYSE CAT   P G  NYSE PG   Mylan  NASDAQ MYL   Mastercard  NYSE MA   and Hershey  NYSE HSY  are only a few among those reporting next week  so lot of data to digest 
On the macro front  third quarter GDP figures from UK and the US will be closely monitored by investors 
On Thursday  UK will offer a first glimpse into the performance of the economy after voting to leave the European Union  The flash Q3 GDP data is forecasted to show 0 3  growth compared to last year  less than half of second quarter s 0 7   Albeit growth is slowing  the immediate impact of the Brexit vote on the economy is far less than what had been expected  but this is likely to change if the divorce negotiations went the hard way  were a recession will be very hard to escape 
In the U S  we re looking for an opposite scenario  where economic activity likely picked up after a disappointing first half of 2016  Markets are looking for a 2 5  economic growth in Q3 from a 1 4  in Q2  Any figure below 2  will likely kill the idea of Fed raising rates in December  and thus pull back the dollar from its seven month high

13536,235051,HSY,Who Will Win The Halloween Sales Race ,opinion,"For most adults  Halloween is a minor holiday  But if you work at a candy company  Halloween is like Black Friday on steroids 
In the U S   Halloween candy sales are more than sales from Easter and Valentine s Day combined  The holiday accounts for about 10  of the industry s annual total sales  That s a recipe for fierce competition between confectioners 
Who will win the Halloween sales race this year  To find out  we re looking at the three largest publicly traded candy companies in the U S  Their performances and earnings can help us predict which will come out on top this October 31 
Mondelez International
Mondelez  NASDAQ MDLZ  is the successor to Kraft Foods  NASDAQ KHC   after the company spun off its grocery division in 2012  It s a massive conglomerate and owns many household names in the candy industry  Nabisco  Cadbury and Toblerone are all Mondelez holdings 
The company has a commanding share of the U S  candy market  But that s no guarantee of financial success  And lately  Mondelez stock performance has been subpar at best  It missed an earnings estimate two quarters ago and in 2016  its shares are down 3  year to date 

Hershey Company
Hershey  NYSE HSY  is the largest chocolate manufacturer in North America  In addition to its chocolate bar  morsel and syrup brands  Hershey owns Reese s  Mr  Goodbar and Krackel  It is also the only company profiled here that runs a theme park 
Hershey is a force to be reckoned with in the chocolate niche  And that specialization has paid off financially  It has beaten earnings estimates by wide margins in each of the last four quarters  Hershey stock is up almost 10  this year  But it experienced some seasonal decline at the beginning of this month 

General Mills Inc 
General Mills  NYSE GIS  is one of the oldest and largest food manufacturers in the U S  Its holdings include supermarket staples like Cheerios  Yoplait Yogurt and Green Giant 
But General Mills has more of a niche candy operation than the other companies we ve examined  Its Betty Crocker dessert line mainly sells fruit snacks and gummies  It produces Gushers  Fruit by the Foot and Fruit Roll Ups 
For this reason  General Mills  Halloween sales potential is more limited than Hershey or Mondelez  And its financials are OK  but not great  General Mills has barely met earnings expectations for the last three quarters  Its stock is up 13  this year  but it recently experienced a big sell off during the September retail slump 

Wrap up
So whose candy will reign supreme this Halloween  It s hard to say  Mondelez wins in total size and market share  General Mills has the best performing stock this year  But Hershey has the strongest earnings  decent stock performance and a firm hold on the chocolate bar market 
It seems as though the Pennsylvania based chocolatiers have the biggest potential to make gains this Halloween

13537,235052,HSY,Hershey CEO To Step Down  What s Next ,opinion,"John Bilbrey  Hershey Company  NYSE HSY  s CEO  has announced that he will step down from his position and retire on July 1 before remaining with the famous chocolate manufacturer as a non executive chairman  He joined the organization in 2003 and was moved into his present position in 2011 
Under his leadership  Hershey turned down Oreo cookie maker Mondelez International Inc s  NASDAQ MDLZ s attempt to purchase it in August 2016  During the months prior  when speculation of a buyout dominated discussion  Hershey s stock rose  but it immediately deflated after it turned down the final buyout effort  Mondelez would not go above  115 a share  and Hershey refused to accept an offer for less than  125 a share 
However  Hershey s market share did double to  20 billion and its market share did increase from 28 percent to 31 percent during Bilbrey s five years as CEO 
Three months ago  the company s charitable trust  which holds 81 percent of the company s voting stock  and overseer  the Pennsylvania attorney general s office  reached a major reform agreement  indicating that significant changes may be coming 
Part of that is due to significant changes in the trust s board  which is increasing from 10 to 13 members while six of those original 10 board members have recently resigned or will soon do so  creating nine openings on the board  The attorney general s position has been in flux too as Kathleen Kane resigned from her role on Aug  17 after being convicted on a variety of charges  Bruce Castor took over the role for the next 13 days before Bruce Beemer assumed it  However  his term ends in January 
Any future sale involving Hershey will likely require approval of the state s attorney general 
Bilbrey  who is 60 and is also known as J P   had replaced David West as CEO after West abruptly left his position following three years in the role to work for Del Monte Foods  West had come under criticism for failing to acquire British candy maker Cadbury in 2010 
Prior to joining Hershey  Bilbrey had worked for McCormick  Mission Foods  Danone Waters and Proctor   Gamble  He earned a bachelor s degree in psychology from Kansas State University in 1978 
Bilbrey is planning to spend more time with his family  However  before he does so  he will   remain involved with the business with the support of a great management team   which he wrote in an email to the company s employees that announced his impending retirement 
A special committee has been created by Hershey to direct the search process for Bilbrey s replacement  which will involve reviewing both external and internal candidates for the role ",2016-10-18,Jesse Boskoff,https://www.investing.com/analysis/hershey-ceo-to-step-down.-what's-next-200159334,200159334
13538,235053,HSY,5 Stocks To Watch Before Market Open  MA  XOM  CVX  RCL  HSY,opinion,"Mastercard Inc  NYSE MA   Better than expected earnings from Visa Inc  NYSE V  and American Express  NYSE AXP  in all likelihood set the stage for a surprise report from Mastercard    on Friday  Earnings have topped estimates the past 2 quarters despite what experts believe is a weak consumer spending environment 
The third quarter is expected to maintain strong volume and transaction growth mainly on the back of recent partnerships and acquisitions  Mastercard recently partnered with PayPal Holdings Inc  NASDAQ PYPL  to increase its usage on the online payments platform  A common theme from previous reports were strong international transaction growth supporting an overall uptake in volume coupled with lower loss provisions from less frequent defaulting 
Exxon Mobil  NYSE XOM   From a financial standpoint  Exxon Mobil    is still one of the premier companies to own  Its buyback programs and robust dividends have attracted investors even when the stock was down  Its strength lies in its balanced operations  financial flexibility and efforts to cut costs and improve efficiency 
Upstream earnings should show improvements after a modest rise in oil prices  a ramp up of drilling activities  and a production resurgence in key projects  Though those gains might be offset by beaten down commodity prices  Downstream operations  on the other hand  are likely to come in even lower  Earlier this year management indicated slim growth in the medium term but for what it s worth  this quarter should be better than the last 
Chevron  NYSE CVX   Chevron    saw some improvement in the second quarter recording a 2  decline on the bottom line and 27  on the top  The slight appreciation in oil prices during the quarter was largely credited with the uptake  Unfortunately crude futures were down during the third quarter which does not bode well for Chevron  one of the most oil weighted majors 
This slight downturn can take its toll on upstream segment while its refining business is starting to show signs of weakness  Ongoing asset sales will help save the balance sheet but could put a damper on production during the quarter  Similar to its peer  Chevron also has strong financial flexibility  a strong balance sheet and a track record for rewarding its shareholders 
Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd  NYSE RCL   Royal Caribbean    generates a majority of its revenue outside of the United States  leaving it prone to macroeconomic uncertainty and currency headwinds  This has played a role in the slowdown delivered in recent quarters and should only become worse as Brexit unravels 
Meanwhile higher marketing spend  increased cruise costs and greater competition could dent the quarter s performance  Nonetheless the cruiseliner has consistently delivered positive revenue growth on the back of strong booking trends  technological innovation and expanding capacity growth  Analysts are confident that Friday s results will show an improvement from its dismal second quarter report 
Hershey Company  NYSE HSY   In late August  it was rumored that Mondelez International Inc  NASDAQ MDLZ  was interested in purchasing Hershey    for roughly  23 billion  The deal was abandoned almost as soon as it began and now Hershey s is left to its own devices to jump start growth  Sales have been on a continual trend down from weak category trends  increasing competition and soft international growth 
The company has cut guidance twice this year to reflect the ongoing challenges that it faces domestically and worldwide  Management doesn t expect this to persist through the second half of 2016 but the Estimize community would beg to differ  Analysts are forecasting a 2  increase on the bottom line and 3  on the top  reflecting an evident slowdown from the second quarter ",2016-10-28,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/5-stocks-to-watch-before-the-market-opens-friday-morning-200161269,200161269
13539,235054,HSY,Divergences Weigh Further On The Stock Market,opinion,"T2108 Status  29 5 T2107 Status  56 2 VIX Status  16 2General  Short term  Trading Call  neutralActive T2108 periods  Day  176 over 20   Day  1 under 30   underperiod   Day  4 under 40   Day  21 under 50   Day  36 under 60   Day  62 under 70 
CommentaryThe complacency going into this earnings season came to a definitive end this past week  The divergences exposing the stock market s underlying weakness further expanded and are even more striking  The pressures have pushed   the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 40 day moving averages  DMAs   ever closer to oversold territory  below 20    T2107  the percentage of stocks trading above their respective 200DMAs  looks like it topped out 

T2108 has firmly returned to the post Brexit lows and sits within striking distance of oversold levels  Can my favorite technical indicator bounce from this support one more time 


T2107 is ominously topping out as the post recession downtrend reasserts itself 
The S P 500  SPY  NYSE SPY   is performing valiantly given it has failed to break free from 50DMA resistance since Fedspeak helped knock it down in early September  I am still assuming that a trading range is in effect until the U S  Presidential election  but that assumption looks ever more tenuous 

The 50DMA once again capped the S P 500  SPY   It closed the week drooping toward the bottom of the recent range 
Suddenly the NASDAQ Composite  QQQ  is also struggling with its 50DMA  Just a month ago  the NASDAQ s out performance shone as a market beacon  On Monday  the tech laden index gapped up convincingly toward its all time high  The index sold off for four straight days and ended the week with a 50DMA breakdown  The chart below suggests that the NASDAQ is working on a double top  A breach of September s low would confirm the double top  Bears should duly note how the sharp and intense selling following Brexit set the stage for invalidating the last double top that formed with the April and June highs 

The NASDAQ  QQQ  gapped up to start the week and then proceeded to sell off the rest of the week to a new closing low for October  The tech laden index is finally looking toppy 
Interestingly  election related news likely drove the market s latest bout of weakness  The S P 500 was working on drifting into the close with a small gain when news broke about FBI Director James Comey sending a letter to Congress about new Hillary Clinton emails  Rumors  commentary  and counter commentary swirled  but the stock market never managed to stage a complete comeback  The 5 minute chart below shows the knockdown and subsequent volatility 

This 5 minute chart shows how quickly the S P 500  SPY  sold off on the latest news of Clinton emails  The market never fully recovered as clarifications rolled on throughout the day 
Given T2108 was around 30  and seeing how fast the market reacted to   I decided to jump on SPY call options  When the market first bounced  I was astounded to see the call options gain over 30   I quickly took profits and set a limit order to buy again at my original price  Sure enough  the market obliged  I then decided to double down with put options on ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures  NYSE UVXY   The volatility index  the VIX  soared on the day but faded hard from its intraday high  I strongly suspect that the VIX will cool down on Monday  This assumption is risky since the VIX closed above the 15 35 pivot  Note the series of lower highs and higher lows forming a subtle wedge pattern on the VIX  I am basically betting that volatility will quickly calm back down as it has done with recent spikes 

The volatility index  CBOE Volatility Index  popped above the 15 35 pivot point but faded from its intraday high  Bears and sellers have regained the advantage but for how much longer 
I consider my bullish trades as a  special case  given the overall deterioration in the underpinnings of the market  I am keeping my short term bias on neutral only because T2108 is so close to oversold territory  My favorite technical indicator demonstrates most clearly the dangers in the market when juxtaposed with the S P 500  T2107 confirms the red flag  Small cap stocks are also adding to the danger signs  The iShares Russell 2000  NYSE IWM  closed at a new four month low and confirmed resistance at the 50DMA  A retest of 200DMA support is now in play 
Small cap stocks have confirmed an ominous failure at 50DMA resistance  These stocks add to the picture of a weakening foundation for the stock market 
The long standing deterioration in Powershares S P 500 Low Volatility Portfolio  NYSE SPLV  resumed this week with a confirmation of a 200DMA breakdown  granted it bounced slightly on Friday   The Powershares S P 500 High Beta Portfolio  NYSE SPHB  continued to hold its ground with rising 50DMA support  It looks like these high beta stocks will be the last to go 
PowerShares S P 500 Low Volatility ETF  SPLV  continues to sag  It 31 2 month downtrend exposes the underlying weakness of the S P 500 


The PowerShares S P 500 High Beta ETF  SPHB  continues to happily hug 50DMA support and is helping to prop up the overall S P 500 
The process for breaking down the high beta stocks may have finally begun with Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN  and Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL  putting on poor post earnings performances on Friday 
AMZN cleanly broke down below 50DMA support and even closed on its lows  However  assuming the market is in trading range mode  I pulled a play out of  and bought a 790 800 call spread expiring in two weeks  If I am correct about the trading range going into the election  I think AMZN could easily mount a relief rally back to 50DMA resistance and my  800 upside target 
Amazon com  AMZN  broke 50DMA support for the first time in 7 months  Notice the selling and weakness going into earnings 
Like AMZN  GOOG succumbed to mounting selling pressure going into earnings  Yet  GOOG s earnings results were enough to generate a gap up and even a follow up run back to all time highs  The sellers returned at that point and closed GOOG out exactly flat with the pre earnings close  I think this fade served as a sufficient confirmation that GOOG s rally will stall here  Support at the 50DMA is now in play 

Alphabet  GOOG  gapped and crapped after earnings initially challenged the all time high  The flat close puts at least the 50DMA support into play 

Pre earnings selling pressure was also telling for Chipotle Mexican Grill  NYSE CMG   CMG failed to break 200DMA resistance on October 10th  broke down below 50DMA support  made a half hearted recovery  sold off ahead of earnings  and then gapped down convincingly post earnings  CMG now trades at a fresh 3 year and 3 month low  Yet  sellers have not made more progress in the two following trading days  I am holding onto a call option that is the result of another successful trade on CMG using a long short configuration  This time around  I went back to options on both sides  I initiated the trade right after the open as CMG broke through its 52 week low  I locked in profits on the put as sellers pressured CMG well below its lower Bollinger Band   BB  

Chipotle Mexican Grill  CMG  broke down afresh from a poorly received earnings report  Buyers are now trying to hold the post earnings low as the latest level of support 

In general  the long short trades are working very well in the wake of earnings reactions  I was burned enough with earlier attempts to anticipate the direction of post earnings trades  One time the market follows momentum  another time the market fades momentum   I managed to find myself on the wrong side with Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX  and Caterpillar  NYSE CAT   As part of my lesson  I followed   NYSE WHR  but married call options to my put options  Sure enough  WHR soared on Friday  I locked in profits on the call options as a partial payment for the put options 
Edwards Lifesciences Corporation  NYSE EW  provided another dramatic post earnings failure  In a rare bout of bad news  EW gapped down so hard it crashed through 200DMA support with a devastating 17 1  loss  On the next day  sellers looked primed to reverse all the gains form the April post earnings gap up  Buyers closed out the week and provided some hope that EW will at least challenge 200DMA resistance soon 

Edwards Life Sciences  EW  suffered a major post earnings 200DMA breakdown that threatens to erase its entire April post earnings breakout 

 apparently continues to weigh on the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology  NASDAQ IBB   On Friday  IBB confirmed its 200DMA breakdown with a gap down on heavy selling volume  I am a little bit late to the game  but I wanted to wait for confirmation  I bought my put option on an intraday relief rally 

The Bernie Bash remains alive and well after iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology  IBB  gapped down and confirmed 200DMA resistance 

Netflix had a stellar post earnings week but this week completely stalled out  After ignoring momentum and buying put options in the immediate wake of earnings  I am now eyeing NFLX like a hawk for a break from the current consolidation 

After a monster post earnings streak last week  Netflix  NFLX  completely stalled this week 
The iShares US Home Construction  NYSE ITB  has created one of the most disappointing breakdowns that I am tracking  I will write more about ITB in my next Housing Market Review  For now  I will just note how ITB broke down below 200DMA support and dropped straight through a series of housing reports  A big spike in long term bond yields pretty much confirmed the breakdown 

The iShares US Home Construction  ITB  sagged to a 7 month low after a series of data followed the ETF through a 200DMA breakdown 

On the bullish side  my trade on Alcoa  NYSE AA  worked out as the stock held support  I locked in profits on Friday with AA pressed against 200DMA resistance  The post earnings sell off was so strong  I doubt that AA can retest the top of it trading range anytime soon 

Alcoa  AA  passed the test and held support at the bottom of its trading range 

Also on the bullish side  I bought the post earnings 50DMA breakout for Freeport McMoran Copper   Gold Inc  NYSE FCX   I have been eyeing FCX for almost 2 weeks for my next play on its extended trading range  I bought call options and am targeting a run to the top of the range by December 

Freeport McMoRan Inc   FCX  received a nudge above 50DMA resistance thanks to earnings  It may finally make another run at the April July highs 
Hershey Company  NYSE HSY  soared after its earnings report  This breakout is so impressive  HSY looks ready to return to the highs carved out by the buyout offer from Mondelez  I am holding long term call options from buying on the test of 200DMA support  I was tempted to sell but did not  I think HSY is a clear buy on the dips going forward 
Hershey s soared into the gap post earnings on an impressive 50 200DMA breakout well above the upper Bollinger Band  BB  
One of the more intriguing dynamics in the market has developed between the U S  dollar index  DXY0  and precious metals  The U S  dollar index experienced a very strong October  Yet  neither SPDR Gold Shares  NYSE GLD  nor iShares Silver Trust  NYSE SLV  were thrown off their respective uptrending support lines from 200DMAs  My play on support still sits with SLV call options  I am not yet ready to add to the play with VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF  NYSE GDX  call options  I am still waiting for GLD to make a convincing push away from support  Regardless  I am thinking something has to give way in this dynamic  The U S  Presidential election will likely deliver the catalyst 

It looks like the US Dollar Indexhas come to the end of a month long streak


SPDR Gold Shares  GLD  has hung close to a rising 200DMA support  Imagine what might happen if the U S  dollar index starts declining 


Like GLD  the iShares Silver Trust  SLV  has closely followed its rising 200DMA support  A brewing Bollinger Band  BB  squeeze promises to resolve into a big move in the coming weeks

13556,235071,HSY,Hershey Looks Mighty Tasty,opinion,"Remember back in June when Mondelez International  NASDAQ MDLZ  made a  23 billion takeover bid for Hershey Company  NYSE HSY   The stock jumped from around  96 to  112  The bid was quickly rejected as analysis focused on the problems of a trust running a company  I kept the stock on my radar  waiting for signs of a pullback  But they never came  In fact I started saying that the stock looked more like it was ready for another move higher 
That move looks like it s underway right now  The chart below shows how a pop higher to consolidation between 108 and 112 has started to drift to the upside  The momentum indicators are improving  The RSI is turning back higher and the MACD is starting to level and remains positive  The Bollinger Bands  have tightened back to the point just before the move higher started back in May 

A Measured Move higher would target 125 above  There is some interest information in the longer dated November and January Calls as well  The biggest open interest in November is at the 120 Call Strike and in January there is big open interest at the 119 and 130 Strikes  There is also open interested accumulated from 90 to 105 on the Put side in January  September monthly options are big  near the current price with big open interest at the 110 Calls and 115 Puts 
None of this means that anything will happen with this stock but there does seem to be a lot of upside interest after the September expiry  And the price and momentum are shifting higher 
So if you were to forgot about the prior narrative and just follow price  you d probably buy this stock now for a break out ",2016-08-17,Gregory W. Harmon,https://www.investing.com/analysis/hershey-looks-mighty-tasty-200148543,200148543

Hershey shares soared to all time highs back in June after Mondelez  the self proclaimed world leader in  snacking   offered to take over the company in a cash and stock deal worth nearly  23 billion  Mondelez s initial offer was unanimously rejected by Hershey s board of directors 
 Our proposal to acquire Hershey reflected our conviction that combining our two iconic American companies would create an industry leader with global scale in snacking and confectionery and a strong portfolio of complementary brands   said Mondelez CEO Irene Rosenfeld 
 Following additional discussions  and taking into account recent shareholder developments at Hershey  we determined that there is no actionable path forward toward an agreement   While we are disappointed in this outcome  we remain disciplined in our approach to creating value  including through acquisitions  and confident that our advantaged platform positions us well for top tier performance over the long term   the chief executive added 
Deals involving Hershey are subject to approval by the Hershey Trust  which owns about 11  of the company s common stock and 81  of its voting rights  A merger between Mondelez and Hershey would have created the largest confectioner in the world  jumping the current leader  Mars Inc   for the top spot

Although missing forecasts  job growth remained steady coming off the prior two months  solid gains and some are pointing out that August has been one of the most revised months on the calendar  However  the softer than expected wage growth and hours worked may be causing some concern  After a brief drop following the report  September rate hike expectations rose back to near levels that preceded the data  while the U S  dollar reversed higher along with Treasury yields  Fed policy will likely drive much of any additional pickup in volatility and we expect to see the September odds move as economic data comes in over the next few weeks

European stocks higher despite soft U S  jobs report  Asia mixed 
European equities moved to the upside  with the markets digesting the softer than expected U S  nonfarm payroll report  which initially dampened recently heightened September Fed rate hike expectations  Oil   gas issues rebounded as crude oil prices recovered some of this week s sharp drop that had come on a rise in the U S  dollar amid heightened Fed rate hike expectations and as inventory data has fostered oversupply concerns  The equity markets in the region recovered from yesterday s downside reversal that followed a disappointing read on U S  manufacturing activity that overshadowed a jump in U K  manufacturing output  which continued to suggest the late June vote in the U K  to leave the European Union  known as a Brexit  is having a limited economic impact thus far 
The euro was lower and the British pound was higher versus the greenback  while bond yields in the region finished mixed 
Stocks in Asia finished mixed in subdued volume on continued cautious trading ahead of today s key employment report in the U S   which will follow yesterday s disappointing U S  manufacturing data that appeared to dampen recently heightened expectations that the Fed will hike rates this month  Japanese equities were little changed  holding onto solid weekly gains that have been fostered by weakness in the yen as the U S  dollar has rallied as of late amid the elevated Fed rate hike expectations  Chinese stocks  and those traded in Hong Kong advanced following some upbeat earnings results from the banking sector  Markets in Australia fell  as some weakness in healthcare  financials and oil and gas issues more than offset a rebound in the recently battered basic materials sector  while South Korean listings rose following the unexpected upward revision to its 2Q GDP growth to a 3 3  y y rate  from the initial 3 2  expansion  and up from the 2 8  pace posted in 1Q  Finally  Indian securities moved modestly to the upside 
Stocks shrug oil s drop and soft manufacturing data
U S  stocks finished modestly higher on the week  showing some resiliency in the face of a tumble in crude oil prices that pressured the energy sector on the recent strength in the U S  dollar and inventory data that sparked oversupply concerns  The greenback had received a boost after last Friday s speech from Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen and Vice Chair Fischer that suggested a September rate hike may be on the table  However  this week s data did little to change rate hike expectations  and financials continued to rally  Consumer Confidence and personal income and spending improved  and today s labor report showed job growth remained steady despite missing forecasts  countering an unexpected drop in the ISM Manufacturing Index into contraction territory for the first time since February and lackluster monthly auto sales  Global manufacturing reports were mostly positive  with U K  and Chinese activity rising back into expansion territory  while eurozone output continued to grow  Treasury yields dipped on the short to medium end of the curve in choppy action as traders grappled with the mixed data  Equity news was relatively light  though Dow member Apple Inc   NASDAQ AAPL  107  was in focus after the European Union  EU  Commission ruled that it was granted undue tax benefits in Ireland of up to  14 5 billion  Also  Hershey Company  NYSE HSY    HSY  100  fell after Mondelez International Inc   NASDAQ MDLZ  44  announced it has ended discussions regarding a possible combination of the two companies 
Short week will continue to bring key data

13563,235078,HSY,A Guide To Consumer Staples ETF Investing,opinion,"Most product categories across the consumer staples space have been doing really well over the past few months  In fact  amid tepid economic figures  Brexit aftershocks  Federal Reserve s reluctance to hike rates and other global growth issues  we believe investing in consumer staples stocks is safe because of their defensive nature 

	The sector fared well in the first quarter of 2016  Lower gas prices and increasing consumer confidence did the trick for these stocks  However  it should be kept in mind that the consumer staples sector has the potential to face headwinds coming from the global market turmoil and continued volatility in the equity market 

	Nevertheless  consumer confidence   a key determinant of the economy s health   has seen moderate improvement in June  signaling that the U S  economy is now ready to take on the overseas turmoil   Read   

	According to the   the Consumer Confidence Index jumped to 98 0 in June from May s reading of 92 4  This indicates rising consumer optimism regarding the labor market  Apparently  consumers expect moderate improvement in business and labor market conditions  as well as personal income prospects  thanks to the improving U S  macro economic environment  This  in turn  should boost consumer spending  which presently accounts for over two thirds of the total U S  economic activity 

	The overall tone of the global market  however  remains unchanged  as we have estimated from the GDP figures  In fact  according to the third estimate released by   after advancing 1 4  in the fourth quarter of 2015  GDP struggled at 1 1  in the first quarter  Nevertheless  the current GDP estimate is much ahead of last month s tally of 0 8   thanks to increased exports   Read  

	Needless to say  equity markets have become extremely volatile and the overall economic picture appears to be rather bleak at the moment  Despite such a scenario  we expect the gradual improvement in consumer spending to result in a slow but steady recovery in the consumer staples industry 
Playing the Sector through ETFs

	Owing to its defensive nature  this sector is likely to outperform when equity markets are bearish and underperform when they are bullish  The instability in the sector  which is a result of factors like U S  and global exposure  can be countered with a wide array of ETFs 

	ETFs can act as an excellent investment medium for those who are interested in long term exposure to the consumer staples sector 

	For those interested in consumer staples  we have highlighted a few ETFs tracking the industry  any of which could be an attractive pick

13581,235096,HSY,Cocoa Prices Could Rebound Despite Ivorian Rains,opinion,"Rains pouring on Ivory Coast are bringing relief to the West African nation in its hottest month ever  but there s still some way to go before farmers in the world s largest cocoa grower can celebrate the prospects of a better harvest 

Cocoa prices have had one of their worst starts to a year  posting losses in ten of the 12 weeks so far and accruing a year to date loss of 11   That makes it the worst performer among agricultural commodities in 2019 
While international market prices for commodities typically rise in tighter supply situations  the price West African farmers get for their physical cocoa is also determined by pod size and whether the beans are of enough quality to be ground into the top grade butter  cocoa mass and powder required by manufacturers of chocolate  ice cream and other confection and baked products  as well as cosmetics and drugs makers 
Abundant Showers Helping Crop
Heavy showers were reported in most of Ivory Coast s cocoa regions last week  setting better harvest conditions for the April to September mid crop  despite lingering concerns about below average rainfall in the centre of the country 
March is the hottest month in Ivory capital Abidjan  with temperatures averaging 82 Fahrenheit  28 Celsius   The wettest month is May  with an average of 220mm of rain  8 7 inches  
Jack Scoville  analyst at The Price Futures Group in Chicago for soft commodities including cocoa  said in an email to Investing com that cocoa arrivals were generally steady across West Africa 
He added 

 Ivory Coast arrivals have started to fade as the main crop harvest ends and the mid crop harvest gets started  However  arrivals are still about 10  ahead of a year ago  

Farmers in the Ivory bush area were also reported saying that harvests would pick up next month  and that beans were already larger than the season a year ago 
They said the current mix of flowers  small pods and cherelles promised a long mid crop if rainfall remained constant 
In Soubre s western region particularly  the heart of Ivory s cocoa belt  moisture was expected to keep the mid crop healthy 
Q1 Grind Data Key For Pricing
With first quarter cocoa grind results due in a couple of weeks  there s potential for cocoa futures to rebound from the numbers reported by grinders and F B companies such as Olam  OTC OLMIY   Archer Daniels Midland  NYSE ADM   Blommer Chocolate  Barry Callebaut  SIX BARN   Cargill  CM CARG   Cocoa Processing  Mars  Carlyle Cocoa  Hershey  NYSE HSY   Puratos Group  Lindt   Spruengli  SIX LISN   and United Cocoa Processor 
At Thursday s settlement  cocoa s front month May contract on ICE Futures U S  settled down 0 5  at 2 132 a tonne  after hitting a two week low at  2 113 
Technical analysts on Investing com rate May cocoa on ICE  NYSE ICE  as a  Strong Sell  in their daily outlook  pegging Level 3 Fibonacci support at  2 096 33 and a corresponding top resistance at  2 224  Based on Thursday s settlement  that means May cocoa can have a downside of 1 7  in the near term  but an even greater upside of 5 2  
In its outlook for 2020 though  Beroe  which specializes in market research of cocoa  among other things  said demand for cocoa was estimated to rise 30  by next year but unfavorable weather due to climate change could jeopardize global bean supply in that same window 
As such  it added that  investors should expect prices to rise accordingly  ",2019-03-22,Barani Krishnan/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cocoa-prices-could-rebound-despite-ivorian-rains-200400050,200400050
13582,235097,HSY,Dow 30 Stock Roundup  Nike Beats On Earnings  AmEx Raises Dividend,opinion,"The Dow staged a spectacular rebound last week following losses after a surprise Brexit verdict  Despite opinion polls predicting a vote in favor of remaining within the EU  Britain ultimately voted to leave the economic bloc  This led to losses on the first two trading days of the week  However  investors ultimately sought out oversold stocks leading to back to back gains on the last three days 
Brexit Fallout
The index plunged 3 4  on Friday  June 24  posting its eighth largest points decline ever  Heavy losses followed a shock verdict from Britain s referendum which indicated that a marginally higher percentage of voters had opted to leave the EU  The blue chip index also registered its largest percentage fall since Aug 2015 and entered negative territory for the year 
The global financial sector was badly hit with the STOXX Europe 600 Banks index registering a slump of 14   the largest since 1987  Shares of Goldman Sachs Group  Inc    NYSE GS    which generates nearly 20  of its revenue from its U K  operations  declined 7 1   turning out to be the biggest decliner for the Dow 
Separately  the final reading of consumer sentiment index released by University of Michigan came in at 93 5 in June  below the consensus estimate of 94 2  Durable orders decreased 2 2  in May to  230 7 billion 
Last Week s Performance
The index lost 1 5  last Monday after Britain s decision to  Leave  the European Union continued to drag the benchmarks into negative territory  The Dow posted its biggest two session decline in nearly 10 months and also closed below its 200 day average for the first time in the last three months 
Energy  materials and financial stocks were the worst performers for the session  Only the natural safe havens  utilities and telecom  managed to end in positive territory  Moreover  the pound hit a 31 year low of  1 3197 late Monday  which in turn had a negative impact on U S  companies which generate a major portion of their sales from overseas operations 
The index rebounded last Tuesday  gaining 1 6   after two days of Brexit induced losses  Investors grew optimistic and sought assets mostly from beaten down sectors  Oil prices recovered on a weaker dollar  strikes in Norway and production disruptions in Venezuela  Recent strikes of oil workers in Norway have negatively impacted its crude output 
The  third  estimate from the Bureau of Economic Analysis showed that first quarter output of goods and services increased at an annual rate of 1 1   higher than the consensus estimate of a 1  increase  According to S P Case Shiller Home Price data  20 City and 10 City composite indexes increased in April  The Consumer Confidence Index advanced to 98 in June from 92 4 in May 
The index ended higher again last Wednesday  moving up 1 6   following a strong oil price rally and a reduction in  Brexit  concerns  Oil prices continued to rise after the U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA  reported a decline in U S  commercial crude oil inventories   Moreover  oil workers  strikes in Norway and production disruptions in Venezuela continued to weigh on crude output 
Pending Home Sales Index decreased 3 7  from April to 110 8 in May  after three consecutive months of gains  Personal income and disposable personal income  DPI  each increased by 0 2  in May  Personal spending increased 0 4  in May  registering its second straight monthly increase  Additionally  personal consumption expenditure price index  PCE  rose 0 3  
The index increased 1 3  last Thursday following expectations that Bank of England will most likely implement additional stimulus measures to boost its economy  Governor of Bank of England Mark Carney said  the economic outlook has deteriorated and some monetary policy easing will likely be required over the summer  
Moreover  shares of The Hershey Company   NYSE HSY   increased 16 8  on news of a possible takeover bid from Mondelez International  Inc    NASDAQ MDLZ    However  Hershey rejected the acquisition offer of  23 billion in cash and stock  or  107 per share 
Strong gains for three successive days helped the index post its highest weekly gain for the year  The Dow moved up by only 0 1  on Friday  but gained more than 3  over last week  riding on the rebound which followed the losses resulting from Brexit  However  trading volumes were at their lowest since Jun 23  
The Dow increased 0 8  in June  Investors remained cautious for most of the month over a possible exit of the U K  from the European Union  An unanticipated Brexit led the key indexes to deliver a sluggish performance  Moreover  Fed s reluctance to hike rates also raised doubts about the strength of the domestic economy  May s discouraging jobs report  a low level of business investment and lower than expected inflation did little to help the Fed take a rate hike call 
The index gained 1 9  over the last quarter Energy stocks were the biggest gainer during the quarter  while tech stocks were the biggest laggards  Oil prices posted quarterly gains due to a weaker dollar  a fall in the U S  rig count  rise in gasoline consumption and worldwide outages 
Components Moving the Index

13583,235098,HSY,M A Heats Up  3 Companies In The Spotlight  3 More To Watch,opinion,"by Clement Thibault
The usual signs of summer warmer temperatures  the expected array of seasonal fruit have begun to appear  but this year there s been a market warm up as well   the mergers and acquisition arena has been heating up  Buyouts and rumors of impending buyouts have started to proliferate  pushing some share prices through the roof and creating potentially attractive returns for sharp eyed investors on the lookout for the next M A opportunity 
Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT  and LinkedIn  NYSE LNKD  recently kicked off the season with Microsoft s mid June announcement of its  26 billion acquisition of the social networking site  valuing LinkedIn shares at  196  almost 50  above their prior closing price  Loyal LNKD shareholders who stood by the stock after its value was almost cut in half last February when the social networking site reported trouble with its user growth were richly rewarded 

But Microsoft and LinkedIn are old news  Astute traders and investors aim to stay ahead of the pack by paying attention to recent rumors and eyeing potential takeover targets  Below  three companies that are already potential targets plus three more we believe could make good acquisitions in the not so distant future 

Harley Davidson
The iconic motorcycle manufacturer Harley Davidson  NYSE HOG    on rumors of a buyout by private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts   Co  NYSE KKR   The motorcycle company suffered heavily from the 2008 financial crisis  trading for less than 10 dollars a share in early 2009  Nevertheless  HOG managed to reestablish itself as a household name  industry leader and coveted brand 
Indeed  its share price rose to a peak of over  74 dollars during May 2014  Unfortunately  the motorcycle market also peaked in May 2014  and Harley shares have been relatively stagnant  trading around the  40 range since then  until last week s rumors of the potential KKR purchase emerged and pushed the price to  54 25 at Friday s close 
In the past  KKR has acquired a diversified portfolio  with purchases ranging from food giant RJR Nabisco in 1989  to the 2007 acquisition of retail chain store Dollar General  NYSE DG   before taking it public in 2009  to high tech companies such as NXP Semiconductors NV  NASDAQ NXPI  of which it was a stakeholder beginning in 2006 until the company went public in 2010 


The Hershey Company
From classic motorcycles to iconic chocolate  Hershey  NYSE HSY  rejected a  23 billion takeover bid by food maker Mondelez International Inc  NASDAQ MDLZ  on Thursday  denying Mondelez a larger footprint within the American food market  At least for now  According to  

 A Mondelez Hershey deal if Hershey were to get on board would likely not be subject to such intense scrutiny   Regionally  the companies don t overlap too much  At Hershey  nearly 88  of total revenue comes from the North American market  Mondelez only derives 24  of revenue from that region  Europe is a far larger market for the snacking giant  and it has sizable operations in the Latin America and Asia Pacific regions  

If a future bid is accepted  and many analysts believe a higher offer    the two companies would merge to create the world s largest confectioner  However  the potential takeover is expected to run into several major obstacles before it can be approved  First  the Hershey Trust  which controls 81  of the voting rights  and 8 4  of the common stock   is committed to keeping the company independent  as was evident when it objected to a proposed deals with Wrigley in 2002 and Cadbury in 2007 and 2010  today  Mondolez owns Cadbury  
In addition  because the company is based in Pennsylvania and there have been recent allegations of overpayment to some of the company s board members  as well as conflict of interest and expensing problems that have embroiled 3 longstanding board members  the state s attorney general has to approve any deal agreed to by the Trust 

This recent chaos  which involves both the AG s office and the Trust s management  could bode well for Mondelez  The fact that Hershey s shares are still trading close to the rejected bid offer price clearly indicates that investors are not expected this drama to end anytime soon 

Netflix
While the two potential acquisitions described above have some actual facts to bolster the rumors  this next one is a bit of a head scratcher  Shares of Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX  soared almost 6  on Friday  but investors are having trouble figuring out why 
The three most plausible explanations are  Netflix s possible entry into the Chinese market  an  to the stock by several analysts  and the rumor of a possible buyout by Disney  NYSE DIS   In 2012  Disney agreed to let Netflix exclusively stream Disney content and movies that agreement  in September 2016 

So why initiate a buyout now  To begin with  once the agreement takes effect  Netflix will be taking business away from live TV  hurting Disney s ESPN as well as its other live content  Netflix shares have been comparatively low after its meteoric rise in 2015  making this a good time to strike a deal  But without any confirmation from either Disney or Netflix  this is a rumor that may just stay one 

3 Additional  Plausible Targets for Future Acquisitions

Delphi Automotive
Delphi Automotive  NYSE DLPH  is a high tech company which innovates in the automotive sector  Registered in the U K  DLPH currently employs over 160 thousand people  and operates across 44 countries 
Given the rise of electric and self driven cars  purchasing a high tech company that specializes in integrating technology into automobiles would be a smart move for any big manufacturer that s lagging today s smart car trend  With a market capitalization of about  17B  a Delphi buyout would need an acquirer with fairly deep pockets  An acquirer could emerge from any of the global automotive giants ranging from Toyota  NYSE TM  with its  165B market cap to Nissan  OTC NSANY  at  39B 
Of course  all of the automotive giants are developing their own version of the car of the future  but competitive tension has been ratcheting up since the launch of Tesla s  NASDAQ TSLA  Model 3  along with Volvo s   With technology behemoths Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  and Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  also on the case  we see many potential suitors for Delphi Automotive  Bolstering our thinking  Delphi s earnings and stock price have basically been flat during the past two years  and its TTM P E is hovering around 11  a bit below the industry average 

ServiceNow
ServiceNow  NYSE NOW  is a cloud computing company offering everything as a service cloud computing for companies large and small  including platform as a service  PaaS  enterprise service management software for human resources  law  facilities management  finance  marketing  and field operations  The company is growing fast  with earnings having more than doubled in Q1 compared to last year  and revenue up by almost 50  
Cloud computing and IT are today s hot technologies  with everyone from market leader Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  to the still repositioning itself IBM  NYSE IBM  jumping in as each tries to grab a piece of the pie  Similar to Delphi  albeit in a completely different sector  multiple larger companies could be very interested in annexing the capacities ServiceNow has on offer 

Microsoft and SAP  NYSE SAP  are two of the larger cap possibilities we see  Indeed  ServiceNow s  10B market cap won t bother either company  nor would it likely stop  Salesforce com  NYSE CRM  which has already digested 8 companies in the past 2 years alone 

Square
Square Inc  NYSE SQ  is a fintech startup offering electronic software and hardware payment products  available anywhere  The company  founded in 2009 by Twitter co founder Jack Dorsey  went public in November 2015 
While the company might not yet be ripe for acquisition it still needs to develop its user base and improve its technology we wouldn t be surprised to see it sold in the future  The way consumers and merchants make and receive payments is changing  from new credit card technologies  to the introduction of PayPal  NASDAQ PYPL  and more recently Apple and Android Pay 
In fact  the latter two solutions are hurting PayPal  and the competition between credit card companies remains harsh  with Visa  NYSE V  and Mastercard  NYSE MA  continually cutting in on American Express s  NYSE AXP  market share  The inability to develop new products in house for the more conservative credit card industry might push any one of these companies to make a move on Square  perhaps sooner rather than later 
Square s stock price was almost  16 just three months ago  but shares plunged to  9 after the company posted a bigger than expected loss  although the Y Y revenue grew by 51   Like many innovative start ups  SQ is one of those companies likely to incur losses during their early developmental stages  but ultimately have a chance to revolutionize their industry  Which is why we believe there s a good chance they ll be snapped up while they are still growing ",2016-07-05,Clement Thibault/Investing.com ,https://www.investing.com/analysis/m-a-season-heats-up-200139786,200139786
13584,235099,HSY,General Mills  A Reliable Dividend Growth Stock,opinion,"General Mills  Inc   NYSE GIS  manufactures and markets branded consumer foods in the United States and internationally  It also supplies branded and unbranded food products to the foodservice and commercial baking industries  The company operates in three segments  U S  Retail  International  and Convenience Stores and Foodservice 
General Mills is a dividend achiever  which has managed to reward patient shareholders with a dividend raise for 13 years in a row  The company has stated that it has paid dividends for over 100 years in a row 
Some of the company s largest competitors include Campbell Soup Company  NYSE CPB   Hershey Company  NYSE HSY   Kellogg Company  NYSE K  
The company raised its dividend for a second time this year  The new dividend is 48 cents share  which is 4 30  higher than the first raise announced in February  The   and had me concerned  Of course  now that we have two raises in a row  I am in a better shape 
Over the past decade   has delivered 14  annualized returns to its shareholders   Unfortunately  the stock price has gone up a lot  This is possibly related to the offer for Hershey by Mondelez  All of a sudden  this offer reminded everyone that quality food and beverage companies more valuable  Future returns would be dependent on entry valuation  growth in earnings per share and dividend yield at the time of investment 
General Mills has managed to grow its earnings per share by 6 70  year over the past decade  General Mills is expected to earn  3 08 per share in 2017 and  3 34 per share in 2018  In comparison  the company earned  2 77 share in 2016  Unfortunately  as I go back to review   I see that analyst earnings expectations being overly optimistic at above  3 share for several years in a row  Unfortunately  the company has not been able earn over  3 share 
The company has utilized share buybacks in order to reduce the number of shares outstanding from 818 million in 2005 to 611 million in 2016 
General Mills has a portfolio of strong brands  as well as the scale of operations to make products and sell them efficiently  In addition  the company is trying to maintain an innovative approach and either develop in house or acquire products in growth niches  Consumer tastes tend to slowly evolve over time  which is why companies like General Mills that try to stay innovative and capture major trends in tastes and deliver profits  Continued product innovation is the key to capturing future growth  That being said  the bread and butter of consumer products companies are its established brands  where a large portion of consumers engage in repetitive purchases  that create repetitive cashflows  which make investing in consumer staples such a steady and profitable endeavor  While things do change slowly over time  the change is not as fast paced like that in the technology field  This gives some time for companies to react  adapt and profit to the changing environment  Having a steady marketing budget also helps to maintain the broad appeal of the company s products 
Earnings per share could increase from new product offerings  strategic acquisitions  international expansion and streamlining of operations  A constant focus on operations  eliminating unnecessary costs  improving margins and reducing negative effects of input costs are something that should help the company accomplish its targets  The company is able to expand its distribution network on a global basis  invest in innovation and in its strong brands  Having a portfolio of stable food brands generates recurring excess cash flows  Those excess cash flows are not necessary for expansion of the business  Therefore they result in the ability for the company to shower shareholders with more cash every year through regular dividend payments and increases 
The annual dividend payment has increased by 10 20  per year over the past decade  which is much higher than the growth in EPS  Future growth in dividends will be much lower than that however  and will be limited by the growth in earnings per share 
A 10  growth in distributions translates into the dividend payment doubling every seven years on average  If we check the dividend history  going as far back as 1983  we could see that General Mills has managed to double dividends almost every eight years on average 
In the past decade  the dividend payout ratio has increased from 45  in 2007 to 64  by 2016  A lower payout is always a plus  since it leaves room for consistent dividend growth minimizing the impact of short term fluctuations in earnings
General Mills has also managed to generate a high return on equity  which also increased from 20 60  in 2007 to 29 10  in 2016  I generally like seeing a high return on equity  which is also relatively stable over time 
Currently  General Mills is overvalued at 23 30 times forward earnings and yields 2 70   At this valuation  I am not interested in adding to my shares in General Mills  In fact  I am getting a little concerned with the company s inability to grow earnings per share since 2011  I would be interested in the stock below  60 share  which is equivalent to 20 times expected earnings for 2017  Ideally  I want to see General Mills below  56 share  which is 20 times last year s earnings

from  0 39 earned a year ago Over time  SAP s business transformation initiatives have helped it to channel investments from non core to strategic core areas  thereby creating a streamlined lean structure that has been supporting top and bottom line performances  Apart from the solid business transformation initiatives  modest top line growth supplemented bottom line growth in the quarter under review Total IFRS revenue in the second quarter was  5 237 million   5 913 7 million   up 5 4  year over year A flourishing cloud business coupled with strong growth of support revenues aided the top line growth during the second quarter  However  weak Software licenses   support revenues weighed on the revenue performance to a certain degree Also  new cloud bookings   a key indicator of sales success in cloud business   were up 28  to  255 million in the quarter under review Inside the HeadlinesCloud and Software business  which includes Cloud Subscriptions   Support and Software

million  in the quarter  up 30 4  year over year  while Software licenses and support reported revenues of  3 639 million   4109 2 million   relatively flat on a year over year basis However  for the second quarter of 2016  Services revenues were down 3 3  year over year to  878 million   991 4 million  Overall  IFRS Cloud and software revenues  mainly driven by IFRS Cloud Subscriptions   Support strength  witnessed the highest growth in the APJ region  up 44    followed by EMEA  up 38   and the Americas  up 26   Also  the EMEA region witnessed double digit software license revenues growth in majority of the end markets including France  Netherlands  Switzerland and Germany  After a dismal start to the first quarter of 2016  North America is back on track  supporting growth in the Americas region  Moreover  growth of software licenses revenue in Brazil and Mexico added to the overall sales in the region  For the APJ region  triple digit software license growth in Japan coupled with double digit growth in India and China acted as key growth catalyst SAP reported IFRS operating margin of 24 2   up 1 010 basis points from the figure recorded in the second quarter of 2015  Also  the company recorded an 81  increase in its operating profit  which came in at  1269 million   1433 0 million  Quarterly HighlightsSAP s human capital management    HCM    applications continue to act as the main growth driver with SuccessFactors Employee Central surpassing the 1 250 customer at the end of the second quarter  Also  on premise and cloud offerings of SAP s Customer Engagement and Commerce solutions grew in double digits during the second quarter Moreover  consistently strong market traction of the SAP S 4HANA platform may be a threat to its peers  During the second quarter of 2016  the company gained 500 customers of which 40  are entirely new  which greatly supplemented the company s top line performance  The SAP  HANA  Cloud  Platform   HCP   and its partners are helping clients extend  functionalities  build  new  applications  and  integrate  across  cloud  and  on premise platforms  which in turn is fuelling its growth  Some of the noteworthy customers added during the quarter include Hershey Company  NYSE HSY   the Targin Group  Cathay Pacific and Roy Hill Holdings Pty Ltd This apart  SAP s business  which it manages through three main players  namely  Ariba  Fieldglass and Concur  experienced 21  growth in cloud subscriptions and support revenue during the second quarter of 2016  In the past twelve months  Ariba network handled the trading of 2 2 million

Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   To ConcludeSAP posted yet another quarter of solid year over year earnings and revenue growth  largely attributable to the strength of its cloud business  We believe the company will continue to fare satisfactorily as business enterprises keep reinventing in business models and making transition toward digital businesses processes  The company s dominance over three critical client demand areas  namely  customer engagement  human capital management and interconnected commerce network signals at the bright prospects ahead Despite the cloud business strength  cut throat competition from technology heavyweights including Microsoft Corporation   NASDAQ MSFT    International Business Machines Corporation   NYSE IBM   and Amazon com  Inc    NASDAQ

13587,235102,HSY,Will Hershey  HSY  Earnings Disappoint Investors In Q2 ,opinion,"The Hershey Company   NYSE HSY   is slated to report second quarter 2016 results on Jul 28  before the opening bell  Last quarter  the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 4 76  
The chocolate maker surpassed earnings estimates in all the last four quarters with an average surprise of 4 37  HERSHEY CO THE Price and EPS Surprise
   Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement 
Factors at Play
Hershey s sales trends have been feeble since 2014 due to weak category trends  intense competition from the broader snacking category and soft international growth  The top line weakness persisted in the first quarter 2016 with sales declining 4 4  due to continued weakness in demand in China and North America 
While slower than expected sales of non seasonal confectionery is hurting sales trends in North America  weak consumer shopping trends due to economic slowdown and softening chocolate category trends have been impacting Hershey s sales in China since 2015 
With a poor sales history behind  we do not expect any significant improvement in sales trends in the second quarter 
However  despite lackluster sales  Hershey was able to maintain relatively better margins on the back of supply chain savings and productivity gains  As it is evident  from the company s positive earnings surprises and year over year growth in four straight quarters 
The company expects second quarter constant currency sales growth to be better than the full year rate of 1 5   However gross margins are expected to decline in the range of 50 to 100 basis points due to unfavorable sales mix  related to lower non seasonal sales  
Though profits gained from lower advertising costs in the first quarter  these costs are expected to increase in the second quarter  thereby straining EPS  With new product launches as well as merchandising and display activity in North America expected to be proactive  advertising and related consumer marketing costs are expected to increase in a mid to high single digit range  as a percentage of sales  in the second quarter 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Hershey is likely to beat earnings this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here  as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP for Hershey is  1 28  as the Most Accurate estimate is 77 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at 78 cents 
Zacks Rank  Hershey has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   Please note that we caution against Sell rated stocks  Zacks Rank  4 or 5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions

13588,235103,HSY,Food Stocks Releasing Earnings This Week  MDLZ  HSY   More,opinion,The Q2 results announced so far portray a picture of improvement from  weak results of the past quarters  According to an  report  of the 126 S P 500 members that have reported Q2 results so far  70 6  have beaten EPS estimates and 55 6  have come ahead of top line expectations Among the food beverage companies that have already reported their numbers  PepsiCo  Inc    NYSE PEP   once again reported  Q2 results earlier this month and also upped its full year earnings growth target  Last month  General Mills  Inc    NYSE GIS   reported  fourth quarter fiscal 2016 results on both the top and the bottom line Generally  the top line of most food companies are challenged by soft global retail and consumer demand amid evolving consumer tastes  Moreover  economic slowdown in many emerging countries is hurting international sales and profits  However  the domestic business has done comparatively well supported by an improving economic and consumer spending environment Additionally  lower commodity costs than last year  price increases  and cost savings and productivity gains from their restructuring programs have buoyed the bottom line These companies have also become more innovative in their product lines   removing artificial flavors and colors from their products and using simpler ingredients in their food   to meet changing consumer preferences  Notably  some of these companies have been acquiring complementary brands and companies to strengthen their portfolio We believe that these efforts should cushion these companies from growing international headwinds as well as enable them to cater to widely varying consumer tastes in the second half of 2016 and beyond

	However  the leading chocolate manufacturer lowered its sales expectations for 2016 citing weak growth in the confectionary category in North America and persistent macroeconomic challenges in China Earnings Beat
	Hershey s second quarter adjusted earnings per share of 85 cents beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 78 cents by almost 9   Earnings rose 9  year over year as higher volumes  lower tax rate and lower share count  which resulted from share buybacks  offset relatively weaker margins 
	Adjusted earnings exclude derivative mark to market gains  charges related to the productivity initiative and non service related pension expense  Including these  reported earnings were 68 cents  up 45  year over year 







Revenues Improve
	Net sales of  1 64 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 61 billion by 1 9   Net sales  including the impact of currency and acquisitions  imperoved 3 7  year over year  Currency hurt revenues by 0 8 percentage points  pp   Excluding the currency impact  sales were up 4 5   Acquisition benefitted sales by 0 5 pp  Organically  excluding the impact of currency and acquisitions  sales rose 4  on the back of higher volumes 
	Volumes of 3 1 pp were better than expected backed by favorable timing of shipments in North America  Net price realization benefitted sales by 0 9 pp  better than the negative impact of 0 5 pp in the previous quarter 
	Favorable timing of some merchandising programs in North America  which were originally scheduled for the third quarter  benefitted sales in the second quarter  However  this benefit will reverse in the third quarter  Moreover  candy  mint and gum  and CMG growth in the U S  did not meet management s expectations in the quarter 
	Hershey s sales trends have been bleak since 2014 due to soft category trends  intense competition from the broader snacking category and weak international growth  The company is experiencing continually sluggish demand in China and North America 
	While slower than expected sales of non seasonal confectionery is hurting results in North America  weak consumer shopping trends due to economic slowdown and a soft chocolate category have been impacting Hershey s performance in China since 2015 Segment DiscussionNorth America net sales rose 3 2  to  1 44 billion  Excluding currency headwinds of 0 3 pp  sales rose 3 5  due to higher volumes  While pricing deteriorated 1 6 pp  volumes rose 4 5 pp due to favourable timing of shipments  The acquisition of the barkTHINS brand  acquired in April  resulted in a net benefit of 0 6 pp

	Hershey s adjusted gross margin declined 120 basis points  bps  to 45 5  due to an unfavorable sales mix  and higher commodity and other supply chain costs  which offset gains from supply chain productivity and cost savings  The decline in gross margin was slightly higher than management s expected range of 50 to 100 bps 
	Excluding advertising  selling  marketing and administrative expenses  SM A  decreased 2 6  as Hershey is deliberately reducing non essential spending to leverage existing resources  SM A includes investments in non advertising brand building and go to market capabilities in both the U S  and international markets 
	Advertising costs rose 5  due to higher promotional spending in the quarter 
	Operating margin declined 20 bps to 18 5  due to lower gross margins and higher advertising costs

	Though the company maintained its full year earnings and margin guidance  it lowered the previously issued sales expectations for the second time this year 
	Net sales are expected to inch up 1  in 2016  including acquisition benefit of 0 5 pp   less than 1 5  previously 
	The guidance  however  includes a negative impact of 1 0 pp from currency  Excluding the impact of currency  net sales are now anticipated to increase around 2 0   less than 2 5  as declared earlier  Lower than expected non seasonal CMG category trends in North America through the rest of the year and macroeconomic headwinds in China incited the revision 
	Gross margins are expected to be slightly below the 2015 levels  An unfavorable sales mix  related to lower non seasonal sales  and higher commodity costs will offset greater productivity and cost savings 
	Adjusted earnings per share guidance was reaffirmed in the range of  4 24 to  4 28  including barkTHINS dilution of 5 cents to 6 cents per share   which represents around 3 4  growth

13605,235120,HSY,The Commodities Market Has A Sweet Tooth,opinion,"Despite appearances that the entire commodities sector is continuing on a major downslide  one resource remains steadfast   sugar 
Sugar has been one of the best performing commodities so far this year   largely driven by a global supply shortage  after wallowing in a five year surplus 
Supply woes are pushing futures prices higher  while demand continues to increase on a global basis  In fact  the International Sugar Organization   along with most analysts   forecast global deficits through 2017 
According to the   issued May 19  2016 by the United States Department of Agriculture  USDA   the world production for 2016 17 will be approximately 169 million metric tons  mmt   a figure revised down by 7 2 mmt 
Global sugar consumption is forecast at a record 174 mmt  raw value   exceeding production  and drawing stocks down to the lowest level since 2010 11 
While the rising pace of global consumption has been sustained by drawing down stock levels in recent years  inventories are now approaching historic lows 
World raw sugar prices  after falling for over a year and then bottoming at less than  0 11 per pound in August 2015  are finally trending higher 
From Sweet and Low to Sugar Highs

Sugar s price history  these past few years  has been an intriguing drama with an ever thickening plot 
Since 2011  No  1 sugar producer  Brazil   along with Australia  Thailand  Mexico  and India   has created an international sugar glut that resulted in a steep drop in world sugar prices from  0 32 per pound to  0 11 per pound 
But the surplus has finally come to an end 
Adding to the effects of the worldwide production shortfall are dry growing conditions in major producer nations  as El Nino weather patterns cause parched fields from Thailand to India   the world s No  2 producer of sugar 
Brazil Drives Volatility
Political upheaval in Brazil  the world s largest sugar producing country and the largest exporter  has been the key driver of price volatility this year 
Brazilian farmers have become reluctant to sell sugar on the international markets because the Brazilian real has been especially volatile  Farmers have been quick to hold off on sales when it appreciated  and were just as eager to liquidate their supplies when it depreciated 
Fifty seven percent of Brazil s sugar cane crop is now converted to ethanol  further contributing to the sugar deficit 
As a result of all this  Coca Cola Co   NYSE KO  reported that it is halting production of its namesake soft drink for the foreseeable future due to sugar shortages 
The US Company  which manufactures out of economically troubled Venezuela  claims it has run out of the raw material in the country  amidst an economy teetering on the edge of collapse with widespread food shortages and inflation forecast to surpass 700  
India s Drought
Insufficient rainfall in India has also affected this sugar shortage  forcing over 100 sugar mills to halt production in February  according to the Indian Sugar Mills Association 
Sugar consumption in India  however  is expected to rise to a record 27 2 mmt while the country s production is forecast to drop to 25 5 mmt due to smaller areas being cultivated  as well as lower yields 
Drought conditions have encouraged farmers to keep existing cane in production longer rather than planting new cane  Stocks are thus expected to fall 18  
Furthermore  according to government sources  the country may revoke compulsory sugar export orders after two consecutive droughts have potentially turned the country into a net importer   rather than exporter   next season 
Farmers will no longer receive payment after an order is revoked  thus  without subsidies  Indian mills will struggle to export profitably 
Additionally  production in the European Union is expected to decrease by 650 000 metric tons  to 16 1 mmt   nearly 10  of global production 
China Loves Sugar
China s production is also down 400 000 metric tons to 10 6 mmt   which is about 6  of global production  But China s consumption is more important here 
Sugar consumption in China  projected at a record 17 8 mmt  continues to trend higher  bringing stocks down to 3 2 mmt  while production is forecast to decline to 8 2 mmt 
Over recent years  higher land and labor costs  and the cancellation of minimum purchase prices in the Yunnan  Guangdong  and Hainan provinces have resulted in growers opting to grow other  more profitable  crops such as tobacco and bananas  Imports are forecast at a record 7 9 mmt 
A report   from April 20  revealed that the sugar industry in China   already having suffered for four consecutive years   continues to struggle with high production costs  the elimination of government support prices  and import competition 
As of early March 2016  approximately 90  of China s sugar manufacturers were operating at a loss according to industry reports  and a number of mills were already closed 
The United States Shifts Gears
Of course  China is not the only nation that loves its sugar 
The U S  consumes 10 million short tons  mst  of sugar each year  20  of which comes from imports  What is important to note  however  is that absolutely none of the sugar grown on U S  soil is exported 
Production in the U S  is forecast to be down 200 000 short tons from last year to 7 9 mst  which is based on projected lower cane yields  Meanwhile  imports are expected to rebound 8  to 3 2 mst  and stocks are projected to dip 5  to 1 5 mst 
Until recently  the global price of sugar was not of much concern to U S  farmers  Even while the international price remains barely half of what it costs to produce the commodity  farmers still have an incentive to grow sugar beets because the USDA actually regulates the amount of sugar produced nationally to protect the industry from outside influences 
By adhering to the World Trade Organization  WTO  rules  the USDA ensures a stable domestic sugar industry  while continuing to bolster relationships with its trade partners 
Both the WTO and the USDA classify sugar as an  essential  food  meaning it s too important a crop to rely heavily on imports  Members of these organizations control their supply by producing only what they consume 
And while cane was once the dominant sugar in U S  markets  beet sugar has taken the lead in the past few years 
This is because beets can be grown in colder climates and is  therefore  a more versatile sugar source  Furthermore  cane has to be processed twice  making it more expensive to produce than beet sugar  So  cane producers  like those in Brazil  are moving into the ethanol market 
Anti GMO Influences
One of the biggest health trends in the U S  is currently non GMO 
Food production companies are jumping on the bandwagon in an effort to stay ahead of the curve  causing a major shift in the sugar industry 
In 2008  many farmers switched their crops from regular sugar beets to genetically modified beets  which were engineered to tolerate a weed killer called glyphosate 
GMO beets require the application of weed killer only a few times each season  rather than every 10 days like non GMO beets  according to an NPR report  Practically all of the U S  production of sugar beets comes from genetically modified seed 
As a result  there has been a major backlash from the anti GMO crowd  Slowly but surely the larger players in the food industry  such as Hershey  NYSE HSY   are buying into the movement  Hershey is shifting its entire candy portfolio out of GMO  thus using a lot more sugar from sugarcane rather than beet sugar 
This poses an additional problem  with so many farms focused on cost effective beet sugar  the beets of which are GMO based  there is a sudden shortage of sugarcane 
On May 5  2016  just days ago  45 U S  Representatives signed a letter asking Department of Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack to increase the tariff quota for raw sugar  in order to address insufficient domestic supply  The tight supply has sent futures prices even higher 
Sugar Prices   Oh  How Sweet It Is 
Speculators are now taking a more active role in going long sugar  according to recent CFTC reports  And for now sugar looks like it will hold its upward trend  Technically  the charts point to a price of  0 20 per pound 
If you have taken a position in sugar  make sure to keep an eye on the forward curve  and hedge or stop out your position  because  after all  a sugar high can always turn into a sugar crash

Apparently talks between the two have been occurring for a few months now  as Mondelez has been trying to convince Hershey of the takeover  Mondelez reportedly has assured Hershey that in the event of a merger  the company would protect the jobs of Hershey s employees  as well as be willing to move its chocolate headquarters to Hershey  Pennsylvania  and rename the company Hershey 
Mondolez reportedly offered Hershey a deal of  107 per share in a deal comprised of cash and stock  Any potential deal is subject to approval from the Hershey Trust  holders of 81  of its votes  which has been opposed to selling in the past

Though Mondelez said that it would project the jobs of Hershey s employees  move its chocolate headquarters to Hershey  Pennsylvania and rename the company Hershey s  the offer apparently still wasn t enough to budge the Hershey Trust  which owns 81  of the company s voting rights  The rejection of the deal comes after another rejection in 2002  where Hershey rejected a  12 billion offer from Wm  Wrigley Jr  Co  Mondelez offered Hershey  107 per share  half in cash and half in stock 
If the two were to unite  they would create the world s largest confectioner  bringing Hershey s strong U S  footprint to the rest of the globe  and give Mondelez access to Hershey s product lines  The combined company would like jump Mars Inc   the largest confectioner as of now  which owns an estimated 13  of the global market 
Despite its continuing desire to keep the company independent  it s still possible that the Hershey trust would sell the company  though it does seem unlikely  Shares of Hershey closed at  113 49 Thursday  so an increase in the offer would most likely be in order if Mondelez continues its pursuit of a buyout  Be sure to check back with Zacks as this possible deal continues to progress ",2016-06-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/hershey-co.-(hsy)-rejects-$23-billion-takeover-offer-from-mondelez-(mdlz)-200139388,200139388

13612,235127,HSY,How The Food Industry Is Turning Into A Game Of Monopoly,opinion,"What does it mean to dominate an industry  Do we live in a day and age where that market power can come simply from an innovative idea and calculated execution  or are those days over 
Within the food industry in particular  what we re beginning to see more and more of is the industry equivalent of when LeBron James joined two other superstars on the Miami Heat in 2010 instead of continuing on his own with the Cleveland Cavaliers  Granted  he changed his mind a few years later  but the business world doesn t have that kind of flexibility   
With large companies merging together and forming conglomerates  will we see the food industry replicate the oligopolistic competition of the media world  Let s take a look at the implications of what we ve seen so far  and if outlook is really what it seems to be 
But Mom  Everyone s Doing It 
Just today  Hershey   NYSE HSY    that it could be bought by Mondelez International   NASDAQ MDLZ    the company that makes products like Oreos and Ritz crackers  If the acquisition is to happen MDLZ promised to move their headquarters to Hershey  PA and take on the Hershey brand name as their own  An acquisition of HSY could prove to be very lucrative  considering it has and remains a very well recognized firm around the world 
According to the Food Institute  2015 saw 410 M A  Mergers   Acquisitions  deals  The most notable of them was the H J  Heinz Company merging with the Kraft Foods Group  They became the Kraft Heinz Company   NASDAQ KHC    and  is the fifth largest branded food and beverage company in the world 
Coca Cola Enterprises   NYSE CCE    an independent bottler of Coca Cola s   NYSE KO   beverages merged with two other Coke bottlers last year as well  Other news included packaged foods company Post Holdings   NYSE POST   acquiring MOM Brands Company  which is the fourth largest breakfast cereal company in the U S 
These deals are a just a few of the many M A deals that have happened in recent years  The fact of matter is that the  cool  kids are continuing to build up their playground gangs  but why 
What s the Point 
In order to illustrate the benefits that these M A deals provide  let s continue our look at the Kraft Heinz Company  Currently sitting at a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   KHC has been subject to lower spending by U S  shoppers and a shift towards healthier products  However  analysts agree on upward estimate revisions  changing estimates for this fiscal year to  3 07 per share  up from  2 94 60 days ago 
Since the merger  KHC has been able to implement many cost saving initiatives  As per our report  the company plans on saving  1 5B in annual costs by the end of 2017 by focusing on work force reductions  factory closures and consolidations  By using resources from both the Kraft and Heinz businesses  KHC has managed to realize  125M of savings in 2015 and  225M of savings in Q1 of 2016 alone  which has served as a driving force to the aforementioned estimate revisions 
KHC also beat earnings estimates in Q1  pulling in an EPS of  0 73  beating the Zacks Consensus estimate by 19 7   Reported sales of  6 57B also beat estimates and represented a rise of 165 1  year over year 
The food industry is subject to heavy competition  and by merging  companies get to maintain their share of market presence  The reality is that these companies can create scale economies in key parts of their business  such as within their supply chain  marketing  and general purchasing power  all of which can help save costs and maintain margins  The ages old phrase  If you can t beat  em  join  em  holds significantly more credence than people give it credit for 
According to PricewaterhouseCooper s report on the food industry  volatile commodity prices noticeably impact already thin margins  Along with this  sluggish growth in already developed markets can put companies in danger  Mergers help to offset this danger through such perks as brand diversity and increased presence in developing economies 
The benefits that KHC has reaped from its merger is in no way unique  and represents part of the essential motivation behind the current trend in the industry as a whole 
Will the Trend Continue 
PwC mentions another notable shift in the food industry  the ability for smaller companies to compete with established  mammoth firms  By developing relationships with larger grocery chains  these companies have access to almost as large a market share as their larger competition  The little guys on the playground are putting up a better fight against the  bullies   so the bullies just need to get in bigger groups 
I believe that the trend will continue  because the mergers make a lot of sense  Merger strategies are guided by a company s specific needs  and generally the benefits they receive significantly outweigh the costs  As an example  a company can purchase competition that offers a similar product in another geographical location  merge  cut costs  and now have presence in that region 
Mergers are proving to be a surefire method to expand and reduce both costs and risks in the process  Another possibility is that if larger companies see something innovative in smaller competition  they can buy them  incorporate the idea  and in the process scale the innovation into a much larger framework 
Investors should keep an eye out for further acquisition rumors moving forward  HSY is today s news  but there is no doubt there will be more to come 
Bottom Line
Although there is reason to argue that  bigger is not always better   that doesn t seem to be the case in the food industry  Although growing up  your parents may have never appreciated the argument that something is worth doing because  all of your friends are doing it too   Here  everyone appears to be doing it for good reason  and will continue to do so ",2016-06-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/how-the-food-industry-is-turning-into-a-game-of-monopoly-200139386,200139386

The Markets 

Stocks gained on Monday  shaking off concerns that the win by the anti austerity party in the Greek parliamentary elections would re energize the eurozone crisis  Volume during the session was light as traders left their desks early in order to escape the winter storm that was bearing down on New York City  Despite the threat of a slowdown in economic activity that would result from a winter storm  the equity market typically ends higher during the session following major winter storms in New York City  Following the 6 biggest storms in NYC over the last 60 years  the S P 500 has gained in 5 of the sessions that followed  averaging a gain of 0 54   Gains  unfortunately  neutralized in the week following the event with the S P 500 Index recording an average decline of 0 09  
Although the results show that there is a negligible impact on the equity market resulting from winter storms   weather during the winter can have a negative impact on equity market performance if it is prolonged and unconducive to production for various industries  Last year was a case in point  Colder than average temperatures throughout the winter season last year negatively influenced consumer stocks  causing underperformance in the discretionary sector through what is typically a period of seasonal strength  As a result  broad equity benchmarks remained choppy through the first four months of 2014 
With the weather trend for New York City forecasted to be colder than average over the next two weeks  a similar impact on the equity market as what was recorded last year cannot be ruled out  Sluggish equity market performance during colder than average winters is typically short lived as the spring rebound in economic activity tends to lift stocks 














Despite the initial shock that resulted from the parliamentary election in Greece  equity benchmarks in Europe ended firmly higher on Monday  The DAX  FTSE 100  FTSE MIB  CAC  and IBEX have all recorded strong gains over recent weeks  significantly outperforming US indices as investors take advantage of the value that the European stocks present given that they have largely underperformed American benchmarks since 2009 
The bet remains that the ECB s bond buying program will have the same beneficial impact on European markets as what the US stimulus had on American stocks  The FTSE  FTSE MIB  and CAC have each broken out of a declining trend that persisted since last summer  opening a path towards higher values in the months ahead  European equity indices have just begun the second leg of their period of seasonal strength that runs from the end of January through to the beginning of May 











































Sentiment on Monday  as gauged by the put call ratio  ended bullish at 0 90  Yet again  another significant swing from one session to the next continues to push the average true range of the ratio higher as uncertainty in equity markets persists  Resistance on the S P 500 Index remains around 2064  expect uncertainty to remain while the large cap benchmark holds beneath this previous high

13631,235146,HSY,5 Buy Ranked Stocks Surviving The Slump,opinion,"Stocks closed at their lowest level in two months on Tuesday  weighed down by a surge in the dollar  The euro lost the most against the dollar  following renewed fears regarding an interest rate hike by the Fed  A stronger dollar also resulted in lower oil prices  leading to losses for energy stocks 
Tuesday s Plunge
The Dow slumped 1 9   experiencing its biggest one day loss in five months in terms of points  The S P 500 and the NASDAQ both lost 1 7   The blue chip index and S P 500 also sank below their 50 day moving averages  erasing their gains for the year 
However  the NASDAQ managed to protect yearly gains of 2 6   For the Dow  United Technologies  NYSE UTX  emerged as the largest decliner  All its other components took losses  with only DuPont  NYSE DD  emerging unscathed 
Dollar s Surge
The surge in the U S  dollar was possibly the reason for yesterday s losses  Renewed fears regarding an interest rate hike was believed to be the primary cause for the dollar s ascent  Investors anticipated that the Fed will consider a rate hike in the second half of this year as strong jobs data suggested that the labor market is improving 
A stronger U S  dollar also weighed on oil prices  Key energy stocks  including EOG Resources  NYSE EOG   Chevron  NYSE CVX  Exxon Mobil  NYSE XOM  and Marathon Oil Corp  NYSE MRO  declined 1 7   1   1 1  and 1 8   respectively 
A stronger dollar is expected to hurt U S  companies on two different counts  Firstly  quarterly results of companies with a large proportion of foreign sales will be affected  Revenues of international divisions will appear lower when they are repatriated in terms of the relatively stronger dollar  Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   IBM  NYSE IBM   Procter   Gamble  NYSE PG  and Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT  are among those who have expressed concerns about how a surging dollar will hit profits 
Additionally  products of foreign companies will become relatively cheaper  This will hit U S  companies on their home turf as well as in foreign markets  The Hershey Company  NYSE HSY  has already been affected  with international sales declining  Meanwhile  General Motors  NYSE GM  and Ford  NYSE F  will be at a disadvantage against their European competitors both at home and abroad if the dollar continues to rise 
ECB s Stimulus
This is also because the euro has declined rapidly recently  plunging to a near 12 year low on Tuesday  The euro lost nearly 1 4  against the U S  dollar to drop to  1 07  The European Central Bank s  ECB  quantitative easing program was also an important factor behind the euro s slide  The program has pushed eurozone bond yields to their lowest levels ever 
ECB President Mario Draghi has said the ECB will purchase these bonds even if they have a negative yield  As announced in January  ECB will buy government bonds worth 60 billion euros a month through a quantitative easing program 
Five Survivors

SUPERVALU holds a Zacks Rank  2  Strong Buy  and gained 5 7  yesterday to close at  10 77  The stocks  earnings estimates for the current year were revised 3  upward over the last 60 days 
It is likely that rate hike fears will dominate market proceedings in the days ahead  However  stocks remain on a strong footing in the longer term and encouraging economic data could boost markets  Retail sales data  scheduled for release on Thursday  will provide valuable insight into growth in terms of consumer demand  For now  adding these stocks to your portfolio would make for a prudent choice ",2015-03-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/5-buy-ranked-stocks-surviving-the-slump-244764,244764
13632,235147,HSY,Income Investors  Don t Buy Bonds Until You Understand This   ,opinion,"Introduction
The primary attractions supporting investing in bonds or other fixed income instruments have traditionally been high income and safety  People invest their principal in bonds and receive a stated interest rate  coupon  over the life of the bond and are given the promise of having their principal returned at maturity  Under normal times  bonds would typically pay a higher rate of interest than the dividend rate on stocks  Consequently  bonds have acquired the reputation as low risk and high income instruments 
However  risk is a multifaceted concept  The risk of losing all your money is one of the investor s greatest fears  Virtually all high quality bonds eliminate this loss of principal risk  But there are additional risks that bonds do not always protect investors from  Fixed income investments provide little or no inflation protection  especially when interest rates are as low as they are today 
Then  there is liquidity risk  Both stocks and bonds fluctuate in price as a direct consequence of the liquidity they provide investors  The primary determinant of a bond s price fluctuation is changes in interest rates  When interest rates rise  the prices of existing bonds will fall  and vice versa  In contrast  there are many factors that can cause stock prices to rise or fall  But my primary point is that liquidity risk  when investing in bonds at low rates of interest like we have today  is very high  In the current environment  bonds do not afford much protection against liquidity risk  Stocks may or may not 
The bottom line is that I support investing in bonds when they possess the characteristics of providing higher income than I can get on a dividend stock  In fact  there was a time when I completely avoided investing in stocks altogether  favoring investing only in bonds instead  That time was from 1979 through all of 1985  a period of time when AAA rated corporate bonds were paying double digit interest rates  When I could get interest rates of 10  to as much as 15  by investing in high quality bonds  I avoided stocks altogether  It made no sense to me to assume the risk that came from owning stocks when I could get double digit rates on bonds and be virtually guaranteed to get my principal back 
Unfortunately  today the reverse is true as the rates on high quality bonds are in many cases lower than the dividend income I can earn on high quality blue chip dividend stocks  Therefore  just as I exclusively invested in bonds during 1979 1985  today I am exclusively investing in high quality blue chip dividend stocks  However  I consider this a temporary posturing as I would once again enthusiastically utilize bonds when they make economic sense and provide the safety and predictability that they traditionally have 
Rebutting the Rebuttal to My Recent Article
Gary Golnik recently authored an article titled    in an apparent attempt to respond to my recent article titled     however  I believe that Gary failed to effectively counter my arguments with his article for the following reasons 
First of all  what Gary failed to point out or recognize  is that 20 years ago when I could have received a 6 82  yield on AAA rated corporate bonds  I would have been delighted to support including them in a retired investor s well diversified and balanced portfolio  At that time  1996  the dividend yield range on most fairly valued dividend growth stocks was only 1  3   Therefore  bonds offered a significant yield advantage 
As a result  the higher yield differential benefit of investing in bonds at that time was worth it  Consequently  I was delighted to support building retirement portfolios balanced between stocks and bonds  especially for retired investors that needed a high level of current income  With interest rates attractive at the time  it was logical to build a balanced portfolio of high quality bonds laddered across various maturities  coupled with attractively valued dividend growth stocks with lower yields but capital appreciation potential in order to fight inflation 
At that time  a balanced portfolio could easily be designed to be able to adapt to the future when bonds in a rationally designed ladder matured  If capital appreciation was high enough  and the dividend growth stocks were generating enough current income due to growth yield  yield on cost  investors would have the option to reinvest the proceeds in either new bonds or stocks as they chose according to their specific needs and risk tolerances 
Additionally  in 1996 bonds made sense because their yields were high enough to even be considered competitive with the traditional long term returns of approximately 6  8  that stocks have historically achieved  Consequently  due to the predictability of their then higher fixed income stream  and the high certainty that your principal would be returned at maturity  at least in nominal terms   it was quite rational to opt for the lower risk qualities available with investing in bonds 
Furthermore  the pricing of previously issued bonds going forward remained strong and healthy because of the continuous downtrend in interest rates that followed  Here I will add that this was not predictable  because forecasting future interest rates never is  but it was an excellent side effect and benefit for owners of bonds previously issued when rates were higher 
Accurately predicting future interest rates remains unpredictable  However  with rates as low as they are today  logic would dictate that the direction of interest rates is more likely to be higher than lower going forward  That would not be a good environment for recent purchasers of bonds  The following historical graph courtesy of FRED  Federal Reserve Bank of St  Louis  of AAA corporate bond yields summarizes the above statements 

The following excerpt from Gary Golnik s article was offered to support his contention that  and I quote 

 So while stocks may beat bonds  they don t beat bonds by enough over the next few years to warrant the risk of a portfolio heavy in stocks  

But as I will soon extensively illustrate  Gary left an important return component out of his comparison  Here is what Gary said  and his supporting graphic 

 I ve finished my thoughts and haven t referred to a single stock   Egads  what shall I do  The figure below shows the total growth of dividends over the last twenty years  data from Chuck s F A S T  Graphs  for stocks compared to the return available from bonds at various rates  I chose a bunch of stocks at random from Mike Nadel s new DG50  Southern Co   NYSE SO   Kellogg  NYSE K   Realty Income  NYSE O   General Electric  NYSE GE   Exxon Mobil  NYSE XOM   Emerson  NYSE EMR   3M  NYSE MMM   Coca Cola  NYSE KO   Clorox  NYSE CLX   Hershey  NYSE HSY   Deere  NYSE DE   PepsiCo  NYSE PEP   Lockheed  NYSE LMT   Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ   just to illustrate  


Unfortunately  Gary left out capital appreciation  the most important part of a proper calculation which is the primary reason I don t like bonds today  To be clear  the above graph compares dividend growth rates only to the interest rate of a bond  Frankly  I don t see a logical comparison between the two  Gary attributed the results depicted on the dividend growth stocks on the X axis on his above graph to data he pulled directly from F A S T  Graphs  
But most importantly  he leaves out capital appreciation  or in the case of bonds   the lack thereof  and he does not compare apples to apples  So allow me to present the complete picture utilizing the same stocks that Gary referenced in his article  However  I will include the entire dividend record  plus report the capital appreciation thereby reporting the more important total return differential  I have cut and pasted the correlating returns of a 6  bond  which was the highest rate Gary s rebuttal presented in place of the S P 500 comparison that is usually on each performance graph 
I think the reader will discover that the advantage of his selected stocks was much greater than Gary indicated  I have placed a highlighted circle around the cumulative total dividend income and around the capital appreciation component  and total income plus capital appreciation for the reader s quick reference 
Southern Company  NYSE SO 
The first and worst performing stock that Gary improperly presented was the low growth  high yield utility stock Southern Company  According to Gary s graph  it produced less cumulative dividend income than the 6  bond  But once again  he was comparing dividend growth rates with the total income of a bond  The dividend growth rate and the total income it produced are two entirely different things  Consequently  according to the performance report below  Southern Company actually produced approximately the same dividend income as the 6  bond produced cumulative total interest 
However  remember that Gary was comparing apples to oranges by referencing the dividend growth rate which was in fact low as to be expected from a utility  but high enough to produce an equal amount of income  But even with this lowest growth example  Southern Company produced a capital appreciation value in excess of  17 000 while the bond only returned the original  10 000 

Kellogg Company  NYSE K 
The second worst performing stock according to Gary s graph was Kellogg  But once again  he was referring to the dividend growth rate only  and failed to include total cumulative income or capital appreciation which would be a more exact comparison  Kellogg did in fact produce half as much dividend income as the 6  bond produced interest  so on that front Gary wins  However  Kellogg did return a capital appreciation value of just under  17 000  which brought the stock to a virtual dead heat with a 6  bond regarding a factual comparison of total return 

However  something else that Gary failed to take into consideration was the fact that Kellogg was overvalued in 1996  and therefore  a rational valuation oriented investor like yours truly would not have invested in it at that time  I am only against bonds when they don t make rational economic sense  but likewise  I am also against investing in dividend growth stocks when they don t make rational economic sense 
At the beginning of 1996 that was clearly the case with Kellogg as the following earnings and price correlated  reveals  However  I will concede that Kellogg s P E ratio of 22 3 at the beginning of 1996 may not have deterred all dividend growth oriented investors 

Realty Income Corporation
The third worst performing stock suggested by Gary s graph was Realty Income Corporation  the high quality REIT known as the monthly income company  I felt that this example was especially misleading because simply referencing its dividend growth rate of just less than 4  ignored the significant total income advantage it generated over the bond and the capital appreciation value 
Realty Income Corporation generated more than twice as much cumulative total dividend income than the 6  bond  and additionally returned almost  42 000 of capital versus the  10 000 return of principal for the bond  I chalk this one up as a great win for the dividend stocks 

Additionally  it is interesting to note that Realty Income Corporation actually offered a higher current dividend yield than 6  at the beginning of 1996  see orange highlight on above graph   There was arguably more risk here  but Realty Income Corporation even offered a yield advantage over the 6  bond  But my main point is that Gary s graph greatly understates the value of investing in Realty Income Corporation in 1996  which by the way was also attractively valued at that time 

General Electric Company  NYSE GE 
As it turns out  General Electric was a rather interesting company for Gary to highlight for several reasons  First of all  it became insanely overvalued coming into the irrational exuberant timeframe 1996 2000  which led to what can only be called a catastrophic fall from grace by the end of 2002  Then with the Great Recession came another catastrophic drop in price  and making matters worse  a 51  dividend cut in 2009 followed by another 25  cut in 2010 
Yet  in spite of all that calamity  long term shareholder owners of General Electric would have received just under  11 000 of total cumulative dividend income compared to  12 000 of interest income from the 6  bond  and ironically notwithstanding all the volatility in between  just over  21 000 of capital appreciation value 

As an interesting aside  in reality I personally would not have held General Electric over the following 20 years  because in truth and fact  I did own it in 1996 but sold it in 1999 due to excessive overvaluation  I only mention this because it speaks to risk control that comes when prudent investors pay attention to sound valuation 

Exxon Mobil Corporation  NYSE XOM 
Due to the problems the oil sector is now experiencing  energy stocks like Exxon are clearly currently under great stress  Nevertheless  I find it interesting that Exxon  thanks to its long and consistent history of raising its dividend  generated a slight total dividend income advantage over the 6  bond  But more importantly  even when measured in the backdrop of the current or recent poor performance of energy stocks  the fact that it almost quadrupled the original  10 000 investment is worth noting 

Emerson Electric Co 
Emerson Electric did as Gary indicated  generate an interesting dividend growth rate which placed in the middle of Gary s graph  However  in spite of that fact  Emerson Electric underperformed the 6  bond based on total dividends  but did return just over  28 000 of capital value  In other words  2 8 times the ending value of  10 000 returned by the bond 

3M Company  NYSE MMM 
As we continue up the staircase of Gary s graph  we come to 3M  This company did produce less total dividend income than the 6  bond produced interest  but it did provide just under  45 000 of capital value providing a solid hedge against inflation 

The Coca Cola Company  NYSE KO 
Coca Cola produced approximately half the dividend income as compared to the interest the 6  bond would have generated  However  it did produce just under  22 000 of capital value  I would agree with Gary that this example did not beat bonds by enough to justify the risk  However  I would argue that prudent valuation oriented dividend growth investors should not have invested in Coca Cola at the beginning of 1996  Valuation was too high  and the dividend yield to low 

Personally  I would have definitely chose 6  bonds over Coca Cola in 1996 because its dividend yield at that time was only 1   and it was significantly overvalued  I am not against bonds  especially when they make economic sense  I am not generally against stocks  but I am against them when they don t make economic sense 

The Clorox Company  NYSE CLX 
I found the Clorox example that Gary selected especially interesting  First of all  Clorox was very attractively valued at the beginning of 1996 and offered a dividend yield of close to 3   Over time  the company s dividend yield eventually caught up to the 6  bond  resulting in total dividend income that was significantly higher than the cumulative total interest on the bond  And as Gary alluded to in his graph  its dividend growth rate was also high at approximately 10  per annum 
However  the most interesting aspect of this example was the capital appreciation value that came in at over  67 000  or more than 6   times what the bond returned  In other words  when a great dividend growth stock can be purchased at a sound valuation and an attractive dividend yield  the long term rewards can be quite satisfying 

The Hershey Company  NYSE HSY 
I have long admired the Hershey Company  but alas I ve never been comfortable paying the premium valuation that this company has consistently commanded  The following performance report would support that my decision to avoid Hershey has been a mistake  However  since both this article and Gary s are focused on risk  Hershey s chronic overvaluation has been a risk that I have been unwilling to take 
Had I been willing to take the risk  since 1996  I would have received just slightly less total cumulative income than I would have received interest on the 6  bond  and my capital appreciation would have been more than fivefold what the bond returned 

Deere and Company
Deere   Company  NYSE DE  represents another example of a dividend growth stock that was fairly valued and available at a moderately high yield at the beginning of 1996  Consequently  it would have produced cumulative dividend income that was only slightly less than the 6  bond  However  the original  10 000 investment would have grown to over  62 000  I think that s a clear advantage to stocks 

PepsiCo  Inc 
In the same vein as Coca Cola  and similar to Hershey  PepsiCo is a dividend growth stock that I have long been interested in owning  However  excessive overvaluation in 1996 coupled with a low dividend yield in 1996 was a deterrent  Nevertheless  even this overvalued low yielding dividend growth stock since 1996 produced an attractive level of total dividend income  albeit less than that 6  bond  And in spite of the overvaluation headwinds  it would have produced more than three times my original investment thanks to the inflation fighting capabilities of capital appreciation 

Lockheed Martin Corporation  NYSE LMT 
This was another dividend growth stock that was fairly valued in 1996 but still underperformed the 6  bond in total income  However  capital appreciation that was more than fivefold the bond supports the benefit of investing in stocks over bonds regarding the opportunity of fighting inflation 

Johnson   Johnson
Gary s final example on his graph was what many consider the  king  of all dividend growth stocks Johnson   Johnson  As Gary s graph indicated  Johnson   Johnson did have the highest dividend growth rate  but this was somewhat mitigated by high valuation in 1996  Nevertheless  this AAA rated blue chip outperformed the 6  bond on total income  and generated over  46 000 of inflation fighting capital appreciation 

A Summary of My Rebuttal to Gary s Rebuttal Thus Far
Although I apologize to the reader for the lengthy rebuttal to what represented the conclusion of Gary s article  I did so because as the old adage goes  the devil s in the details   First of all  Gary utilized bond rates in his closing argument that simply are not available today  Furthermore  his graphic presented the argument that stocks did not provide enough of an advantage over bonds to justify the risk 
However  his graph compared dividend growth rates  not dividend income generation or capital appreciation  to the income from high interest paying bonds that are actually not currently available  But most to the point  comparing the dividend growth rates of stocks offers no relation or relative merit to the interest rate available on the bond 
The dividend growth rates of stocks are simply not relevant to his argument  The only thing that would have been relevant is a side by side comparison of the total returns generated by each  which is what I presented  So sorry  Gary  I believe you meant well  but I did not find your concluding argument relative or even germane to the subject 
I Have an Investment Proposition for You
If I was an investment salesman  although I am not  and came to you with the following proposition  would you be interested  The proposition is as follows  I would like to offer you a 20 year investment that will start out paying you 4  per annum  however  the yield will drop or decrease by 2  every year thereafter until maturity  Additionally  I will virtually guarantee that I will return approximately 67  of your original principal invested after the 20 years have passed  How many thousands of dollars would you like to invest with me today 
I doubt that many of you would take me up on that proposition  However  the odds are extremely high that that is exactly what you would be doing if you invested in an AAA rated corporate bond today  The 20 year AAA rated corporate bond currently yields 3 8   In the following presentation  I rounded that up to 4   Therefore  I provided a mild advantage to the bond 
Then I assumed an inflation rate of 2   which is significantly less than the rate of inflation over the last couple of decades  Once again  I provided a mild advantage to the bond  In my original article  I suggested on several occasions that bonds were simple  I did receive comments challenging that statement  however  I stand on my position  The reason I state that bonds are simple is straightforward  You buy a bond at a specific amount  face value   it will then pay a specific rate of interest over the specified time if held to maturity  Bond investing cannot really get any simpler than that 
However  because of inflation  bonds are not as low risk as Gary suggests  I am not saying that bonds are riskier than stocks  I concede that the opposite is true  On the other hand  the alleged lower risk of bonds only applies to the predictability of receiving a fixed amount of interest each year  and a high probability of having your original investment returned  Because by definition  bonds are fixed income instruments  they have no inflation fighting capacity at all  In contrast  it cannot be said that stocks will absolutely fight inflation  but they at least provide the potential to 

Additionally  the only time that bond investing can get complicated  is if you decide to sell the bond prior to it maturing  This simply provides liquidity risk or benefit depending on what interest rates have done since you originally purchased your bond  As I did in my original article  and for those that would like to learn more about the relationship between bond prices and interest rates  to a Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC  educational piece that summarizes things nicely  If you have any confusion about how this all works  I believe the Wells Fargo investing basics explanation will clear things up 
This brings me to a further rebuttal of what Gary presented in his article  In the article he states  and I quote 

 Bonds
Much has been made about the declining value of bonds in a rising interest rate environment  Bond pricing is simple to calculate in Excel  but is a bit hard to wrap your head around  The figure below lets me understand the basic concepts a bit more easily  I plotted the cost  or value  of a  10 000 face value 10 year bond with a 5  coupon  with various market rates  4  5  and 6 percent  
The first thing to note is that all of the different rate curves collapse to  10 000 at the end  you get your face value back   From a price point of view  bonds get cheaper as rates increase  The current rate environment gives about 4  yield for a high rated corporate bond and rates are likely to go up  The blue curve shows what happens if they increase steadily to 6  over ten years  


My problem with the above quote and graphic is that Gary explicitly states that   high grade corporate bonds under the current rate environment gives a 4  yield   However  he creates a graph of a  10 000 face value 10 year bond paying 5   The problem is  no such high grade corporate 10 year bond exists 
But what I really don t understand is how a lower yielding 4  bond rate starts out at  10 800  I guess he is suggesting that the 4  rate would be at a premium at that time to the nonexistent 5  bond that he presented  I also have a problem with the assumption that rates gradually rise to 6   What happens if interest rates rise much quicker than that  Bond prices can fall sharply if rates rise quickly 
Gary then follows the above up with two graphs with stock and bond calculations at various rates  Once again  the problem is he uses 10 year bond rates of 4   5  and 6   Unfortunately  no high quality 10 year bonds offering those rates exist today  If they did  I would better accept his argument  but since they don t  I don t 

 Stocks versus Bonds
The next figure shows the value of  10 000 invested with ten year bond rates at 4   5   and 6   It also shows the total value of  10 000 worth of DGI stock invested in a 3  dividend yielding company  which grows its dividend and its stock price at 3   5   and 7  rates  These correspond to a range of total dividend growth of factors of 1 8 to 3 9  and growth rates of dividend of 6   10   and 14   Neither of the investments are reinvested  

Gary s accompanying graph 

Once again  the biggest problem I have with the above graph is that high quality 10 year bonds that are paying 4   5   or 6  are not available today  The best rate that I see on a 10 year corporate bond of any quality is an A rated corporate which only offers a yield of 3 52   As I will discuss later  if I could in fact find quality bonds of reasonable maturities with yields of at least 5   but preferably higher  I might to an extent buy into Gary s argument 
But unfortunately for Gary and the rest of us  rates like that are simply not available today  Consequently  bonds do not offer any protection against inflation risk  and that is a real risk  Moreover  even when yields were much higher  they still didn t fight inflation  but they at least generated a high enough level of current income that they made sense to include in a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds  I am not anti bonds  but I am anti bonds when rates are as low as they are today as evidenced by the following table courtesy of ValuBond 

Additionally  Gary attempts to support his argument by presenting his views of a Monte Carlo simulation by Wade Pfau and the glide path  However  I believe that Gary dramatically oversimplifies what Wade Pfau s work was really about  For example  Gary offers what I interpret as a moderately cynical statement about investors and stock picking  However  the Monte Carlo simulations that Wade Pfau and others developed focus significantly on stock valuations as the following excerpt indicates 

 This study explores the interaction of two research threads relating to asset allocation in retirement  whether the optimal equity glide path should rise or fall throughout retirement  and at what pace those changes should occur   and or whether retirement asset allocation should move up and down dynamically in response to stock market valuation extremes  

Additionally  and perhaps even ironically  Wade Pfau and Associates indicated that glide paths performed better with stocks and treasury bills and not bonds  as the following two excerpts from the   with bold emphasis added by me 

 It is notable that in these high valuation environments glide paths and dynamic valuation based allocations tend to perform better with stocks and Treasury bills  or similar cash substitutes  and not bonds  The potential bond volatility with interest rate risk can be dangerous and possibly lead to lower SAFEMAX outcomes when equity valuations are already so elevated  even if the bonds still have better long term returns   

 This suggests that financial planners guiding clients on retirement income in today s environment should focus on managing interest rate risk  even at the cost of lower bond portfolio returns  It is not necessarily fatal to a retirement plan to hold high allocations of short term bonds in the face of low interest rates  because its primary purpose is to defend against equity declines and be available to reinvest for better equity returns  not to be a return driver itself  
Now  I will admit that the link to the above article allegedly supports the general idea of including fixed income in all portfolios  Nevertheless  my main point is that there is much more to the glide path scenario than Gary would like us to believe with his glide path graph  The reader is free to review the entire article  as I have  to gain a deeper insight into what I m discussing 

 Wade Pfau and the Glide Path
Dr  Pfau has done a lot of Monte Carlo simulations of various retirement outcomes  oh  goody  Monte Carlos  my engineer brain starts to get excited   Seriously  it s a good and valid tool  He looked at various ratios of stocks and bonds in an investment portfolio  and look  please  cash is just a very low return bond as far as this analysis is concerned   I know I can pick stocks better than averages  oh wait  most investors can t   Trust me  all of these arguments are minor details in the overall analysis  What he showed is that the best chance of having your money last through retirement is to follow a  glide path   see the figure below  my interpretation of the concept   And yes it s a V rather than a U because I didn t bother to make the allocation nonlinear  


Summary and Conclusion   I want it to be crystal clear that in the general sense I am not anti bonds  When and if bonds make economic sense  as they have in the past  I would be enthusiastic about including them in retirement portfolios  as I have been in the past  However  I do not believe that bonds make economic sense at today s low level of interest rates  The yields they offer are simply not high enough to overcome the inflation risk  and tax risk if in taxable accounts  that is highly certain to destroy their true future purchasing power 
Yes  it is possible that stocks might also do poorly  But in my opinion the reality in the current interest rate environment is that I can find fairly valued  high quality dividend growth stocks that offer higher current yields than I can find on high quality bonds  and they at least provide the potential to fight inflation  I would rather take the risk that I may or may not beat inflation with a temporary overweight in stocks  over the risk of being virtually guaranteed that I won t 
But my bottom line point is that retired investors should not buy bonds until they once again provide the traditional yield advantage over stocks that they have in the past  When that happens  and I believe that it will  but I don t know when  bonds will once again become a viable investment alternative 
But until that happens  I don t believe it makes sense to invest in low yielding bonds unless you keep your maturities ridiculously short  Unfortunately  if you do that  there is no return of any kind available at all  If you cannot stomach temporarily having all your money in dividend stocks  then put it in cash  not bonds 
As a bonus  I have prepared a free analyze out loud video on  that provides a more in depth and detailed look at bonds vs dividend growth stocks in today s low interest rate environment

13633,235148,HSY,10 Stocks To Watch If There s A Crash,opinion,"We ve all seen the headlines  If you believe the financial media  we re in a bubble and it s about to pop  2014 is going to be 2008  2001  and 1929 all over again 
I m not quite so pessimistic  but it s hard to ignore the fact that the risk in this market is increasing  I wrote back in January that I thought valuations in the market were stretched  and I expect major corrections in certain stocks though not so much for the whole market 
Now that we know the Fed is more likely to tighten than loosen  everyone concedes that it is only a matter of time before certain stocks fall back to earth  The question is not if but when  Still  a tough question 
Pop
Typically  bubbles continue until something serious comes along to pop them  I remember back in 1999   2000 how everyone knew the market was in a bubble  but they were afraid to miss the upside so they stayed in  And  eventually  got crushed 
The current geopolitical uncertainty adds to the risk in the market  It might not be the straw that breaks the bubble s back  but it certainly raises the risk profile of some already highly overpriced stocks 
With every passing day  success in this market depends more and more on being diligent in your stock  ETF or mutual fund investments  Momentum and technical strategies are crowded and ineffective  Investing is getting harder  not easier  There is no substitute for proper diligence on the true earnings and valuation of securities  Investing based on other criteria is not investing  it is speculating 
So  my advice is do your homework and arm yourself with diligence  And when opportunity presents itself  dive in 
Benjamin Roth  a lawyer during the Great Depression  kept a diary that includes many wonderful  on the market  In particular  he wrote in 1931 that  It is generally believed that good stocks and bonds can now be bought at very attractive prices   and then in 1937 that  The greatest chance in a lifetime to build a fortune has gone and will probably not come again soon  
Think  Opportunity 
For the long term investor  a market crash represents an incredible money making opportunity  As long as you have some cash on the sidelines  high quality companies can often be bought at prices well below where they d normally trade 
The list below comprises 10 stocks that aren t quite screaming buys but could be incredible opportunities if a crash shaves 25  or more off their valuations  All these companies earn a top quintile return on invested capital  ROIC  and have a price to economic book value that earns my second best  Attractive  rating 
Stocks to Buy in a Crash
Sources    New Constructs  LLC and company filings 
All these companies are high quality  value creating businesses that I would love to own  In fact  I ve previously recommended two of them  Gap  NYSE GPS  and Scripps Networks Interactive  NYSE SNI   Both GPS and SNI have outperformed the broader market and now are just too expensive for me to be a buyer any longer  If the price dropped sharply in a market crash  however  I d definitely look at re entering those positions 
The Price Has Got To Be Right
The Hershey Company  NYSE HSY  is a great example of a company I d like to own a piece of at a cheaper price  Hershey has steadily increased its ROIC from 15  in 2007 to 22  last year  HSY s consistently solid free cash flow  along with its  750 million in excess cash  give it plenty of resources to either invest in its business or return cash to shareholders 
However  at its current price of   92 share  HSY has a PEBV of 1 5  which means that roughly a third of the market s valuation of the stock relies on future cash flow growth  I d rather not invest in a stock with that much growth already baked into its price 
If the market were to crash and HSY were to fall 30 40   it would be trading in the low sixties  right at economic book value  Essentially  the stock would be priced for zero growth  HSY bottomed near a PEBV of 1 0 in 2008  and has returned nearly 200  since that time 
A similar story applies to the rest of the stocks in the list    all great companies  but too expensive to be good stocks  If the market crashes  keep an eye on these stocks as potential investments when the price is right

13635,235150,HSY,Designing The Appropriate Common Stock Retirement Portfolio,opinion,"Introduction
What is the best way to design or construct a common stock portfolio  This is a question I am often asked and my short answer is always the same   it depends  The truth is  there is no perfect method or strategy for designing a stock portfolio that is right for every individual investor  However  there are principles of sound investing that every investor can follow and apply when designing a common stock portfolio that s just right for them 
Furthermore  there are general categories that individual investors fall into  Some individuals are young and planning for retirement while other individuals are closer to retirement  and there are some that are already retired  Additionally  each individual investor has different levels of financial resources that specifically apply  To complicate the process even more  individual investors of all types possess unique goals  needs  objectives and risk tolerances  Therefore  the logical secret to designing a successful common stock portfolio is to design one that s most appropriate for you 
Therefore  the objective of this series of articles is not to attempt to dictate how individuals should design their own stock portfolios  Instead  the objective of this series is to provide information regarding common stock investing strategies and options that each individual can evaluate and ultimately utilize so they can implement and construct a common stock portfolio that s just right for them 
At the end of the day  it comes down to making the appropriate choices  The most appropriate choices include  but are not limited to  utilizing the most suitable categories of common stocks available as well as the appropriate mix  In one context the choices approach the infinite  and this can be confusing or even overwhelming  On the other hand  the options can be generally categorized  thereby simplifying the process to a more manageable level 
Of course  individual investors also have the option of engaging professional help or self directing their own stock portfolios  This can be done directly by hiring outside professional managers or by investing in packaged products created by professional managers such as mutual funds or ETF s  However  this series of articles is intended for the self directed individual investor interested in designing and managing their own common stock portfolios 
Stock Selection  What Are the Choices 
On the US stock exchanges alone  individual investors have almost 20 000 individual stocks  companies  to choose from  No matter how diligent you could be  it would be impossible for any individual to conduct a comprehensive analysis on all of them  Therefore  individual investors need a method of separating the wheat from the chaff 
One effective way to accomplish that is to break the larger list down into broader categories based on specific characteristics and attributes  In his best selling book  One Up On Wall Street   renowned mutual fund manager Peter Lynch presented what he referred to as  The Six Categories   Personally  I believe that Peter Lynch provided a succinct summary of the broad categories or types of common stocks available for investment consideration 
However  his 6 categories are very broad  and therefore  within each category there are many additional nuances that investors are best served to recognize and understand  Nevertheless  I believe that Peter Lynch provided an excellent foundation with his presentation of the 6 broad categories available to investors  To clarify this important distinction further  I turn to Peter Lynch and his own words with the following quote 
 There are almost as many ways to classify stocks as there are stockbrokers    but I found that the 6 categories cover all of the useful distinctions that any investor has to make  
In order to provide the reader with a more comprehensive understanding of the 6 broad categories of stocks that Peter Lynch presented  I offer the following review of each category with a few sample  to provide deeper insights  Importantly  since Peter Lynch was primarily referring to the characteristics of 6 broad types of businesses  I have taken stock prices off of the graphs  My goal was to allow the reader the opportunity to focus on the types of businesses that Peter Lynch was describing without the bias that volatile stock movements can bring 
Peter Lynch s 6 General Categories
Below I present Peter Lynch s 6 general categories with a short description taken directly from his best selling book  One Up On Wall Street   Then I present an example or two with brief commentary of my own with the objective of providing a deeper insight into each category and what each offers from an investment perspective  When appropriate  my examples will come directly from what Peter Lynch said  But most importantly  my examples are not recommendations to buy today  instead  they are just offered as examples of the types of companies Peter Lynch was referencing 
Slow Growers
 Usually these large and aging companies are expected to grow slightly faster than the gross national product  Slow growers didn t start out that way  They started out as fast growers and eventually pooped out  either because they had gone as far as they could  or else they got too tired to make the most of their chances  When an industry at large slows down  as they always seem to do   most of the companies within the industry lose momentum as well  Electric utilities are today s most popular slow growers  
Southern Company  NYSE SO   A Slow Growing Utility
From the following graph we see a quintessential example of a slow growing utility that Peter Lynch suggested as a popular slow grower  Long term earnings growth has averaged only 2 5   However  the primary attraction to investing in utilities is not for growth  instead  it is for their above average dividend yields 

When you examine the performance of Southern Company since 1995  you see the benefit of its high dividend yield relative to the average company as represented by the S P 500  However  you also discovered that capital appreciation  which averaged 2 8   is highly correlated to its earnings growth achievement of 2 5   Slow growth utilities can be excellent choices for retired investors seeking maximum income 

Campbell Soup Company  NYSE CPB 
However  not all slow growers are utility stocks  Therefore  I present Campbell Soup as a second example of a slow grower from the consumer nondurables sector  Since fiscal year 1996  Campbell Soup has grown earnings at 2 9   The company does offer a moderately generous dividend  but its average dividend yield is lower than utilities such as Southern Company typically offer  Importantly  that previous statement implies that both companies are purchased when valuation is sound 

When you examine the performance of Campbell Soup over the timeframe covered in the above graph  you again discover a high correlation of capital appreciation of 3 8  to its earnings growth rate of 2 9   On the other hand  due to its typical lower yields referenced above  total cumulative dividends are consistent with the average company  as represented by the S P 500 

The Stalwarts
 Stalwarts are companies such as Coca Cola  Bristol Myers  Procter   Gamble  Hershey s  Ralston Purina and Colgate Palmolive  These multibillion dollar hulks are not exactly agile climbers  but they are faster than slow growers  
Stalwarts are an important category for retired investors and dividend growth investors  Many of the Dividend Aristocrats and Dividend Champions are found in this category  However  as Peter Lynch pointed out  stalwarts will not necessarily produce high growth  but most of the companies in this category would be considered blue chips  Nevertheless  quality often comes at premium valuations  Therefore  it can be difficult to find stalwarts at attractive values 
The Hershey Company  NYSE HSY 
Hershey was one of the companies that Peter mentioned in the above quote from his book  This is clearly a stalwart  however  even though I don t have prices on the graph  if I did you would discover that this company has a long legacy of commanding a premium valuation  Nevertheless  it has grown earnings at an average rate of 7 6  since fiscal year 1997  On the other hand  earnings growth has been interrupted a few times along the way 

When examining the long term performance of Hershey we once again see that capital appreciation is highly correlated with the company s earnings growth rate  However  its cumulative dividend yield has been superior to the average company as represented by the S P 500 

The Procter   Gamble Company  NYSE PG 
The blue chip stalwart Procter   Gamble has grown earnings at 6 3  since fiscal year 1996  Although this qualifies it as a faster grower than the slow growers presented above  the reader should note that growth has been slowing in recent years  see red circle on graph   Although not depicted  growth over the last decade or so would place Procter   Gamble in the slower grower category comparable to what we saw with Campbell Soup  This is important because investors should be aware that companies can move from one category to the next  especially as they get larger  as is the case with Procter   Gamble 

Regardless  the long term performance associated with the above graph clearly illustrates Peter Lynch s point about faster growing stalwarts  Long term average earnings growth of 6 3  correlates highly with the capital appreciation of 7 1  that Procter   Gamble produced for shareholders 
However  the interesting aspect of Procter   Gamble s performance is that total cumulative dividend income exceeded the income of the slow growing utility Southern Company  This is attributed to Procter   Gamble s higher earnings growth and dividend growth over the long run 

The Fast Growers
 These are among my favorite investments  small  aggressive new enterprises that grow at 20 to 25  year  If you choose wisely  this is the land of the 10  40 baggers  and even the 200 baggers  With a small portfolio  one or 2 of these can make a career  Fast growing company doesn t necessarily have to belong to a fast growing industry  As a matter of fact  I d rather it didn t  
Although Peter Lynch did not mention any fast growers by name  I offer the following examples to illustrate the powerful returns possible with fast growers  Each of the three examples presented below met his criteria of a  10 bagger  or better  Two of them would classify as  small aggressive new enterprises that grow at 20  to 25  a year  but Google is currently a behemoth as a result of its extremely high historical earnings growth thus far 
I will let the F A S T  Graphs  and associated performance results on each stand on their own  The key points the reader should focus on are the historical earnings growth rates and the long term returns that each have produced  However  it should also be noted that none of these fast growers pay a dividend and all the return has resulted from capital appreciation over time

The Cyclicals
 A cyclical is a company whose sales and profits rise and fall in regular if not completely predictable fashion  In a growth industry  business just keeps expanding  but in a cyclical industry it expands and contracts  then expands and contracts again  The autos and the airlines  the tire companies  steel companies  and chemical companies are all cyclicals  Even defense companies behave like cyclicals  since their profits rise and fall depends on the policies of various administrations  
When examining the following graphs on well known cyclicals in the autos  tire and steel sector  we see classic examples of what Peter Lynch meant when he said  profits rise and fall in regular if not completely predictable fashion   The associated performance reports of each of these first three examples illustrates the unpredictable nature of investing in them 
I also included Boeing as a defense company to illustrate how they behave like cyclicals  However  most defense companies I have examined are a lot less cyclical than the autos  tire and steel deep cyclicals  As a result  the dividend income stream from most defense companies is often more predictable than their semi cyclical earnings results  But most importantly  this illustrates how diverse companies can be within each of these 6 broad categories

Turnarounds
 Turnaround candidates have been battered  depressed  and often can barely drag themselves into Chapter 11  These are slow growers  these are no growers  These aren t cyclicals that rebound  these are potential fatalities  Turnarounds stocks can make up lost ground very quickly    The best thing about investing in successful turnarounds is that of all the categories of stocks  their ups and downs are least related to the general market

In the late 1990s Crown Cork  then known as Crown Cork and Seal  was forced to reorganize as a result of being inundated with asbestos lawsuits and an ill fated acquisition  However  I present this example to illustrate what Peter Lynch meant when he talked about how quickly turnarounds can make up lost ground 


To illustrate my point  I offer the following Crown Holdings earnings graph with prices included  Here we discover that once earnings growth resumed  what was once a turnaround turned into one of the fast growers discussed above 


American International Group  NYSE AIG 
One of the most recognized companies in the financial services sector was American International Group  The company had actually amassed a strong record of earnings growth prior to the bursting of the financial bubble  However  the following graph clearly illustrates the complete collapse of earnings 

On the other hand  since 2012  we see how American International Group represented a classic example of what Peter Lynch meant when he said they could turn around quickly  Since 2012  earnings growth has averaged more than 40  per year  However  most of that average growth is attributed to the 285  growth achieved in 2012 

Even though American International Group s earnings growth has slowed down since 2012  shareholder returns during this turnaround period have been more than double the S P 500  Personally  I consider turnarounds a very risky category  On the other hand  for those investors with an appetite for risk  they can be quite rewarding as both of these examples illustrate 

The Asset Plays
 An asset play is any company that is sitting on something valuable that you know about  but that the Wall Street crowd has overlooked  The asset play may be as simple as a pile of cash  Sometimes its real estate  
Plum Creek Timber Company  NYSE PCL 
Frankly  I was not able to come up with a clear example of an asset play  However  Plum Creek Timber Company might represent an example of what Peter Lynch was talking about  The company does own or control a large amount of timber producing real estate and they do have a program for selling it  However  the majority of their revenues come from selling wood related products 
Nevertheless  the underlying value of their real estate holdings is not necessarily reflected in their ongoing operating results  However  I believe it is a speculation to believe that shareholders would benefit in a meaningful way   at least over the short to intermediate term  My point is that I consider asset plays too speculative for most investors 


As a bonus  I have prepared a free  which provides a more in depth and detailed look at Peter Lynch s 6 categories of stocks 
Summary and Conclusions
In this part 1 on stock selection  I have simply presented the 6 broad categories that investors have to choose from based on what Peter Lynch wrote about in his best selling book  It s important to state that investors could in theory construct a fully diversified common stock portfolio by only using companies from 1 of the 6 broad categories  For example  a diversified portfolio of dividend growth stocks could be created utilizing stalwarts only 
Nevertheless  the primary objective of this part 1 of a series on stock selection was to illustrate the broad categories available for common stock investors to choose from  In that regard  this article was oriented towards developing a clearer understanding of the types of companies available to various classes of common stock investors  Moreover  this article was also designed to illustrate the vast differences there are among the 6 categories of common stocks  This supports my continuing contention that it is a market of stocks and not a stock market 
In part 2  I will discuss an assortment of common stock portfolio design strategies that investors might consider  depending on their goals  objectives  needs and risk tolerances

13636,235151,HSY,Double Digit Equity Returns Hiding In Plain Sight,opinion,"Entirely too many investors lurch from one stock to another in a desperate search for higher returns  While a precious few get lucky  the majority doom themselves to abysmal returns 
Wall Street  of course  loves this  because this kind of behavior generates huge commissions and gives professional traders a self replenishing source of fuel  your money 
Thankfully  it doesn t have to be that way 
Today we re going to talk about what you need to know about a special class of investments that s been shown to account for as much as 90  of total market returns over the last century 
They re beaten down  ideal for anyone who s been burned by the latest dot bomber or media darling  and one of the most sensible investments you can make today 
Best of all  they pay you cold hard cash while requiring almost none of your time to manage  making them a perfect choice even if there s more volatility ahead 
Here s a time tested way to put your investment money to work during turbulent times 
What Most Investors Are Missing in Their Rush to Profits
I ve talked with tens of thousands of investors over the years and inevitably they all want the same thing  safe  big double digit returns 
There s nothing wrong with that  It s absolutely possible  No   scratch that   it s essential to building the financial future of your dreams 
Here s the rub though 
Most investors go about this entirely the wrong way  They pursue the next  best thing  and lurch from stock to stock thinking that s going to get them the home run they desperately crave  The majority of the time they wind up with nothing to show for their efforts save smaller brokerage statements 
In reality  the path to above average double digit returns is right in front of them  It s the sure things that make this happen 
As usual  this is counterintuitive  As always  you ve got to get your emotions out of the way before you get started  That way you can take a good hard look at the data without damning emotional hang ups 
That s what Richard Turnhill and Stuart Reeve did in 2010  The former is chief investment strategist for BlackRock s Alpha Strategies Group and the latter is the lead portfolio manager for BlackRock s Global Dividend Income portfolios  Between the two of them  they help manage more than  4 7 trillion   with a  T  
Their research  like mine  tells a very compelling story   up to 90  of total returns over the last century came from dividends and reinvestment  Not 25  or 50   but 90  
Most investors hear this and immediately make a fatal assumption that they have to play a decades long waiting game to earn that kind of money  That s simply not true 
In fact  companies that distribute regular  reliable dividend payouts tend to significantly outperform their non dividend peers over both the short and long term 

There are a couple of reasons why  First  dividend paying stocks offer a constant income stream that offsets low interest rates  Second  they tend to be better run and have better business models and stronger balance sheets than non dividend paying alternatives  And  third  dividend paying companies place a premium on stability so you have the built in downside protection of savvy managers rather than clueless politicians and even more clueless Fed officials 
While the first two are obviously very important under any market conditions  the latter is critically important now  That s because dividend paying stocks have  on average  suffered losses less than half as severe as those that don t reward their shareholders over time 
Obviously  earnings are under pressure right now  Chances are you re hearing a lot about this in the mainstream media  I ve certainly been asked about it in connection with my recent television appearances 
Conventional thinking is that this is going to crater dividends  so a lot of people are prepared to write  em off 
That s a terrible mistake 
You see  dividends  as we have discussed many times  are a function of much more than earnings  Companies that pay them tend to have a moderate growth rate that s matched by a strong balance sheet  solid cash flow  and strong earnings  You simply cannot look at earnings in isolation 

The other thing to keep in mind is that many of the best run companies actually grow their dividends over time  They re not like making a fixed income investment in a bond that never changes  which is how a lot of people think about dividends 
That means that every dollar you invest and reinvest going forward is compounded  This is important because here  too  there is a performance difference   dividend growers outperform companies that keep their dividends the same 
You can see that very clearly in a lot of studies  but one of my favorites is this one from Ned Davis Research highlighting how powerful this can be even under some of the toughest market conditions in history  What s interesting about this is that the outperformance is true for both U S  stocks AND global stocks 

What s really great though   and admittedly is my favorite part of all this   is that dividend growth is so powerful that you can make a modest investment and over time earn more money than you paid to do so 
I ve known plenty of savvy investors  for example  who made modest investments in companies like Altria Group  NYSE MO   Procter   Gamble Co   NYSE PG   and others who have received more in dividends over the years than it cost them to buy the shares initially  Effectively  they ve got gobs of free money on their hands  and you can bet they re living the high life  too 
So how do you get started 
I m glad you asked  by taking a look at a few key numbers 
This Metric Led Money Map Readers to 175   Gains
In February 2010  I raised some eyebrows by recommending Altria Group to Money Map Report subscribers  It was a controversial recommendation at the time because  in addition to waves of litigation  the stock was brushing up to 52 week highs that made some observers question my timing 
But I wasn t worried about market timing   then or ever  I was much more interested  as I noted to my readers  in Altria s proven ability to hike its dividend payouts significantly over the years  In fact  as I explained to readers  I was so confident in Altria s ability to continue its string of dividend hikes that I titled the issue  This Ultra Reliable 6 9  Dividend Is Just the Beginning  
Sure enough  Altria has hiked its dividend seven times in the five years since  rising from  0 38 per share in the days immediately before my recommendation to  0 565 per share today   a 48 6  dividend increase as it gave readers who followed along the opportunity to capture profits of more than 175   The S P 500  by comparison  has turned in only 83 11  over the same time frame 

It seems obvious in retrospect  but at the time Altria s ability to keep up its legendary dividend hikes was seen as being very much in doubt  Multibillion dollar lawsuits targeting the company  often successfully  led many analysts to wonder how much cash Altria would have to maintain  much less increase  its payouts 
As usual  though  analysts were asking the wrong question 
I was more concerned with the company s payout ratio   the percentage of a company s earnings that go back to shareholders in dividends  The few analysts who gave it a fair hearing thought Altria s then payout ratio of 77  was suspiciously high 
They weren t factoring in the reality that this payout ratio was actually on the historically low side for Altria  which maintained a profit margin that crushed the overall consumer goods sector by more than two to one 
Companies that have high profit margins are usually well positioned to not only maintain but also increase their dividend payouts over time  For example  look at Hershey Co   NYSE HSY   which managed to raise its dividend payout seven times in the last seven years 
You might not suspect that a chocolate company would be able to hike its dividend payout by 95 9  at a time when financial markets seemed to teeter near the point of collapse  even if it had an unbeatable brand like Hershey 
But once again  the company s dividend outlook was determined by profit margin  The company maintained a profit margin of 10 47  in September 2009  according to Ycharts com  That was respectable enough to give management plenty of breathing room to raise dividends  especially since the product was already so cheap it didn t see much of a drag in demand due to recession 
Finding Extra Income in the Most Unlikely Places
Then there s the technology sector  which typically isn t considered a significant source of dividend income 
Many tech stocks are notoriously stingy when it comes to dishing out dividends  That s because the sector they re fighting over is so fluid  they often can t afford to divert precious resources from research and development lest they lose the crucial battle over market share  They ve also convinced legions of investors that growth companies simply don t pay out  which is baloney  but another story for another time  
Google Inc  NASDAQ GOOGL   Tesla Motors Inc  NASDAQ TSLA    Facebook  NASDAQ FB  and GoPro Inc   NASDAQ GPRO   for example  are just a few of the bigger players that don t pay any dividends at all 
But the fact remains  a great way to generate reliable income is to invest in mature dividend paying technology stocks that sit on huge cash hoards and control proprietary technology that the world s consumers increasingly covet 
A notable  and recent  case in point is Apple Inc  NASDAQ AAPL   The Cupertino giant hiked its dividend by 33  five months ago   mere weeks after I identified it as a likely dividend hiker to Total Wealth readers 
This technology icon is able to hike its dividend despite the nature of its sector because of its stellar profit margin of more than 22   Tim Cook s well known intent to reward shareholders also contributed to making the company a likely dividend grower in my view 
Another enticing dividend paying tech stock is Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM   which has raised its payouts by 37  in just the last two years 
With a stellar profit margin of more than 23   the company is a very strong candidate to boost its dividend payout significantly in the near future 
Although it s more of a dark horse candidate  SanDisk  NASDAQ SNDK  could hike its dividend in a meaningful way as well  The memory storage device maker is tapped into the  Unstoppable Trend  of technology and has hit a rough patch of growing pains that isn t unusual for expanding new players in new markets  But it s also raised its dividend payout by 33  over the last two years  and its 46  payout ratio means it has more room to grow ",2015-09-16,Keith Fitz-Gerald,https://www.investing.com/analysis/these-double-digit-returns-are-hiding-in-plain-sight-265150,265150

13649,235164,HSY,Food Costs Are No Joke ,opinion,"If This Continues  You May Need Armed Guards On Food Trucks
The basic necessities in life just keep getting more expensive   On Tuesday  Hershey Company  NYSE HSY  announced that the prices of all of their chocolate bars is going to go up by about 8 percent   That is particularly distressing to me  because I am known to love chocolate   But if it was just chocolate that was becoming significantly more expensive perhaps that would be okay   Last month  it was coffee   J M  Smucker  one of the largest Coffee producers in the United States  announced that it planned to raise coffee prices by about 9 percent   And Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  has announced a bunch of price increases across the board on their coffee products   Of course we could all survive without chocolate and coffee  but as you will see below just about every food category is becoming more expensive   If this keeps up  could we eventually see armed guards in grocery stores and on food trucks 
On Wednesday  Robert Wenzel of the Economic Policy Journal  some new data that has just been released by the federal government about food inflation over the past year   Without a doubt  these numbers are quite startling 

According to thereleased today by the Bureau of Labor Statistics  year over year gains in some food products at the producer level have been truly spectacular 
Eggs for fresh use are up 33 9  
Pork is up 28  
Processed turkeys are up 20 4  
Dairy products are up 10 7  
Fresh and dry vegetables are up 8 4  
Fresh fruits and melons are up 7 5  

Unfortunately  paychecks for most American families are not going up at similar rates 
What that means is more pain when we make our trips to the grocery store   Things have gotten so bad that even the mainstream media is running stories about this   For example  this excerpt comes from a recent CNBC article 

 I try to do all my local errands in one day and go up to the mall   said Helon Rapfogel of New Jersey   I used to go maybe twice or three times a week  and now I just go one day a week  if that much  And I try to consolidate things  
Rapfogel said that higher costs for food and gas are hitting her overall budget 
 You sacrifice things  Like not doing an ice cream run during the week with the kids   That could  hurt the local retailers  and we don t want to do that   but we may have to   she said 
At the grocery store  meat  dairy and fruit prices are all up substantially  People are even paying more for lattes at their local coffee shops  And it s not just food gas prices have jumped sharply on geopolitical unrest  and at the moment there s no relief in sight 

So why is all of this happening 
Well  the truth is that a lot of factors have combined to produce something of a perfect storm 
First of all  we should talk about Federal Reserve money printing   Since the last financial crisis  the Fed has been on an unprecedented money printing spree   This has dramatically pushed up the prices of stocks  commodities and just about everything else   It was naive to think that we wouldn t eventually see substantial food inflation as well   Just look at what  quantitative easing  has done to M1 since the last recession 

When you have more dollars chasing roughly the same amount of goods and services of course prices are going to go up 
It is just basic economics 
But according to Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen  there is absolutely no reason to be concerned   The following is a video of her telling the press her view on inflation that I shared in a previous article 

But crazy Fed money printing is not the only reason why food prices are going up 
The endless drought in the western half of the country is severely hurting food production as well   The size of the U S  Cattle herd has shrunk for seven years in a row  and it is now the smallest that it has been since 1951   And the drought is hitting the state of California particularly hard  and considering the fact that it produces nearly half of all of our fresh produce that is more than a little bit alarming   Yes  we are more technologically advanced that we used to be  but we are not advanced enough to overcome an epic multi year drought in half the nation 
In addition  we are also dealing with the worst pork virus to ever hit the United States right now   Porcine epidemic diarrhea has already wiped out about 10 percent of the pig population in the U S   and approximately 100 000 more are dying each week   As you saw above  pork prices are already up 28 percent over the past 12 months  and if a solution is not found to this virus the price increases are going to get much worse 
Down in Florida  citrus growers are facing a horrific outbreak of citrus greening disease   The U S  Department of Agriculture says that orange production in the U S  will be down 18 percent compared to last year  and it is expected that this will be the worst crop in close to 30 years 
Another plague known as the TR4 fungus has hit banana production   According to CNBC  this horrible fungus may eventually completely wipe out the variety of bananas that we eat today 

Banana lovers take note  The world s supply of the fruit is under attack from a fungus strain that could wipe out the popular variety that Americans eat 
 It s a very serious situation   said Randy Ploetz  a professor of plant pathology at the University of Florida who in 1989 originally discovered a strain of Panama disease  called TR4  that may be growing into a serious threat to U S  supplies of the fruit and Latin American producers 
 There s nothing at this point that really keeps the fungus from spreading   he said in an interview with CNBC 
While there are nearly 1 000 varieties of bananas  the most popular is the Cavendish  which accounts for 45 percent of the fruit s global crop and the one Americans mostly find in their supermarkets 

For decades  Americans have been able to go to the grocery stores and fill up their carts with massive amounts of very inexpensive food 
But just because it has been that way for so many years does not mean that it will be that way in the future 
Right now  there are 49 million Americans that are dealing with food insecurity  and that number will only get worse as food prices go even higher 
It is getting to the point where it is not too hard to imagine desperate people holding up food trucks and robbing grocery stores in order to feed themselves and their families 
Let us hope that we don t see anything like that any time soon  but we are moving in that direction 
Just a few years ago  the notion that we could ever see armed guards on food trucks or in grocery stores in the United States was absolutely unthinkable 
But now  it is not so crazy

13650,235165,HSY, Stench  of Nassar scandal will dog USA Gymnastics for years  experts,news,"By Ben Klayman DETROIT  Reuters    The scandal stemming from longtime USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar s sexual abuse of young female athletes could take a financial toll on the sports federation for years  sponsorship executives said  The group already stands to lose millions of dollars in revenue through the 2020 Olympic Games  as sponsors back away after a week of emotional testimony detailing Nassar s crimes against star athletes  the executives said   There s a stench right now and how long will the smell stay around  that s really the question   said Gary Fechter  an attorney with McCarter   English who has represented companies in sponsorship deals   People either want to look away or don t want to be reminded of it   Nassar was sentenced on Wednesday to up to 175 years in prison at the end of a weeklong hearing  A parade of victims told their stories in raw and unflinching terms  describing how he used medical treatments to justify penetrating their bodies with his fingers  He worked for the federation through four Olympic Games  but the allegations did not come to light until 2016  Well known Olympic medalists including Gabby Douglas and Aly Raisman also publicly accused Nassar of sexually abusing them  with Raisman in court calling the federation  rotten from the inside   Federation President and Chief Executive Kerry Perry  who took over last year after her predecessor resigned  said Wednesday after the sentencing that the victims  testimonies have left a lasting impression    Every day  their stories will impact my decisions   she said in a statement   USA Gymnastics will be in the news again next week when Nassar is due to be sentenced on similar charges in a different Michigan court  The group still faces litigation from scores of victims accusing it of inaction in the face of years of complaints  and U S  Olympic Committee Chief Executive Scott Blackmun has called for the entire board to resign   L2N1PK1N5   L8N1PK096   DRIP  DRIP  DROP That constant drip of bad news has corporate sponsors dropping their deals  Industry experts said the scandal has been amplified by the  MeToo era that has seen dozens of prominent men in business  politics and entertainment accused of sex abuse   The only thing that gets people s attention in sports or business or politics is cash flow  or in this case  compromising cash flow   said David Carter  executive director of the USC Sports Business Institute    The rebooting of USA Gymnastics is going to take a very long time   he added  saying it will likely be a major topic of conversation until at least the Summer Games in Tokyo in 2020   AT T Inc  N T  on Tuesday suspended its sponsorship with USAG  citing the Nassar scandal  saying the federation needed to be rebuilt   We stand ready to step back in when USAG has fully addressed these tragic events   the company said in a statement   Under Armour  Inc  N UAA  last month ended a sponsorship deal that had been slated to run through 2020  Spokeswoman Diane Pelkey said Wednesday in an email the company hoped its decision  helps to facilitate necessary change   Other companies that terminated or didn t renew expiring deals in 2016 and 2017 include Procter   Gamble Co  N PG    Hershey Co   N HSY   Chobani  Kellogg Co  N K  and Utah based KT Tape   Such deals can generate revenue in the single digit millions of dollars and can account for about 20 to 33 percent of a federation s annual totals  industry analysts estimated  USA Gymnastics declined to address the loss of sponsors or discuss its finances  A review of the not for profit organization s 2016 tax return showed revenue of almost  34 5 million  including about  13 2 million derived from members and about  12 9 million from hosting competitions  It was not clear whether corporate sponsorship was included in any of those totals  The federation  which began in 1963 with barely 7 000 competitors  today boasts more than 174 000 athletes and professionals as members  according to its website  Membership fees range from  25 for introductory athletes to  89 for coaches and professionals  Analysts and industry officials said the federation has likely lost some members  Some of Nassar s victims cheered the companies that cut their sponsorships   I am deeply grateful for the sponsors of USAG like AT T who have heard the voices of the victims and say no more   said Rachael Denhollander on Wednesday  She was the first to come forward publicly with allegations against Nassar  Sponsorship experts predicted that the federation will eventually recover from the scandal  if sponsors see real changes  including the possible exit of the directors who have not already resigned   
 I m not sure that the organization has much of a choice   said Jim Andrews  senior vice president with ESP Properties  a unit of WPP Plc  L WPP  that tracks sponsorship spending   If they attempt to make changes that are essentially window dressing     then they won t be successful  ",2018-01-25,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/general-news/stench-of-nassar-scandal-will-dog-usa-gymnastics-for-years-experts-1153166,1153166

13656,235171,HSY,Hershey s  A Sweet Tooth For Success,opinion,Milk chocolate bars  Reese s Peanut Butter Cups  Kisses chocolates  Payday bars  Milk Duds  Jolly Ranchers  The only thing sweeter than these goods is the stock of the company that produces them  Hershey s  HSY  is up 18 3  year to date and still has significant upside potential  One of the main reasons Hershey s stands out from its competition is the extent to which it is determined to aggressively expand  Although many blue chip companies are satisfied with steady growth and consolidating existing revenue streams  Hershey s has a sky high goal to reach  10 billion in revenue by 2017  To put this context  Hershey s 2012 revenue was  6 6 billion and the 50  revenue increase by 2017 will require  as noted by its Chief Growth Officer  yes  it has a Chief Growth Officer     Moreover  Hershey s expects to achieve net sales of  1 billion in markets outside of Canada and the U S  by the end of 2014  The hallmark of Hershey s growth strategy is based on a proven socioeconomic trend  as people become richer  they have more disposable income  which leads them to spend more on nonessential items  such as confectionaries and sweets  That s why Hershey s is targeting countries across the world that have high populations and strong GDP growth  For example  Hershey s has put China at the top of its priority list and is seeing huge opportunity in tapping into one of the largest middle class transitions in history  Hershey s current product pipeline in China  which includes Hershey s Kisses and solid chocolate globes  is doing extremely well  In 2013  Hershey s plans to expand its footprint in China with new products such as premium Kisses Deluxe products and Hershey s Drops  By 2017  Hershey s wants to expand international sales to 25  of total sales from the current 16   This goal is buoyed by the fact that China isn t the only international market where Hershey s products are well received  Hershey s net sales in Brazil and Mexico  as well as China  were all above plan  with local currency sales in these markets up double digits year over year  Additionally  Hershey s recently became the  2 player in the Mexico off of its strong sales  and in Brazil its chocolate business grew at a pace more than double the category growth  In Canada  Hershey s is gaining significant market share  1 4 percent increase in the fourth quarter of 2012 alone  in the sweets and refreshment category and its Reese s brand is the  1 chocolate brand in the country  That s not to say that Hershey s is neglecting its U S  market  Hershey s domestic performance is strong and holds significant potential  For one  it has the largest market share  43 1   of the U S  chocolate and its US chocolate retail sales are healthy  with a cumulative average growth rate of 6 1  in the last four years  For 2012  Hershey s U S  retail takeaway and market share of candy  mint  and gum was up 5 7   Recently  Hershey s acquired Brookside  a privately held Canadian confectionery company that produces chocolate covered fruit with unique fruit juice centers  This acquisition can significantly boost Hershey s earnings in the long term as Brookside has increased sales at a compound annual growth rate of about 20  over the last several years  Combined with Hershey s additional manufacturing capacity and plans to expand its U S  presence  Brookside is poised to easily increase 2013 net sales growth by over 20   Moreover  Hershey s domestic and international performance will be significantly boosted by its marketing and promotion prowess  Many of Hershey s products have near universal brand recognition and Hershey s is a brand often associated with taste and quality  Building on this brand recognition  Hershey s has also announced plans to increase advertising by 20  in 2013 and already has a huge marketing network  from the Reese s NCAA basketball program to Twizzler tie ins with the upcoming Superman movie to various Jolly Rancher and Twizzlers promotions with Gym Class Heroes  Moreover  Hershey s marketing research is cutting edge  utilizing such techniques as mind modeling and proprietary research techniques  This marketing research has led to such profitable changes as resealable confectionery bags and currently shows that Brookside products hold significant appeal to not only candy lovers  but people who don t have sweet tooths  So what has this all meant for Hershey s  It has had four consecutive years of double digit EPS percentage increases averaging about 13   It also has a solid three year sales growth rate of 7  and an extremely healthy annual ROE of 78 1   In the last quarter  Hershey s reported a strong 12  increase year over year in sales  Hershey s financial strength has also allowed it to post a quarterly dividend of  0 42 a share  a figure which has only gone up since its introduction  Few  if any  of Hershey s competitors have its valuable combination of aggressive international expansion and solid growth  General Mills does not have nearly as aggressive of an international expansion strategy as Hershey s does and currently only derives 12  of its total sales from international markets  Others  such as Kellogg  K   have seen international segments decline in performance  in Kellogg s third quarter of 2012  it  its international segment posted a 6  decline in sales and an 11  decline in operating profit  Competitors such as ConAgra Foods don t even have operations outside of North America  The only major competitor that has more of an international presence than Hershey s is Mondelez International  MDLZ   but its growth has actually been decreasing  the company s 2012 revenue declined 2 2  and EPS declined a huge 11 34   Catalysts such as aggressive international expansion  domestic dominance  marketing strength  and smart acquisitions ensure that Hershey s is a must own stock for anyone who wants to make a sweet profit ,2013-03-22,George Liu,https://www.investing.com/analysis/hershey's:-a-sweet-tooth-for-success-160082,160082
13657,235172,HSY,Will Salesforce s Acquisition Moves Work ,opinion,Exact Target  to put it crudely  is an email based marketing platform  one whose usage has been on an upswing as consumer brands have turned to the internet for the marketing efforts  ExactTarget has big name customers including folks like Coca Cola  It also adds more structure to Salesforce s ambiguous sounding marketing cloud On paper  all of CEO Benioff s moves make sense  Cloud infrastructure is the future of software  Social is a core and vital need for companies and marketing is becoming crucial and strategic necessity in our increasingly distraction infested world  Bringing it all together with mobile   another area of focus for Salesforce   makes perfect sense  It is a good strategy to take especially as some of the older  software  guard starts to slip  Exact Target brings in enough muscle into the company to go toe to toe with Oracle which acquired RightNow  Eloqua and Vitrue   Will it work  The question is whether Salesforce actually make all these disparate pieces start to work together and make a gourmet dish called profits from all these ingredients  Many on Wall Street are skeptical  though some of it is because of Benioff s bombastic  I am always right  style  The doubters have a reason  the marketing cloud  which until recently was only Radian6 and Buddy Media  only was about 3 percent of company s revenue   around  100 million  The other businesses  such as    which consists of the 2010 Jigsaw acquisition   are said to bring in about a  100 million  It isn t clear how much  or how little  the company makes from Heroku and then there is Work com  its new business that is an amalgamation of Rypple  Choicepass and other assets  Those are rounding errors for a company that is going to bring in  4 billion this year  That said  for now  Benioff has enough to standup in front of the world and promise what a friend of mine calls  future bliss   Um  having listened to CRM  s earnings calls and winced at the analysts who cover it rush to outdo each other in the  who can be as effusive as humaly possible to anything CRM does  competition  I laughed at the  many on Wall St are skeptical comment  This is especially so watching GS and BAC  analysts  rush into defend the stock price after the deal with price targets calling for  50  upside  If that is skepticism  I d hate to see optimism  For those of us few who actually are skeptical  it has nothing to do with Benioff s  bombastic  I am always right  style   No  that has zero to do with it  We would be skeptical because of the accounting games they are playing  slowing sales  despite changing how they are accounted for to goose them   margins falling   500M in insider stock sales  3 years of consecutive losses  organic growth slowing etc etc etc  I would bet if the author actually polled those of us who are skeptical on the company Benioff s personality would come after those reasons and the  analysts  whose commentary on earnings calls could be replaced with ox flatulence with little degradation to the insightfulness of the questions they ask  Personally  I am shocked that anyone  given the acquisition history of this company can put finger to keyboard and say  Benioff has enough to standup in front of the world and promise what a friend of mine calls  future bliss    Just look at the last two deals they did  They spent over  1B dollars for Radian6 and Buddy Media and have only managed to squeeze  100M of revenue out of them  What is omitted from this article is that the dismal return is the good news  The bad news is that neither has yet to develop into a profit center  that does still matter  right    So  based on that we are supposed to just assume the  2 5B deal for ExactTarget is going to be the magic panacea for the company  Why  Boil it down  they paid  3 5B for losses   I will say one thing  the 10X revenues CRM paid for Radian6 and Buddy Media does make the 8x revenues they paid for ExactTarget look like a bargain  For those wondering  yes  of course  ExactTarget is also a money losing operation  losing   20M each yr for the last 3 yrs   In fact CRM has also lost increasing amounts of money for the last three years and given their write down of tax assets last year  it is safe to assume we have at least a few more in front of us  they ve already admitted GAAP losses for FY  14   In fact  there is a very real and by that I mean likely chance that when FY  15 rolls around  CRM  in its entire existence  despite by then near  20B in revenues  maybe more  will have not only not made a single penny but will have lost over  500M   just think about that  Even more interesting is that the  500M will be much less than the dollar amount of stock sales insiders have made from FY  11 to then  That number will probably be well over  700M  I have said it before and will say it again  I can walk out to my street corner and sell  1bills for   85 and increase my  revenues  every single day  But at the end of the day  I am still losing money  Further  I can move my operation to the  cloud  and sell billions of dollar bills for   85 each and still lose money albeit in a very modern and stylish fashion  Being a  cloud company  that loses money is no different than a candy company that does    both are an unprofitable business  Being a cloud company that overspends for acquisitions that lose money is no different than a food maker who does the same  they are both lousy at making acquisitions  Bulls will always chime in  you just do not understand where CRM is doing and where they are going   Here is the thing  Financial reporting makes things pretty understandable  When you play accounting games and still have terrible results  it is clear  what they are doing  isn t working  Further when you write off tax assets it is clear  where they are going  is actually easy nowhere  When your company essentially has a market to itself and can t make money  how the hell do you expect them to do it now that ORCL  MSFT and IBM have woken up and start making a major push into it  Let s be honest  Benioff created something  He is an evangelist  a very good one  and he has the tech world hooked  But  that does not mean we should suspend all irrational analysis of his company  Why doesn t Wall St require a company with  4B in revenue to make at least a dime or a nickle  Why does he get a pass in the media even after a string of deals for over  1B that contribute virtually nothing  On what planet do companies with thousands of customers and now large competitors wake up one day and say  now we make a profit  and are able to accomplish that live on  If Hershey  HSY   a company with a  19B market cap and    600M in earnings  what  those exist   saw execs dump   500m in stock over a 3 year period and promised more this year  CRM has   does anyone else think that would be news  Do we not think it would affect the stock price and commentary on the company  At the end of the day  price and value always meet always  I do not pretend to know  when  it will happen  but it always does  Reality and rational analysis eventually rule valuation  Irrational prices  whether they be too high or too low always eventually find their proper level  CRM could see its stock price cut almost in half and I d still wonder why people would want to buy it

13658,235173,HSY,What Makes This Confectionary So Attractive for Long Term Investors ,opinion,"In my mind  portfolio safety and consistency of equity market returns are paramount  This is a basic portfolio management principle  and I like to see consistent earners as core positions in any equity market portfolio 
This doesn t mean there isn t room for more speculative stocks  but investing is different than risk capital speculating 
Consistent earnings growers and dividend paying stocks should be the foundation of an equity market portfolio geared for long run returns  Dividends can be spent  reinvested  or  better yet  placed in an automatic dividend reinvestment program  The numbers really do add up over time  especially among those companies with a history of increasing their annual dividends throughout the years 
One mature enterprise with a very good long term track record of delivering positive returns to shareholders is The Hershey Company  NYSE HSY   it s the kind of position that long term investors may wish to consider when it s down 
The business of chocolate and confections is a good one  and this company has a long history of increasing earnings and dividends  What Hershey is not is a fast growing company where you want to see double digit sales growth 
But while this well known brand may be a slow grower  it offers consistency  which in today s world  is a very valuable trait   See     
That doesn t mean Hershey s stock won t go down commensurate with the broader equity market  but the business is solid and it s highly likely to still be growing when other industries  companies  and capital markets fail  The company s 25 year long term stock chart is featured below 

By slow growth  the company s 2014 first quarter saw total sales increase 2 4  and earnings grew 4 4   4 7  in diluted earnings per share   Clearly  this company hasn t reinvented the wheel 
For all of this year  management expects total sales to grow between five and seven percent  and this includes the impact of foreign currency exchange rates  which is a risk with multinational corporations  
According to the company  new products are where the growth is  This month  Hershey will launch  York Minis  and  Hershey Spreads   which are instant consumables  In the third quarter  the company will offer  Ice Breakers Cool Blast Chews  and  Brookside Crunchy Clusters  to the marketplace  And in its international markets  the company plans a broader roll out of its  Reese s Peanut Butter Cups  in the bottom half of the year 
On top of all this  margins are set to expand  although the cost of dairy is always a worry with this business 
But  even with mid single digit sales growth being the expectation this year  bottom line earnings are where the good news should be 
Management forecasts 12  to 13  GAAP earnings per diluted share growth over 2013  which is pretty decent  all things considered  Combined with the company s dividend  the current yield is approximately two percent   that s a good expected return from a mature enterprise with staying power 
In a slow growth world  it s a business like Hershey that will deliver the goods where others don t  Consistency is a valuable attribute in the equity market  very few companies provide it

13663,235178,HSY,Trump Says Trade Wars Are  Easy to Win  as Tariff Anger Spreads,news," Bloomberg     President Donald Trump pushed back against a wave of criticism against steel tariffs  with a tweet saying  trade wars are good and easy to win  
Trump is facing anger from manufacturers and trade partners in China and Europe after announcing tariffs of 25 percent on imported steel and 10 percent on aluminum for  a long period of time   The formal order is expected to be signed next week 



 When a country  USA  is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with  trade wars are good  and easy to win   Trump said in an early morning tweet on Friday 
Trump hasn t given the details of the planned action  including whether any products or countries would be exempted 
The planned tariffs  justified on the basis that cut price metals imports hurt both American producers and national security  now raises the prospect of tit for tat curbs on American exports and higher prices for domestic users  While the practical impact may yet turn out to be limited  the political environment for global trade has just taken a turn for the worse 
Trump Roars  China Yawns  U S  Shoots Itself in Foot  Gadfly
Asian stocks on Friday built on losses seen in the U S  the previous day  with shares in Hong Kong  Japan  China  Australia and South Korea weaker  Separately  the yen spiked and Japanese assets slumped after Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda discussed the timing of a possible exit from its stimulus policy in parliament 
The official response in China  the world s largest steel producer  was muted  Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying merely said in Beijing Friday that China urges the U S  to follow trade rules 
Industry insiders were less restrained  The U S  measures  overturn the international trade order   Wen Xianjun  vice chairman of the China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association  said in a statement   Other countries  including China  will take relevant retaliatory measures  
Li Xinchuang  the vice chairman of China Iron and Steel Association  called the move  stupid  
U S  allies  seeing their industries threatened  responded with bafflement and dismay  Some also panned the idea that metals imports pose a threat to national security 
 Steel and aluminum imports from Japan  which is an ally  do not affect U S  national security at all   Japan s Trade Minister Hiroshige Seko told reporters in Tokyo Friday   I would like to convey that to the U S  when I have an opportunity  
Canada    the biggest foreign supplier of steel to the U S     said the measures were unacceptable while the European Union vowed to  react firmly  with World Trade Organization compliant countermeasures in the next few days  Australian Trade Minister Steve Ciobo called the move  disappointing  and said his country is seeking an exemption 
The punitive measures would level the unfair playing field that has persisted for years  and make it easier for American companies to expand and hire workers  Trump said 
U S  companies from beer brewer MillerCoors  NYSE TAP  to candymaker Hershey Company  NYSE HSY   which use aluminum for manufacturing and packaging  said operations would be hurt by the tariffs 



 We buy as much domestic can sheet aluminum as is available  however  there simply isn t enough supply to satisfy the demands of American beverage makers like us   MillerCoors said in a tweet   American workers and American consumers will suffer as a result of this misguided tariff  
Soybean Response
A U S  move on tariffs risks provoking retaliation  particularly from Beijing  China has already launched a probe into U S  imports of sorghum  and is studying whether to restrict shipments of U S  soybeans    targets that could hurt Trump s support in some farming states  While China accounts for just a fraction of U S  imports of the metals  it s accused of flooding the global market and dragging down prices 

Trump announced the tariffs despite lobbying of his administration by foreign governments  and while Chinese President Xi Jinping s top economic adviser is in the country on a mission to defuse tensions 
The impact of the step hinges in part on which nations will be affected  said Alex Wolf  senior emerging markets economist at Aberdeen Standard Investments in Hong Kong who previously worked at the U S  State Department 
 It s not much ado about nothing  but until we see the final scope of the tariffs and the response from global trading partners it s hard to say it s the start of a tit for tat trade war   he said ",2018-03-02,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/trump-says-trade-wars-are-easy-to-win-as-tariff-anger-spreads-1321680,1321680

13683,235198,HSY,Why Hershey  HSY  Is Poised To Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering Hershey  HSY   which belongs to the Zacks Food   Confectionery industry 
When looking at the last two reports  this chocolate bar and candy maker has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 9 22   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the most recent quarter  Hershey was expected to post earnings of  1 18 per share  but it reported  1 31 per share instead  representing a surprise of 11 02   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  1 48 per share  while it actually produced  1 59 per share  a surprise of 7 43  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Hershey lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Hershey has an Earnings ESP of  0 25  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on October 24  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-10-03,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-hershey-hsy-is-poised-to-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200470746,200470746

13705,235220,HSY,Hershey Shares May Be too Tasty for Their Own Good,news,"By Charlie Blaine
Investing com   Iconic chocolate maker Hershey s shares have been pretty sweet of late  reaching new highs recently  But is the stock now priced for perfection 
Certainly Goldman Sachs thinks so  saying on March 29 that the shares were vulnerable to a 20  pullback 
Hershey  NYSE HSY  shares duly rose nearly  3 to a 52 week high of  116 73 on Tuesday before drifting back  They re off 0 5  today and 0 8  from that Tuesday peak  But they re still up 30  from early May 
But don t just listen to Goldman  There are good reasons to think the stock has all the good news priced in 
The consensus target price from analysts polled by Investing com is  103 67  down more than 10  from current levels  Of 16 analysts who cover the stock  only three rate it a buy  Twelve are neutral 
The company is struggling with sales growth  North American sales overall grew 4 3  in the fourth quarter  but most of that was due to sales from new acquisitions  Back that out and core Hershey sales fell around 3   About 89  of Hershey s  7 8 billion in sales in 2018 came from North America 
Competition is getting tougher  especially from arch rival M M Mars 
Distribution costs are rising  thanks in part to higher fuel prices 
But Hershey was a great counter play in the fourth quarter when the stock market was tanking  rising 5 1  when the major averages tumbled 20  or more  And Hershey is up 8  this year 
If Hershey does fall  it will not be because sales are growing slowly  It s a product where sales rise with population and are basically stable  The controlling shareholder  the Milton Hershey School Trust  controls 80  of the voting shares  The dividend is stable  Its net profit margin is north of 15  
And it has fantastic brand recognition  There are Hershey Bars  Reese s Cups  Reese s Pieces  the candy preferred by E T    Hershey s Cocoa and Jolly Rancher hard candies  It does business in 70 countries 
If Hershey falls  the reason will be simply the price is high and has gone up a lot 
Also  growth stocks  the traditional drivers of market gains  have reasserted themselves 
Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   for example  is up 27  this year after falling 30  in the fourth quarter and 6 8  for all of 2018  Cisco Systems  NASDAQ CSCO  is up 28 8  and Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX  is up more than 35

At the end of the day  the S P 500 was still up 19 8  for this year  with the Dow up 17 2  and the Nasdaq enjoying a 23 9  gain 
The stagnation may be in part to traders being noplussed by earnings reports  But it also may be that they re considering taking money off the table after the market s big run since early June  The S P 500 is up 9 5  since June 3  when Fed Chairman Jerome Powell began signalling a rate cut might be coming 
Stocks jumped to new record highs last week in response to Powell s continued hints about lower rates 
Holding the market back Tuesday was weakness in energy  utility and healthcare shares 
Apache  NYSE APA   Chesapeake Energy  NYSE CHK  and   Devon Energy    NYSE DVN  were all lower  along with Consolidated Edison  NYSE ED   the big New York utility company  Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  and UnitedHealth Group  NYSE UNH  were lower  
On the flip side  there was a group of winners from the oil price drop  airlines like JetBlue  NASDAQ JBLU     Alaska Air    NYSE ALK  and United Airlines parent United Continental Holdings  NASDAQ UAL  
 
What strength you could find was in industrials  materials and consumer discretionary shares  with gains in such stocks as Boeing  NYSE BA   Whirlpool  NYSE WHR   U S  Steel  NYSE X  and International Paper  NYSE IP  
Among consumer stocks  Costco Wholesale  NASDAQ COST   Chipotle Mexican Grill  NYSE CMG  and Hershey  NYSE HSY  moved up  Costco s gain was tiny and came after hitting a new intraday high 
In oil  WTI futures slumped more than 3  to  57 62 a barrel on a comment from President Donald Trump suggesting Middle East tensions were easing  That raised fears that global oil supplies are more than ample  WTI fell to as low as  57 02  Brent crude  the global benchmark  fell 3 2  to  64 35  The price had fallen to as low as  63 82  
As a result    Exxon Mobil    NYSE XOM  fell 1 5     Chevron    NYSE CVX  dropped 0 8   The Philadelphia Oil Service index dropped 1 5   
In addition  interest rates moved up  even as Fed Chief Powell repeated his vow to act as appropriate to support the economy  The 10 Year Treasury yield rose 1  to 2 113    
Financial stocks had decent performances  JPMorgan Chase  NYSE JPM  rose 1 1   and Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  climbed 1 9  after second quarter results beat analysts  estimates 
  Wells Fargo    NYSE WFC  fell 3   however  after officials warned expenses will be at the high range of projections and likely to run at the same level in 2020  Wall Street had been looking for costs to come down

13735,235250,HSY,Chocolate makers face ethical branding dilemma,news,"By Ange Aboa and Maytaal Angel
ABIDJAN LONDON  Reuters    Ivory Coast and Ghana s threat to possibly halt the cocoa industry s ethical branding schemes poses a major risk to chocolate makers operating in Western markets where consumer demand for sustainably sourced products is rising 
The West African nations  which together produce more than 60  of the world s cocoa  said last week they will re examine the schemes because chocolate makers have been slow to pay them a  living income  premium for their beans 
In a bid to ease pervasive farmer poverty  Ivory Coast and Ghana introduced a  400 a tonne living income differential  LID  in July on cocoa sales for the 2020 21 season  The move was a major overhaul in how global cocoa is priced 
They have since sold around 150 000 tonnes of 2020 21 cocoa  trade and government sources said  versus about 450 000 tonnes this time last year 
There are still some 2 35 million tonnes left to sell  but while the current marketing campaign is still in its early stages  Ivory Coast and Ghana need faster  large volume sales to chocolate makers for the LID to work 
 The two countries have resolved to make the  LID  work whatever it takes   said a source at Cocobod  Ghana s cocoa regulator  He said this included halting sustainability schemes  used for ethical branding  within the next few weeks if chocolate makers don t comply 
Under pressure from Western consumers for ethically sourced products  chocolate makers such as Mars Wrigley  Mondelez  O MDLZ   Barry Callebaut  S BARN   Hershey s  N HSY  and Nestle  S NESN  have spent millions on sustainability schemes 
The programmes  which include audits from certifiers such as Fair Trade  are key to chocolate makers  branding  which could be hit if they are seen as hesitant to part with cash ear marked to alleviate poverty 
 A few weeks ago  we started buying some quantities of cocoa for 2020 2021   said a spokesperson for Nestl  
Hershey s said it times its purchases based on commercial needs but will comply with the LID  while Mondelez said it recognised the urgent need to improve farmer livelihoods  but added longer term  price premiums need to be directly linked to measures to eradicate poverty and climate change 
 We have not changed our buying approach in any way  As our approach takes us into the 2020 2021 crop  we are absolutely committed to buy with the LID   said a Mars spokesman 
Barry Callebaut declined to comment 
NAMED AND SHAMED
Ivory Coast and Ghana plan to use the LID income to guarantee farmers 70  of a  2 600 a tonne target price  If global prices rise above  2 900  LID proceeds will be placed in a fund that would guarantee farmers the target price when market prices fall 
For the scheme to work  the two nations need money upfront  They have already raised the guaranteed price they will pay farmers for this season s crop 
  Chocolate makers  are going to be named and shamed soon  Customers will read that they don t support farmers  their certification schemes have been suspended  etc   said a senior cocoa trader 
Commodity traders act as middlemen   buying cocoa  selling it to chocolate makers  and making money on the spread  They usually buy in advance from producers and hold the risk on their books until chocolate makers step in 
Their margins have plunged in recent years however 
Because they are also unable to hedge the LID  they say chocolate makers who have committed to ethical sourcing need to take on some of the risk by bringing forward their purchases 
This would require a sourcing strategy overhaul for chocolate makers  Moreover  they fear that if they pay the LID now and their competitors don t  they could lose out if the LID is later scrapped 
 This  LID  could work if Ivory Coast and Ghana had the money to stockpile  excess supply  but they  don t  so most of us think the plan will have to be adapted or maybe withdrawn   said a cocoa industry source 
The source added that halting sustainability schemes would hurt farmers  not just chocolate makers 
About 500 000 tonnes of Ivory Coast and Ghana cocoa are certified per year  according to industry sources  The cocoa can fetch farmers a premium of up to  200 per tonne 
The cocoa industry s efforts to source sustainably have been around for nearly two decades  though little has changed on the ground for farmers  with poverty widespread and West African forest cover all but decimated ",2019-10-15,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/chocolate-makers-face-ethical-branding-dilemma-1996371,1996371

The only other S P 500 component leading the index more than once on an annual basis over the decade was chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices  O AMD   which surged 80  last year and is on track to gain 132  in 2019  Up over 340  since the end of 2009  AMD s recent surge marks a comeback after a downturn in personal computer sales in the first half of the decade had many investors questioning whether the chipmaker would survive at all in the shadow of semiconductor giant Intel  O INTC  
Under Chief Executive Lisa Su  who took over in 2014  AMD stopped losing money and is expected by analysts to expand its bottom line by over 40  in 2019  according to Refinitiv 
Following its stellar stock market performance  Netflix is now struggling with slowing subscriber growth  ballooning costs to produce content and new competition from Walt  Disney   N DIS  and other services  With Netflix up 24  in 2019 and falling short of the S P 500 s 28  gain  analysts on average now recommend buying its shares  The stock remains down 20  from its record high close in July 2018 
The S P 500 s second strongest performer of the decade has been electronic bond trading system operator MarketAxess Holdings Inc  O MKTX   up over 2 600   followed by medical equipment maker Abiomed  O ABMD   which has surged over 1 800  
In ninth place is Ulta Beauty  O ULTA   which has flourished even as other shopping mall retailers struggled to fend off Amazon and is up 1 280  over the decade  Amazon  O AMZN  clocks in as the decade s 11th strongest S P 500 performer  gaining 1 232  
Investors buying the stocks most highly rated on average by analysts at the start of the decade  and holding them through 2019  mostly would have done well  But investors buying and holding the stocks least liked by analysts at the end of 2009 also would have fared well

13803,235318,HSY,Chocolate s  OPEC  Promises To Lift Cocoa Prices For African Producers,opinion,"While the world has been vexed over the spike in oil prices in recent days  amid the U S  Iran conflict and speculation about whether OPEC would raise production if the rally continued  a different cartel was quietly working to boost the prices of another commodity 

For those who missed it  here s the story  Ivory Coast and Ghana  the West African nations which together produce about two thirds or more of the world s cocoa  have formed their own chocolatey version of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC  
Breaking News  Cocoa Prices Haven t Rallied Yet
The Wall Street Journal  a long piece on the cocoa cartel saga at the weekend  But here s the short take  The initiative hasn t yet sent cocoa prices into the stratosphere  If anything  the West African partnership   already dubbed  COPEC  by some in government and industry  according to the Journal   has witnessed a slide in cocoa prices since the New Year began 
New York traded cocoa futures are down nearly 2  in the first week of 2020  after a 3  drop in December  London traded cocoa futures slumped 9  since the start of this month  after a 7  rise last month 
 Prices have been cheaper lately based on ideas of very good production potential in West Africa   said Jack Scoville  a Price Futures Group analyst in Chicago for  soft  commodities that include cocoa  coffee  sugar and orange juice 
Global Weather Is Kind Now To Cocoa
In a market commentary written Monday and shared with Investing com  Scoville said weather in Ivory Coast had improved for cocoa  from frequent showers  

 Ideas are that the next crop will be good   he wrote 

 Drier weather is now more important due to harvest activities  The harvest is ongoing amid showers  but good progress in the harvest is expected at this time  
 The weather in Asia is also called good   Scoville added 
In Asia  cocoa is grown in Malaysia  India  Vietnam  the Philippines and Thailand  While Malaysia has a 250 year history with cocoa and was once its third biggest producer  the other countries in the region are fairly new to the crop  though they have potential to become important growers over time 
So  what s the story with this so called COPEC 
Cartel s Idea Is To Charge A  400 Premium
The Journal says the two nation cocoa cartel wants to charge an extra  400 for a metric ton of cocoa  That s a 16  premium over New York cocoa  which settled on Monday at  2 491 a ton  and nearly 17  above London cocoa  which hovers at just under 1 800 pounds   2 376  a ton   depending which side of the world prices the raw ingredient for your chocolate 
Of course  it s not just candy bars that could get pricier  Ice cream   made from cocoa butter  the smooth velvety product that comes from the grinding of cocoa beans   and biscuits and other baked goods   produced from cocoa powder which also emerges from grinding   will get more expensive too 
The question is when that could happen 
Most big cocoa users strike cocoa contracts months or more than a year in advance  to secure pricing for the massive quantities they need  the Journal said 
It said Ghana and Ivory Coast initially proposed a minimum price for their cocoa of  2 600 a metric ton during meetings with representatives of the chocolate industry last year 
Executives from a group of multinational cocoa and chocolate companies reportedly pushed back against a minimum price  saying the policy lacked clarity and could create havoc in the market 
 Some Chocolate Makers Already Paying The PremiumInstead  the chocolate industry agreed to a premium added on top of the futures market price  which they said would be more straightforward  the Journal added 
Some chocolate companies have already begun buying West African beans with the premium attached  Others are cribbing  trying to find a way out of it  without too much success  since cocoa producers elsewhere  including in Asia  weren t turning out enough supply 
 You re talking about two thirds of the world s cocoa   Jonathan Parkman  co head of agricultural trading at London based brokerage Marex Spectron  told the Journal  referring to the West African output   The world cannot do without that cocoa  
Another opponent of the plan is Eric Bergman  vice president at brokerage JSG Commodities Inc  He calls the new premium  essentially a  1 2 billion tax on the cocoa industry   basing it on the two West African nations  combined production of about 3 million metric tons 
U S  Candy s Big Three Support The New Cartel
The big three names in the U S  candy business   privately held Mars  Hershey  NYSE HSY  and Mondelez  NASDAQ MDLZ    are  however  supportive of paying more for their West African beans 
 It s the right thing to do   said Christine McGrath  chief of global impact  sustainability and well being at Mondelez  which currently buys cocoa from six countries  including Ivory Coast and Ghana 
 Mars believes boosting the income of cocoa farmers while ensuring cocoa is grown sustainably is key to a thriving cocoa sector   said Joseph Gerbino  a global communications director at the company 
 Cocoa farmers should be able to support their families and earn a decent standard of living  and we support the goal of raising farmer incomes   said Jeff Beckman  spokesman for Hershey 
These testimonies   that this COPEC initiative will be good for the cocoa farmers   is the message being spread by Ivory Coast and Ghana to push for global acceptance of their cartel 
History Might Not Be On COPEC s Side ThoughYet  advocates for the farmers themselves aren t too sure if the plan will work 
Cobus de Hart  an economist at NKC African Economics  says unlike OPEC s ability to control oil pumping  Ivory Coast and Ghana would need to regulate an agricultural commodity that takes years from planting to begin producing cocoa beans 
 How are you going to tell the farmers to produce less if it s the only way they re earning a living   Mr  de Hart said   Oil can stay in the ground  but it s going to be really hard to get farmers to stop producing  
To this  I have an anecdote to add   of Malaysia and its failed attempts at managing a rubber cartel 
For 20 years  Malaysia ran the International Natural Rubber Organization  or INRO  which included Thailand  the other major rubber producer  But Malaysia exited the group in 1999 after the cartel s buffer stock price intervention model based on Asian currencies became too challenging to manage in the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis  The availability of synthetic rubber also complicated life for INRO 
So  each cartel has its nemesis  
For OPEC  it is U S  shale  
For rubber  it was Asian currencies and synthetic rubber  
For cocoa  it might be its own farmers not knowing when to stop producing ",2020-01-07,Barani Krishnan/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/chocolates-opec-promises-to-lift-cocoa-prices-for-african-producers-200496794,200496794
13804,235319,HSY,In Cocoa s Rally  A Three Way Fight Is Emerging,opinion,"It s the second best performing commodity of the year among U S   softs   driven by Asian demand  And prices of New York traded cocoa could go even higher if a cartel and farm lobby get their way   though demand destruction might also set in from consumers who balk at higher costs of their candy 
At Thursday s settlement  cocoa on ICE  NYSE ICE  Futures U S  was up almost 7  on the year   putting it only slightly behind raw sugar  which had advanced by nearly 7 5   The other two components of the softs complex  orange juice and arabica coffee  traded in negative territory 
Bloomberg provided some answers for cocoa s outperformance  citing Asian demand for chocolate  based on grinding numbers for the commodity in the region  that it said was growing faster than in both Europe and North America 
Bean grindings in Asia probably climbed 7 5  in the fourth quarter from a year earlier  rounding out an annual record  according to a Bloomberg survey of analysts  brokers and grinders  The surge in Asian grinds matches almost perfectly the cocoa rally in New York since the start of the year in percentage terms 
Chocolate Demand Growing Fastest In Asia 
 The only real growth is coming out of Asia   Jonathan Parkman  co head of agriculture at London s Marex Spectron Group  said  referring to cocoa consumption   We are not seeing significant growth outside of that area  
Rising affluence and changing lifestyles in Asia have spurred grinders to turn more beans into butter and powder used to make chocolate bars  drinks  ice cream and biscuits  The International Cocoa Organization in November said India and China will be major drivers of chocolate demand and data this week showed Malaysian grindings jumped 23  last quarter 
Cocoa processing in the West  meanwhile  has come under pressure as factory profits eased  bean prices rose and chocolate demand showed signs of weakness  In the three months through late December  U S  retail sales of chocolate candy fell 2 8  in volume from a year earlier  according to Chicago based market researcher IRI 
Will Confectioners Be Happy With Rising Cocoa Costs 
But will the strong Asian demand for chocolate hold if cocoa prices keep rising under cartel and farm lobbies  How much higher costs will confectioners be able to absorb before they pass it on to consumers  
These are valid questions amid the cocoa cartel formed by Ivory Coast and Ghana and farm lobby spearheaded by the Cocoa Barometer Consortium   both West African initiatives 
The Ivorian and Ghanian cocoa cartel is inspired by the OPEC model for oil led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries 
The Wall Street Journal  which reported on this initiative early this month  says the cocoa cartel   dubbed COPEC by some   wants to charge an extra  400 for a metric ton of cocoa  That s a 15  premium over prevailing New York cocoa prices 
The Cocoa Barometer Consortium is a West African industry initiative  separate to the cartel  It calls for every chocolate and cocoa company  and every sustainability standard  to develop and publish a living income policy  including a clear statement on what the minimum farmgate price should be 
And What About The Farmers 
 Currently almost no cocoa farmers in the main cocoa production countries in West Africa are earning a living income   says the Cocoa Barometer in a position paper published by the Voice Network 
It adds that without a living income for cocoa farmers  cocoa will never be sustainable  If a farmer must choose between feeding his family and not cutting down his old growth trees  it isn t a choice  Other challenges facing the sector   such as deforestation and child labour   will be impossible to tackle if farmers still live in poverty  
 The paper cites Dutch chocolate brand Tony s Chocolonely  which has aligned its price with Fairtrade and pays the same per metric ton  The main difference is that Tony s calculates the Fairtrade premium as part of the Living Income Reference Price 
Moreover  premiums are part of a communal fund  are not fully paid to the farmer  and the paper says they should not be considered part of the farmgate price  Dutch retailer Albert Heijn is also purchasing according to the Tony s Chocolonely model 
 It should be abundantly clear that living income is the starting point of a conversation on farmer income  not a finish line  Those people reading this paper would not be satisfied with earning just a living income  Why should a cocoa farmer  Every farmer should be able to earn at least a living income  but preferably a lot more    said Antonie C Fountain  one of the paper s authors 
Paul Schoenmakers  head of impact at Tony s Chocolonely  told Confectionery News  another trade publication   To really change the system and make an impact  paying a higher price is not enough   You need all five sourcing principles  traceable beans  a higher price  strong farmers  long term commitments and investing in productivity   quality  No cherry picking   
It s An Economically Sensitive Commodity
Eric Scoles  commodity market strategist at RJO Futures in Chicago said cocoa is economically sensitive market 
 Now that it appears the drama and fear caused by a flare up of tension in the Middle East has settled down  cocoa prices are moving up   Scoles said 
 With demand concerns and market anxiety mostly resolved  the bulls have become confident in cocoa again  Fundamentals are supportive  
Yet  continued rise in prices could lead to demand destruction as well  as said earlier 
In the past  large multinational confectioners have seen cocoa prices well above  3 000 a metric ton and dealt with them by making candy bars smaller  adjusting the amount of cocoa used in their products and in many instances  by raising prices  
Three Way Win Needed
Of course  it s not just candy bars that could get pricier  Ice cream   made from cocoa butter  the smooth velvety product that comes from the grinding of cocoa beans   and biscuits and other baked goods   produced from cocoa powder which also emerges from grinding   will get more expensive too 
The biggest names in confection include Kisses producer Hershey Company  NYSE HSY   M Ms and Snickers bars maker Mars Inc  and  Mondelez International Inc   NASDAQ MDLZ    producer of the Cadbury Dairy Milk bars and Oreo cookies 
To sum up  African farmers need better than living incomes  confectioners have to keep their cocoa costs manageable and consumers must be happy with the quality and size of the chocolate they re paying for 
 It s a tough win win win ",2020-01-17,Barani Krishnan/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/in-cocoas-rally-a-threeway-fight-is-emerging-200499509,200499509

117115,338630,HSY,Hershey Earnings  3 Things to Watch,news,"Hershey  NYSE HSY  shares beat a booming market in 2019 as investors gained confidence in the confectioner s global growth strategy  That rally sets up a potentially volatile week ahead when the company reveals its fourth quarter operating results on Thursday  Jan  30  Management will likely pair those results with comments on Hershey s outlook for the new fiscal year ahead 
So  let s take a look at a few trends in that report that might determine whether shareholders enjoy another sweet year in 2020 

Salty and sweet treats
Hershey last year avoided the growth struggles that struck many other producers of consumer packaged foods  and investors are looking for that positive momentum to continue  Organic sales rose nearly 2  in the third quarter  and net sales  which include the impact of recently acquired salty snack brands like Amplify and Pirate  rose 2 5   Most investors who follow the stock are expecting reported revenue to rise by nearly 4  this quarter  up to  2 06 billion 
Looking beyond that headline figure  Hershey s sales strength will show up in two related metrics  First  there s market share  which inched higher in the U S  and international geographies last quarter  Investors will also be watching sales volumes to confirm that the confectioner isn t relying entirely on higher prices to deliver its increased revenue 
Under the hood
Several positive trends have combined to push profit margins higher in recent months  including rising prices  the shift toward salty snacks like Skinny Pop  and cost cuts  Of the three factors  price boosts played the biggest role  which means profitability will be worth watching as Hershey potentially bumps up against pricing challenges 
Any such issues would show up in a flat or declining gross profit margin  which last quarter expanded to 44 8  of sales from 44  a year earlier  That improvement allowed Hershey to spend more cash on marketing without sacrificing bottom line profitability  but that balance can be hard to achieve in any given quarter  Overall  though  look for operating margin to continue climbing so that adjusted earnings per share expand at a quicker rate than sales 
The 2020 outlook
Assuming Hershey meets its upgraded outlook for 2019  the consumer staples company will have achieved a 1 5  organic sales boost for the year to mark a slight slowdown when compared to 2018  Yet investors are more focused on its increased market share  higher pricing  and broader portfolio    factors that should put it in position to quickly improve on that result if selling conditions remain strong in the industry 
With that big picture in mind  look for CEO Michele Buck to refer to the global selling environment while issuing Hershey s 2020 outlook on Thursday  That forecast is likely to predict modest revenue gains and slightly higher profitability  which should translate into adjusted earnings growth in the high single digit range for the year ahead ",2020-01-22,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/plfbo,2065100

to Michele Michele Buck    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Melissa  Good morning to all of you on the phone and webcast  We had a strong 2019  with accelerated business performance and differentiated financial results  This was driven by momentum in our core U S  confection portfolio in both retail takeaway and margin expansion  by incremental and profitable international growth and by further expansion of our snacking portfolio  And we continue to invest in our brands  capabilities and people  I d like to extend a sincere thank you to our employees and all of our partners for their hard work to make this possible  For the full year  we delivered net sales growth of 2 5  and EPS growth of 7 8   a testament to our strong brands  business model and a commitment to balanced top and bottom line growth  Constant currency organic sales growth of 1 8  was ahead of expectations  driven by incremental pricing and core based strengths of our U S  confection business These gains drove stronger than anticipated gross margin expansion of over 100 basis points for the year  which enabled incremental investments in our brands and employees and an enhanced earnings for our shareholders  We are pleased with the consistency of our results throughout the year and the momentum we are taking into 2020 in the fourth quarter  net sales grew 4  behind 1 9  organic constant currency growth and our gross margin expanded 96 basis points  For the full year  our Hershey candy mint and GM retail sales increased 2 6  resulting in a category share gain of approximately 10 basis points  While along Easter contributed to this performance  We also finish the year strong with retail sales growth of 2 8  and a category share gain of approximately 20 basis points in the fourth quarter As was the case with the entire year  this growth was driven by balanced activation across the portfolio  And we are seeing the benefit from our investment in marketing spending carrying through to retail performance  Our Reese s brand continued to outperform the market  with growth of over 6  in the fourth quarter  driven by great advertising  innovation and strong in store execution  Kit Kat grew 2 3  in Q4  behind incremental capacity and our new Kit Kat Duos innovation  which launched late last year  Early results of this innovation are encouraging  and we expect continued momentum in this brand in 2020 Our media and packaging investments on our mid tier iconic brands also drove strong growth  with Payday  up over 8   Almond Joy  up 6   Rolo  up 5   and Heath  up 35  in the quarter  resulting in a combined share gain of 20 basis points  Pricing remains an important lever for us in the fourth quarter  Net price realization of approximately four points in Q4 was slightly ahead of expectations as we began to see a benefit from our most recent price increase announced in July of 2019  And we expect this to continue in 2020  with planned price realization of two to 2 5 points on our U S  confection business in the U S  for the year  As we look to 2020  we have another great year of activations planned within our confection business In just a couple of days  for the first time in brand history  Reese s will be running an advertisement during the 2020 Super Bowl  This will be a great opportunity for America s number one confectionary brand to increase awareness of one of its best tasting  highest consumer rated item in the portfolio  Take5  As we had shared with you last year  our relaunch of this item is off to a strong start  and we re excited to build on this with an ad during America s most watched sporting event and additional in store merchandising and distribution  We are also excited about our product innovation for 2020  In addition to our Kit Kat Duos innovation  we are excited to announce the expansion of our THiNS platform in 2020  York THiNS and Reese s White THiNS will launch in March and will be able to    and both the    will be available in both the take home and peg formats This provides York lovers a unique way to enjoy one of their favorites  And it enables us to secure strong year two merchandising for our core milk and dark Reese s items that we launched this past year  Our snack portfolio also delivered solid growth in the fourth quarter  SkinnyPop ready to eat popcorn retail sales grew over 13   resulting in a category share gain of 170 basis points  And as expected  Pirate s Booty performance accelerated as we began to recapture distribution lost earlier in the year and had strong promotional activity behind our on pack Disney promotion  Retail sales grew 1 4  in the fourth quarter and over 4  in December  Our most recent acquisition  ONE Brands  grew 35  in traditional measured channels  with additional strength in non measured channels such as e commerce Now for an update on our international markets  We have made significant progress over the past several years by focusing on branded  high margin products  streamlining our operating model and rightsizing our investments  Since we began this journey at the beginning of 2017  we have increased our segment income by  125 million over the past three years  while continuing to grow our organic constant currency net sales  This is a significant accomplishment made possible by the hard work and dedication of many employees around the world  A sincere thank you to everyone who helped drive this business transformation and financial performance  Our international business provides us with important geographic diversification and incremental growth  and we are excited to build on this progress with another year of profitable growth in 2020 In Mexico  we will continue to focus on increased distribution and innovation on our Hershey and payloads Pella Rico brand  After strong test results last year  we will be launching a new business model more broadly in 2020  aimed at securing incremental and profitable distribution in traditional trading  Additionally  we will continue to innovate with new flavors and packaging to drive growth in our existing channels  In Brazil  despite a continued heightened competitive environment  we delivered profitable growth in the fourth quarter  Our dark chocolate Hershey s portfolio has performed very well  and we are excited to bring new innovation within that platform to market in 2020  Additionally  we are focused on growth in nontraditional retail channels  and we re expanding a successful 2019 test to more regions this year In India  our national Kisses launch remains on track  and we are leveraging important learnings from our regional launch last year to further optimize the proposition as we expand in 2020  We continue to see this market as a strategic growth vector for our business  In China  we had a strong finish to the year  and we plan to build upon last year s successful Flavors of Life promotion with new varieties in 2020  Due to the timing of Chinese New Year in 2020 and 2021  we expect 2020 shipments to be slightly pressured  but we continue to feel good about our in store activations and our base business momentum  In summary  we re pleased with our performance and believe we will deliver another year of high quality financial results in 2020  We are proud of what we have accomplished and the momentum we are seeing on the business  but we also recognize we must continue to adapt and invest to elevate the business further Over the past several years  we ve invested in incremental capacity and planning capabilities  I am pleased by the progress that we ve made here and the opportunities that this has unlocked for us  In 2019  we delivered our best case fill rate in a decade and saw meaningful increases in our advantage survey rankings  Since 2017  our supply chain ranking with our customers advanced from number 15 to number four  and our customer service is now ranked number one among our peers  up from number12 just three years ago  We will build on this with additional investment in our supply chain capabilities over the next several years  As a part of a multiyear capital project  we will add additional capacity for our largest and fastest growing brand  build agile fulfillment and late stage customization capabilities and invest in new data and technology within our supply chain that increases visibility  automation and digitalization We believe these investments will enable us to respond to changing needs from both our consumers and customers while maintaining our advantaged margin profile  We look forward to sharing more details about this at our Investor Day in March  In addition to investing to advance our business capabilities  we are also very focused on elevating our talent and culture  In December  I announced several organization changes that I believe will enable us to take our business to the next level  Chuck Raup has been promoted to President U S  Chuck is a proven  results driven  commercial operator with a successful 10 year track record at Hershey  most recently  leading the acceleration of our U S  CMG business  Chuck s deep expertise across snacking  having led all areas of confection at Hershey and from his previous experience at Kraft  will be instrumental to our future success as we pursue our strong growth ambition across traditional and digital channels  Kristen Riggs has been promoted to Chief Growth Officer Kristen started with the company more than 14 years ago and has worked across nearly all commercial functions  Her focus on driving growth is underpinned by a strategic and analytical understanding of the modern consumer  strong marketing expertise and a tenacity for creating positive change in the organization  Together  the U S  business and growth office will work seamlessly to ensure the delivery of both 2020 and our growth plan over the next several years  And finally  Chris Scalia has been promoted to Chief Human Resources Officer  Chris joined Hershey in our Legal Department in 2005 and transitioned to Human Resources in 2011 Since that time  Chris has led talent management  recruiting  HR operations and business partner teams as well as workforce development  Chris brings a strong commercial business acumen an analytical rigor to talent planning and development and a passion for how people and culture drive performance  These changes are a testament to Hershey s talent development and succession planning  and I couldn t be more excited about the opportunities ahead with this tremendous talent across the organization  Thank you to Todd  Mary Beth  Kevin and Terry for all their contributions to our success over the past several years I ll now turn it over to Steve  who will provide you with details on our financial results  Steve Steve Voskuil    Senior Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Michele  and good morning  everyone  It was a strong year and quarter  and we are pleased with the quality of delivery across our segments  North America achieved net price realization and operating leverage  enabling incremental investment in brands and capabilities throughout the year  We saw consistent  solid retail takeaway on our core confectionary brands in the U S   and our international business delivered another year of incremental profitable growth  We feel good about the momentum we have heading into 2020 to deliver an on algorithm year for both top and bottom line  Fourth quarter net sales increased 4  to  2 1 billion versus the same period last year  with a slight headwind from foreign currency exchange The Net Impact of acquisitions and divestitures contributed 220 basis points of growth  organic constant currency net sales growth of 1 9  was consistent with expectations and driven by price realization in the US and volume growth in our international markets  Net price real estate for the quarter was 360 basis points partially offset by anticipated elasticity driven volume declines of 170 basis points  Adjusted earnings per share diluted were  1 28 for the quarter increase of 1 6  versus the same period last year  This was driven by gross margin gains  which were more than offset by increased incentive compensation  For the full year net sales increased 2 5  the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures was a one point benefit Organic constant currency net sales growth of 1 8  was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange of 30 basis points  The delivery of our net sales and gross margin expansion plans allowed for investment in brands  capability and our employees to drive future growth  This translated to adjusted earnings per share for the full year of  5 78  an increase of 7 8  versus prior year  In the fourth quarter  our North America segment net sales increased 3 8  versus the same period last year  The net benefit of acquisitions was 250 basis points  Organic net sales of 1 3  was driven by price realization of 400 basis points  partially offset by elasticity driven volume declines of 270 basis points Recall  in the third quarter  price realization was approximately one point lower than expectations due to the timing related to our July 2019 announced price increase  As anticipated  this headwind reversed in the fourth quarter  Without this timing shift  price realization was approximately 300 basis points  about 50 basis points ahead of expectations as we began to get a slight benefit from our most recent price increase  This incremental pricing contributed to stronger than anticipated gross margin expansion in the fourth quarter  Adjusted gross margins in North America expanded 130 basis points versus prior year  This was driven by net price realization and favorable commodities  which were partially offset by increased logistics and packaging costs  consistent with other quarters North America advertising and related consumer marketing spend increased 5 1  in the quarter driven by planned advertising increases enabled by our gross margin expansion  Fourth quarter international and other segments net sales increased 5 8  versus the year ago period  Constant currency net sales grew 6 3   offset by a 50 basis point headwind from foreign currency exchange  Volume was a 5 7 point benefit  and net price realization contributed 60 basis points to net sales growth  Combined  organic constant currency sales  net sales in Mexico  Brazil  India and China grew 6  versus the fourth quarter of 2018  with growth in all markets  International and other advertising and related consumer marketing decreased 11  versus prior year as we continue to optimize investment in these focused markets Now turning to gross margin  Adjusted gross margin    excuse me  adjusted gross profit of  898 million in the fourth quarter increased 6 4  versus prior year  This resulted in adjusted gross margin of 43 4   an increase of nearly 100 basis points  driven by net price realization and favorable commodities  Fourth quarter adjusted operating profit of  370 million resulted in an operating profit margin of 17 9   a decrease of 70 basis points versus the fourth quarter of 2018  Gross margin gains were more than offset by higher incentive compensation  This incentive increase was related to a strong 2019 performance and a structural market based increase of variable compensation linked to company performance for our managers and individual contributors  This increase was planned to occur gradually over the coming years However  our strong performance in 2019 allowed us to accelerate this change  which we believe is important for retaining and securing top talent in our organization  As you saw in our press release  reported operating profit in the fourth quarter declined  135 million versus the prior year period  driven by the recognition of a long lived and intangible asset impairment loss associated with our 2015 acquisition of Krave  While meat snacks remain a growing category  volume has been driven by mainstream and value brands  The premium segment slowed and became even more competitive  which pressured sales and margins  While disappointing  this acquisition was an important step to beginning to diversify our portfolio in the U S   and we have leveraged the learning to improve the propositions and performance on our more recent acquisitions Moving down the P L  Interest expense of  37 million was in line with the prior year period  Full year interest expense was  144 million  an increase of  5 3 million versus 2018 due to increased debt associated with acquisitions  The adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter was 9 8  versus 9 5  in the year ago period  This rate was favorable versus our expectations due to the execution of additional tax credits  For the full year 2019  the adjusted tax rate was 17 4  versus 19 2  in the year ago period  This full year favorability was driven by excess tax benefits from stock based compensation and valuation allowance releases in our international markets  In the fourth quarter  other expense was  34 million  a decrease of  5 1 million versus the year ago period  driven by non service related pension expense For the fourth quarter of 2019  weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were approximately 210 5 million  reflecting a slight decrease versus the prior quarter  The company did not repurchase any shares in the fourth quarter against our July 2018   500 million authorization  and  410 million remain  Total capital additions  including software  were  82 million in the fourth quarter  totaling  318 million for the full year 2019  This was slightly below expectations as some of our IS initiatives were delayed due to employee resource constraints related to our large ERP and supply chain projects  We continue to return cash to our shareholders  with fourth quarter dividends of  157 million  This was our 360th consecutive quarterly dividend on the common stock  We have solid underlying momentum in our core business that we believe positions us well to keep the momentum going in 2020 We expect full year net sales growth of 2  to 4   consistent with our long term algorithm  This includes an approximate one point benefit from the acquisition of ONE Brands  We anticipate our growth in North America will accelerate versus 2019 as we lap our SKU rationalization program  While we continue to expect profitable growth in our international markets  we expect the contribution will be lower than 2019 due to less favorable macroeconomic conditions impacting the confectionary category growth  Like 2019  we expect our North America growth to be driven by pricing  while our international growth is expected to be more volume driven  We expect gross margins to expand again in 2020 but at a slower pace than 2019  While we plan to benefit from slightly more price realization  commodities will change from being a tailwind in 2019 to a headwind in 2020  As a result  we expect adjusted gross margin to expand 40 to 50 basis points As was the case in 2019  we will leverage this pricing and gross margin expansion to lean into investments in our brands and capabilities  We expect advertising to grow slightly ahead of sales this year  and we ll continue to invest in data  technology and other initiatives to drive sustainable  profitable growth in the future  We expect 2020 interest expense to be relatively in line with 2019  and other expense to increase  30 million to  40 million versus 2019 as we plan to execute additional tax credits  As a result of these higher tax credit investments  we expect our 2019 adjusted tax rate to be between 16  and 17   The net impact of investment tax credits and our adjusted tax rate is unfavorable versus 2019 as we lap the onetime benefit of valuation allowance releases  For 2020  we expect elevated capex spending as we advance our ERP transition and initiate a strategic supply chain program As Michele mentioned  this multiyear capital project will not only add capacity but also give us new fulfillment and technology capabilities that we believe will help us deliver on the needs of our consumers and customers  while maintaining an advantaged margin profile  Given these significant investments  our capex for 2020 is estimated to be between  475 million and  525 million  Our core business sales growth and another year of gross margin expansion are expected to deliver full year adjusted earnings per share growth of 6  to 8   consistent with our long term algorithm  Given some of the timing of this year s key initiatives as well as events we are lapping from prior year  we do expect second half financial performance to be stronger than the first half While we have more pricing in the first half and are lapping our SKU rationalization program  we are also lapping a strong Easter  pipeline fill associated with our packaged candy transition  tax strategies that resulted in a low first half 2019 rate and second quarter margin benefits associated with our July 2019 price increase  Similar to 2019  while these factors create some volatility in our quarterly financial results  we expect retail performance to be more consistent throughout the year and remain confident in our ability to achieve our full year guidance  We remain focused on delivering balanced growth  with a disciplined approach to building our brands and evolving our business model for the future  We have strong cash flow and a healthy balance sheet  and we ll continue to make the necessary investments to drive the business and deliver long term shareholder value That concludes my financial discussion  and I ll now turn it back to Michele Michele Buck    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Steve  I m proud of what we have delivered over the past several years  and I m optimistic about 2020 and our future  We continue to operate with a healthy level of dissatisfaction and constantly push ourselves to elevate the business even further  We are excited about the opportunities ahead  and we look forward to sharing more details about our strategic plans in March Steve  Melissa and I are now available to take your questions Questions and Answers OperatorThank you   Operator Instructions  Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays  Please proceed with your question Andrew Lazar    Barclays    AnalystGood morning  everybody Michele Buck    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning Andrew Lazar    Barclays    AnalystSo two things for me  First  as we think about some of the various pieces that drove the fourth quarter unallocated corporate  maybe can you give us a sense or help quantify a bit  how much sort of is expected to stay in the base as we go through 2020  And how much  if any  sort of reverses out and perhaps helps to become a bit of a tailwind to 2020 operating income  And then    and second  I know it s a smaller business  Michele  but your comments on a new business model in Mexico just piqued my interest  I think you were talking about a new model to gain some incremental distribution  I didn t know if that was something along the lines of more of like a partnership or perhaps you can expand a little bit on that  And that s it Michele Buck    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerAndrew  why don t I take that one first because I think that s a quick one  which is really the focus there in Mexico is a new model to capture traditional trade  So it is not anything beyond that  but really  it s a focus to go after that traditional trade business Steve Voskuil    Senior Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerYes  Just picking up on the compensation on what stays and goes  Just in the fourth quarter  we really had three things that rolled in  One was if you look year over year  there was a rebate impact on incentives  The prior year period had below target performance and payout  So in the fourth quarter  you sort of catch up to target  We had then a predicted over target performance and then the market adjustment that we talked about  And clearly  we roll into 2020  That onetime market based adjustment will go away and so will the performance will reset at a target level  So roughly 50  of that increase will stay going forward  and about half of it will go away Andrew Lazar    Barclays    AnalystGreat  Thanks very much OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse  Please proceed with your question Robert Moskow    Credit Suisse    AnalystThe results are pretty much in line with what we had expected  Maybe incentive comp is a little higher than we thought  but    so I was just going to jump into capex  The capex spend is a big step up  You mentioned it s related to the ERP and supply chain program  Are there any expenses that run through the income statement related to this step up in your ERP program  Or is this really just a kind of a capex kind of effort  And also  what steps are you taking  if any  if you need to mitigate customer service issues Steve Voskuil    Senior Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerSure  The ERP program has been going for a number of years  And so you re right  there s    a portion of that capex step up in 2020 is due to the ERP program continuing  There is a portion that hits the P L  Year over year  for  20  it s not a material factor  and it s obviously factored into our guidance  As we get to the March investor conference  as Michele said  we ll talk more about the supply chain project and probably also talk more about the next couple of steps that we expect on the ERP program  But for 2020  it s fully reflected from both opex and capex Michele Buck    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerAnd we have a big focus on chain management to the end of your question relative to really managing the risks and business continuity during that period of time  and we can talk a bit more about that in March Robert Moskow    Credit Suisse    AnalystOkay  Well  I ll wait until March then  Thank youOperatorThank you Our next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan  Please proceed with your question Ken Goldman    JPMorgan    AnalystHi  good morning  Thank you Michele Buck    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morningKen Goldman    JPMorgan    AnalystTwo for me  First  the increase in capex  does that change your outlook  at least in the short term  on M A  I know most of the M A you ve been doing is relatively  I guess  tack on in nature  So my guess is probably you ll stay opportunist  but I was just curious for your thoughts there  And then my second question is thank you for the guidance on the gross margin outlook  I guess in that guidance  are you assuming any incremental pricing action  whether it s list prices  whether it s reduced promos or pack size changes  things like that  Or is it sort of status quo  and you have all the pricing actions that you need already baked in and hit that gross margin number  And I m asking because  obviously  cocoa has gone up a little bit  and I know you re hedged there and so forth  but just curious Steve Voskuil    Senior Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerMaybe I ll take the first part of that question relative to    thinking about M A relative to the additional capex  So clearly  that has an impact on free cash flow  Our capital allocation priorities aren t changing  We continue to look  first and foremost  at funding both organic and inorganic growth  protecting the dividend and obviously watching overall leverage  I would say as we sit here today  we have    with the incremental capex investment  we are not pulling back or looking for potential inorganic opportunities as they come available We ll always do that with an eye toward leverage and the value proposition for shareholders  So I would say no change in our posture from that perspective  On the gross margin side  we don t comment about specific pricing actions that we might have planned for the coming year because price continues to be a strategic part of our repertoire of tools to use  along with all the other components  So anything you want to add to that  Michele Michele Buck    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  I would just say  I mean overall  we are expecting price in that 2  to 2 5  range for the year in North America  and our gross margin guidance is consistent with that being a part of it Ken Goldman    JPMorgan    AnalystThank you so much OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein  Please proceed with your question Alexia Howard    Bernstein    AnalystGood morning  everyone Michele Buck    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morningAlexia Howard    Bernstein    AnalystSo it seems as though the core business is chugging along  You ve got the modest price increases rolling through each year  In terms of the future business development acquisition strategy from here  can you talk a little bit about what the key learnings have been from what s worked with SkinnyPop popcorn and what seems to be improving with Pirate s Booty and maybe some of the things didn t work so well with Krave and Brookside  And then also maybe just talk about what your priorities are from here  Is it are going to remain within salty snacks in the U S   Or are you thinking about more overseas acquisitions  What s the priority list from here  And I ll pass it on Michele Buck    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerSure  So let s start with our overall strategy  which is about capturing incremental snacking occasions  And if you look within that  certainly  the number one priority is in categories outside of sweet indulgence in the U S  So both salty snacks  savory as well as we ve recently bought the ONE Brands nutrition bar  So I d say it s largely about better for you and savory in the U S  Not to say that we will not move forward with something in confection  if there s a gap in our portfolio  we will  And we would entertain international acquisition  but our bar is much higher  given the risk levels of that business  And obviously  given we don t have scale internationally  the businesses that make sense for us are just a bit different than in U S  Relative to our key learnings  I would say  probably the first and biggest learning is that    is around selection of assets  that is  we are a branded  high gross margin company That is    those are the kinds of brands we re used to growing and building  SkinnyPop and Pirate s Booty fit right in that sweet spot on both of those elements  And I think especially if we re going into a newer category or segment within snacking  Krave  in particular  was an acquisition that did not meet either of those relative to adequate scale nor adequate gross margin  So I think that s the single biggest learning was that piece of what fits our business model and staying true to that  And then certainly  along the way  I think we learned other things relative to integration and how to get the best of both leveraging our scale as well as enabling some of the entrepreneurial spirit but realizing the businesses we re buying are in a phase of scaling up in growth  and there s help needed to do that Alexia Howard    Bernstein    AnalystGreat  thank you very much  I ll pass it on OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs  Please proceed with your question Jason English    Goldman Sachs    AnalystHey  good morning  folks  Thank you for having me in and happy belated New Year Michele Buck    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYou re welcome Jason English    Goldman Sachs    AnalystI want to come back real quick on the capex piece because it s a surprisingly large number  And it sounds like we ll get more detail on where that spend is coming at the Analyst Day  But given that you used to be a lot more into supply chain and you re saying at the same time that your prior margin for growth  productivity savings are poised to step down  is it unreasonable to think that we should expect a larger or some sort of news around renewed productivity goals over the next couple of years Steve Voskuil    Senior Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerYes  We re not announcing today any renewed productivity goal  I would say productivity is and will remain a key part of our algorithm inside the P L  You re right  last couple of years with margin for growth had probably had higher than historically typical productivity  2020 is down a little bit from that as the kind of peak of that program passes  And we will do as we always do  kind of continue to look for additional productivity opportunities  And some of the improvements coming in terms of fulfillment with the supply chain investment will actually set the future for some more as we go forward Michele Buck    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  a little bit of additional context  You know in the past  we did big supply chain projects  and those tended to be much more focused on utilization of capacity and also margin enhancement  This supply chain project is very much focused on enabling growth and doing so by providing increased flexibility and customization capabilities that will then allow us to meet consumer and customer needs while maintaining the advantaged margin structure that we have Jason English    Goldman Sachs    AnalystThat s good context  I understand a little bit better now  I appreciate that  Switching gears real quick to growth side  so new capabilities to help drive growth  But from a volumetric perspective  there s not a lot of growth right now in your    at least in your North American portfolio  And I know there some elasticity components there  but how should we think about the growth trajectory for both the category and your portfolio as we track through the next 12  24 months Michele Buck    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerSo first of all  we think both volume and price are important to our long term algorithm  During the years where we have pricing  those years will be much more pricing driven than volume driven  And we do a lot of hard work on our programming to keep our volumes flat during that time  Otherwise  according to the models  we d actually decline in volume  So we re pleased that we ve been able to do that  But over the years  you ll see a bit of both  And as we look at the actual growth outlook  we continue to think that the CMG category is going to grow at that 1 5  to 2  type of range  We believe in 2020 that it will be at the higher end of that range given the pricing in the marketplace  but we believe it will not be as high as 2019  which also had the additional benefit of a long Easter  And we look to grow in line or slightly above the category growth rate Jason English    Goldman Sachs    AnalystOkay  Thanks a lot  I ll see you in Florida Michele Buck    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerOkay OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from the line of Steven Strycula with UBS  Please proceed with your question Steven Strycula    UBS    AnalystHi  good morning  Just to piggyback off of Jason s question on the organic sales for the year  how should we think about maybe how the China and Brazil macro situations really kind of play into how you think about the international business  I know it s a smaller part  And then on the U S  front  anything to comment on SNAP and how that    any potential developments and legislation might potentially impact that business as you think forward  Thank you Michele Buck    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  So certainly  we have seen some macroeconomic softness in several of the developing markets in which we participate  As we developed our plans for the year  we tried to take that into account as other factors that were known at the time  Clearly  the coronavirus would be the one unknown that really we didn t have visibility to at the time  and we are tracking that carefully  We do anticipate that will have an impact on our business in China  But as you know  we are predominantly North American based company  so not as big an impact as we may see from some others  And we are carefully tracking and always do kind of what happens with SNAP at this point in time  We have not built in nor anticipate something significant there  but we ll keep a close eye on that Steven Strycula    UBS    AnalystAnd as a quick follow up to that  Michele  I appreciate the color for China  As you think about it being a potential impact  as you noted  is it more from a manufacturing standpoint that facilities are maybe off line until maybe the beginning of February  as is the case for the industry  Or is it more just an early indication that depletion rates in the retail channel are already starting to come in a little bit as travel slows  Any color there would be helpful Michele Buck    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  I would say it s more of the latter  which is our business tends to have a seasonal skew around Chinese New Year  We sold in our volume  And now  consumers are not able to go to retail  And so we are trying to carefully watch what the takeaway will be and any waste implications from the fact that  that portfolio is seasonal in nature  So that s the biggest hit for us Steven Strycula    UBS    AnalystThank you OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from the line of Jon Feeney with Consumer Edge  Please proceed with your question Jon Feeney    Consumer Edge    AnalystThe morning thanks very much  A couple    a detail question first and then a real question  The detail question is on looking at your takeaway data you gave us  so 2 8  on candy  mint  and gum  11 3  on salty snacks  2 5  overall  is it like last quarter where all that gap    is that all Krave  that    kind of flushing out of the system  It would be my first question because it would seem to me it d be something like in the 3s overall  if that wasn t the case  And second question  real question is  it seems like pricing work a lot better than it used to  and it s worked fantastically at times in the past decade  But it seems like you get it  You see less elasticity  You grow gross margin  Like    is something just new under the sun here where you have better capabilities and you just price more tactically going forward than used to be  If you get any detail on that  I d appreciate it Michele Buck    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerOkay  So relative to your first question  you re right that there are some of the smaller emerging brands like Krave that are a drag to our total consumption  The other piece is our grocery business  which is comprised primarily of syrup and baking chips  Syrup tends to be a pretty stable business  but baking chips has big promotional windows  and it s very competitive  So we always have decisions to make relative to which pieces of business to go for and which just don t have the profit margins that we re interested in  And so we passed on some less profitable business this year  and that was a drag on our total retail takeaway Relative to pricing  I would    so we think about the impact as being pretty consistent with what we ve seen over the years that we ve always had a pretty solid ability to leverage price  And we believe that s only though because of all of the investments that we make  with retailers and retail specific programs  the high level of advertising we put behind our brands that creates the brand s value proposition for the consumer that enables that  So    but we see basically the elasticity is being somewhat in line with what we ve seen historically Jon Feeney    Consumer Edge    AnalystWell  it works  whatever it does  Thank you Michele Buck    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYou re welcome OperatorThank you  Your next question comes from the line of John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo  Please proceed with your question John Baumgartner    Wells Fargo    AnalystMorning  Thanks for the question  I guess  Michele and Steve  I d just like to hear a bit more about the operating leverage  given the importance of that to the P L  We ve seen plant closures over the years  You ve had the modernization in Hershey  Now there s talk about  I guess  the smart plants  So as you exit the margin for growth  how do you think about leverage from here  And how large of a contributable manufacturing be  given the increases in capacity  flattish category growth relative to leverage from SG A at this point  I mean there s a lot of moving pieces  I m just trying to get a sense for the factors and how that materializes Michele Buck    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerSteve  do you want to get that Steve Voskuil    Senior Vice President  Chief Financial OfficerYes  I would like to  Driving operating leverage over time is going to continue to be a key part of the algorithm  And so all of these investments  whether we re talking in the manufacturing area or some of the capability investments  all are with an eye toward driving a return over time and ultimately driving leverage  And so some of the investments in digital and data  all have a business case around leverage at the end  And so as we ve done in the past  as margin for growth wraps up  we will kind of    as Michelle said  the past go right back through the P L and attack each one of those to continue to drive sustainable leverage  Anything to add there  Michele Michele Buck    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerNo John Baumgartner    Wells Fargo    AnalystOkay  And just as a follow up there  Based on the guidance  it looks as though nonadvertising SM A for 2020 should increase a fair amount year on year  Are there any particular call outs there in terms of the plan  whether it s in store programming  sales force feet on the street or anything else worth note that we should think about here Michele Buck    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerOur data and technology investments do fall in that line  So investments around ERP  investments more broadly around data and technology when it comes to analytics and how we evaluate the business  new data sources  etc   fall in that bucket  That s a significant piece John Baumgartner    Wells Fargo    AnalystOkay  thanks for time OperatorThank you  Our next question comes from the line of Rob Dickerson with Jefferies  Please proceed with your question Rob Dickerson    Jefferies    AnalystGreat  thank you  I guess first question  Michelle  is just given the amount of investment you deployed over the past  call it  two  three years to now  speaking to the next two two three years to become more efficient  With that in mind  as we see brand support increase  I feel like at least  usually  that brand support goes to your larger brands  Or just higher margin that are leveraged overall  But you ve also acquired a number of smaller companies that are faster growth  smaller  but faster growth  on trend  etc  So when you step back and say  OK  we kind of  let s say  we ve kind of gotten through the first part of kind of our investment overall supply chain ERP Now we have further investment  Like should we be expecting increased innovation in the marketplace on brands like Skinny and Pirate s Booty and ONE  And I just ask because they seem to be kind of the on trend growth of your brands  not as big  but there s a lot of potential there  And I feel like we just haven t seen a tremendous amount of new innovation come out of those brands so far post acquisition Michele Buck    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  No  that s a great question  I would tell you that overall  as we look at growing a business  we do really believe in balanced    the balance levers we ve spoken with you all about relative to distribution  advertising that can drive base velocities  seasonal presence at pricing  etc  And so we believe all those levers are important  But at different phases and different brands like different of those levers are more important  So with brands like SkinnyPop and Pirates  in particular  we want to make really sure that we take full advantage of driving the cores on those businesses because they were not at max distribution capacity for what they deserve  given their velocity levels  So making sure that we continue to focus on that core distribution and also that we advertise to maximize household penetration So there are many brands and confections  where we have 40  household penetration  And it s significantly less on the brands like Pirates or Skinny  So it s intentional that we first focus on the core and that we judiciously add innovation  And we did do that with some seasonal items and some other items  the right flavor profiles  But we think that s a key learning from the past  is to be very measured in the innovation approach  We learned that on some of our early acquisition models  focus enough on the core Rob Dickerson    Jefferies    AnalystOkay  fair  And then just a quick follow up  I guess what s implied with further capital spend  especially in 2020 on the capex side of overall investment  I m assuming  as the leader of the company  the expectation is that this does build efficiency  obviously  So essentially  hopefully derisk further acquisitions  even if smaller in scale so basically Krave doesn t happen again Michele Buck    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  We are always focused on making better and better decisions and learning from every action we take in the past  So    and we feel good about what we re seeing on SkinnyPop and Pirate s  in particular  And ONE is on track  integration and acquisition model wise as well Rob Dickerson    Jefferies    AnalystOkay  super  thank you OperatorThank you   Operator Instructions  Our next question comes from the line of David Palmer with Evercore ISI  Please proceed with your question David Palmer    Evercore ISI    AnalystGreat  good morning Michele Buck    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerMorningDavid Palmer    Evercore ISI    AnalystIn recent years  Hershey has been smarter about pricing  You ve been smoothing out the price increases in any one year  and you ve been hitting different parts of the portfolio and using weight outs and new packaging  But volume is still down  It s down this last quarter  And I m wondering how you re thinking about pricing power and levers that you might have up your sleeve  Should we get into an inflationary environment  particularly with cocoa into  21  that it looks like it s shaping up to be  In other words  do you think you could defend that 45  type gross margin should we get an outsized lumpiness in inflation Michele Buck    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerSo of course  we can t really talk about the future pricing actions  but we can talk a little bit about what we re seeing in commodities and cocoa pricing and how we re thinking about how that flows through the P L  How about we take a little bit of a step back and talk a bit about that  and Steve and I will kind of tag team this  So we are very focused on watching cocoa s commodity because it s critically important for us  We do know it s a headwind as we go into next year  and that headwind is built into the guidance that we ve given you So every year going forward  we focus on the right combination of programs  which include hedging  which includes sometimes deciding to price  which include making trade offs across the P L to really accommodate whatever is happening in cocoa pricing  We do have pretty strong visibility going forward  so we have a chance to plan around that  And Steve  do you want to talk a bit more about that Steven Strycula    UBS    AnalystYes  I would say  as Michele said  we have good visibility in 2020  As you point out  David  if things like the lid and some of the pressure on cocoa remain into 2021  that will put some pressure  for sure  from a commodity standpoint into the P L  That said  between pricing levers  productivity levers and others  we ll use our toolbox to work to continue to drive leverage through gross margin as we go forward  The bar will be tougher  depending on how that cocoa pricing shapes up as we get to the back part of 2020 and into 2021  and we ll have more visibility into that as the year progresses Michele Buck    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerIt s certainly something that s been volatile over time  So I think we have experience managing that volatility David Palmer    Evercore ISI    AnalystThat s very helpful  And just a real small one  the relaunch of Take5  as you said  at the Super Bowl  That s an interesting move  It s only in the measured channel  it looks like it s about 0 5  of your channel mix  So it s not a huge trademark  but there s probably something you see in that  that s making you think there s an opportunity there  So maybe a couple of comments about why you think that is Michele Buck    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerSure  So Take5 has the highest repeat purchase of any competitive innovation and has one of the highest repeat purchases of many of the great brands we ve seen over time  It lacks awareness and trial  And so we relaunched    began relaunching that brand  putting it under the Reese s trademark because that is one key way to drive trial  It is    has great Reese s peanut butter on it  But that s where a placement like Super Bowl can tend to really help you  which is it garners a lot of awareness and trial and eyeballs  And we think that  that will be really helpful for us as part of our overall marketing plan behind Take5  So we look at Take5 as    I look at it as one of our great innovations for the year  We know it s a great product  and we ll have consumers get a chance to try it for themselves David

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Hershey 
For Hershey  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Hershey will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Hershey would post earnings of  1 61 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 61  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
