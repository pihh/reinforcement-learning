138815,360330,AEE,Beyond windmills  Epoch s Van Valen looks for grid improvements,news,"By April Joyner and Ross Kerber
NEW YORK  Reuters    At a time when U S  utilities face pressure to rely more on renewable energy  a well known investor in the space said it is equally important to judge companies by their spending on less glamorous areas like power lines and grid reliability 
Kera Van Valen  managing director and portfolio manager at Epoch Investment Partners  said on Tuesday that she finds companies including  Ameren Corp   NYSE AEE  and WEC Energy Group Inc appealing because of their infrastructure spending 
Those companies   and their regulators   understand that  you re going to need to connect more and more to the alternative energy sources and you need that distribution network to be able to do so   Van Valen said at the Reuters Global Investment Outlook 2020 Summit in New York 
She said she had avoided holding California utilities  notably the now bankrupt PG E Corp  on concerns that state officials were not focused enough on areas like grid reliability   We didn t feel the state regulator was as constructive as some of the other states within the U S    she said 
Van Valen is a portfolio manager for Epoch s equity shareholder yield strategies focused on areas like companies  dividends and buybacks  Epoch managed  33 1 billion for clients as of Sept  30

Van Valen has been a long standing holder of leading cigarette maker  Altria Group   NYSE MO  Inc  with a stake accounting for about 1  of her portfolio  She defended the holding despite scrutiny of smokeless tobacco technologies and public health concerns 
She said Altria and rivals have  tremendous pricing power   Even if sales volumes decline   the pricing does allow for the company to generate growth and strong cash flows  
Recent regulatory attention to vaping could ultimately benefit large tobacco companies  she said  given much of the concern stems from products made by smaller companies or illicit use 
 Everybody wants to see this regulation come through  It actually could be quite beneficial to the large tobacco companies   she said 
Van Valen said about 5  to 10  of her strategies  investors currently ask for a few holdings to be stripped out because of environmental  social or governance  ESG  issues  Despite her holdings in industries like tobacco  her portfolios still rate highly on some ESG metrics because they include many companies that are tightly overseen 
 The reason we re more comfortable with them is they re following the regulations   she said ",2019-11-05,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/beyond-windmills-epochs-van-valen-looks-for-grid-improvements-2012501,2012501

   Will give Russia 20 percent of U S  uranium market
2014 2020
   Russia sees nuclear fuel storage in U S  as next step
 
  Recasts with quotes  details  background 
 By Simon Shuster
 MOSCOW  May 26  Reuters    Russia signed a landmark deal to
supply nuclear fuel directly to U S  companies on Tuesday 
setting itself up to control 20 percent of the U S  uranium
market and extending its global reach in the nuclear sector 
 At a ceremony in the Russian capital  U S  electricity firms
PG E  Ameren Corp and Luminant signed deals to get more than  1
billion in uranium supplies from Russia s state nuclear fuel
exporter Tenex between 2014 and 2020 
  This is a revolutionary breakthrough   Sergei Kiriyenko 
the head of Russia s state atomic energy firm  Rosatom  which
controls Tenex  told reporters 
 Until last year  U S  anti dumping laws had only allowed
Russia to sell the United States uranium recovered from
dismantled Soviet nuclear weapons  These sales are carried out
through U S  uranium trader USEC Inc 
  We have broken through the wall forbidding us to sell
Russian fuel to the American market  After the contracts signed
today  we will start new contracts   a jubilant Kiriyenko said
after drinking toasts of champagne with the Americans   This is
only the beginning  
 Bruce Hamilton  the president of Fuelco  the intermediary
set up by the three U S  companies for the deal with Russia 
said Tuesday s agreements open the door for Russia to directly
take 20 percent of the U S  uranium market between 2014 and
2020 
  The Russians do it all  They mine it  they convert it and
they enrich it   Hamilton told Reuters after the deals were
signed   And after 2020  it s just wide open  for Russia   
 The Russian fuel would be used initially to provide power to
5 million U S  homes in California  Texas and Missouri  he
added 

 NUCLEAR STORAGE IN THE U S 
 Russia  one of the world s biggest nuclear players  has long
been seeking to expand its clout in the sector by moving into
developed markets such as the United States  European Union and
Japan 
 Earlier this year  it signed deals to cooperate with Japan s
Toshiba and Germany s Siemens  putting Russia in the centre of a
nuclear alliance stretching from Western Europe to East Asia 
 Tuesday s deals extended its reach further into the United
States  where Russia is now discussing access to nuclear
infrastructure  such as uranium storage facilities  Kiriyenko
said 
  The directors of the U S  energy companies discussed this
with us  For them it would be more convenient if these
facilities were located right in the United States  This is a
logical step for us   Kiriyenko told reporters 
 He added that these facilities would be jointly owned 
 Hamilton declined to comment on this project 
 U S  anti dumping laws were eased last year in a deal
between Moscow and Washington to allow direct sales of uranium
to other U S  firms aside from USEC 
 Analysts expect the increased access for Russian uranium to
lead to lower prices in the United States 
 The head of Tenex  which is also known as Techsnabexport 
said his company expects to get as much as 25 percent of the
U S  uranium market through the deals signed on Tuesday 
  I am confident other similar deals will follow   Tenex CEO
Anatoly Grigoryev  who signed all the contracts on behalf of the
Russian side  told reporters

   4th such deal since  wall  to U S  market broken last week
   Rosatom subsidiary plans  3 bln bond to fund expansion
 
 By Simon Shuster
 MOSCOW  June 3  Reuters    Russia s state nuclear firm
Rosatom sealed a uranium supply deal with U S  utility Exelon
Corp on Wednesday and voiced plans to issue a 100 billion rouble
bond as it intensifies its global expansion 
 Last week  the company said it had  broken down the wall 
into the U S  uranium market by striking three landmark deals to
supply nuclear fuel worth more than  1 billion to U S  power
firms PG E 
 U S  anti dumping laws  which were relaxed last year  had
previously only allowed Russia to sell the United States uranium
recovered from dismantled Soviet nuclear weapons 
 These sales are carried out through U S  uranium trader USEC
Inc  which had an effective monopoly on Russian uranium imports
under the so called  megatons to megawatts  scheme established 
 But Exelon will now become the fourth U S  firm to buy the
fuel directly from Rosatom s uranium exporter Tenex  also known
as Techsnabexport 
 Tenex is expected to gain control of 20 25 percent of the
U S  uranium market over the next decade as the chance to strike
direct supply deals opens up  Analysts expect U S  uranium
prices to fall as Russian fuel pours into the market 
 Under all four of the contracts already signed  state owned
Tenex will provide uranium to between 2014 and 2020 
 But Rosatom has not revealed the volume or price of the fuel
it will supply  saying only that it will be in line with market
prices 
 
 BOND TO FUND GLOBAL EXPANSION
 Russia  one of the world s biggest nuclear players  has long
been seeking to expand its clout in the sector by moving into
developed markets such as the United States  European Union and
Japan 
 Earlier this year  another Rosatom subsidiary 
Atomenergoprom  signed deals to cooperate with Japan s Toshiba
and Germany s Siemens  putting Russia in the centre of a nuclear
alliance stretching from Western Europe to East Asia 
 Sergei Kiriyenko  the head of Rosatom  said seperately on
Wednesday that this subsidiary plans to issue rouble bonds worth
100 billion roubles   3 25 billion  to fund its global
expansion 
 Atomenergoprom was created by Prime Minister Vladimir Putin
when he was Russia s president to merge all of the country s
civilian nuclear assets and help them compete in the global
market 
 Its current operations include building Iran s controversial
nuclear reactor at Bushehr through another Rosatom subsidiary 
Atomstroyexport  as well as projects to provide nuclear fuel or
build reactors in India  the Middle East  Asia and at home 
 Exelon  of Chicago  owns and operates more than 38 000 MW of
generating capacity  markets energy commodities  and transmits

138843,360358,AEE,Analysts Estimate Ameren  AEE  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Ameren  AEE  reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on November 8  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This utility is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 46 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  2 7  
Revenues are expected to be  1 75 billion  up 1 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 8 33  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Ameren 
For Ameren  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Ameren will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Ameren would post earnings of  0 75 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 72  delivering a surprise of  4  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

138924,360439,AEE,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  NVIDIA  Ameren  GTT And Ciena,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL  February 12  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  NVIDIA Corporation   NASDAQ NVDA    Ameren Corp    NYSE AEE    GTT Communications  Inc    NYSE GTT   and Ciena Corp    NYSE CIEN   Here are highlights from Monday s Analyst Blog Nvidia  NVDA  Q4 Earnings  What s in Store for the Stock NVIDIA Corporation is scheduled to report fourth quarter fiscal 2019 results on Feb 14 In the trailing four reported quarters  the company s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice and missed it once  the average positive surprise being 18 6  Having impressed investors with a stellar performance in the last couple of years  the company has been witnessing a downward trend since last October  Further  the chip maker has remained tremendously stressed ever since it came up with lower than expected results in the last reported quarter Notably  the company s non GAAP earnings per share of  1 84 missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 91  Although the figure surged 38  from the year ago period  it declined 5  sequentially Revenues improved 21  year over year to  3 18 billion  However  the top line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 24 billion and was also lower than the management s projection of  3 25 billion     2    Although growth across Datacenter  Professional Visualization and Automotive segments was positive  weakness in the Gaming segment was a spoiler Estimates and Guidance for Q4NVIDIA recently trimmed its fourth quarter fiscal 2019 guidance  The company cited softness in the gaming and data center spaces to be the primary reason behind the view cut  The company warned  deteriorating macroeconomic conditions  particularly in China  to be a major headwind The company s previous revenue estimate of  2 7 billion      2   was reduced to  2 2 billion      2    indicating a fall of 24  year over year and a 31  plunge sequentially The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at  2 37 billion  reflecting a year over year drop of almost 18 6  Moreover  the non GAAP gross margin is now expected to be 56  compared with the earlier outlook of 62 5   Margins are anticipated to be affected by around  120 million in charges for excess DRAM and other components due to the current market conditions besides the updated revenue expectation Further  the consensus mark for earnings currently stands at 75 cents  down 45 3  over the past 30 days Factors at PlayOn the last earnings call  NVIDIA initiated a tepid outlook for the fiscal fourth quarter  mirroring its suspension of mid range Pascal GPU shipments in order to stabilize the channel inventory levels following the end of the cryptocurrency mining boom  which dwindled demand for its GPUs Although the channel inventory cutback has been in line with management s expectations  sales in the soon to be reported quarter are expected to be lower due to sluggish consumer demand for gaming GPUs on account of sharp deceleration in China and waning Turing sales Additionally  high price of its high end RTX GPUs has compelled consumers to delay their purchases as they wait for reasonable prices and ray tracing technology to become more widely available The Zacks Consensus Estimate for GPU revenues is pegged at  2 4 billion  representing a dip of 2 4  from the year earlier quarter Moreover  due to the normal seasonal build cycle  the company anticipates a decrease in sales of Tegra chips for game consoles  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Tegra processor revenues stands at  362 million  depicting a decline of nearly 20  from the prior year quarter Furthermore  NVIDIA mentioned that many of its data center deals were not closed in the last month of the quarter as economic uncertainties made customers increasingly cautious  This makes us highly apprehensive as the company generates nearly one third of its revenues from this segment However  NVIDIA s confidence in its strategies and growth opportunities in ray traced gaming  rendering  high performance computing  AI and self driving cars  is something to look forward to What Our Model SaysOur proven Zacks model conclusively shows that a company with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  has significantly high chances of beating estimates if it also has a positive   Zacks Rank  4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  stocks are best avoided  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  NVIDIA currently has a Zacks Rank  5  which decreases the predictive power of ESP  and an Earnings ESP of 0 00   which further makes surprise prediction difficult  Thus  this combination does not predict a likely

138931,360446,AEE,Top Analyst Reports For Walmart  Amgen And Honda,opinion,"Wednesday  February 20  2019
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Walmart  NYSE WMT   Amgen  AMGN  and Honda  HMC   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Walmart s shares have outperformed the Zacks Supermarkets industry over the past six months   6 3  vs   5 7    due to its focus on strengthening e commerce and store operations  The Zacks analyst thinks these factors helped the company retain its sturdy comps trend in fourth quarter fiscal 2019  wherein top and bottom lines improved year over year and the latter marked its fourth consecutive beat  Notably  U S  comps rose for the 18th straight time  
Further  e commerce sales surged on the back of strong Walmart com and online grocery performances  E commerce sales are expected to rise nearly 35  in fiscal 2020  
Walmart is also making efforts to improve its International unit by shifting focus to profitable countries  To this end  the company s investment in Flipkart is however expected to dent the bottom line in fiscal 2020  Transportation costs and a compelling pricing strategy are threats to gross margin  Nonetheless  the Flipkart deal bodes well for the long term 
 You can   
Shares of Amgen have gained  2 4  in the past year versus the Zacks Biomedical and Genetics industry s decline of  16 3   Amgen beat expectations for both earnings and sales in the fourth quarter  However  its 2019 guidance reflects a year over year decline  
The Zacks analyst thinks that while Amgen s newer drugs   Prolia  Xgeva  Blincyto  Kyprolis   will drive sales  biosimilar and brand competition faced by its legacy products will create pressure on the top line in 2019  Meanwhile  uptake of key drug  Repatha has been slow due to payer restrictions and the recent price cut will hurt sales going forward  
Amgen is progressing with its pipeline and the approval of Aimovig was a huge boost  In the past five years  The company has launched nine products  including two in new therapeutic areas  Amgen boasts a strong biosimilars pipeline  which could be an important long term growth driver for the company  Its restructuring plan is making it leaner and more cost efficient 
 You can   
Buy ranked Honda s shares have outperformed the Zacks Foreign Automotive industry over the past six months  losing  9 2  vs   15 2   In third quarter of fiscal 2019  Honda s revenues improved year over year  
The Zacks analyst likes the company s Vision 2030 plan which aims to boost coordination between research and development as well as procurement and manufacturing of its products that will aid the company to reduce developmental costs and focus more on electric vehicles  
Also  its revenues streams in motorcycle and financial segments and favorable model mix are adding to profits  The company s collaboration with other companies to develop autonomous and electric vehicles will allow it offer new technologies and expand business

138959,360474,AEE,NVIDIA  NVDA  Q4 Earnings  What s In Store For The Stock ,opinion,NVIDIA Corporation   NASDAQ NVDA   is scheduled to report fourth quarter fiscal 2019 results on Feb 14 In the trailing four reported quarters  the company s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice and missed it once  the average positive surprise being 18 6  Having impressed investors with a stellar performance in the last couple of years  the company has been witnessing a downward trend since last October  Further  the chip maker has remained tremendously stressed ever since it came up with lower than expected results in the last reported quarter Notably  the company s non GAAP earnings per share of  1 84 missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 91  Although the figure surged 38  from the year ago period  it declined 5  sequentially Revenues improved 21  year over year to  3 18 billion  However  the top line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 24 billion and was also lower than the management s projection of  3 25 billion     2    Although growth across Datacenter  Professional Visualization and Automotive segments was positive  weakness in the Gaming segment was a spoiler Estimates and Guidance for Q4NVIDIA recently trimmed its fourth quarter fiscal 2019 guidance  The company cited softness in the gaming and data center spaces to be the primary reason behind the view cut  The company warned  deteriorating macroeconomic conditions  particularly in China  to be a major headwind The company s previous revenue estimate of  2 7 billion      2   was reduced to  2 2 billion      2    indicating a fall of 24  year over year and a 31  plunge sequentially The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at  2 37 billion  reflecting a year over year drop of almost 18 6  Moreover  the non GAAP gross margin is now expected to be 56  compared with the earlier outlook of 62 5   Margins are anticipated to be affected by around  120 million in charges for excess DRAM and other components due to the current market conditions besides the updated revenue expectation Further  the consensus mark for earnings currently stands at 75 cents  down 45 3  over the past 30 days NVIDIA Corporation Price and EPS Surprise   Factors at PlayOn the last earnings call  NVIDIA initiated a tepid outlook for the fiscal fourth quarter  mirroring its suspension of mid range Pascal GPU shipments in order to stabilize the channel inventory levels following the end of the cryptocurrency mining boom  which dwindled demand for its GPUs Although the channel inventory cutback has been in line with management s expectations  sales in the soon to be reported quarter are expected to be lower due to sluggish consumer demand for gaming GPUs on account of sharp deceleration in China and waning Turing sales Additionally  high price of its high end RTX GPUs has compelled consumers to delay their purchases as they wait for reasonable prices and ray tracing technology to become more widely available The Zacks Consensus Estimate for GPU revenues is pegged at  2 4 billion  representing a dip of 2 4  from the year earlier quarter Moreover  due to the normal seasonal build cycle  the company anticipates a decrease in sales of Tegra chips for game consoles  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Tegra processor revenues stands at  362 million  depicting a decline of nearly 20  from the prior year quarter Furthermore  NVIDIA mentioned that many of its data center deals were not closed in the last month of the quarter as economic uncertainties made customers increasingly cautious  This makes us highly apprehensive as the company generates nearly one third of its revenues from this segment However  NVIDIA s confidence in its strategies and growth opportunities in ray traced gaming  rendering  high performance computing  AI and self driving cars  is something to look forward to What Our Model SaysOur proven Zacks model conclusively shows that a company with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  has significantly high chances of beating estimates if it also has a positive   Zacks Rank  4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  stocks are best avoided  You can uncover the

139006,360521,AEE,4 Terrific Utility Stocks To Buy Ahead Of Q4 Earnings ,opinion,The Utilities sector was the best performer for the S P 500 in 2018  The sector ended in the positive territory despite the benchmark index suffering significant losses  Although Wall Street displayed signs of recovery so far in 2019  several headwinds still persist Lingering trade related conflicts between the United States and China  fears of a global economic slowdown  geopolitical uncertainties like Brexit problem and uncertainty about Fed s monetary stance in 2019 are near term concerns An escalation on any of these fronts will lead to severe market fluctuations  At this stage  it will be wise to invest in defensive sector stocks like utilities to cushion your portfolio Immune to Vagaries of Economic Cycle    The Utilities sector is mature and fundamentally strong as demand for such services is generally immune to vagaries of the economic cycle  It s because these companies provide basic services like electricity  gas and water  which can never go out of demand Consequently  adding stocks from the utility basket usually lends more stability to a portfolio in an uncertain market condition  Moreover  the sector is known for stability and visibility of its earnings and cash flows   Stable earnings enable utilities to pay out consistent dividends that add to their attractiveness to income oriented investors Utility companies enjoy a reputation for safety given the regulated nature of their business  which lend their revenues a high level of certainty  These companies also benefit from the domestic orientation of their business  which shields them from foreign currency translation issues that have been plaguing the other industries of late Notably  in 2018  utility stocks in the S P 500 gained 4 9   Except utility  healthcare was the only sector which ended in the green after reporting a gain of 4 7   The benchmark itself lost 6 2  last year Future Looks Bright  Overall  utilities will benefit from the new rates in their service territories  customer growth  effective management and control of expenses through the introduction of new technology  In addition  strengthening of transmission and distribution networks  which lowered outage time  is going to have a positive impact on earnings  Non availability of replacement of services provided by utilities is the biggest driving force Major utility companies have taken initiatives to curb emission from their respective generation portfolio and focus on usage of higher percentage of clean and renewable assets

139028,360543,AEE,Why Ameren  AEE  Is Poised To Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Ameren  NYSE AEE   which belongs to the Zacks Utility   Electric Power industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This utility has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 19 99  
For the last reported quarter  Ameren came out with earnings of  1 50 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 28 per share  representing a surprise of 17 19   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  0 79 per share and it actually produced earnings of  0 97 per share  delivering a surprise of 22 78  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Ameren  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Ameren has an Earnings ESP of  2 13  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on February 15  2019 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-01-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-ameren-aee-is-poised-to-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200376064,200376064

139079,360594,AEE,Here s Why Momentum Investors Will Love Ameren  AEE ,opinion,"Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock s recent trend  which can be in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   And for investors following this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  this can be very tough to define  There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance  The Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Ameren  AEE   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Ameren currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
Let s discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for AEE that show why this utility shows promise as a solid momentum pick 
A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short term price activity  as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For AEE  shares are up 2 62  over the past week while the Zacks Utility   Electric Power industry is up 0 86  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 2 12  compares favorably with the industry s 3 03  performance as well 
Considering longer term price metrics  like performance over the last three months or year  can be advantageous as well  Over the past quarter  shares of Ameren have risen 8 04   and are up 14 55  in the last year  In comparison  the S P 500 has only moved  8 2  and 1 08   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to AEE s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  AEE is currently averaging 1 282 296 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with AEE 
Over the past two months  5 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost AEE s consensus estimate  increasing from  3 25 to  3 37 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  1 estimate has moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Given these factors  it shouldn t be surprising that AEE is a  2  Buy  stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B  If you re looking for a fresh pick that s set to soar in the near term  make sure to keep Ameren on your short list ",2018-12-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/heres-why-momentum-investors-will-love-ameren-aee-200367372,200367372

Strikes BackOn Jun 15  President Trump announced that the United States was imposing tariffs on  50 billion of China s imports  Additionally  he said that the United States  will pursue additional tariffs  in case China pursues retaliatory measures  Trump added that 25  tariffs will be imposed on Chinese products that utilize  industrially significant technologies  China s commerce ministry retorted that would respond by imposing tariffs on U S  goods in  equal scale and equal strength   On Jun 16  China s finance ministry stated that it will launch tariffs of 25  on  50 billion of U S  imports  Tariffs on  34 billion of U S  imports  primarily on agricultural goods  will commence from Jul 6   India Retaliates  Defensive Stocks Gain CurrencyMeanwhile  India is moving ahead with plans to impose retaliatory tariffs on 30 U S  products  Per a revised WTO filing  the move is aimed at recouping tariffs worth  241 million imposed by the United States on India s steel and aluminum in March  These fresh tariffs have been levied on almonds  apples  walnuts as well as metal and chemical products Fittingly  defensive sectors  such as real estate  consumer staples and utilities were the major gainers of Friday s trading session  These stocks grow at a slower pace than the rest of the economy  However  they are more stable in nature and safer during periods of economic uncertainty These also offer dividend yields which are higher than the overall market  Such a characteristic had actually decreased their attractiveness during a year when treasury yields have peaked  But with trade tensions cropping up  they may prove to be popular  especially among risk averse investors Our ChoicesTrump s decision to impose tariffs on Chinese products seems to have sparked off a full fledged trade war  China has responded in equal measure and no resolution seems to be in sight in the near term  In fact  the trade war could actually expand in scope with countries like India choosing to impose retaliatory tariffs Investing in defensive stocks  which offer a safe and stable choice during periods of uncertainty looks like a good option at this point  Further  they carry the promise of above average dividend yields  We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and other relevant metrics PennyMac Mortgage Investment Trust   NYSE PMT

139189,360704,AEE,Ameren s Arm Set To Acquire 400 MW Wind Farm In Missouri,opinion,Ameren Corporation s   NYSE AEE   subsidiary  Ameren Missouri  recently announced that it has signed an agreement for acquiring a 400 megawatt  MW  wind farm in northeast Missouri  Notably  Ameren Missouri will purchase the farm following its construction The transaction seems to be in line with the company s goal to reduce carbon emissions up to 80  by 2050 Details of the AgreementThe wind farm will consist of 175 technologically advanced wind turbines and electricity generated from these turbines will be sufficient enough to power an estimated 120 000 homes by 2020  Post construction  the wind farm will become the largest wind energy provider in Missouri The transaction still remains subjected to a number of regulatory conditions  while the financial terms of the deal were kept under wraps Benefits of the BuyoutAmeren Missouri s 20 year outlook plan pledges to expand clean energy in Missouri and possibly neighboring states with an investment of  1 billion in new wind generation projects  This venture is expected to produce at least 700 MW of new wind generated energy by 2020  Impressively  Ameren s latest buyout of the wind farm will enable the company to meet 50  of this planned capacity Moreover  the company s Mark Twain Transmission Project  which got the regulatory go ahead this January  will aid the wind farm to distribute energy more seamlessly in Missouri with the former s expanded transmission capacity  Indeed  energy from the new wind farm  together with the new transmission lines of the Mark Twain project  will enable Ameren to deliver greater energy reliability  economic growth and better access to clean energy sources to the residents of Missouri Our ViewWind energy is one of the fastest growing forms of electricity generation from clean energy in the United States and thereby  plays a pivotal role in the country s rapid expansion of low carbon electricity generation  The U S  wind power industry had a strong finish to 2017  with 7 017 MW of new wind capacity installed in the country  representing  11 billion in new private investment  as per a report published by the American Wind Energy Association  AWEA  Moreover  the pipeline of wind farms under construction or in advanced development totals 28 668 MW as of 2017 end  reflecting a 34  increase compared to 2016 end  Going forward the wind industry s powerful growth is poised to continue in 2018 as well  delivering jobs and private investment to rural areas and factory towns and resulting in an overall economic growth Such valued growth prospects of the wind industry must have encouraged Ameren Corp  to invest in the latest wind farm   Missouri  being the national transportation hub for rail  river  road  and air shipments in the United States  has energy consumption per capita at the national median  Naturally  energy demand is high in the state that offers solid opportunities to electricity providers  like Ameren  to expand its footprint in there Coming to its operational performance  the company witnessed a solid 48  year over year increase  driven by higher Ameren Missouri electric service rates and retail sales  Considering its latest expansion plans for wind energy in the state of Missouri  we may expect the company to deliver similar bottom line growth in the coming days Price MovementAmeren s stocks gained 1 0  in a year  compared with the broader  s decline of 6 3   The company s modernized approach and focus on increasing customer

	Chicago  IL   December 06  2016   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include SCANA Corporation  NYSE     Southwest Gas Corporation  NYSE     Ameren Corporation  NYSE AEE   NYSE     Dean Foods Company  NYSE     and Turning Point Brands  Inc   NYSE      

	Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations    

Here are highlights from Monday s Analyst Blog  

5 Top Defensive Stocks to Fight Market Uncertainty

	Jobs growth lost momentum in November and the drop in unemployment rate did not herald in good news as it stemmed from a decline in labor force participation  The economy thus remains on tenterhooks  The major indices  in the meantime  gyrated this month as tech stocks bleed  President elect Donald Trump s policy changes and protectionism  along with a stronger dollar may pose concerns for companies having significant international exposure  Though Trump s market friendly policies have worked wonders for a slew of sectors  it is also turning the broader market into one giant bubble  raising possibilities of disenchantment for investors in the near term 

	Outside the U S   a resounding  no  vote in Sunday s Italian referendum has kept investors on high alert  Given the turbulence  investing in defensive companies seems prudent  Such stocks provide consistent dividend and steady earnings regardless of the state of the global equity market 

Jobs Report Suggests Moderation in Growth

	The November jobs report showed fewer than expected job additions  while the count over the prior two months has been trimmed  The U S  economy added 178 000 jobs in November  less than analysts  expectations of 180 000 to 200 000  Year on year employment growth has declined 7 basis points from 1 65  to 1 58   The payroll count  in the meantime  was revised lower by a cumulative 2 000 over the last two months  While Professional   business services  construction and health care added jobs  all other industries showed no considerable addition 

	Meanwhile  the unemployment rate fell to 4 6   marking a 9 year low  But  the decline is largely because of the fall in participating rate  The big drop in the unemployed rate was the result of the 226 000 decline in civilian labor force  The participation rate decreased to 62 7  last month from 62 8   It is now near the lowest since 1978  The news on wages was also discouraging  Average hourly earnings fell by 0 1  in November to  25 89 after a 0 4  rise in the prior month  This marks the first decline since Dec 2014 

Tech Tumbles on Fear of Trump Effect

	The tech heavy Nasdaq  which has lately been impacted by weakness in technology  fell 2 7  last week  its worst decline since the election on Nov 8  Among other major indices  the S P 500 lost 1   while the Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks  which has been one of the biggest gainers post the election  fell 2 2  over the same time frame 

	Trump s tax reforms aren t favoring the tech sector much  He is in favor of lowering corporate tax rate from 35  to 15   This might be great news for some sectors  but not for techs at all  The tech sector s current tax rate averages around 20   which suggests that it earnings will receive a lesser boost compared to sectors with notably higher tax rates 

	Tech behemoths often stash a lot of cash overseas  Trump s policy that corporates will get a chance to repatriate foreign profits at a rate of 10  should benefit these tech stocks  but  his call for tariffs on goods manufactured overseas could make products pricey  eventually affecting revenues  Trump  on a personal level  doesn t share a good rapport with several tech powerhouses including Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   whose CEO Jeff Bezos was accused of evading corporate taxes  read more     

	Substantial international exposure has also made major tech companies vulnerable  thanks to a stronger dollar  The rising dollar will deny revenues of multinational companies that rely heavily on profits from overseas 

Trump s Rally a Bubble 

	Trump s market friendly policies  however  helped major indices scale to all time highs in November  However  this warns us that the market might be approaching the overbought region which will either be corrected by going sideways or lower 

	According to Ed Yardeni  chief investment strategist at Yardeni Research Inc   the S P 500 s forward price to earnings ratio climbed to 16 9 multiples last week from 16 4 multiples on Nov 8  When it comes to small cap stocks  the ratio for the small cap S P 600 surged to 19 9 from 17 4 in the same period  These valuation levels are difficult to sustain unless the U S  economy expands to 4  from the current level of about 3  

Voters Reject Renzi in Referendum

	On the international front  a stinging defeat of Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi dragged U S  equity index futures down on Dec 4  while the euro touched a 20 month low  He said that he will resign following a referendum over his proposals for constitutional reforms  Exit polls and early projections indicated that he had lost the referendum by a wide margin 

	Italian voters rejected the proposals aimed at ending a political gridlock and reviving Italy s stagnant economy  This means that investors now view the country to be Eurozone s biggest risk  Italy might be driven out of the Eurozone which could spark a banking crisis 

5 Defensive Stocks to the Rescue

	As the markets seem to be plagued with widespread uncertainty including stretched valuations  defensive stocks seem to be the safest investment option  Such stocks are generally non cyclical  or companies whose business performance and sales are not highly correlated with the activities in the larger market  Their products are in constant demand irrespective of market volatility and such names include companies from the utilities and consumer staples sectors 

	Utilities are deemed defensive stocks as not many people will be willing to live without electricity  gas and water  Food  beverage and tobacco companies are true defensive plays as demand for such staple stocks remains unaffected during economic downturns  We have  thus  selected five solid stocks from the aforementioned defensive sectors that boast a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and a  of  A  or  B   Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three metrics  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners 

SCANA Corporation  NYSE        This distributor and seller of electricity to retail and wholesale customers has a Zacks Rank  2 and a VGM score of  B   The company s estimated growth rate for this year is 11 4   in contrast to the industry s projected negative return  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current year earnings increased 4  over the last 60 days  The company offers a dividend of 3 24  

Southwest Gas Corporation  NYSE        This distributor and transporter of natural gas in Arizona  Nevada  and California carries a Zacks Rank  2 and a VGM score of  B   The company s estimated growth rate for this year is 8   higher than the industry s return of 4 2   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current year earnings advanced almost 1  over the last 60 days  The company gives a dividend of 2 44  

Ameren Corporation  NYSE        This company engages in rate regulated electric generation  transmission  and distribution in Missouri and rate regulated natural gas transmission and distribution businesses in Illinois  The company has a Zacks Rank  2 and a VGM score of  A   The company s estimated growth rate for this year is 5 3   in contrast to the industry s projected negative return  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current year earnings increased 6 7  over the last 60 days  The company has a dividend payout of 3 42   You can see   

Dean Foods Company  NYSE        This food and beverage company has a Zacks Rank  1 and a VGM score of  A   The company s estimated growth rate for this year is 31 5   above the industry s return of 26 5   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current year earnings advanced 3 2  over the last 60 days  The company gives a dividend of 1 88  

Turning Point Brands  Inc   NYSE        This manufacturer and seller of smokeless and smoking tobacco products in the U S  has a Zacks Rank  2 and a VGM score of  B   The company s estimated growth rate for next year is 38 3   more than the industry s return of 10 9   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current year earnings increased 5  over the last 60 days

139371,360886,AEE,Will Southern Company  SO  Q3 Ruin The Earnings Streak ,opinion,"Electric utility firm Southern Company   NYSE SO   is set to release its third quarter 2016 results before the opening bell on Monday  Oct 31 
In the preceding three month period  the Atlanta  GA based service provider delivered a positive earnings surprise of 7 25  on robust performance from its wholesale unit 
Coming to earnings surprise history  the utility has an excellent record  its beaten estimates in each of the last four quarters  resulting in an average positive surprise of 5 58  SOUTHERN CO Price and EPS Surprise
 

   Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to Consider This Quarter
The operating results of Southern Company are affected by weather conditions and may vary on a seasonal and quarterly basis  Electric power supply is usually a seasonal business  In several regions of the country  demand for power peaks during the summer months  along with market prices  In other areas  power demand reaches its maximum during the winter  But with this year s late summer turning out longer and hotter than normal  Southern Company s third quarter retail electricity demand might get a boost 
However  with customer growth tepid and likely to remain so for some time  sales are likely to be affected  This together with a large base  might make it difficult for Southern Company to manage rates 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Southern Company will beat estimates this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  to be able to beat consensus estimates  Please check our  that enables you to find stocks that are expected to come out with earnings surprises 
That is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is 0 00   This is because the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate both stand at  1 17 
Zacks Rank  Southern Company has a Zacks Rank  3  Though a Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of ESP  the company s ESP of 0 00  makes surprise prediction difficult 
We caution against Sell rated stocks  Zacks Ranks  4 and 5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Stocks to Consider
While earnings beat looks uncertain for Southern Company  here are some firms from the utilities space you may want to consider on the basis of our model  which shows that they have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter 
Ameren Corp    NYSE AEE   has an Earnings ESP of  2 90  and a Zacks Rank  2  The partnership is expected to release earnings results on Nov 4  You can see  
CMS Energy Corp    NYSE CMS   has an Earnings ESP of  3 33  and a Zacks Rank  2  The company is likely to release earnings on Oct 27 
American Water Works Company Inc    NYSE AWK   has an Earnings ESP of  2 00  and a Zacks Rank  2  The partnership is anticipated to release earnings on Nov 2

139398,360913,AEE,Ameren  AEE  Enters Overbought Territory,opinion,"Ameren Corporation   NYSE AEE   has moved higher as of late  but there could definitely be trouble on the horizon for this company  That is because AEE is now in overbought territory with an RSI value of 73 13 
What is RSI  
RSI stands for  Relative Strength Index  and it is a popular indicator used by technically focused investors  It compares the average of gains in days that closed up to the average of losses in days that closed down  readings above 70 suggest an asset is overbought  while an RSI below 30 suggests undervalued conditions are present 
Other Factors
Yet AEE s high RSI value isn t the only reason for investors to be concerned  as there has been some decidedly negative earnings estimate revisions in Ameren s stock as of late  This is especially true when investors dive into some of these revisions in order to get a better picture of AEE s prospects for the near term 
Over the past two months  investors have witnessed 2 earnings estimate revisions lower compared to none higher for the current year  The consensus estimate for AEE has also been on a downward trend over the same time period too  as the estimate has fallen from  2 51 share two months ago to just  2 50 share today 
If this wasn t enough  Ameren also has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell which puts it into unfortunate company among its peers  So  given all of these factors  investors may want to consider exiting this stock now before it falls back to Earth
