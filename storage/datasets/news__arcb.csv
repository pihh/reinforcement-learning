Investment Research Pick These 5 Low P CF to Garner Superior ReturnsInvestors always try to hit the jackpot while picking stocks  But striking the right chord each time is not easy unless you are blessed with Midas touch When it comes to the investment market  experts consider value style as one of the most effective approaches  In value investing  investors pick stocks that are cheap but fundamentally sound  So  the chance of outperformance is high when the market moves higher There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock s inherent strength but a random selection of ratios cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company s financial position  For this  we recommend Price to Cash Flow  or P CF  as one of the key metrics  This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per share basis   the lower the number  the better Price to Cash Flow Reveals Financial Health Questions may arise as to why we are considering the Price to Cash Flow valuation metric  when the most widely used metric is Price Earnings  or P E   Well  what makes P CF stand out is that operating cash flow adds back non cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income  truly reflecting the financial health of a company Analysts caution that a company s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  However  cash flow is reliable  It is net cash flow that reveals how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is putting the same to use A positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company s liquid assets  This gives the company the means to settle debt  shell out for its expenses  reinvest in its business  endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders  Then again  a negative cash flow implies a decline in the company s liquidity  which in turn lowers its flexibility to support

7364,228879,ARCB,Pick These 5 Low P CF Stocks To Garner Superior Returns,opinion,Investors always try to hit the jackpot while picking stocks  But striking the right chord each time is not easy unless you are blessed with Midas touch When it comes to the investment market  experts consider value style as one of the most effective approaches  In value investing  investors pick stocks that are cheap but fundamentally sound  So  the chance of outperformance is high when the market moves higher There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock s inherent strength but a random selection of ratios cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company s financial position  For this  we recommend Price to Cash Flow  or P CF  as one of the key metrics  This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per share basis   the lower the number  the better Price to Cash Flow Reveals Financial Health Questions may arise as to why we are considering the Price to Cash Flow valuation metric  when the most widely used metric is Price Earnings  or P E   Well  what makes P CF stand out is that operating cash flow adds back non cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income  truly reflecting the financial health of a company Analysts caution that a company s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  However  cash flow is reliable  It is net cash flow that reveals how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is putting the same to use A positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company s liquid assets  This gives the company the means to settle debt  shell out for its expenses  reinvest in its business  endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders  Then again  a negative cash flow implies a decline in the company s liquidity  which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves What s the Best Strategy However  an investment decision solely based on the P CF metric may not fetch the desired results  To identify stocks that are trading at a discount  you should expand your search criteria and consider price to book  price to earnings and price to sales ratios  Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a  of A or B to your search criteria should give you even better results as they eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap Here are the parameters for selecting true value stocks P CF less than or equal to X Industry Median Price greater than or equal to 5  The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher Average 20 Day Volume greater than 100 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable P E using  F1  less than or equal to X Industry Median  This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to its peers P B less than or equal to X Industry Median  A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain P S less than or equal to X Industry Median  The P S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company s sales   the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is PEG less than 1  The ratio is used to determine a stock s value by taking the company s earnings growth into account  PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P E ratio  A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospect Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment Value Score of less than or equal to B  Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential  Here are five of the 19 stocks that qualified the screening American Axle   Manufacturing Holdings  Inc    NYSE AXL    which designs  engineers  validates  and manufactures driveline  metal forming  powertrain  and casting products  sports a Zacks Rank  1  It has an expected EPS growth

7371,228886,ARCB,Time To Invest In The Transportation Sector ,opinion,"Earnings season is a good time to rethink your investments because that s when companies tell you how the current environment affects them  how they are adapting  whether they see growth slowing or picking up  and so forth  Such guidance is particularly important this earnings season as the U S  and China are yet to come to an understanding on trade  global trade shrinks  partly impacted by the slowdown in China  which is the lowest in 28 years  even as other international issues like the Brexit adds to uncertainties 
This doesn t make for the most encouraging backdrop for the transportation sector  which essentially depends on the volume of trade and travel within the country and outside 
The sector  which can broadly be discussed under the airline  rail  shipping  truck and services industries is therefore tied to macro factors like GDP growth  industrial production  construction volumes and trade  as well as consumer demand 
Airlines
The Transportation   Airlines group  Zacks Rank 7 out of 250   or top 3   has underperformed the S P 500 over the past year  losing 23 6  compared to the S P s 7 0  decline 

 
But results and analyst estimates haven t deteriorated as much 
Of the four companies that have reported quarterly results this quarter  all have topped analyst expectations 
The earnings estimates for the Dec 2018 and Mar 2019 quarters are up 10 9  and 4 6  in the last 12 months 
Since the volume of business and leisure travel  as well as available capacity determine the load factor  consumer confidence and disposable income play a big role in revenue generation 
The U S  consumer sentiment for Jan 2019 of 90 7 fell from 98 3 in December to 90 7    because of fears regarding the domestic economy    compared to market expectation of 97   While down from recent highs  it remains positive   BofA CEO Moynihan says that based on the company s credit card and bank account information  consumer spending is increasing at 5 6  now and although it was stronger earlier  it is far from negative 
A big positive is the slump in oil prices  which is bringing down operational cost 
There are a large number of buy ranked stocks here  AZUL SA   NYSE AZUL    Air France   KLM   OTC AFLYY   and Spirit Airlines   NYSE SAVE   have a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   while Alaska Airlines  ALK   Allegiant Travel Company  ALGT   American Airlines  AAL   Delta Airlines  NYSE DAL  and Jet Blue  JBLU  are some of the Zacks Rank  2  Buy  stocks 
Rail
The Transportation   Rail group  Zacks Rank 88 out of 250   or top 35   has outperformed the S P 500 over the past year  gaining 9 4  

 
Results have been less than spectacular so far this quarter with one out of three companies that have reported results beating estimates  The good thing is that there also haven t been any misses yet 
There is almost no change in December and March quarter estimates in the last 12 months 
Since agricultural produce  metals  construction material and fuel  such as coal  are all moved within the country and across borders by train  the sector is impacted by things like GDP growth  manufacturing growth  construction spending and agricultural production 
Smooth cross border trade also helps  especially since trade volume with the country s closest neighbors is very high  So the resolution of conflict between the U S   Mexico and Canada and the renegotiation of NAFTA under the new United States Mexico Canada Agreement  USMCA  is a big positive 
GDP growth  which is hovering around 3   could fall to zero in the seasonally softer first quarter because of the government shutdown  but according to White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett  this would lead to a 4 5  growth number in the following quarter once operations resume  So the softness in the growth number isn t related to underlying weakness in the economy 
In December the Federal Reserve slightly lowered its GDP growth estimate for 2019 from 2 5  to 2 3  while raising long term expectations from 1 8  to 1 9   What s more  unemployment rates are expected to remain low at under 4  through 2021 
The ISM report for Dec 2018 shows slowing growth in PMI  new orders  production  employment and prices  At the same time  because of caution at customers  which are maintaining very low inventory levels   supplier deliveries are slowing down and inventories are growing at a slower rate to maintain a steady backlog 
All this goes to show that there is a lot of caution at both customers and manufacturers despite the still expanding economy  A scenario where we ship to consumption is healthy in any situation and enables a quick pullback 
There are uncertainties in the construction market  which has seen decelerating growth for around 2 years following several years of double digit growth  This year  growth should have been about even  but tariffs and trade wars are adding pressure  Likewise for agricultural production 
Trade war concerns mean that the segment will be worth another look after the March 2 deadline 
Shipping
The Transportation   Shipping group  Zacks Rank 106 out of 250   or top 42   has mostly underperformed the S P 500 over the past year  losing 20 8  

 
But results are likely to meet or exceed lowered analyst expectations as a fallout of the trade war and fears of shrinking global growth and trade 
The only company that has reported results this quarter has topped analyst expectations 
The earnings estimates for the Dec 2018 and Mar 2019 quarters have both dropped substantially in the last 12 months 
So let s see what experts have to say about international trade this year 
The International Monetary Fund  IMF  lowered its growth outlook slightly for 2019 and 2020  It now expects global growth of 3 5  in 2019 and 3 6  in 2020  previous 3 7  for both years  
China s slowing growth rate is also a concern  its GDP grew 6 6  in 2018 and December quarter growth of 6 4  means that further deceleration is in the cards 
The World Bank also points to slightly slower growth this year that may however be adjusted if trade war concerns alleviate  It s current forecast for global growth in 2019 is 2 9   down from 3  in 2018  with advanced economies growing 2  and emerging economies 4 2   It expects U S  to grow 2 5  this year  down from 2 9  in 2018  China is expected to grow 6 2  this year  down from 6 5  in 2018 
Another factor impacting trade this year is Brexit  which goes into effect at the end of March  As a result  the cost of trade between the UK and EU countries could increase and trade volumes could be impacted     
Despite the gloom and doom predicted for the year  it s worth nothing that even a slightly slower growth rate is still a growth rate  and far from zero 
Besides  there s one section of the shipping industry that is focused on crude oil and LNG  both of which will remain steady  especially given currently low oil prices 
Shipbroker Banchero Costa sees continually increasing rates for LNG shipping in particular  The prices will be driven by strong demand and relatively limited supply as the complexities of liquefying natural gas before shipping make capacity addition difficult 
Recent capacity additions helped growth rates swell from the 10 year average of around 5  to 7 5  in 2016  9 9  in 2017 and an estimated 10  in 2018  Moreover  although not among the top suppliers like Australia and Qatar  the U S  has entered the market in a big way  with shipments up 58  in 2017  So opportunities abound 
There are a large number of buy ranked stocks here  KNOT Offshore Partners LP   NYSE KNOP   and Ship Finance International Ltd   have a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   while Dorian LPG Ltd    Frontline Ltd   FRO   GasLog LP    NYSE GLOG    Navios Maritime Acquisition Corp   and Nordic American Tankers Limited  are some of the Zacks Rank  2 stocks 
Truck
The Transportation   Truck group  Zacks Rank 107 out of 250   or top 42   has underperformed the S P 500 over the past year  losing 18 2

7373,228888,ARCB,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  KNOT Offshore  Ship Finance  ArcBest And Heartland,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL  January 28  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  KNOT Offshore Partners LP   NYSE KNOP    Ship Finance International Ltd    NYSE SFL    ArcBest Corporation   NASDAQ ARCB   and Heartland Express  Inc    NASDAQ HTLD   Here are highlights from Friday s Analyst Blog  Time to Invest in the Transportation SectorEarnings season is a good time to rethink your investments because that s when companies tell you how the current environment affects them  how they are adapting  whether they see growth slowing or picking up  and so forth  Such guidance is particularly important this earnings season as the U S  and China are yet to come to an understanding on trade  global trade shrinks  partly impacted by the slowdown in China  which is the lowest in 28 years  even as other international issues like the Brexit adds to uncertainties This doesn t make for the most encouraging backdrop for the transportation sector  which essentially depends on the volume of trade and travel within the country and outside The sector  which can broadly be discussed under the airline  rail  shipping  truck and services industries is therefore tied to macro factors like GDP growth  industrial production  construction volumes and trade  as well as consumer demand AirlinesThe Transportation   Airlines group  Zacks Rank 7 out of 250   or top 3   has underperformed the S P 500 over the past year  losing 23 6  compared to the S P s 7 0  decline But results and analyst estimates haven t deteriorated as much Of the four companies that have reported quarterly results this quarter  all have topped analyst expectations The earnings estimates for the Dec 2018 and Mar 2019 quarters are up 10 9  and 4 6  in the last 12 months Since the volume of business and leisure travel  as well as available capacity determine the load factor  consumer confidence and disposable income play a big role in revenue generation The U S  consumer sentiment for Jan 2019 of 90 7 fell from 98 3 in December to 90 7    because of fears regarding the domestic economy    compared to market expectation of 97   While down from recent highs  it remains positive   BofA CEO Moynihan says that based on the company s credit card and bank account information  consumer spending is increasing at 5 6  now and although it was stronger earlier  it is far from negative A big positive is the slump in oil prices  which is bringing down operational cost RailThe Transportation   Rail group  Zacks Rank 88 out of 250   or top 35   has outperformed the S P 500 over the past year  gaining 9 4  Results have been less than spectacular so far this quarter with one out of three companies that have reported results beating estimates  The good thing is that there also haven t been any misses yet There is almost no change in December and March quarter estimates in the last 12 months Since agricultural produce  metals  construction material and fuel  such as coal  are all moved within the country and across borders by train  the sector is impacted by things like GDP growth  manufacturing growth  construction spending and agricultural production Smooth cross border trade also helps  especially since trade volume with the country s closest neighbors is very high  So the resolution of conflict between the U S   Mexico and Canada and the renegotiation of NAFTA under the new United States Mexico Canada Agreement  USMCA  is a big positive GDP growth  which is hovering around 3   could fall to zero in the seasonally softer first quarter because of the government shutdown  but according to White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett  this would lead to a 4 5  growth number in the following quarter once operations resume  So the softness in the growth number isn t related to underlying weakness in the economy In December the Federal Reserve slightly lowered its GDP growth estimate for 2019 from 2 5  to 2 3  while raising long term expectations from 1 8  to 1 9   What s more  unemployment rates are expected to remain low at under 4  through 2021 The ISM report for Dec 2018 shows slowing growth in PMI  new orders  production  employment and prices  At the same time  because of caution at customers  which are maintaining very low inventory levels   supplier deliveries are slowing down and inventories are growing at a slower rate to maintain a steady backlog All this goes to show that there is a lot of caution at both customers and manufacturers despite the still expanding economy  A scenario where we ship to consumption is healthy in any situation and enables a quick pullback There are uncertainties in the construction market  which has seen decelerating growth for around 2 years following several years of double digit growth  This year  growth should have been about even  but tariffs and trade wars are adding pressure  Likewise for agricultural production Trade war concerns mean that the segment will be worth another look after the March 2 deadline ShippingThe Transportation   Shipping group  Zacks Rank 106 out of 250   or top 42   has mostly underperformed the S P 500 over the past year  losing 20 8  But results are likely to meet or exceed lowered analyst expectations as a fallout of the trade war and fears of shrinking global growth and trade The only company that has reported results this quarter has topped analyst expectations The earnings estimates for the Dec 2018 and Mar 2019 quarters have both dropped substantially in the last 12 months So let s see what experts have to say about international trade this year The International Monetary Fund  IMF  lowered its growth outlook slightly for 2019 and 2020  It now expects global growth of 3 5  in 2019 and 3 6  in 2020  previous 3 7  for both years  China s slowing growth rate is also a concern  its GDP grew 6 6  in 2018 and December quarter growth of 6 4  means that further deceleration is in the cards The World Bank also points to slightly slower growth this year that may however be adjusted if trade war concerns alleviate  It s current forecast for global growth in 2019 is 2 9   down from 3  in 2018  with advanced economies growing 2  and emerging economies 4 2   It expects U S  to grow 2 5  this year  down from 2 9  in 2018  China is expected to grow 6 2  this year  down from 6 5  in 2018 Another factor impacting trade this year is Brexit  which goes into effect at the end of March  As a result  the cost of trade between the UK and EU countries could increase and trade volumes could be impacted     Despite the gloom and doom predicted for the year  it s worth nothing that even a slightly slower growth rate is still a growth rate  and far from zero Besides  there s one section of the shipping industry that is focused on crude oil and LNG  both of which will remain steady  especially given currently low oil prices Shipbroker Banchero Costa sees continually increasing rates for LNG shipping in particular  The prices will be driven by strong demand and relatively limited supply as the complexities of liquefying natural gas before shipping make capacity addition difficult Recent capacity additions helped growth rates swell from the 10 year average of around 5  to 7 5  in 2016  9 9  in 2017 and an estimated 10  in 2018  Moreover  although not among the top suppliers like Australia and Qatar  the U S  has entered the market in a big way  with shipments up 58  in 2017  So opportunities abound There are definitely  buy ranked stocks here  KNOT Offshore Partners LP and Ship Finance International Ltd  have a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  TruckThe Transportation   Truck group  Zacks Rank 107 out of 250

7384,228899,ARCB,Seagate  STX  To Report Q2 Earnings  Disappointment In Store ,opinion,"Seagate Technology Plc   NASDAQ STX   is scheduled to release second quarter fiscal 2019 results on Feb 4 The company has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters  recording average positive surprise of 8 6  Seagate delivered first quarter fiscal 2019 non GAAP earnings per share of  1 70 per share  which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 55 per share  The figure also improved 96 cents from the year ago period and 4 9  sequentially Revenues of  2 992 billion outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 959 billion and also improved 13 7  from the year ago quarter and 5 5  sequentially Both the top and bottom line witnessed year over year improvement  driven by robust adoption on account of strong demand of Seagate s storage drives  Moreover  increasing traction for mass storage solutions across the company s edge and enterprise markets remained a tailwind  Notably  exabyte shipments during the reported quarter increased 41  year over year Seagate Technology PLC Price and EPS Surprise
    Guidance   EstimatesManagement anticipates second quarter revenues to be in the range of  2 7 billion to  2 75 billion   The corresponding Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at  2 74 billion  representing a decrease of approximately 5 9  from the year ago quarter Seagate projects gross margins to be at the lower point of the company s long term range of 29 33   primarily owing to lower than expected demand for nearline HDDs For second quarter fiscal 2019  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at  1 27 per share  indicating a decline of 14 2  from the year ago quarter Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement Challenges Faced by SeagateSeagate is the second largest manufacturer of hard disk drives  HDDs  in the United States  The company is facing challenges owing to NAND flash pricing  which is currently on the decline on account of oversupply and weaker than expected growth in end market demand  Consequently  a drop in prices could impact the company  and may offset the benefits from improved demand and prices of DRAM products Moreover  Seagate faces stiff competition from Hitachi  Samsung  KS 005930  and Intel   NASDAQ INTC   in the storage market Additionally  ballooning debt levels have been plaguing Seagate for some time now   At the end of first quarter fiscal 2019  net debt amounted to  2 88 billion  Moreover  any downturn in macroeconomic and foreign exchange volatility conditions is likely to make it difficult for the company to pay or refinance debts  going ahead Further  frequent management changes  though made with an intention of a turnaround  is raising skepticism PCs remain the greatest users of HDDs and Seagatestill derives the bulk of its revenues from these devices  According to the recently released worldwide PC shipment data by Gartner and IDC  even the back to school season failed to lift the PC market  Per Gartner s preliminary data  PC shipments in the fourth quarter of 2018 fell 4 3  year over year to 68 6 million units  Going by IDC  worldwide PC shipment also dipped 3 7  on a year over year basis and totaled 68 1 million in the final quarter  A declining trend in PC shipments is detrimental to business prospects of Seagate  which continues to depend substantially on PC sales Product Rollouts to Aid SeagateSeagate kicked off the year by showcasing latest data storage solutions at CES 2019  The company expanded LaCie family by unveiling LaCie Mobile Drive and LaCie Mobile SSD  which it anticipates shipping by end of January In a bid to offer sturdy backup solutions  Seagate debuts Backup Plus family with Backup Plus Slim  Backup Plus Portable and Backup Plus Ultra Touch  Moreover  Seagate unveiled FireCuda 510 PCIe NVMe SSD  which is tailor made for gaming enthusiasts Seagate also unveiled IronWolf 110 SATA SSD custom made SSD for Network Attached Storage   NAS   appliances to primarily target enterprise customers and business professionals We believe this move is in sync with company s attempt to capitalize on growing HDD requirement  The company s expanding portfolio will not only bolster the top line in the to be reported quarter but also strengthen its competitive position against Western Digital  NASDAQ WDC  Anticipating a potential acceleration in cloud deployments  due to exponential growth in data storage in the cloud   Seagate is investing heavily in order to deliver high capacity storage devices that would support expansion of cloud infrastructure and cloud applications Moreover  increasing traction for mass storage solutions across the company s edge and enterprise markets is a tailwind What Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model  a company with Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  along with a positive  has a good chance of beating estimates  The Sell rated stocks  Zacks Rank  4 or 5  are best avoided Seagate has a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  and an Earnings ESP of  3 15   You can uncover the best

Earnings History
I see an OK earnings history with two beat and two misses over the last four quarters   In the end  the beats were not as big as the misses  but on the whole  the company is profitable 
Estimate Revisions
The recent revision have been positive  with the FY 2020 now looking at  0 49 which is up from  0 44   The next year s number is at  0 51  which is also up five cents over the last 30 days 
Valuation
I really like the valuation here  with the 14x forward PE and 16x trailing number   The topline growth is just around double digits   The price to book multiple of 1 3x is very low  but so is the 0 4x price to sales multiple   I see margins are improving so the valuation is a good one 
 
May was a tough month for stocks across the board   It was even worse to stocks that missed earnings in that month and that is just what happened to ArcBest Corp   Following the earnings miss  the stock has fallen to a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  and is now the Bear of the Day 
Description
ArcBest Corporation provides freight transportation services and solutions  The company s Freight Transportation segment offers transportation of general commodities  motor carrier freight transportation services  business to business air transportation services  ocean transport services  global customizable supply chain solutions and integrated warehousing services 
Its Premium Logistics   Expedited Freight Services segment provides expedited freight transportation services to commercial and government customers  premium logistics services  and domestic and international freight transportation with air  ocean  and ground service  ArcBest Corporation  formerly known as Arkansas Best Corporation  is headquartered in Fort Smith  Arkansas 
Earnings History
Back on May 2  the company reported earnings that were below expectations   The total sales of  711 8M was still an increase of 1 7  on an annual basis  but still below the  724M consensus estimate   
It is important to note that while the muiss of 13 cents was a 43  negative earnings surprise  it was the first miss over the last four quarters 
Estimate Revisions
Following the miss  the estimates for 2019 dropped   The Zacks Consensus Estimate moved from  3 69 to  3 38 over the last 60 days   Similarly  the  Zacks Consensus Estimate for next year slipped from  3 84 to  3 57 over the same time horizon 
Research Support
A couple of weeks ago I saw a research note come out suggested that there would not be a freight recession  That same note highlighted ARCB among others as a solid investment oppotunity as most of the names in the group were trading below historic multiples 
A call like that takes some guts as the broader market continues to worry about what a trade war might do to transportation names

Antitrust Investigations Hit Silicon Valley   Again
Alphabet Inc  and Amazon com Inc  stocks opened Monday down big  with Amazon down 3  and Google down over 6   Both companies are facing speculation of an antitrust investigation  The U S  Department of Justice is reportedly going after Google  while the Federal Trade Commission is trying to tackle Amazon and Facebook  Amazon closed the day down around 5  while Alphabet closed around  6 5  
Meanwhile  Facebook is just now nearing the end of the Cambridge Analytica scandal and will be paying  3 5 billion for its privacy violations based on reports  Facebook opened Monday down 3  amid the concerns around other tech giants and closed the day down around 7  as the FTC will reportedly be including Facebook in their antitrust investigation 
DOJ Investigation
Alphabet s subsidiary Google is under pressure as the DOJ looks to open an investigation into  Google s business practices related to its search and other businesses   as first reported by the Wall Street Journal  With Alphabet being the tech power that it is  it s hard to know exactly what the DOJ is set to look into 
Many of the worries seem to be focused on Google s collection of search data and control of the digital advertising market  Google s search engine currently claims about 75  of the worldwide search engine market share for desktops and that number is even higher for mobile and tablet devices  Google also made up 38  of the digital advertising market in 2018  17  more than its closest competitor  Facebook 
Google has faced many investigations in the past  paying out billions to the European Commission over the past few years  The FTC has also previously investigated Google  which ended with Google agreeing to pay a  22 5 million fine after denying any guilt 
FTC Investigation
The Federal Trade Commission has started the first steps of an investigation into Amazon  There is no clear sign of what the FTC will be specifically looking into  but Amazon s control in the online retail sector has always been an area of concern for politicians  This  coupled with its growing influence in multiple markets  make it a prime target 
Amazon is also currently under investigation by the European Union who believe Amazon may be stifling competition due to its size  As seen with the previous Google investigation  the European Union is not afraid to fine these big tech companies in the name of consumer protection  The EU also tends to be significantly stricter than the US when it comes to regulation of these large companies 
Facebook was added to the investigation after initial reports were focused on just Amazon and Google  The investigation into Facebook will focus on whether or not it stifles competition and has acted in an unlawful and monopolistic nature  This comes on the back of an FTC investigation regarding privacy issues and Facebook s user data collection  
Public Pressure
These investigations come after the companies and tech giants as a whole have come under bipartisan pressure from government officials  President Trump  backed by other Republicans  has accused Google of having biased search results and has had something of a personal feud with Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos 
Meanwhile  Democrats have concentrated on whether or not these tech giants cut off competition  Antitrust regulation has become a main focus of Democratic Sen  Elizabeth Warren s 2020 presidential campaign and her thoughts have been echoed by Sen  Amy Klobuchar and Sen  Bernie Sanders  With this much support behind the investigations  it could prove troublesome for the companies 
This investigation is just in the very early days and although the government pressure is large  all these companies have large legal teams and resources at their disposal so it is nothing to be overly worried about at the moment  but should be watched as it continues to progress

7390,228905,ARCB,Alphabet  ArcBest  Workday  ServiceNow And Splunk Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   October 18  2019    Shares of Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL    NASDAQ GOOG   as the Bull of the Day  ArcBest   NASDAQ ARCB   asthe Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Workday   NASDAQ WDAY    ServiceNow   NYSE NOW   and Splunk   NASDAQ SPLK   Here is a synopsis of all five stocks  Sometimes the Bull of the Day is a stock that s off the beaten path  It s a small  up and coming name that many folks weren t aware of  Today s Bull is not one of those stocks  Rather  today s Bull is a huge company that I m sure you interact with on a daily basis  In fact  you re probably using one or two of there products right now as you re reading this  Care to venture a guess  I m talking about Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  Alphabet  The company formerly known as Google provides online advertising services in the United States  Europe  the Middle East  Africa  the Asia Pacific  Canada  and Latin America  It offers performance and brand advertising services  The company operates through Google and Other Bets segments  The Google segment offers products  such as Ads  Android  Chrome  Google Cloud  Google Maps  Google Play  Hardware  Search  and YouTube  as well as technical infrastructure  This segment also offers digital content  cloud services  hardware devices  and other miscellaneous products and services  The Other Bets segment includes businesses  including Access  Calico  CapitalG  GV  Verily  Waymo  and X  as well as Internet and television services The reason for the favorable Zacks Rank lies in the series of earnings estimate revisions coming in to the upside recently  Over the last month  analysts have upped their earnings estimates for the current quarter  next quarter and current year  Those bullish moves have pushed up our Zacks Consensus Estimates for the current year from  48 57 to  49 33 while next year s number has shot up from  54 32 to  56 14 Even with these bullish moves to the upside  Alphabet has a tendency to surprise analysts with its earnings report  Last quarter  EPS came in at  14 21  far surpassing expectations calling for  11 49  That amounted to a 23 67  surprise  The quarter before that  Alphabet beat by 12 58   The company s next report is set to hit the wires after the bell Monday October 28th  Analysts are looking for  12 55 out of the report  That would be a year over year EPS contraction of 3 91   When looking for the next Bear of the Day I often look at the weakest stocks in the weakest industries  I don t mean weakest in terms of price action  but rather  stocks and industries with weak earnings trends  A stock s price can change on a dime for no reason at all  But a stock s earnings trend  that takes weeks  even months to develop  Stocks with negative earnings trends can be stuck in those trends for a long time  especially when there is weakness in the overall industry Today s Bear of the Day is one of those stocks with a weak trend in a weak industry  I m talking about Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  ArcBest  ArcBest Corporation provides freight transportation services and integrated logistics solutions worldwide  It operates through three segments  Asset Based  ArcBest  and FleetNet  The Asset Based segment transports general commodities  such as food  textiles  apparel  furniture  appliances  chemicals  nonbulk petroleum products  rubber  plastics  metal and metal products  wood  glass  automotive parts  machinery  and miscellaneous manufactured products through less than truckload services  It also offers motor carrier freight transportation services to customers in Mexico through arrangements with trucking companies  The ArcBest segment provides expedite freight transportation services to commercial and government customers  premium logistics services  such as deployment of specialized equipment to meet linehaul requirements  and international freight transportation with air  ocean  and ground services The Transportation   Truck industry sits down in the Bottom 11  of our Zacks Industry Rank  The trade war has a lot to do with that  Just because the US and China have agreed on Phase One of their trade agreement does not mean that all economic problems are fixed  It will take months for the backlog to work itself though the economic system  This industry could be under pressure for a long time  ArcBest earnings have been under pressure as well  Over the last sixty days  seven analysts have cut their earnings estimates for the current year and next year  The bearish sentiment has dropped our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year from  3 25 down to  2 77  Next year s number has come down from  3 46 to  3 01 Additional content Did Rain in the Cloud Market Create a Buying Opportunity Workday s disappointing analyst day sent fear rippling through the sector  punishing cloud stocks throughout the market  The company maintained its full year guidance but hinted at topline deceleration  Signs of a topline slowdown for a firm that sports such hefty valuation multiples was a red flag for investors  WDAY plummeted over 11  yesterday and continues to decline in morning trading The double digit revenue multiples that these cloud stocks have been donning may be in excess of what they are worth  Valuation concerns have been haunting stocks and investors alike in the second half of this year as the markets attempt to correct any overly rich multiples This broader cloud decline driven by Workday concerns is overplayed for a couple of reasons One  the cloud industry can t be so easily lumped together as the space is incredibly heterogeneous  with the only real similarity being the way the products are deployed  Workday s primary product offering is its cloud based human capital management or HCM  though it offers some other enterprise software solutions   Cloud based HCM is a particular enterprise cloud segment that doesn t necessarily have any correlation with the broader category  There were other company specific concerns like acquisition delays and deceleration due to substantial market penetration Workdays management team is also in question having missed on 4 of the last 5 quarterly EPS estimates  Management is either not doing an adequate job communicating to analysts or management themselves are surprised by the results  Either way  this demonstrates a management team that doesn t effectively communicate to the public  The guidance that was presented at WDAY s analyst meeting may have been ill advised I believe that this dip in the cloud market has created a buying opportunity for a few well positioned players ServiceNow ServiceNow fell over 7  yesterday in reaction to the concerns that WDAY s management team instilled into the cloud segment  ServiceNow was hit hard by Workday s slip due to similarity in size and marginally similar product offering Both are pureplay enterprise cloud platforms  but ServiceNow has a stronger outlook and a savvy management team that has been able to beat its expectations consistently  NOW has bounced a bit from yesterday s dive  trading up marginally in morning trade ServiceNow started as an IT workflow cloud to improve IT service management  Today the Now Platform  is a single cloud platform that encompasses IT  employee  and customer workflows Since NOW s IPO back in 2012  the company has demonstrated consistent quarter over quarter topline growth and year over year growth that hasn t faltered below 30   The firm is profitable but has been toeing the line for the last year and a half  None the less  it has proven it can turn a profit even with its remarkable growth rate NOW is trading at a forward P S multiple of 11 3x  which is on the lower side of its YTD range  10x   14x   This stock has returned shareholders 43  so far in 2019  despite its pullback yesterday  NOW looks to have short term potential as it bounces off its 200 day moving average  green   which has been held as a reasonably reliable support level in the past  NOW is well positioned for a long term play for your portfolio of the future  Yesterday s cloud fiasco created a buying opportunity for this enterprise cloud leader Splunk This stock has been trading in my buy range since its last earnings release at the end of August  SPLK beat both top and bottom estimates but took a substantial hit due to its announced  1 billion acquisition of SignalFx  I believe investors  concern was overstated  SignalFx further builds out the firm s cloud offering  creating an enormous amount of synergies between the two firms I was able to buy shares as this stock bottomed out in September  and yesterday s rain in the cloud segment has created yet another point of entry for this leading cloud player Splunk is a platform that helps companies utilize real time machine data for collection  indexing  and alerts  allowing companies to uncover actionable insight from this data no matter the source or format  The company is also leveraging AI and machining learning for forecasting and anticipative decision making The company has shown strong growth figures  consistently propelling its topline over 30  year over year  SPLK has only returned investors 8  YTD due to its recent acquisitions Splunk has been aggressively buying up companies to quickly build out its product offering with 8 purchases since the beginning of 2017  The acquisitions typically have an initial negative impact on SPLK  but the stock always bounces back Workday and Splunk are both enterprise cloud firms but provide very different product offerings  Splunk s real time machine data management provides companies with a very niche capability  This capability is becoming crucial in business  with speed being the competitive component  Splunk is in a growing market and has a significant amount of long term potential The slide in share price yesterday pushed SPLK down to a 6 5x forward P S  which I am quite comfortable with  This is on the lowest side of stock s 5 year P S trend  ranging from 10x   15x   This stock is a buy for me at any price below  120 Take AwayWorkday s analyst meeting soured the entire cloud market when the concerns were primarily company specific  The rainfall in the cloud market was overdone  and I expect to see some precipitated returns back to highs in some of the well positioned cloud players 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 DaysJust released

present in the market  Apart from this  the complexities related to the stock market make it even more difficult for individual investors to select outperformers in their portfolios without proper

21585,243100,ARCB,Teamsters step up union drive at FedEx Freight  Con way,news,"By Nick Carey CHICAGO  Reuters    After years of failed efforts  the Teamsters union has won a toehold in the trucking units of FedEx and Con way and is targeting more facilities at both  potentially threatening what analysts see as a core competitive advantage for the companies 
The push by the Teamsters comes as a shortage of experienced drivers in the trucking industry is prompting companies to hike pay and offer improved working conditions 
The International Brotherhood Teamsters  which represents 1 4 million workers and is one of North America s most powerful unions  has long tried to unionize workers at FedEx Corp and last month won votes to have union representation at two local FedEx Freight facilities out of three holding secret ballots 
Five ballots are scheduled at FedEx Freight facilities this month  with the next due on Nov  12 in Newark  New Jersey 
With the exception of its pilots  FedEx s workforce is non unionized  While pay for its drivers is above that of some competitors  its larger rival United Parcel Service Inc pays its unionized drivers more  and FedEx has higher profit margins 
The Teamsters also won two out of four recent ballots at Con way Freight  part of Con way Inc  which according to industry estimates pays slightly more than FedEx but less than UPS 
The Teamsters declined to comment for this article 
The expanding U S  economy has driven up freight demand at a time when older truckers are retiring and fewer new drivers are signing up  That shortage hurts long haul truckers more than less than truckload operators like FedEx Freight and Con way Freight  which fill up trucks with smaller orders from multiple customers  But it has forced up pay across the industry 
In April  FedEx announced pay increases for 19 000 FedEx Freight drivers at the unit s 360 facilities  effective October 
 Drivers and dock workers currently have the ball in their court  and it may be there for a long while   Cowen   Co analyst Jason Seidl said in an Oct  30 client note  adding Con way s battle against the Teamsters could weigh on its results short term 
FedEx Freight accounted for  5 8 billion of FedEx s  45 6 billion fiscal 2014 revenue  while Con way Freight contributed  3 5 billion of Con way s  5 5 billion revenue in 2013 
Both companies are fighting the unionization effort  After the Teamsters scored wins against Con way  one in September and one in October  the company filed objections to the ballots with the National Labor Relations Board claiming the union intimidated workers  and emphasizes the union s victories affect only two out of around 300 facilities 
 We don t believe we need a third party between ourselves and our employees   Con way Chief Executive Officer Doug Stotlar told analysts in an Oct  31 conference call 
FedEx has said it is weighing an appeal with the NLRB against the most recent vote in favor of union representation on Oct  31 at a facility in New Jersey 
While gains have so far been small   there are only about 150 drivers at the FedEx Freight facilities where the Teamsters won ballots   the union said on its website other campaigns were under way 
 The aim here appears to be to unionize an entire sector   said Dan Cornfield  a Vanderbilt University labor analyst 
But it could be an uphill struggle 
According to data compiled by industry expert SJ Consulting Group Inc  as of July this year Con way Freight drivers made  24 75 an hour  while FedEx Freight drivers earned  24 40  Among unionized companies  wages at ArcBest Corp were  23 17 and  21 10 at YRC Worldwide Inc 
Unionized truckers at UPS Freight make an estimated  26 65 
SJ Consulting founder Satish Jindel said the Teamsters will likely face difficulty persuading FedEx Freight and Con way Freight drivers that collective bargaining is a boon when two major unionized carriers pay less 

 FedEx Freight and Con way are seasoned campaigners  as they have been fighting unionization for decades   he said   They are not going to be easy targets for the Teamsters

21657,243172,ARCB,Solid Relative Price Strength Add Luster To These 5 Stocks,opinion,Investors generally gauge a stock s potential returns by examining earnings growth and valuation multiples  At the same time  it s important to measure the performance of such a stock relative to its industry or peers  or the appropriate benchmark If you see that a stock is underperforming on fundamental factors  then it would be prudent to move on and find a better alternative  However  those outperforming their respective sectors in terms of price should be selected because they stand a better chance to provide considerable returns Then again  it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength  Stocks delivering better than the S P 500 over a period of 1 to 3 months at the least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth and are the best ways to go about this strategy Finally  it is important to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings results of these companies  In order to do this  we have added positive estimate revisions for the current quarter s  Q1  earnings to our screen  When a stock undergoes an upward revision  it leads to additional price gains Screening ParametersRelative   Price change   12 weeks greater than 0Relative

Favorite Stocks to Watch Out ForProper guidance is often the difference between success and failure in life  The same holds true for the investing world  The need for proper guidance is all the more required now as the Q4 earnings season is not too far away  Investors are on the lookout for stocks  which have the potential to surpass earnings expectations in the upcoming reporting cycle  It is a well known fact that earnings beat generally leads to stock price appreciation However  the task of designing one s portfolio with outperformers is by no means an easy one  The uncertainties in the investment world make the task of selecting stocks for handsome returns a daunting one  Moreover  a number of stocks flood the market at any given point in time  In the absence of proper guidance  identifying a winning stock is akin to searching for  a needle in a haystack  for an investor  The proper guidance  in this respect  comes from brokers who are deemed to be experts  equipped with vast knowledge of investing Of the three types of brokers analysts  sell side  buy side and independent  present in the investment world  sell side analysts are most common  Various brokerage firms employ them to provide unbiased opinion to investors after thorough research  Buy side analysts are employed by hedge funds  mutual funds etc  while the independent ones simply sell their reports to investors Be Guided by Earnings Estimate Revisions Broker ratings are backed by sound logic and are by no means arbitrary  Brokers not only scrutinize the publicly available financial documents but also attend company conference calls and other presentations  Naturally  it is in the best interest of investors to pay heed to such well researched information as they aim to generate maximum returns from their portfolio Since brokers closely follow the stocks in their coverage  they revise earnings estimates only after carefully examining the pros and cons of an event for the concerned company  In fact  a rating upgrade or downgrade by brokers has the potential to influence the price of the stock Naturally  when investors see brokers revise estimates or recommendation on a stock  they often assume that there is something that has attracted analysts  attention  In fact  a rating upgrade generally leads to stock price appreciation  Similarly  the price of a stock may plummet following a rating downgrade Estimates can move north for a number of reasons   favorable earnings performance  a bullish guidance  product launch or any favorable macro scenario Ignore the Top Line at Your Own PerilA strategy designed solely on the basis of the bottom line is unlikely to result in a winning strategy  According to many market watchers  a revenue beat is more creditable for a company than a mere earnings outperformance  especially in an environment of revenue weakness due to macroeconomic headwinds like a strong dollar or lackluster demand for travel  which will hurt travel focused companies   To address top line concerns  we have included in our screen the price sales ratio  which serves as a strong complementary valuation metric For the rest of this Screen of the Week article

 Chicago  IL   January 8  2019   Stocks in this week s article include  Tech Data Corp    NASDAQ TECD    ArcBest Corp    NASDAQ ARCB    MetLife  Inc    NYSE MET    Gulfport Energy Corp    NASDAQ GPOR   and Colfax Corp    NYSE CFX    Kevin Matras screens for companies showing their  first  profit and explains why they are ones to watch Screen of the Week written by Kevin Matras of Zacks Investment Research Create a Value Based Portfolio with These Low P CF Stocks 
 Value style is considered one of the best practices when it comes to picking stocks  There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock s inherent strength but a random selection of a ratio cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company s financial position  For this  we would suggest Price to Cash Flow  or P CF  ratio as one of the key metrics  
 This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per share basis   the lower the number  the better  One of the important factors that make P CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income  truly diagnosing the financial health of a company  
 Analysts caution that a company s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  On the other hand  cash flow is reliable  It is net cash flow that unveils how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is deploying the same  
 Positive cash flow indicates an increase in a company s liquid assets  It gives the company the means to settle debt  shell out for its expenses  reinvest in its business  endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders  On the other hand  a negative cash flow implies a decline in the company s liquidity  which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves  
 However  an investment decision solely based on the P CF metric may not fetch the desired results  To identify stocks that are trading at a discount  you should expand your search criteria and also consider price to book ratio  price to earnings ratio and price to sales ratio  Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap

Add Value to Your InvestmentInvestors always try to hit the jackpot while picking stocks  But striking the right chord each time is not easy unless you are blessed with Midas touch When it comes to the investment market  experts consider value style as one of the most effective approaches  In value investing  investors pick stocks that are cheap but fundamentally sound  So  the chance of outperformance is high when the market moves higher There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock s inherent strength but a random selection of ratios cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company s financial position  For this  we recommend Price to Cash Flow  or P CF  as one of the key metrics  This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per share basis   the lower the number  the better Price to Cash Flow Reveals Financial HealthQuestions may arise as to why we are considering the Price to Cash Flow valuation metric  when the most widely used metric is Price Earnings  or P E   Well  what makes P CF stand out is that operating cash flow adds back non cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income  truly reflecting the financial health of a company Analysts caution that a company s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  However  cash flow is reliable  It is net cash flow that reveals how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is putting the same to use A positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company s liquid assets  This gives the company the means to settle debt  shell out for its expenses  reinvest in its business  endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders  Then again  a negative cash flow implies a decline in the company s liquidity  which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves For the rest of this Screen of the Week

21789,243304,ARCB,Create A Standout Portfolio With These 4 Low P CF Stocks,opinion,Warren Buffett once said   It is far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price    The strategy is very simple   find stocks that are trading below their inherent worth Investment in stocks made on diligent value analysis is usually considered one of the best practices  In value investing  investors pick stocks that are cheap but fundamentally sound  So  chances are high that these stocks will allow investors to book profits when the market trends upward There are a number of ratios to identify value stocks but none alone can conclusively determine their inherent potential  Each ratio helps an investor to understand a particular aspect of the company s business  One such ratio  Price to Cash Flow  or P CF   can work wonders in stock picking  if used prudently  This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per share basis   the lower the number  the better Why Price to Cash Flow You must be wondering why we are considering this when the most widely used valuation metric is Price Earnings  or P E   Well  one of the important factors that makes P CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income  truly diagnosing the financial health of a company Analysts caution that a company s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  Then again  cash flow is quite reliable  Net cash flow unveils how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is deploying the same A positive cash flow indicates an increase in the company s liquid assets  This gives the company the means to settle debt  shell out for its expenses  reinvest in its business  endure downturns and finally undertake shareholder friendly moves  On the other hand  a negative cash flow implies a decline in the company s liquidity  which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these endeavors However  an investment decision solely based on the P CF metric may not fetch the desired results  To identify stocks that are trading at a discount  you should expand your search criteria and take into account price to book ratio  price to earnings ratio and price to sales ratio  Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a  of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap The Bargain Hunting StrategyHere are the parameters for selecting true value stocks P CF less than or equal to X Industry Median Price greater than or equal to 5  The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher Average 20 Day Volume greater than 100 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable P E using  F1  less than or equal to X Industry Median  This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to its peers P B less than or equal to X Industry Median  A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain P S less than or equal to X Industry Median  The P S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company s sales   the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is PEG less than 1  The ratio is used to determine a stock s value by taking the company s earnings growth into account  PEG ratio gives a more complete picture than P E ratio  A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospect Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment Value Score of less than or equal to B  Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential  Here are four of the 17 stocks that qualified the screening Daqo New Energy Corp    NYSE DQ   has an expected EPS growth rate of 29  for 3 5 years and pulled off an average positive earnings surprise of 15 3  in the trailing four quarters  The manufacturer and seller of polysilicon and wafers sports a Zacks Rank  1  You can see  ArcBest Corporation   NASDAQ ARCB   has an expected EPS growth rate of 43 3  for 3 5 years and delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 144 6  in the trailing four quarters  This Zacks Rank  2 company provides freight transportation services and integrated logistics solutions Citizens Financial Group  Inc    NYSE CFG   operates as the bank holding company for Citizens Bank  N A  and Citizens Bank of Pennsylvania  which provide retail and commercial banking products and services  This Zacks Rank  2 company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 3 6  over the trailing four quarters and has a 15 5  expected EPS growth rate for 3 5years General Motors Company   NYSE GM   designs  builds and sells cars  trucks  and automobile parts worldwide  It has a Zacks Rank  2 and expected EPS growth rate of 8 5  for 3 5years  The company delivered positive earnings surprises in the trailing four quarters at an average of 21 8  Get the rest of the stocks on the list and

21793,243308,ARCB,4 Transportation Stocks That Could Beat The Market In 2019,opinion,The Zacks  Sector is about to close the year 2018 on a negative note This key sector has logged nearly 20  losses since the beginning of this year  The sell off has been blamed on multiple woes  including volatile oil prices  labor woes and weather related disruptions In fact  the diversified transportation sector  which includes airline operators  railroads  truckers  third party logistics  3PL  companies and shippers  to name a few  has performed worse than the Zacks S P 500 composite  which has declined 6 9   The coveted index has suffered due to factors like weaker earnings growth  U S  China trade war related disputes  Fed rate hike and government shutdown worries among others Price PerformanceWhy Transports Suffered in 2018 The lackluster performance of transportation stocks in 2018 was mainly due to oil prices  which were on an uptrend for most of the year  West Texas Intermediate  WTI  started the year just above  60 per barrel and touched multi year highs of more than  76 in early October With expenses on fuel representing one of the largest inputs for transports  this sharp increase in crude prices did not bode well for the sector  Escalating fuel costs apart  high expenses on the labor front  declining coal volumes  disruption in operations due to inclement weather and political uncertainties also plagued the sector What AwaitsTransports in 2019 Now the question is  will transportation stocks be able to revive their sagging fortunes  thereby outshining the broader market s performance next year  Let s try and gain some clarity on that In a stunning turnaround of fortunes  oil has been on a downward trend since early October  The commodity has plunged more than 35  on fears of supply glut and economic headwinds  With oil prices poised to end 2018 on a low note  transports should breathe a sigh of relief going into the new year Even though  many analysts believe that oil could experience a recovery in 2019  it is highly unlikely that the commodity will touch the highs of 2014 when it traded above  100 a barrel  This certainly bodes well for transports Subdued oil prices apart  robust e commerce growth should stand package delivery companies like United Parcel Service  Inc    NYSE UPS   in good stead next year  Moreover  3PL providers like C H  Robinson Worldwide   NASDAQ CHRW   should enjoy a fruitful 2019 on the back of impressive freight demand  Strong air travel demand is expected in 2019  which bodes well for airlines Volume growth and improvement in a key metric   operating ratio  operating expenses as a percentage of revenues    are expected in 2019 for railroads  another key component of the sector  Low tax rates should also fuel growth of transportation stocks in the coming year Impressive Sector Rank Supports TurnaroundThe Zacks Transportation Sector is poised to end 2018 on an impressive note  The sector is ranked 4th among the 16 Zacks sectors  The  is an important tool in designing a winning portfolio of stocks   Given the impressive sector rank  we expect transports to perform impressively the new year on the back of the tailwinds mentioned above On the basis of trailing 12 month Price to Book Value  P B   which is a commonly used multiple for valuing transportation stocks  the sector is currently trading at 2 7X compared with the S P 500 s 3 5X ValuationIn view of the encouraging prospects  we believe transports will be good investment options for 2019  Consequently  we have picked four transportation players with a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and of A or B for investors  You can see  ArcBest Corporation   NASDAQ ARCB   provides freight transportation services and solutions  This Zacks Rank  1 stock has seen the 2019 earnings estimate being revised upward to the tune of 17  over the last 90 days  It has a VGM Score of A Spirit Airlines   NYSE SAVE   based in Miramar  FL is an ultra low cost carrier  This Zacks Rank  1 stock has seen the 2019 earnings estimate being revised upward to the tune of 25 4  over the last 90 days  It also has a VGM Score of B Seaspan Corporation   NYSE SSW   is a leading independent owner  operator and manager of containerships  This Zacks Rank  2 stock has seen the 2019 earnings estimate being revised upward to the tune of 15 6  over the last 90 days  It also has a VGM Score of A Triton International Limited   NYSE TRTN   based in Hamilton  Bermuda  is the largest lessor of intermodal containers  This Zacks Rank  2

21833,243348,ARCB,4 Low P CF Stocks To Add Maximum Value To Your Investment,opinion,Value style is considered one of the best practices when it comes to picking stocks  There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock s inherent strength but a random selection of a ratio cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company s financial position  For this  we would suggest Price to Cash Flow  or P CF  ratio as one of the key metrics This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per share basis   the lower the number  the better  One of the important factors that make P CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income  truly diagnosing the financial health of a company Analysts caution that a company s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  On the other hand  cash flow is reliable  It is net cash flow that unveils how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is deploying the same Positive cash flow indicates an increase in a company s liquid assets  It gives the company the means to settle debt  shell out for its expenses  reinvest in its business  endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders  On the other hand  a negative cash flow implies a decline in the company s liquidity  which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves However  an investment decision solely based on the P CF metric may not fetch the desired results  To identify stocks that are trading at a discount  you should expand your search criteria and also consider price to book ratio  price to earnings ratio and price to sales ratio  Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a  of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap The Bargain Hunting StrategyHere are the parameters for selecting true value stocks P CF less than or equal to X Industry Median Price greater than or equal to 5  The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher Average 20 Day Volume greater than 100 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable P E using  F1  less than or equal to X Industry Median  This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to its peers P B less than or equal to X Industry Median  A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain P S less than or equal to X Industry Median  The P S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company s sales   the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is PEG less than 1  The ratio is used to determine a stock s value by taking the company s earnings growth into account  PEG ratio gives a more complete picture than P E ratio  A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospect Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2

21851,243366,ARCB,Zacks com Highlights  ArcBest  Citizens Financial Group  General Motors And Gulfport Energy,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   November 20  2018   Stocks in this week s article include  ArcBest Corp    NASDAQ ARCB    Citizens Financial Group  Inc    NYSE CFG    General Motors Co    NYSE GM   and Gulfport Energy Corp    NASDAQ GPOR   Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research 4 Low P CF Stocks to Add Maximum Value to Your InvestmentValue style is considered one of the best practices when it comes to picking stocks  There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock s inherent strength but a random selection of a ratio cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company s financial position  For this  we would suggest Price to Cash Flow  or P CF  ratio as one of the key metrics This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per share basis   the lower the number  the better  One of the important factors that make P CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income  truly diagnosing the financial health of a company Analysts caution that a company s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  On the other hand  cash flow is reliable  It is net cash flow that unveils how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is deploying the same Positive cash flow indicates an increase in a company s liquid assets  It gives the company the means to settle debt  shell out for its expenses  reinvest in its business  endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders  On the other hand  a negative cash flow implies a decline in the company s liquidity  which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves However  an investment decision solely based on the P CF metric may not fetch the desired results  To identify stocks that are trading at a discount  you should expand your search criteria and also consider price to book ratio  price to earnings ratio and price to sales ratio  Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a  of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap And that s what we re

CRC   5 Broker Friendly Stocks to Tide Over Market VolatilityThe Q3 earnings season  which is over for most of the 16 Zacks sectors  has unveiled a rosy picture with many companies reporting better than expected earnings  According to the latest   78 7  of the 488 S P 500 companies that have reported thus far having outperformed earnings estimates This is highly encouraging as an earnings beat generally leads to stock price appreciation  Investors like to add outperformers to their portfolios  which can fetch them handsome returnsMarket Volatility on the RiseDespite the impressive Q3 performance  the U S  equity market has been witnessing a roller coaster ride over the past two months  While trade related tensions with China continue to be a source of worry  expectations of higher interest rates in the near future and plunging crude oil prices have also increased investors  concern  Moreover  the decline in technology stocks has further added to concerns The heightened volatility is reflected in the significant increase in the CBOE Volatility Index  VIX  Proper Guidance   A Must in this ScenarioWith market participants gripped by fears on the one hand and robust earnings numbers on the other  selecting potential winning stocks is a difficult task Furthermore  with a huge number of stocks available in the market at any point of time  spotting potential outperformers is by no means an easy task for individual investors  In the absence of proper guidance  identifying a winning stock is akin to searching for  a needle in a haystack  Additionally  with time at a premium these days  it is next to impossible for investors to go through the extensive process  Given this backdrop  it is in the best interest of investors to seek guidance from  experts in the field   The concerned experts are brokers Broker Advice to the RescueTo avoid such confusion  investors  more often than not rely on guidance provided by brokers who are deemed to be experts in the field  The opinion of brokers is highly sought after by investors as they have a clear insight into the nitty gritty of the investment world  Individual investors  more often than not  do not have access to such detailed and well researched information Out of the three types of brokers  sell side  buy side and independent  present  sell side analysts are the most common  They are employed by various brokerage firms to provide unbiased opinion on stocks  Meanwhile  buy side analysts are employed by hedge funds  mutual funds and others while independent analysts directly sell their reports to investors Brokers revise their earnings estimates after carefully examining the pros and cons of an event for the concerned stock  Naturally  their stock related actions  upgrade or downgrade

21924,243439,ARCB,6 Safe Haven Stocks To Buy As Trade War Tensions Continue,opinion,"This week  President Trump asked his administration to find another  200 billion worth of goods to impose tariffs on  Moreover  the Senate voted to re instate a ban on U S  component sales to Chinese firm ZTE  HK 0763   undoing the government s agreement with Beijing to save the firm 
But while ZTE was a one firm affair  the threat of additional sanctions had Chinese people pulling their money out of the stock market  sending Chinese markets down and setting off a chain reaction elsewhere  including in the U S 
The White House figures that it can increase the pressure because of China s dependence on the U S  in key growth sectors  But whether the new threat constitutes real actions or negotiating rhetoric is anyone s guess  Especially since the President hasn t limited his standoff to China  but taken the fight to the world 
So after the President removed the steel and aluminum tariff exemptions  the EU decided to impose tariffs on  3 2 billion worth of American goods like bourbon  peanut butter and Harley Davidson motorcycles to counter the 25  and 10  tariffs on European steel and aluminum  respectively 
The tariffs go into effect on Friday  Its goal is to bring maximum harm to Republican states  ignoring the President s threat that counter sanctions will have it targeting European cars next 
Mexico s retaliatory tariffs announced earlier this month affect another  3 billion worth of American goods including a 20  tariff on U S  pork legs and shoulders  apples and potatoes and 20 25  duties on cheeses and bourbon and a host of other items  again with the goal of bringing maximum harm to southern states  While Trump s economic advisor Larry Kudlow hinted at bilateral deals to replace the NAFTA  both Canada and Mexico are against it  So there s another stalemate 
Even India  which is a much smaller trading partner  has proposed additional tariffs of up to 50  on above 800cc motorcycles targeting Harley Davidson as well as lower rates on 29 other categories including things like almonds  walnuts and fresh apples  lentils  certain iron and steel goods and boric acid to offset the impact of steel and aluminum tariffs on the global market  India is more important as a defense market because it is the fourth largest defense spender with an underdeveloped domestic market  enabling the U S  to grow into the third largest supplier  after Russia and Israel 
Whatever the plan  whether actual or rhetorical  one thing the government has managed to achieve is increase the uncertainty on Wall Street  Which is why this is a good time to jump into some safe haven stocks 
Using Zacks methodology  we can identify stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  recommendation that cater to attractive industries  studies have shown that the top 50  of Zacks Ranked Industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1   have a VGM Score of A or B  indicating universal appeal because value  growth and momentum investors would find them equally attractive   A Value Score of A or B  indicating that they are undervalued  and an expected long term  3 5 year  growth rate of over 10   The following stocks satisfy all the above criteria and more

21928,243443,ARCB,5 Stocks To Watch Out For On Recent Broker Rating Upgrades,opinion,One often falters in life due to lack of proper guidance  This is true for the investing world as well  With a deluge of stocks flooding the market at any point of time  an investor may make a wrong choice while designing a portfolio in the absence of proper know how Moreover  time constraint makes the task even harder  Choice of improper stocks can adversely impact returns  thereby ruining the objective of investing hard earned money in the highly unpredictable stock market Broker Advice   The SaviorTo avoid such an unfortunate scenario  investors  more often than not rely on guidance provided by brokers who are deemed to be experts in the field Of the three types of brokers analysts  sell side  buy side and independent  present in the investment world  sell side analysts are most common  Various brokerage firms employ them to provide unbiased opinion to investors after thorough research  Buy side analysts are employed by hedge funds  mutual funds etc  while the independent ones simply sell their reports to investors  Brokers not only scrutinize the publicly available financial documents but also attend company conference calls and other presentations Given the above scenario  it is in the best interest of investors to pay heed to such well researched information  Estimate revisions serve as an important pointer regarding the price of a stock Framing a Winning StrategyWe have designed a screen to shortlist stocks based on improving analyst recommendation and upward revisions to

market at any point of time  an investor may make a wrong choice while designing a portfolio in the absence of proper know how Moreover  time constraint makes the task even harder  Choice of improper stocks can adversely impact returns  thereby ruining the objective of investing hard earned money in the highly unpredictable stock market Broker Advice   The SaviorTo avoid such an unfortunate scenario  investors  more often than not rely on guidance provided by brokers who are deemed to be experts in the field Of the three types of brokers analysts  sell side  buy side and independent  present in the investment world  sell side analysts are most common  Various brokerage firms employ them to provide unbiased opinion to investors after thorough research  Buy side analysts are employed by hedge funds  mutual funds etc  while the independent ones simply sell their reports to investors  Brokers not only scrutinize the publicly available financial documents but also attend company conference calls and other presentations Given the above scenario  it is in the best interest of investors to pay heed to such well researched information  Estimate revisions serve as an important pointer regarding the price of a stock Framing a Winning StrategyWe have designed a screen to shortlist stocks based on improving analyst recommendation and upward revisions to earnings estimates over the last four weeks  Also  since the price sales ratio is a strong complementary valuation metric in the presence of analyst information  it has also been included  The price sales

PRU       and CVR Refining  LP  NYSE   NYSE CVRR       Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research 5 Value Stocks with Impressive EV EBITDA Ratios to Own NowThe price to earnings  P E  ratio is broadly considered by value investors as a useful yardstick for working out the fair market value of a stock  Many prefer to take the P E route in their pursuit of a portfolio of stocks with attractive prices  But even this ubiquitously used valuation metric is not without its  is a Better Substitute  Here s WhyAlthough the widespread use of P E stems from its simplicity  a more complicated metric called EV EBITDA is sometimes viewed as a better approach as it offers a clearer picture of a company s valuation and earnings potential  EV EBITDA determines the total value of a firm while P E just considers its equity portion Also referred to as enterprise multiple  EV EBITDA is the enterprise value  EV  of a stock divided by its earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA   EV is a firm s market capitalization plus the market value of its debt and preferred equity minus cash  In a nutshell  it is the total value of a company EBITDA  the other element  gives a clearer picture of a company s profitability as it strips out the impact of non cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that reduce net earnings  It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows Just like P E  the lower the EV EBITDA ratio  the more alluring it is  A low EV EBITDA ratio could be a sign that a stock is potentially undervalued Unlike P E ratio  EV EBITDA takes debt on a company s balance sheet into account  Due to this reason  EV EBITDA is generally used to value potential acquisition targets as it shows the amount of debt the acquirer has to assume  Stocks boasting a low EV EBITDA multiple could be seen as attractive takeover candidates Another key drawback of P E is that it can t be used to value a loss making entity  A firm s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  In contrast  EV EBITDA is less amenable to manipulation and can also be used to value companies that are making loss but are  is also a useful tool in evaluating the value of firms that are highly leveraged and have a high degree of depreciation  Moreover  it can be used to compare companies with different levels of debt However  EV EBITDA is also not without its downsides and alone cannot conclusively determine a stock s inherent potential and future performance  The ratio varies across industries and is generally not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries given their diverse capital spending requirements Thus  instead of solely relying on EV EBITDA  you can club it with the other major ratios such as price to book  P B   P E and price to sales  P S  to screen bargain stocks Screening CriteriaHere are the parameters to screen for value stocks EV EBITDA 12 Months Most Recent less than X Industry Median  A lower EV EBITDA ratio represents a cheaper valuation P E using  F1  less than X Industry Median This metric screens stocks that are trading at a discount to their peers P B less than X Industry Median  A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that the stock is undervalued P S less than X Industry Median  The lower the P S ratio the more attractive the stock is as investors will have to pay a smaller price for the same amount of sales generated by the company Estimated One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0  greater than or equal to X Industry Median This parameter will help in screening stocks that have growth rates higher than the industry median  This is a meaningful indicator as decent earnings growth always adds to investor optimism Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 100 000 The addition of this metric ensures that shares can be traded easily Current Price greater than or equal to  5  This parameter will help in screening stocks that are trading at a minimum price of  5 or higher Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  No screening is complete without the Zacks Rank  which has proven its worth since inception  It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  have always managed to beat adversities and outperform the market  of less than or equal to B Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score

21995,243510,ARCB,4 Safe Dividend Growth ETFs   Stocks For A Faltering Market ,opinion,"With investors puzzled about the future course of stock market momentum given the rising rate worries  investors must be wondering where to park their money  With a spike in yield  chances are high that both equities and bonds will lose their value 
Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  has already forecast that stocks may  if 10 year bond yields hit a high of 4 5  and a more than  of a Fed rate hike in March  A senior portfolio manager at Sit predicts that the Fed will raise rates four times this year  one more than what has been penciled so far by the central bank 
While rising rates will lower the price of bonds  fears of faster ceases in cheap money inflows will likely hurt stocks  Against this scenario  some safe or value picks are necessary 
BofA stock strategist noted that  while we do not see a set level at which interest rates have begun to hurt equities  we may be getting closer to    The strategist also indicated that  historically  the probability of loss for the S P 500 increases when the 10 year Treasury yield rises above 3   
With the benchmark Treasury yield hitting a high of 2 94  this month and currently at 2 86  as on Feb 26  2018  a 3  yield is not a far behind  So  let s find what could be safer stock investing options right now 
Target Dividend Aristocrats
Dividend paying securities can be steady sources of current income for investors when returns from equity markets are at risk  But as per the analysis from Bank of America Merrill Lynch  NYSE BAC   both high yield and no yield can get hurt in a rising rate environment  read    
So  it is better to tap  companies with modest yields and plenty of potential to grow their payments  Typically   to high yielders  but right now the growers are slightly cheaper   per Bank of America Merrill Lynch 
Dividend aristocrats are the blue chip dividend paying companies  which have a long history of raising dividend payments year over year  These provide hedge against economic uncertainty and are high quality in nature 
Further  many U S  companies hoard a pile cash on their balance sheets and are likely to increase their dividend payouts  especially given the passing of the tax reform  The Trump administration proposed a move from the current worldwide tax system to a territorial system  allowing companies to send their offshore profits back to the United States without extra taxes 
Investors are expecting tax savings to result in fatter and faster dividend hikes and more stock buybacks  Morgan Stanley s analysts predict that 43  of the total tax savings will go to dividends and buybacks  read

industries  a high growth industry normally has higher multiple and vice versa  and is typically not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries given their diverse capital expenditure requirements As such  instead of solely banking on EV EBITDA  you can combine it with the other major ratios such as price to book  P B   P E and price to sales  P S  to screen true value stocks  Screening CriteriaHere are the parameters to screen for value stocks EV EBITDA 12 Months Most Recent less than X Industry Median  A lower EV EBITDA ratio represents a cheaper valuation P E using  F1

assessing the fair market value of a stock  Many prefer to take the P E route in their pursuit of stocks that are trading at attractive prices  But even this widely popular equity valuation multiple has a few pitfalls What Makes EV EBITDA a Better Substitute While P E is the most commonly used tool for evaluating a firm s value  another valuation metric called EV EBITDA works even better  The ratio is often viewed as a better alternative to P E as it offers a clearer image of a company s valuation and its earnings potential  EV EBITDA also has a more complete approach to valuation as it determines the total value of a firm as opposed to P E  which considers only its equity portion   Also referred to as the enterprise multiple  EV EBITDA is the enterprise value  EV  of a stock divided by its earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA   EV is the sum of a company s market capitalization  its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents  Simply put  it is the total value of a firm The other constituent  EBITDA gives the true picture of a firm s profitability as it eliminates the impact of non cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that dilute net earnings Usually  the lower the EV EBITDA ratio  the more attractive it is  A low EV EBITDA ratio could imply that a stock is potentially undervalued and vice  also takes into account the debt on a company s balance sheet that P E ratio ignores  This is the reason why EV EBITDA is typically used to value potential acquisition targets  It shows the amount of debt the acquirer has to bear  Stocks with a low EV EBITDA multiple could be seen as attractive takeover candidates Another major drawback of P E is that it can t be used to value a loss making firm  A company s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  EV EBITDA  in contrast  is hard to manipulate and can also be used to value firms that have negative net earnings but are positive on the EBITDA front Moreover  EV EBITDA allows the comparison of companies with different debt levels and is a useful tool in measuring the value of firms that are highly leveraged and have substantial depreciation and amortization expenses However  EV EBITDA is not without its limitations and it alone can t conclusively determine a stock s inherent potential and future performance  It varies across industries  a high growth industry normally has higher multiple and vice versa  and is typically not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries given their diverse capital expenditure

21999,243514,ARCB,4 Trucking Stocks To Drive Into Earnings Beat In Q1,opinion,The U S  trucking industry witnessed gradual improvement in 2017  As the U S  economy continues to grow  demand for carriage is also increasing and this momentum is expected to be sustained in 2018  The trucking industry is the lifeblood of the economy as it moves more than 70  of the nation s freight by volume In its 2017 2018 Freight Transportation Forecast  the American Trucking Association   ATA   has predicted that there will be persistent growth for truckers driven by manufacturing  consumer spending and international trade over the next 12 years A robust U S  economy  healthy consumer and business confidence  massive tax haul and business friendly policies of the government are anticipated to fuel trucking industry s growth  Let us  focus on trucking stocks positioned to report upbeat earnings results  which will eventually lead to an uptick in share price Robust ATA Projection The ATA has projected that from 2018 to 2023  the freight volume growth rate will be 3 4  per annum  For 2017  ATA estimated that 15 18 billion tons of freight was moved by all modes  The figure will rise 36 6  to 20 73 billion tons in 2028  Goods hauled by both truckload and less than truckload  LTL  operators will rise by an average 3  per annum over the next five days Truck transport is a  derived demand  industry  which means demand for truckers depends on the demand for the products that trucks haul  Consequently  trucking serves as a barometer of the U S  economy  According to ATA  trucking revenues is likely to grow 5 4  annually between 2018 and 2023 and are expected to reach  1 trillion by 2024 Massive Tax OverhaulThe overall economic outlook has been fairly bullish fueled by President Trump s proposed policy changes  The proposal to reduce corporate taxes from the current 35  to 21  is likely to bring corporate tax rate to its lowest level in 78 years Trucking companies book much of their revenues within the United States  Consequently  a significant reduction in corporate tax rate faced by these companies would be immediately accretive to cash flow  Trump has also promised removing 75  of the regulations during his tenure  which is likely to help private employers Strong U S  Economy On Mar 21  the Fed raised GDP growth forecast for 2018 to 2 7  from 2 5  in December 2017  A survey among economists conducted by The Wall Street Journal predicted U S  GDP would rise 2 8  in 2018 For March  the Conference Board s measure of consumer confidence index stands at 127 7  the second highest since November 2017  Business sentiment also remains healthy  Under Trump s presidency  the U S  manufacturing sector is witnessing strong business spending at factories for expensive durable items such as machinery and vehicles A robust job market  massive tax cuts and solid economic data are likely to increase consumer spending in the months to come  Meanwhile  strong domestic and global economic conditions along with favorable government policies will pave the way for long term growth of the manufacturing sector  Both of these will bolster demand for truckers Zacks Favors

22015,243530,ARCB,Forget Geopolitics  Turn To Q1 Earnings With 5 Winning Stocks,opinion,Astute investors have turned their focus from the latest White House tweets to Q1 corporate profits  Strategists believe that tax benefits and pickup in deal activity will aid earnings  Wall Street has always shown an uptrend after earnings release in the last five years Geopolitical crises like the prospects of a Western strike on Syria and trade war tensions have receded somewhat  Mounting military tensions  historically  has had no effect on markets but on humans  In addition  Trump has toned down some of the trade war banters with China  by categorically stating that the nations may not end up imposing the proposed tariffs Since Q1 earnings is expected to drive equity gains and talks of firing missiles and trade war rhetoric take a back seat  investing in sound growth stocks that can make the most of the first quarter earnings season seems judicious Investors Shouldn t Fear a Syria StrikeEscalating concerns over the Middle Eastern countries have been weighing on investors  mind for quite some time now  Trump had twitted that a missile attack on Syria was very much in the cards after Syrian President Bashar al Assad sanctioned chemical weapon attack on civilians in Damascus over the weekend  Russia had retaliated  saying that it will fend off any U S  missile Such a concern  however  ratcheted down lately after Trump suggested that a military strike on Syria may not be imminent  He tweeted  never said when an attack on Syria would take place  Could be very soon or not so soon at all  Investors should also shrug off fears of a U S  missile strike on Syria  Historically  such military attacks have limited impact on the stock market  especially over the long run  Jeffrey Kleintop  the chief global investment strategist at Charles Schwab  NYSE SCHW    Co  said that immediately after a military strike markets tend to lose around 0 2  to 0 3   but there is nothing exceptional about it  Such a movement happens almost daily during normal trading sessions Trump Defuses Trade War Chatter with ChinaTrump had earlier  in the light of China s  illicit trade practices   doubled down on China tariffs  ratcheting up possibilities of a U S  China trade war  He had ordered the U S  Trade Representative to consider imposing tariffs on additional  100 billion in Chinese imports  China in turn was widely expected to adopt a similar protectionist move and heighten global concerns of a tit for tat trade battle This had resulted in a lot of uneasiness  with most sectors expected to suffer collateral damage  After all  increased trade conflicts dent corporate profits and impede economic expansion  But  for now  Trump said that the United States may be able to avoid a potential trade conflict with China provided Beijing is willing to give more American products access to its market  Eventually  he believes that the countries will end up imposing no tariffs at all Q1 Earnings Takes Center StageWhile geopolitical jitters wane  investors anticipate a strong earnings season to lift Wall Street  Banks have already started to pop ahead of earnings  For the Finance sector  of which the Major Banks industry is the biggest earnings contributor  total Q1 earnings are expected to be up 19 2  from the same period last year on 4 5  higher revenues  This would follow 0 6  earnings growth in the preceding quarter on 4  higher revenues  read more    Total earnings for the S P 500 companies are estimated to improve 16  from the same period last year on 7 4  higher revenues  the highest quarterly earnings growth pace in seven years  read more    Earnings are likely to rise mostly on Trump s polices  including tax cuts  The latest tax laws gave companies massive tax relief as they will now be paying between 8  and 15 5  instead of the earlier 35  for bringing back money held overseas  read more    Earnings Season Mostly Leads to Big Stock GainsStrategists from JPMorgan Chase   Co    NYSE JPM   and Deutsche Bank  DE DBKGn  have expressed optimism  citing that share buybacks and stronger global growth will help S P earnings surpass estimates by 5   more than average margin of 3 1  in the past five years  per data compiled by Bloomberg Undeniably  this will be another big quarter for profit growth eventually leading to an uptick in share prices  After all  a whopping 80  of S P gains came during earnings season since 2013  per Bloomberg 5 Top PicksWall Street  of late  has been scaling higher on optimism that lower U S  taxes will boost corporate profits  Conversely  investors ignored rising military tensions and trade policy that had sparked tensions for Wall Street over the past several weeks This calls for investing in stocks that will report a significant uptick in Q1 earnings and in the process scale north  Such stocks have a positive   This is our proprietary methodology for determining stocks that have the best chance to

22072,243587,ARCB,A Week Of Sand And Dollars,opinion,"As summer arrives  both sand and dollars are presenting themselves 
May is now in the books and it was only forgettable if you were investing in non US dollar equities  bonds or commodities  US stocks did fine and some managers found a few big hits in the many takeovers that hit the tape  The most important move during the month was the bounce in the dollar which was treading on thin ice at mid month  But as Greece continued to falter  Spain voted Left and the US economic data started sending stronger signals  and the dollar bounced to reclaim its 50 day moving average which will ease the trending global macro investors  With the US dollar bounce  the April gains in oil and energy based stocks  bonds and emerging markets reversed  US bonds continued lower as American investors felt the pain of 5 10  declines in their longer duration bonds   and they didn t like it  As we grab the sandals and beach towels from the seasonal closet  investors will hit the beach looking at their mobile devices for both the weather forecast and the last reported economic reading  If the numbers continue to strengthen in the US then it will pay to stick to US dollar based investments while hedging your International bets  Have fun watching the data and don t forget to use sunscreen 
To the relief of billions of   in trend following hedge fund assets  the US dollar finds a trampoline in May

  go ahead and blame the strong US dollar  


US dollar strength and company specific worries means the Industrial sector and transportation sub sector might just take the summer off 
ARCA XLI and ARCA IYT Chart

The industrials sector came under pressure this week  Machinery capital equipment names were hit particularly hard with Terex Corporation  NYSE TEX   13 9    Oshkosh Corporation  NYSE OSK   8 5    Joy Global Inc  NYSE JOY   7 9   and Manitowoc Company Inc  NYSE MTW   7 7   some of the big decliners  Much of the blame was chalked up to cautious comments from equipment rental companies at the KeyBanc Industrial conference  KeyBanc said that both United Rentals Inc  NYSE URI   15 2   and H E Equipment Services Inc  NASDAQ HEES   11 1   noted a near term soft patch in May utilization and rental equipment rates  pointing to challenging weather and more onerous E P headwinds

For the month of May  US Sector investors were rewarded everywhere but in energy stocks 

Geographically  May was friendly to US investors and hostile to Emerging Market ones 

More specifically in May  Biotech helped Healthcare and  combined with the Semis  also helped the NASDAQ and Small Caps outperform  At the bottom  any asset that touched energy prices or the US dollar had a difficult time 

Looking at the Morningstar Style boxes shows that May was anything but  sell and go away   Small Cap growth crushed it 

A look at the top performing  10b  market caps showed the power of M A as 6 of 9 top May performers were involved in deals  Even Avago Technologies Limited  NASDAQ AVGO   which bought Broadcom Corporation  NASDAQ BRCM   posted huge gains  which is another sign that the market wants to reward use of capital 

Looking at the bottom of May s large cap performers shows the big reversal in the Energy space 

Good thoughts from JPMorgan s Trading desk on where the market stands heading into the beach 
More of the same  Volumes are still light  liquidity remains super thin  incremental news is essentially non existent  and conviction levels are low   these dynamics have been present for weeks and the addition of month end machinations made for an environment prone to chasing and violent  squeezes   on the upside and downside  but little net progress  the S P 500 continues to find it very difficult to move meaningfully away from the 2K level   Looking at the bigger picture  the path forward still looks the same as before  Greece is a nuisance  as far as stocks  especially in the US  are concerned  and even assuming a full and immediate resolution to its debt drama  which is far from a foregone conclusion  it s hard to envision the macro landscape looking enormously different  Greece has been far on the periphery of the US narrative for a while now   More important is the Fed and the timing around liftoff   it still seems like the market is resting too much on cynicism   bad is good    secular stagnation    perpetual ZIRP   and needs to transition towards a healthier world view  stabilizing inflation  decent growth  mild policy tightening  etc    this transition process will most likely be a temporary negative but any such dip should be bought 
One area of prices which refuses to take a vacation is housing prices 

Also  hotel prices which are limit up as demand has significantly outstripped capacity 

Kids born today will not know what an incandescent light bulb is  And this is great news for your utility bill 
According to Goldman Sachs  lighting represents 14  and 38  of total electricity demand in the residential and commercial end markets  So as LED lighting rises from 8  this year to 65  in 10 years  your bills will be sliced  not to mention the frequency of your bulb changing   Goldman also believes this could cut both coal and natural gas demand by 5   That is huge

Mary Meeker s Annual Internet Trends Report is out and this chart shows how we can t wait for our self driving cars  Seriously  who has a spare 1 hour per day to manually drive their cars 

Just when you thought that you had seen everything  Governors and State lawmakers who still believe they can earn 7 8  for the next 30 years  and have little understanding of basic pension fund accounting  are going to attempt to time the financial markets with their constituents  retirement dollars 
Facing a shortfall of more than  50 billion in his state s pensions  and with no simple solution at hand  Gov  Tom Wolf of Pennsylvania is proposing to issue  3 billion in bonds  despite the role that such bonds have already played in the fiscal woes of other places  And he is not alone  Several states and municipalities are considering similar action as they struggle with ballooning pension costs 
The deals are generally pitched to state and local officials as an arbitrage play  The government will issue the bonds  the pension system will invest the proceeds  and the investments will earn more  on average  than the interest rate on the bonds  The projected spread between the two rates makes it look as if the government has refinanced its pension shortfall at a lower interest rate  saving vast sums of money  But that s just on paper  In reality  the investment return assumption is just that   an assumption  and a deceptive one at that because it does not take risk into account
Meanwhile  future pension fund investment returns are going to be much more difficult to achieve if Goldman is correct about US Equities 
If David Kostin s calculations are right  the fizz is out of the stock market s Champagne  Mr  Kostin  Goldman Sachs Group s chief US stock strategist  last week forecasted no price gain at all for the S P 500 over the next 12 months  with the index s only return coming from dividends  For the coming 10 years he projected just 5  yearly total returns  with nearly half from dividends  That means the index value would rise only about 2 7  a year for a decade  Many money managers say he is a little on the pessimistic side  but they widely agree that future US stock gains probably will be limited  simply because stocks have gotten so expensive   We  too  think that investors should temper their enthusiasm for stock returns  They will be mid to high single digits and not the double digits we have all enjoyed historically   said Lori Heinel  chief portfolio strategist at State Street Global Advisors  which oversees  2 4 trillion in Boston 
Let s just hope these hedge fund families are all running different strategies 
The world s largest hedge fund managers are dominating the capital invested in the asset class  according to Preqin  The data provider found the top 11  of managers controlled 92  or  2 78 trillion of total hedge fund assets at the end of Q1 2015  These 570 managers also each held at least  1 billion in assets  qualifying their membership of the   1 billion club    The  1 billion club has continued to grow over the past 12 months  both in terms of the assets they command and their influence on the hedge fund industry   said Amy Bensted  Preqin s head of hedge fund products

Prepared Remarks 
OperatorGreetings and welcome to the ArcBest Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call  During the presentation  all participants will be in a listen only mode   Operator Instructions  As a reminder  this conference is being recorded Friday  January 31st  2020 I would now like to turn the conference over to David Humphrey  Vice President of Investor Relations  Please go ahead David Humphrey    Vice President  Investor RelationsWelcome to the ArcBest fourth quarter 2019 earnings conference call  Our presentation this morning will be done by Judy McReynolds  Chairman  President and Chief Executive Officer of ArcBest and David Cobb  Chief Financial Officer of ArcBest Today  following Judy and David s opening remarks about the fourth quarter results  I will conduct a question and answer period with them by reading submitted questions that we received last night following our earnings release  We appreciate the questions that we received and we will try to answer as many as we can during the remaining time of this call We thank you for joining us today  In order to help you better understand ArcBest and it s results  some forward looking statements could be made during this call  As we all know  forward looking statements by their very nature are subject to uncertainties and risk  For more complete discussion of factors that could affect the Company s future results  please refer to the forward looking statement section of the Company s earnings press release  and the Company s most recent SEC public filings In order to provide meaningful comparisons  certain information discussed in this conference call includes non GAAP financial measures as outlined and described in the tables in our earnings press release We will now begin with Judy Judy R  McReynolds    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  David and good morning everyone  I m pleased to talk with you today about our fourth quarter and 2019 performance  particularly as it marks the end of my 10th year as CEO  which provides an opportunity to reflect on how far we have come as an organization While the fourth quarter was the most challenging of the year  our overall performance for 2019 was the second best in the last 10 years We didn t see the same record setting conditions last year as those in 2018  but it was still a year full of accomplishments for ArcBest  We achieved good progress on our efforts across the Company to provide an excellent customer experience  to develop our people and to deliver solid financial results When I began my role as CEO in 2010  it was a far different situation as we navigated the effects of the financial crisis which hit everyone in our industry  including us  very hard  That year  we reported  1 7 billion in revenues  coming almost exclusively from our LTL business and a  55 million consolidated operating loss Fast forward to 2019 when we reached nearly  3 billion in revenue with roughly a third of that generated by our Asset Light business and  109 million in non GAAP operating income  Our balance sheet is solid and our cash flow generation strong  We know we have more work to do on the Asset Light side but I m proud of our team s evolution and our ability to give customers the breadth of solutions they require across the supply chain Our expansion and diversification have not been without their challenges and volatile market conditions  but I am confident we are firmly on the right path for the next decade ahead  By serving and spending time with our customers and by investing in innovative technologies to enable a more informed and actionable view of their logistics needs  we are better able to address their pain points An example of this involves a high end appliance manufacturer with revenue of more than  15 billion  They were an existing client for us running at about  430 000 a month in revenue for deliveries to a big box retail center that they needed damage reduction and guarantee of final mile deliveries that were on time  Specifically for them  we created a managed solution involving a mode optimization of LTL  time critical LTL  truckload and expedite  Thanks to our solution  they began to see reduced damages  creative coordination of specialized deliveries and enhanced reporting and visibility  We ended up basically quadrupling that business to  1 8 million a month in revenue In fact it has gone so well that we are now in early stages of helping this high end manufacturer work with another online retail seller and our experiences show that we will be the right partner once again As a result of our expansion and investments in recent years  our managed solutions business is growing  Our cross sell accounts have become larger in size and are growing faster than single service accounts  And these accounts also have higher rates of retention  which is a more stable foundation for future growth The growth in our managed business is also having a positive impact on our Asset Based business  And in some cases  if we had continued to only provide LTL this business would have been lost to us forever Speaking of ABF  we achieved a significant milestone in paying a profit sharing bonus to all eligible union represented employees at ABF upon reaching a full year operating ratio of 95 2   I m proud of this accomplishment and I thank everyone for their hard work And now  I ll discuss some additional detail on the fourth quarter performance of our service offerings  In the fourth quarter  we continued to offer our Asset Based customers with a superior level of service in response to their specific transportation needs  The pricing environment was solid and stable during the quarter and allowed us to achieve needed increases in yields  especially on our LTL rated shipments  But lower demand during a moderating and uncertain economic environment contributed to decreased revenue resulting from reductions in both shipments and tonnage  Lower LTL rated shipment levels have resulted in reductions in productivity metrics in our dock and city operations thus impacting profitability relative to last year s fourth quarter Our focus on customer service  while seeking to maintain the proper balance between cost management and our business levels put some pressure on fourth quarter operating margins relative to 2018 Later in the call David Cobb will detail the monthly tonnage declines that we experienced in the fourth quarter  which has been the case throughout the entire year  Our tonnage declines reflect the overall weakness in the manufacturing and industrial sector of the economy and truckload capacity increases  As a result of the reductions in our LTL business  we ve been opportunistic in filling available Asset Based equipment capacity with both truckload and LTL transactional shipments  utilizing some new systems that offer more timely information on existing opportunity Our recent Asset Based tonnage comparisons with the previous year have improved as a result of these initiatives and in January 2020  we are seeing growth in our tonnage compared to last year  The January business growth has also resulted in improved linehaul metric  As I mentioned in the fourth quarter  we were successful in improving price on our Asset Based business  Throughout 2019 we compared back to quarters in 2018 that reflected total Asset Based quarterly price increases in the range of 8  to 10   Even with those challenging comparisons in each quarter of 2019  we further improved pricing relative to 2018  The pricing environment in January is comparable with previous quarters but the addition of the transactional shipments I mentioned earlier has impacted our revenue per hundredweight metric Fewer total shipments and a reduction in average revenue per shipment resulted in a decline in fourth quarter ArcBest Asset Light revenue versus the prior year  As we have experienced throughout 2019  the most significant impact contributing to lower Asset Light revenue and operating income was the reduced demand for our expedite services compared to the previous period  In the current demand environment  shippers have a greater number of lower cost capacity options  thus reducing their need for our expedite services  This translated into a double digit percent reduction in expedite shipments  combined with a comparable decline in average revenue on these shipments We experienced an increase in the truckload brokerage shipments handled in our Asset Light business during the fourth quarter  but we were challenged by lower average shipment revenue relative to the cost we had to pay for the Asset Light purchased transportation equipment capacity  Our total PTE cost decreased during the quarter  but not in the same proportion as the decline in average shipment revenue  This combination of factors contributed to significantly reduced Asset Light operating income Growth in our managed transportation services continues to be a positive contributor to our Asset Light results  As I discussed earlier on the call  our managed solutions resonate with customers and there is a high level of interest in ArcBest coordinating their supply chains in a cost efficient manner  while maintaining a focus on service and transit reliability  We are certainly adding new customers and shipment activity to our managed services  but we re also finding creative ways to meet the needs of existing customers  Our managed solutions opportunity pipeline continues to grow which is exciting  because we know these solutions are particularly responsive to customers in this environment At FleetNet  total events increased during the fourth quarter compared to last year as the increase in the preventative maintenance service event offset a reduction in roadside repair activities  The improvement in fourth quarter operating income was the result of growth in total events and cost efficiency gains from previous technology investments During 2019  we continued to take actions to enhance shareholder value  Throughout the year  we paid our  0 08 per share quarterly cash dividend and we bought back over 307 000 shares of our stock for a total price of  9 1 million  Under our existing repurchase programs  we have approximately  13 million of purchase availability going forward And now  I ll turn it over to David Cobb for a discussion of the earnings results and operating statistics David R  Cobb    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Judy and good morning everyone  Let me begin with some consolidated information  Fourth quarter 2019 consolidated revenues were  717 million compared to  774 million in last year s fourth quarter  a per day decrease of 7  On a GAAP basis  we had a fourth quarter 2019 net loss of  0 22 per diluted share due to a previously announced non cash impairment charge related to Asset Light  This compared to a  0 57 per share profit last year As detailed in the GAAP to non GAAP reconciliation table in yesterday afternoon s earnings press release  adjusted fourth quarter 2019 net income was  0 56 per diluted share compared to  1 06 per share in the same period last year  ArcBest fourth quarter 2019 effective GAAP tax rate was a benefit of 53 9   primarily due to the non cash asset impairment charge and tax credits which were related to use of alternative fuels and related to our research and development activities For the full year of 2019 consolidated revenues totaled  3 billion compared to  3 1 billion in 2018  a per day decrease of 3 2   Full year earnings per share were  1 51 compared to  2 51 in 2018  On a non GAAP adjusted basis  as outlined in our earnings press release 2019 earnings were  2 88 per diluted share compared to  4 02 in 2018 In 2019  total net capital expenditures  including equipment finance  equaled to  147 million  which is below previous expectations reflecting shifts in the timing of some expenditures into 2020 as well as higher sale proceeds 2019 expenditures for revenue equipment totaled  86 million  the majority of which was for replacement of units in ArcBest Asset Based operations  Depreciation and amortization cost on property  plant and equipment were  108 million  In addition  amortization of intangible assets was  4 4 million in 2019 For 2020 total net capital expenditures are estimated to range from  135 million to  145 million  This includes revenue equipment purchases of approximately  82 million  primarily replacements for Asset Based operation  ArcBest depreciation and amortization cost on property  plant and equipment in 2020 are estimated to range from  110 million to  115 million  This expense range does not include amortization of intangible assets which are estimated to approximately be  4 million in 2020 Our full year 2019 GAAP tax rate was 22 3   which was positively impacted by the tax credits recognized in the fourth quarter that I previously mentioned  The effective tax rate reconciliation table in our earnings press release shows the reconciliation of GAAP to non GAAP effective tax rate  which was 25 8  for the full year of 2019 We currently expect our full year 2020 non GAAP tax rate to be in a range of 25  to 26  while the effective rate in any quarter may be impacted by items discrete for that period  We ended the fourth quarter with unrestricted cash and short term investments of  318 million  Combined with the available resources under our amended credit revolver and our receivable securitization agreement  our total liquidity currently equals  571 million Our total debt at the end of the fourth quarter 2019 of  324 million includes a  70 million balance on our credit revolver   40 million borrowed on our receivables securitization and  214 million of notes payable  primarily on equipment for our Asset Based operation  The composite interest rate on all of our debt was 3 1   which was lower than the third quarter  And full details of our GAAP cash flow are included in our earnings press release Our Asset Based fourth quarter revenue was  513 million  a decrease of 6 5  compared to last year  As Judy referenced earlier  Asset Based quarterly tonnage per day decreased 8 1  versus last year s fourth quarter Fourth quarter 2019 by month Asset Based daily total tonnage versus the same period last year decreased by 9 1  in October  decreased by 11 9  in November and decreased by 2 3  in December  The declines in fourth quarter total tonnage per day were driven by decreases in LTL rated business Just as  Phonetic  Judy described earlier  we increased the level of truckload rated shipments in the ABF Asset Based network to utilize available equipment capacity  Fourth quarter total shipments per day decreased by 7 3  compared to last year s fourth quarter  Fourth quarter total billed revenue per hundredweight on Asset Based shipments was  35 62  an increase of 2 1  compared to the fourth quarter of last year Excluding fuel surcharge  the increase in fourth quarter billed revenue per hundredweight on Asset Based LTL rated freight was in the high single digits  We secured an average 4 3  increase on Asset Based customer contract renewals and deferred pricing agreements that were negotiated during the quarter On an adjusted basis  our Asset Based fourth quarter operating ratio was 95  compared to 93 1  in 2018  For the full year of 2019 ArcBest Asset Based revenue was  2 1 billion compared to  2 2 billion in 2018  a per day decrease of 1 2   Asset Based 2019 total tonnage per day decreased 4 8  compared to the previous year while daily shipments decreased by 2 4   resulting in a 2 5  decrease in total pounds per shipment On an adjusted basis our Asset Based full year operating income was  118 8 million compared to  145 6 million in 2018  In total  the revenue in ArcBest Asset Light businesses decreased 2 8  versus last year s fourth quarter  reflecting a revenue decline in the ArcBest segment partially offset by revenue increase in the FleetNet segment On an adjusted basis  fourth quarter Asset Light operating income was  1 1 million compared to  7 8 million last year  Full year 2019 revenue for the Asset Light businesses was  950 million compared to  976 million in 2018  a decrease of 2 7   Full year 2019 adjusted operating income for these businesses was  11 2 million compared to  26 5 million in 2018 Adjusted full year 2019 Asset Light EBITDA was  23 8 million compared to adjusted EBITDA of  43 4 million in 2018  Yesterday afternoon we filed an 8 K that included our fourth quarter 2019 earnings release  along with an exhibit that provided some additional information about our current quarterly financial results along with our recent business levels and our future expectations on certain financial metrics  This information should be helpful in modeling expectations for our 2020 financial results Now I ll turn it over to Judy for some closing comments Judy R  McReynolds    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerTo change things up a little bit this quarter  I would like to take a few minutes to talk about our technology innovation so that you can get a little more color on what s going on there  First  however  I will mention just one recent Company highlight in which we were named to the 2020 top 500 list of the Best Employers for Diversity  We came in at number 340 on the list  published by Forbes in partnership with Statista  This is the second consecutive year that ArcBest has appeared on the list  In 2019 we ranked number 484  We are honored to be named to and moving up on the top 500 list ArcBest s history is marked by innovations and we further advanced our capabilities in the last few years in order to respond to accelerating change in our industry  One area where we see a lot of potential is in cognitive technologies  We have deployed these kinds of solutions to help shippers submit pickup request to ABF without an agent  to process and categorize inbound customer emails automatically for a quicker response and to check the capacity of a trailer by auto scanning a CCTV feed and then alerting a dock employee of a potential problem  We are in an early stage with many of these technologies that we are enthusiastic about their early success so far Another aspect of cognitive technologies is machine learning  We have developed a number of algorithms that are embedded in the applications our employees use and they help them simplify and drive better decision making  We have developed and are utilizing these kinds of solutions in yield management and in our Asset Light operations where we launched a capacity sourcing tool to optimize the utilization of internal equipment capacity  while reducing the time it takes to secure external equipment capacity in meeting customer requirements Recently ArcBest launched an innovation accelerator to encourage new transformative ideas  This accelerator combines employees from across the organization who work closely with executive leadership to identify opportunities for disruptive innovation within our company  as well as evaluate potential external innovation partners  We favor smart and pragmatic investments at ArcBest and I m pleased with the progress in this area and look forward to what s next To conclude our prepared remarks  I d like to underscore how excited I and our team remain about the market opportunities and growth potential ahead  I attend various meetings throughout the year and I m always encouraged by the can do attitude I witness in our people and the strong testimonials I receive from customers about them and the solutions we provide  As we move into 2020 and beyond  we will strive to achieve a best in class experience for our customers utilizing the right balance of human and digital interactions that makes their businesses easier to do And now  I ll turn it over to David Humphrey to conduct our question and answer session Questions and Answers David Humphrey    Vice President  Investor RelationsOkay  We will now begin the question and answer period with Judy and David  To start off  we had several questions about the tonnage trends that we experienced in late fourth quarter  19 and the improvement as we moved into January  What were the primary drivers behind the improvement that we were seeing  Those similar questions on this topic came from Chris Wetherbee with Citi  Jack Atkins of Stephens  Todd Fowler with KeyBanc  Ken Hoexter with Bank of America  Ravi Shanker of Morgan Stanley and Stephanie Benjamin at SunTrust David R  Cobb    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  David  I ll take that  Thank you  And I appreciate everyone s interest and the questions on our Asset Based tonnage trend  It s our normal practice to use transactional shipments to better utilize fixed resources in seasonally weaker periods  And these shipments improved our December sequential comparisons and resulted in a favorable year over year comparison in January And as Judy mentioned earlier  we ve had recent success in adding heavier transactional LTL rated shipments to better utilize available trailer space that would otherwise be moving empty  This success has resulted in improving our shipment trends by utilizing some new systems that offer more timely information on existing opportunity  These actions really reflect continuation of our focus on customer level profitability while utilizing the transactional market to opportunistically fill the empty capacity in our asset network  So we don t believe the improvement was experienced from demand but more about an intentional action to fill into capacity in the network David Humphrey    Vice President  Investor RelationsChris Wetherbee ask about what drove the change in build revenue per hundredweight from a 2 1  year over year increase in fourth quarter  19 to a decline of 3 5  in January  We also wanted to    he also wanted to understand the impact of mix in pricing on this change  Then Ken Hoexter wanted to know how we are thinking about the trade off between pricing and volume in LTL  He pointed out that in fourth quarter  19 pricing was up to spot volume being down pretty significantly and he wanted to know if we are losing market share David R  Cobb    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  and that s related to what I just mentioned in that we strategically added more heavier weighted transactional shipments in December and January that help fill into capacity in the network  So the change in revenue per hundredweight is more a reflection of that mix shift  Year over year core LTL price is in the mid single digits and is on top of multi year solid price increases  So our objective is to offer superior services in the LTL marketplace and in return  we ll continue to focus on securing corresponding pricing for each of our customers Our approach is to manage customer level profitability while utilizing the transactional market to fill that empty capacity in our asset network  From our analysis  we believe we are maintaining the market share David Humphrey    Vice President  Investor RelationsWe had another question about how long we can sustain elevated growth in truckload rated spot shipments moving in the asset based network David R  Cobb    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  that s really about just us trying to optimize our network with the right balance of truckload rated business and price  And during the extremely tight capacity market in 2018  we had historically low levels of truckload rated spot shipments in the network from about the second half of the year through early 2019  So the comparisons of our truckload rated business volumes become tougher as the year progresses  It really comes down to contribution to the network being the driving decision behind truckload rated business levels David Humphrey    Vice President  Investor RelationsDave Ross of Stifel ask are 3PLs away for ABF to get back some volume back into the system  Why or why not David R  Cobb    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  we have numerous and strategic relationships with 3PLs today and those provide us access to business opportunities and we utilize those opportunities to optimize our network resources that we ve been talking about  And we actively pursue business with 3PLs when the opportunity makes sense from a business standpoint David Humphrey    Vice President  Investor RelationsWe had several people ask about the current pricing environment for LTL and our pricing outlook for 2020  Pricing continues to moderate on a year over year basis  How much of that is driven by comps  more aggressive competition or other factors  And finally  what are your expectations for a potential GRI Judy R  McReynolds    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerDavid  I ll take that  In our view  the pricing environment remains comparable with recent quarters  And we expect that the pricing environment will remain competitive but rational for 2020  Beginning with our space based pricing initiatives that we launched in August of 2017  we ve really had a 2 5 year period of very solid pricing success that included year over year increases of 8  to 10  in 2018 and continued solid increases in 2019  especially on our LTL rated freight  And with this strong base of increases during this past period  we would expect that our 2020 price increase levels will return to more normal rates of year over year increases As I just mentioned  our core LTL business continues to be priced solidly but the addition of some transactional shipments that both I talked about earlier and David also did has really impacted our yield metric  In addition to improving our business levels  those transactional shipments are contributing to improved operational metrics  including higher trailer load averages and some reductions in empty miles  And at this point we re evaluating the potential for 2020 GRI for ABF  but we haven t made any final decisions  There are a number of factors that go into our decision every year about whether to implement a GRI  including the market and competitive environment and some solid input from our sales group regarding their discussions with our customers David Humphrey    Vice President  Investor RelationsOkay  Ravi Shanker has stated that our weight per shipment was showing signs of stabilizing on a sequential basis  With easier comps  do you expect weight can begin to be up on a year over year basis in 2020  What do you think is a normal weight per shipment David R  Cobb    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  in our supplemental exhibit to the earnings release total weight per shipment in January increased 6 5  compared to January 2019 with our    with the weight per shipment on our LTL rated shipments increasing 2 5   We would say our normal weight per shipment is    runs around 1 000 pounds per shipment David Humphrey    Vice President  Investor RelationsOkay  Next Jason Seidl of Cowen ask what are the monthly contract pricing trends and renewals for the quarter  What are your expectations for pricing in the rest of the quarter and for the full year 2020 David R  Cobb    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Although we don t provide monthly information  for the fourth quarter we secured a 4 2  increase with our contract and deferred pricing renewal  January is running at historical first quarter average rates of around 3  to 4   We expect that the pricing environment will remain competitive but rational this year David Humphrey    Vice President  Investor RelationsKen pointed out regarding the press release that Judy said returning the Asset Based business to historic levels has been a stated long term goal  Given that there has been a bit of fluctuation in the historical margins  could you clarify what margin level she means and is there a timeline to get there Judy R  McReynolds    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerWell  David  I appreciate Ken s question and I think what he was referencing was some discussion that we had about our historic margins in relationship to paying the union incentives  So the contract provisions for paying our union incentives specified a minimum full year 96  operating ratio for making the payment  We were really pleased that our 95 2  OR in 2019 allowed us to pay 1  of union wages to our employees But when I talk about historical levels of profitability  I m really referring to annual asset base operating ratios in the low 90 s  And we certainly have more work to do to consistently attain those profitability levels  But our payment of the union incentive represents a significant step in moving in that direction As for when we get to those ORs  I don t really have a specific time frame to give you and that s    part of that s because of the cyclical nature of our business  So we are certainly working to get there as fast as possible and we do see opportunities for further efficiency gains in our operations And then with respect to our Asset Light business  we are targeting consistent 5  operating margins there David Humphrey    Vice President  Investor RelationsOkay  We had a question about the current demand environment  What are you seeing out there  Are you seeing any signs of normal seasonality coming back  Along those lines  how is January trending for you Judy R  McReynolds    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerThe current trends from the normal fall off after peak have continued in January  Our customers remain somewhat optimistic that seasonality will provide a lift as we move into March  The customers continue to be cautious about their businesses regarding the uncertainty around inventory levels  trade concerns and this year s US presidential elections  But I do believe it s helpful to have trade deals with China and the USMCA approved by the United States  Excess capacity in the market has encouraged our customer base to seek opportunities to optimize their current supply chain models and that has benefited us because many of our largest accounts are working with us to become more efficient  both from a cost and compliance perspective  This is providing opportunities for ArcBest to help solve these complex supply chain needs of our customers Yesterday in the 8 K that accompanied our earnings release  we provided an update on January business levels  And our January trends have improved due to some initiatives to fill available capacity in our asset based network as we ve been discussing  Our Asset Light business so far this year is more challenged as compared to a stronger January in 2019  We re currently experiencing a 3  reduction in revenue while our purchased transportation costs have actually increased about 2   A portion of this margin compression is market related  And the other part of it really relates to our mix of business David Humphrey    Vice President  Investor RelationsOkay  We had several    we had questions about the typical sequential change in asset based operating ratio from fourth quarter to first quarter  Are there any items that you believe will impact typical sequential change I ll just take that one and I ll point out that in our supplemental 8 K yesterday    yesterday afternoon  we mentioned that our first quarter OR has historically increased by approximately 400 basis points versus the first quarter  At this point there really are no significant puts or takes to mention that would impact what we would expect in the OR change relative to history There could be some items moving each way and some of these are unpredictable  especially weather events in the first quarter and property sales  And as you saw in the fourth quarter  we benefited from a gain on asset sales Ken had several questions about employee resources and head count  Given volume declines in the Asset Based segment  could you discuss ArcBest thinking with regard to headcount and resource needs  Is it possible we could see head count declines commensurate with volume declines  How much available capacity do you currently have given volume declines  Assuming resource cuts are needed and appropriate  could you achieve it through normal employee attrition Judy R  McReynolds    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerWell  we consistently work to match our labor needs to business levels with a combination of attrition and layoffs when necessary  However  during the seasonally weaker periods  we have a challenge and we have to address that challenge by balancing headcount reductions with service levels as our customers expect good service from us But in our dock and city operations  we currently have about 150 people on layoffs  And in addition  we have 60 fewer road drivers in the ABF network this month versus last year in January  so January of 2019 level  We are being very strategic with our head count as it relates to our business levels And from a line haul perspective  attrition in the fourth quarter really positioned us well for our current business levels as we start 2020  We ve made notable reductions in other areas of variable costs such as rents and purchased transportation  And because we have the flexibility to manage modes  we have initiatives to optimize our head count while also using our rail and purchased transportation partners  And with this flexibility  we re able to provide our best in class customer experience  while keeping headcount more in line with our business level Another bright spot I ll mention is our deployment of a number of tech and analytics management tools that really allows better visibility of needed manpower adjustments and we re looking forward to having the benefit of those in 2020 David Humphrey    Vice President  Investor RelationsThe next question was about the level of core cost inflation we should expect for ArcBest Asset Based segment in 2020 David R  Cobb    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThe majority of our Asset Based labor costs are impacted by the union labor agreement  which includes total annual cost increases that average about 2  per year for the life of the contract  And that is a very manageable cost increase and we appreciate having known labor cost stability for the remainder of the contract through mid 2023  We were very pleased to pay the  Indecipherable  operating ratio incentives at the 1  level since ABF achieved a 95 2  OR in 2019 that Judy mentioned  That amounted to  5 1 million of expense accrued in 2019 I also mentioned our revenue equipment has cost more in recent years and impacts are estimated 2020 depreciation expense that we disclosed in our supplemental 8 K and largely due to the safety features for technologies like lane departure  warning systems  collision mitigation and cameras And as we ve mentioned with our long term perspective  we continue to make technology and process investments in many areas targeted for growth opportunities including the efforts to improve customer experience and also to optimize cost  like Judy just mentioned  Those actions in cost may proceed the timing of the expected benefits David Humphrey    Vice President  Investor RelationsWith weight per shipment trend stabilizing and LTL tonnage now flat year over year in the Asset Based business  do you see an opportunity to outperform normal OR seasonality in the first quarter or would you expect to be roughly breakeven in that segment in the first quarter David R  Cobb    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerWe don t provide guidance on our expectations for the first quarter  But as noted in the supplemental exhibits in earnings release  we typically see the 400 basis point deterioration from fourth quarter to the first quarter  We are experiencing improvements in weight per shipment and generally larger shipments are beneficial to us  We are also encouraged with additional business which is filling available capacity in our system like we talked about  However  we did have a property gain in the fourth quarter and those events can be lumpy David Humphrey    Vice President  Investor RelationsWe had a question about how much of a margin headwind is represented by the union profit sharing agreement as we move toward our long term margin goals David R  Cobb    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  we provided some additional information about the union operating ratio incentive in our supplemental exhibit  The ABF OR of 95 2   as we mentioned  plus the bonus expense of about  5 1 million  that s a 1  payout on union wages  But if the profit sharing burdens would increase to 2  of employee wages for an operating ratio of between 93 1  to 95   then the bonus would increase to 3  of employee wages for an operating ratio of better than a 93  David Humphrey    Vice President  Investor RelationsConsidering the fact that insurance is currently a big truckload cost factor  is this a headwind for ABF in 2020 David R  Cobb    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  while we ve seen a modest increase for 2020  it isn t a major headwind for ABF  As was pointed out by the question  the insurance market has tightened this year on the heels of some very large verdicts against transportation carriers  Our understanding is that many carriers have had difficulty placing their coverage needs with insurance companies that are still willing to be in this market ABF has a long history of being a safe carrier and we ve made substantial investments in technology  in our tractors and in our safety programs like I just mentioned  But as a result of our safety focus and the work of our employees  we ve had a very good loss history  So that helps us with insurance renewals  Nevertheless because of the market pricing increase  we will have some incremental cost headwinds somewhere around  2 million David Humphrey    Vice President  Investor RelationsWe received several questions about our recently announced technology investments from several analysts  including Jack  Todd  Ravi  Chris and Stephanie  Could you give us an update on the technology investments within your Asset Based operations  Can you provide an update on the pilot break testing program or freight handling program  In how many locations is it currently being tested Judy R  McReynolds    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerWell  David  thanks for the question  Currently  the primary testing is occurring in two locations in Indiana  The test results of these initial pilots have been positive and we re working to open a facility in Kansas City where a distribution center test is expected to begin in late summer of this year  Testing the process in a distribution center setting will give us a better understanding of the challenges of conducting this operation in a larger  more active service center environment It will also help us to determine the proof of concept that will ultimately help us decide if we go forward with implementing it throughout the entire ABF network  There really isn t much more detail to provide at this time until we do this testing and have some time to analyze the results  But we are pleased with the technologies and processes that are being evaluated in the pilot and their potential to provide a better experience for our employees and our customers  reducing the amount of time that freight is idle  improving transit performance  reducing cargo planes and injuries and accelerating the employee training time David Humphrey    Vice President  Investor RelationsOkay  Also regarding the pilot freight handling program they ask at what point could this move from a pilot to an actual application and what impact did that have on your financials  Is there an end point to the spending  or should we assume it persists for the foreseeable future  Can you give us a sense of what the spending level in 2020 will look like Judy R  McReynolds    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerWell  in the third and fourth quarters of 2019  we reported this additional technology spend in the Asset Based segment and it was approximately  4 5 million in each quarter or a total of  9 million in the second half of 2019  We also expect that these related costs in the first quarter of this year    that will be approximately  5 million and that s versus  2 million in the first quarter of 2019 in the Asset Based segment At this early stages of pilot  we aren t providing projections beyond the first quarter as there are a number of factors that are being evaluated that would also impact future costs  And moving along during the year  we will provide our expected costs for the next quarter when we report each quarter s earnings The transition of the pilot to Kansas City in a distribution center environment later this summer will lead to some incremental testing costs  Our modeling shows though that this project should produce returns that meet our internal benchmarks and these pilot tests are being conducted to further prove this concept and the associated results David Humphrey    Vice President  Investor RelationsOkay  Are you seeing real estate opportunities from large competitor downsizing David R  Cobb    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerIn reference to the various LTL company closures occurred    that occurred throughout 2019  we are always aware of what properties and locations become available  But there really weren t any properties of interest to us and we didn t add any as a result of those closures David Humphrey    Vice President  Investor RelationsCould you provide additional color on the asset sale gain reported in fourth quarter  Do you expect additional asset sales in 2020 David R  Cobb    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThe gain that was reported was related to the sale of unused service center at ABF  As this regularly happens  this was a situation where we relocated into a new facility and we were able to sell our former service center  This happens periodically as we buy and sell real estate  but the timing is always typically unpredictable We will likely have similar real estate gains at some point during the year  but  like I said  the timing and the financial impacts are unknown this time David Humphrey    Vice President  Investor RelationsOkay  Chris Wetherbee asks about what steps can be taken from a cost reduction standpoint to improve profitability in our ArcBest segment  Should we expect to see revenue per day trends improve further in the remainder of first quarter  And Jack Atkins wondered if there are levers we can pull on the cost side to support or even improve profitability in that segment in 2020  And that business see an improvement in profitability this year  absent a recovery in the freight market Judy R  McReynolds    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerWe recognize the need to improve our Asset Light operating performance and we re focused on the deployment of technologies and cognitive engagement strategies to automate and optimize processes  which should help us increase employee productivity and improve the customer experience  Some examples of automation that we re beginning to utilize are shipment tracking and email management  as well as digital freight matching  And so that the advancements that we ve made in our Asset Light business in 2019 should provide greater operating cost efficiencies in 2020 Although we do continue the expectation to invest  we feel like there is even further improvements that we could make that should positively impact our performance in 2021 and beyond But if you look at this    the overall cost for our Asset Light segment  some of those are fixed in nature and really could be better leveraged with greater revenue growth  So we remain focused on gaining that growth through our cross selling strategy and that s both within our existing customer base where there is a large opportunity  but we can also focus on selling multiple solutions or overall solutions to new customers But we have to keep in mind that in order to aggressively grow our Asset Light service offerings  we have to maintain a high level of service because that s what our customers expect  So we re balancing all of these things to gain an improvement in the growth and the overall results But if the freight market remains in recession and customer and carrier rates remain at current levels  it will be difficult to materially improve our margins and operating results in the near term  The costs that we ve previously discussed that are associated with the building of ArcBest owner operator and contract carrier capacity should normalize in 2020 so that should help  But as always  we continue to manage head count in our Asset Light operations to our shipment volumes and we re continuously looking to further improve the efficiencies of our workforce David Humphrey    Vice President  Investor RelationsCan your Asset Light expedite business get back to the prior margin levels  absent a big capacity carnage Judy R  McReynolds    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerIn 2018  we experienced a strong demand environment and tight capacity  which generated tremendous value for customers through their utilization of our ground expedite solution or service offerings  In 2019 we had something different  We experienced a freight recession  excess truckload capacity  which reduced the demand for some ground expedite solutions  And as we began this year  we aren t experiencing much of a change from 2019  But we believe that as the demand environment improves and capacity stabilizes  we would expect the trends for ground expedite volumes and pricing to improve consistent with our past history David Humphrey    Vice President  Investor RelationsRavi pointed out that comps in the Asset Light business began to get easier in the first quarter of this year  Do you anticipate year over year growth in that business  Are you seeing any heightened competition in any particular pocket of the Asset Light business David R  Cobb    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I d say that the Asset Light result is really a reflection of the recessionary freight environment and excess available capacity  As Judy mentioned  so far in this year we aren t seeing much of a change from that  And as we probably talked about before  a large portion of our business is transactional in nature and with this weaker spot market it s negatively impacted our results  We don t really point to certain regions or customers or lanes that are experiencing an unusual amount of competition  But Judy mentioned this earlier also  our managed solutions and supply chain optimization work with customers are particularly responsive in this environment and we are encouraged by the pipeline of opportunities that we have there As noted throughout 2019 our expedite business has been impacted by that excess market capacity and as a result there have been lower tender rejection rates David Humphrey    Vice President  Investor RelationsAgain on the Asset Light side you discussed various market driven pressures  Could you elaborate  How much of the margin deterioration is a reflection of competitive pressure from brokers undercutting pricing and thereby squeezing margins  How much is normal cyclicality David R  Cobb    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerWell  I would just say that the margin compression in the fourth quarter was really more about tightening capacity and less about other brokers cutting prices  Specifically  we saw this happen between Thanksgiving and Christmas David Humphrey    Vice President  Investor RelationsOkay  What is your appetite for Asset Light M A in 2020  Do you have any interest in the assets that XPO has announced it is looking to sell  Are there any segments  geographies or deal sizes that are more attractive to you  How do you view current valuation multiples Judy R  McReynolds    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerWhile we won t comment on specific target  we continue to review M A opportunity  We re more interested in Asset Light opportunities that could benefit us in terms of scale and or technology advancements and that s really been our focus for some time  More recently  we ve been less interested in small tuck in deals unless there is a potential for some significant outsized tech or other strategic advancement We also see tremendous opportunity through organic growth for our Company and as well as some operational efficiencies that could improve our overall results  When we step back and look at valuation multiples  they still seem a little bit high to us David Humphrey    Vice President  Investor RelationsIs there a way to help us quantify the progress you re making cross selling your services  Could you share the percentage of revenue tied to customers that utilize two or more services Judy R  McReynolds    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerBased on the needs of our customers  cross selling continues to be an important component of our strategy with 80  of our customers needing two or more of the solutions that we provide  Currently approximately 38  of our customer base uses us for multiple services  These customers comprise more than 80  of our total revenue  But we know we still have a significant amount of their wallet share available to us and that s within the customers that are already using us for multiple services  So we re encouraged by that opportunity For customers that are cross sold  we see significant jump in revenue per customer  profit per customer and retention versus those customers that are not cross sold  All of those benefit us  And so  we re really still aggressively pursuing this cross selling strategy David Humphrey    Vice President  Investor RelationsOkay  Todd Fowler asks  please discuss your e commerce initiatives  What percentage of your business do you think is e commerce  How do the margins on this  Indecipherable  compare to overall margins  And what are your expectations for growth in this area going forward Judy R  McReynolds    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerWell  I appreciate  Todd  questions  And    while it s difficult to quantify the overall percentage of our revenue or margin impacted by e commerce  our current point of view is that we continue to benefit from e commerce opportunities within our customers  Our e commerce customers have shown increasing interest in the solutions we provide and a great example is Retail   which is a compliance solution for vendors to help them better meet large retailers  stringent shipping and delivery requirements We created Retail  in collaboration with our customers and our tech folks and that these customers that participate are really suppliers to major retailers and we re seeing the demand for our Retail  services accelerate  This ongoing co creation program really provides robust compliance management solutions that enhance ArcBest s existing retail logistics services by combining innovative software solutions with enhanced operating processes  This is the type of solution that relies on our logistics expertise  our assets and our relationships to improve these customers  outcome We also see e commerce driving the demand for our managed solutions  especially with the increased complexity and need for flexibility in supply chains to be more responsive to the consumer  Final mile is another area where we see the impact of e commerce and we ve been uniquely positioned to provide value in this area for over a decade  And more broadly  our focus on digital connectivity and information flow with our customers as well as our emphasis on customer experience have really positioned us well in our conversations around the e commerce business  We see e commerce as a continuing secular growth story as e commerce only represents a percentage in the low teens of total retail sales according to the Federal Reserve So overall  we see continued growth opportunity for our business that relates to e commerce in the first mile  middle mile and final mile transportation and in providing managed solutions and these other tailored solutions like I mentioned with Retail  David Humphrey    Vice President  Investor RelationsStephanie and Ken ask about the macro environment and its impact on our ability to reach our long term margin goals  What is your outlook for manufacturing and industrial activity in 2020  Do you believe  we ve seen the bottom in 2019 David R  Cobb    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I ll first point to the Industrial Production Index  which continued to trend downwards throughout 2019 and really ever since September of 2019  this metric has been lower than the prior year  The PMI steadily declined throughout 2019 and was 47 2  in December  and that s the lowest level since June of 2009 when it was about 46 3   I think  All that indicates contraction in the manufacturing sector  And this is compared to a PMI that was 54 2  in January of 2019  so last year PMI is considered a leading indicator in our LTL business  So it s kind of hard to determine if we ve reached the bottom of this downturn  Indecipherable   The current economic environment as well as excess truckload capacity present the challenges to our growth in operating performance  But as Judy mentioned there are a lot of opportunities  We re focused on managing our resources to the level of business we have while keeping in mind that our customers expect that high level of service  I d just reiterate that we re better positioned today than the last time the freight environment was at this weak level Our logistics solutions provide optimized options for customers  And the sophistication level of the average customers increased  we ve seen that just time and time again  and there is a desire to evaluate the options to reduce cost out of their supply chains  As we ve mentioned  our managed solution growth reflects the value that we provide our customers and our Asset Based segment also benefits from that managed solutions growth David Humphrey    Vice President  Investor RelationsOkay  How the recent tariff and trade resolutions with Mexico and China impact the business  if at all David R  Cobb    Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  we expect those resolutions to have a positive impact but it might be a while before we see the effects of that David Humphrey    Vice President  Investor RelationsOkay  And then finally for our last question  We had a question about our strategy for offering a suite of transportation services beyond LTL and about the progress we ve made during 2019 in doing that  Judy  do you want to wrap up the call with an answer to that one Judy R  McReynolds    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerAnd I d like to say how much I appreciate all the questions that we received really because it s has been beneficial  So with respect to that question  when I took over leadership of ArcBest 10 years ago  our focus was primarily on the LTL services offered by ABF  We really were not fully equipped to address the complete needs of our customers and we struggled during one of the worst economic periods in our century s history  But since that time  we have embarked on a strategy based on listening to the needs of our customers and have developed logistics service capabilities that have allowed us to really partner with them to optimize their supply chain  And now we are a logistics company that offers most any service our customers require  And we focus on meeting their needs by offering an array of these integrated solutions And as I described in my introductory comments on the call  we ve developed many innovative technologies that make us more efficient and allow our customers to interact with us in the way that they prefer  During 2019  we continued to have solid success  As we ve mentioned several times about our managed transportation solutions to our customers  we re excited that our pipeline remains strong and the managed transportation deals we re seeing continues to grow as we see new business flowing in But because of the transformation that we ve gone through in the last decade  we are really bullish about the future and we believe we re equipped to be successful in any economic environment we encounter  Thank you  David David Humphrey    Vice President  Investor RelationsOkay  Well we appreciate everybody taking the time to send in questions last night  We thank you for joining us this morning and we appreciate your interest in ArcBest  This concludes our call Operator Operator Closing Remarks Duration  58 minutesCall participants David Humphrey    Vice President
