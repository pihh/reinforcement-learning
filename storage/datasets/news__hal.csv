 everyone  2019 solidified the pivot from growth to capital discipline in North America and marked another step on the road to recovery in the international markets  I m pleased with the way the Halliburton team executed our value proposition  delivered exceptional safety and service quality and stayed focused on generating healthy returns and strong free cash flow  I thank our outstanding Halliburton employees for their hard work and execution the entire year 2020 opens a new decade and a new century for Halliburton  It brings new opportunities that I will address in a few minutes  but first  some headlines for the full year and fourth quarter of 2019  We finished 2019 with total company revenue of  22 billion and adjusted operating income of  2 1 billion  I am pleased with the continued recovery in our international business  We increased revenue 10   outgrowing the international rig count for the second year in a row  North America revenue declined 18  as a result of customer activity and pricing reductions and our decision to focus on those customers that provide the best returns Systematically improving our service delivery  immediate cost reductions and the growth in non frac product lines allowed us to stem the margin erosion  We delivered over  900 million of free cash flow for the full year  demonstrating our ability to generate consistent free cash flow throughout different business environments Finally  2019 was an exceptional year for our safety and service quality performance  Our total recordable incident rate and non productive time both improved by over 20   historical bests across our business  This is a result of our employees  continued commitment to safety and process execution And now  a few points about the fourth quarter  We finished the quarter with total company revenue of  5 2 billion  a 6  sequential decrease and adjusted operating income of  546 million  an increase of 2  quarter over quarter  Our Completion   Production division revenue declined 13  sequentially and operating margin remained essentially flat  Our Drilling   Evaluation division delivered a strong quarter  We grew revenue 4  and improved operating margins 300 basis points sequentially  D E international margins grew significantly  offset by margin decline in North America While our North America business declined due to the significantly lower activity in US land  internationally we delivered 10  revenue growth this quarter  This underscores the versatility and global reach of our business  In the fourth quarter  we took a  2 2 billion largely non cash impairment charge and made strategic decisions to market for sale our pipeline services and well controlled product lines As I mentioned  2020 brings plenty of opportunities  The oil price is more constructive as we enter the year  The imminent global recession fears have abated with the help of economic easing from the leading central banks  US production growth is slowing because of constricted capital flows  The increase in non US non OPEC supply coming into the market is limited  The geopolitical instability in the key oil producing region of the world should add an incremental risk premium to the commodity prices in the near term  That said  oil prices are still supported by the OPEC  cut and will fluctuate based on the group s resolve to continue limiting production  Gas prices in the US are below breakeven levels  US drilling and completions activity may be biased lower due to the consolidation and restricted access to capital Halliburton is no stranger to navigating choppy waters  We entered 2020 and our next century with a clear sense of purpose  We will continue to do what we do best  collaborate and engineer solutions to maximize our customer s asset value while generating industry leading returns and sustainable cash flow for our shareholders  We will do this with attention to the sustainability of our business  minimizing environmental impact and acting as a responsible corporate citizen The international markets presented plenty of growth opportunities in 2019  We grew revenue 10  year over year  closing stronger than anticipated  All regions increased revenue led by Asia Pacific  Latin America and Europe  Both our divisions meaningfully contributed to the international growth  Completion   Production led the charge with 13  expansion due to higher activity in mature fields in Europe and unconventionals in Argentina  the UAE and Australia  Drilling   Evaluation grew international revenues 8  as we increased activity levels in all markets  specifically in Norway  Mexico  China and Nigeria In 2020  we expect the international spend by our customers to increase by mid single digits  making it the third consecutive year of spending growth  We have the right footprint and an enhanced technology portfolio to compete and win across the international markets  We expect to grow at or above the market rate this year  consistently focusing on profitable growth and improving our international margins  Continued gas activity expansion in the Middle East  resolution of political issues in Latin America and several pending project awards may enable us to outgrow the market again in 2020 Our Drilling   Evaluation division is poised to grow faster as we get the benefit of the full year in our Norway integrated contracts  the iCruise directional drilling platform rollout continues and new offshore drilling activity starts up around the world The international revenue growth should follow the historical cyclicality  In the first quarter  we expect international revenue to decline due to normal seasonality and the elimination of year end sales  Thereafter  we should see steady growth that would peak in the fourth quarter This year  we expect to increase our international margins  We anticipate higher utilization for our existing equipment in busy markets like the North Sea and Asia Pacific  Our project pipeline is strong  and the incremental activity will help tighten tool availability and absorb the existing cost structure  We intend to be prudent with capital allocation  driving our organization to have the right pricing discussions with customers  Given the tool tightness in some product lines and geographies  we are strategically reallocating assets to the best returning opportunities Pricing in certain international regions is improving  and we expect this momentum to continue throughout 2020  About one third of our book of business is awarded every year  the remaining two thirds are existing contracts and contract extensions  We re gaining pricing traction on new work and contract renewals and we re making strategic choices about the work we pursue  I believe the capital and pricing discipline across all geographies will allow Halliburton to deliver rational returns driven growth in the international markets Turning to North America  The US shale industry is facing its biggest test since the 2015 downturn with both capital discipline and slowing leading edge efficiency gains weighing down activity and production  As expected in the fourth quarter  customer activity declined across all basins of North America land  affecting both our Drilling and Completions businesses  The rig count in US land contracted 11  sequentially  and completed stages had the largest drop we have seen in recent history  While holidays and weather were the usual factors  other reasons for this air pocket inactivity included our customers  free cash flow generation commitment and an oversupplied gas market With this backdrop  Halliburton followed our playbook and continued to proactively manage our fleet count  As announced last quarter  we also proactively cut costs and started the implementation of the strategy to sustainably improve our service delivery  Those actions allowed us to curb margin declines in North America and deliver lower detrimentals year on year  even though the industry s sequential activity drop was much more severe than in the fourth quarter of 2018 In the fourth quarter  the market saw clear public evidence of the long awaited equipment attrition  This is just the beginning  We believe a lot more equipment will exit the market as lower demand  increasing service intensity and insufficient returns take their toll  As service companies cannibalize idle equipment for parts and use sidelined pumps to beef up working fleets  the available horsepower supply in the market may be smaller than some think  Halliburton has continued doing what we said we were doing  stacking equipment to improve our returns  We exited 2019 with 22  less available fracturing horsepower  We ve rationalized our equipment supply to the anticipated level of demand in 2020  The size and scale of our business in North America give us the ability to right size without sacrificing our market leadership position and the value that comes with it In the fourth quarter  we started the implementation of our  300 million annualized cost savings and service delivery improvement strategy  We moved quickly to execute the initial personnel reductions and real estate rationalization  all with an eye to improving on our near term financial performance  We ve achieved about  200 million in savings on a run rate basis in the fourth quarter  While this impacts our business globally  the majority of the savings are geared toward North America We are looking at 2020 with pragmatism  Early indications are that our US land customers will reduce capital spending approximately 10  from 2019 levels  I believe that the current level of DUCs in the market will allow operators to spend less money on new well construction and direct more of it to completions  Depressed gas pricing is negatively affecting the activity outlook in the gassy basins  which will likely bear the brunt of the activity reductions in 2020 In the first quarter  operators will reload their budgets and we expect modest improvement in completions activity as a result  That said  the calendar cadence where some operators are biased to spend more earlier in the year will likely remain  Halliburton will continue to be proactive in taking actions to generate industry leading returns and strong free cash flow in this environment  Here are the more significant actions After systematically rationalizing equipment in 2019 to adjust to changing activity levels  in 2020  we plan to provide the capacity that maximizes the returns on our overall fleet  This should also allow us to be efficient about our workforce and maintenance planning and to achieve higher utilization of existing fleets throughout the year  Pricing pressure was considerable during the year end tendering season  Consistent with our capital disciplined approach  we ve taken on contracts that are expected to allow our portfolio to earn acceptable returns and decline those that are not  I like the slice of the market that we re choosing to participate in this year  Our high graded customer portfolio gives us confidence in a more sustainable demand level and a mix of pricing and volume that generates returns for Halliburton Make no mistake  we will continue developing technologies whose value accrues to Halliburton and not just to our customers  Our integrated completions offering and the iCruise rotary steerable system are prime examples of such technologies  They should allow us to reduce our capital outlay and deliver better margins  all with the purpose of generating strong returns We plan to continue strategically growing our share of services per well by increasing the competitiveness of our non hydraulic fracturing businesses in North America  Our wireline and perforating  artificial lift and specialty chemical product lines all posted strong double digit revenue growth in 2019 despite the overall market softness in US land  We intend to keep this momentum and spread it to other services Finally  we will continue the implementation of our service delivery improvement strategy  Halliburton is redesigning the way we deliver our fracturing services in order to lower our unit cost and improve margins and returns in the long run 2019 closed the decade of the shale revolution that transformed the United States into the world s top hydrocarbon producer  Halliburton was an early participant in this development and has been investing in it and innovating ever since hand in hand with our customers  As unconventionals enter maturation phase  Halliburton is committed to the North American market and taking appropriate actions to thrive in the new environment I ll now turn the call over to Lance to provide more details on our financial results  Then I will return to discuss digitalization  a topic that will define the next decade for our industry  Lance Lance Loeffler    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Jeff  and good morning  Let s begin with an overview of our fourth quarter results compared to the third quarter of 2019  Total company revenue for the quarter was  5 2 billion  a decrease of 6   and adjusted operating income was  546 million  an increase of 2   During the fourth quarter  we recognized  2 2 billion of pre tax impairments and other charges to further adjust our cost structure to current market conditions  These charges consisted largely of non cash asset impairments mostly associated with pressure pumping and legacy drilling equipment  They also included approximately  100 million of cash costs primarily related to severance As a result of the charge in the fourth quarter  we recognized a benefit of approximately  35 million from a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense  which reflects two months of DD A impact  The after tax impact of this reduction in the fourth quarter is approximately  0 03 of EPS  of which  0 02 is included in our Completion   Production results and the remainder in Drilling   Evaluation numbers  As Jeff mentioned  we ve also accomplished a significant portion of our intended annualized cost reductions with the remainder to come in the first quarter Let me take a moment to discuss our divisional results in more detail  In our Completion   Production division  revenue was  3 1 billion  while operating income was  387 million  both decreased 13   Reduced activity and pricing in multiple product service lines primarily associated with stimulation services in North America land  coupled with lower activity for stimulation services in Latin America and well intervention services in the Middle East  drove our results  These declines were partially offset by higher pressure pumping activity in the Eastern Hemisphere coupled with year end completion tool sales globally In our Drilling   Evaluation division  revenue was  2 1 billion  an increase of 4   while operating income was  224 million  an increase of 49   These results were primarily driven by increased activity in all product service lines in the Middle East Asia  coupled with higher drilling activity in Europe Africa CIS and year end software sales globally  These improvements were partially offset by lower drilling activity in North America and reduced testing activity in Latin America Moving on to our geographical results  In North America  revenue was  2 3 billion  a 21  decrease  This decline was mainly due to lower activity and pricing in North America land  primarily associated with pressure pumping and well construction  This decline was partially offset by higher year end completion tool sales in the Gulf of Mexico  In Latin America  revenue was  598 million  a 2  decrease  resulting primarily from lower activity in multiple product service lines in Argentina  coupled with decreased testing activity across the region  These results were partially offset by higher activity for all product service lines in Colombia  increased project management activity and cloud infrastructure installations in Mexico and higher year end completion tool sales across the region Turning to Europe Africa CIS  revenue was  883 million  a 6  increase  resulting primarily from increased well construction activity in the North Sea  coupled with increased activity in multiple product service lines in Algeria  These improvements were partially offset by lower pipeline services across the region  In Middle East Asia  revenue was  1 4 billion  a 19  increase sequentially  largely resulting from increased activity in multiple product service lines across the Middle East  India and China  higher pressure pumping activity in Australasia and higher year end completion tool sales across the region  These results were partially offset by lower well intervention services in the Middle East In the fourth quarter  our Corporate   Other expense totaled  65 million  and we expect it to be the same in the first quarter of 2020  Net interest expense for the quarter was  141 million and should remain approximately the same for the first quarter  Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was approximately 22   Based on the market environment and our expected geographic earnings mix  we expect our 2020 first quarter effective tax rate to be approximately 21  with the projected full year tax rate of approximately 23  We earned approximately  1 2 billion of cash from operations during the fourth quarter  As expected  we improved our working capital and generated strong free cash flow of approximately  827 million for the quarter  delivering approximately  1 billion of free cash flow for the full year  excluding the cash impact of the restructuring charges I discussed earlier  As a result  we ended the year with  2 3 billion in cash Capital expenditures during the quarter were  340 million with our 2019 full year capex ending just above  1 5 billion  As we look ahead to this year  we intend to reduce our capital expenditures by approximately 20  to  1 2 billion  We believe this level of spend will still allow us to invest in our anticipated international growth while continuing to rationalize our business to the current market conditions in North America Within this reduced capex budget  we will continue investing in and growing our production group businesses  namely  constructing a chemical manufacturing plant in Saudi Arabia and expanding our artificial lift footprint  We will also move forward with the iCruise system global rollout but at a more normalized pace than what we accomplished over the last couple of years Our digital efforts and new technologies aimed at improving our efficiency and reducing our operating costs will also get an appropriate share of spend  We believe our capital allocation decisions are consistent with our focus on generating strong cash flow for our investors  regardless of the market environment  Finally  let me provide you with some comments on how we see the first quarter playing out As is typical  our results will be subject to weather related seasonality and the roll off of year end sales  which will mostly impact our international business  North America will see a modest increase in completions activity  as Jeff described earlier  We will continue to pull the levers that allow us to mitigate margin declines across the business this quarter  As such  in our Completion   Production division  we expect sequential revenue to increase 2  to 4  with margins declining 125 to 150 basis points  For our Drilling   Evaluation division  we anticipate sequential revenue will decline 4  to 6  with margins decreasing 200 to 250 basis points I ll now turn the call back over to Jeff  Jeff Jeff Miller    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Lance  One of the key trends that will define the new decade in our industry is digitalization  The next 10 years will see digital technologies and artificial intelligence going mainstream  just like the smartphones did in the last decade  In the oil and gas industry  digitalization unlocks the potential to structurally lower costs  shorten the time to first oil  increase optionality in exploration and production and enhance performance across the entire value chain Digital is not a separate strategy at Halliburton  Rather  it is an integral part of our value proposition  Our ability to collaborate  engineer solutions and maximize customers  asset value is evolving through the seamless integration of digital technologies into our operations  Digital permeates everything we do and has the same goal as our business strategy  deliver value for our customers and returns for our shareholders At Halliburton  we are hard at work on the next frontier solutions that will shift the balance in the people  process  technology triad by replacing labor and reducing capital investments through automation and self learning processes  We believe this will allow us to harness the transformative power of digitalization and make a quantum leap in productivity  similar to going from horses to horsepower  It takes time to build the scalable software and hardware infrastructure required to fully capitalize on digital solutions  We re well along that path and have been building up our digital capabilities for a number of years with a long term view of how digitization will evolve  I m pleased with the internal and customer adoption we re seeing Halliburton is in a unique position to reap the benefits of the industry s move toward digitalization  Our Landmark product line is an established leader in petrotechnical software with a powerful cloud enabled DecisionSpace 365 software platform  In 2019  the cloud native software was our fastest growing business within Landmark  increasing revenues 50  year over year Landmark provides us a solid foundation established through decades of investment in software development  people  domain expertise and processes to create and scale digital solutions  This benefits all of our product lines  In addition  we have strategic partnerships with Accenture  Microsoft  AWS and Schneider Electric  all of which validate and expand both our vision and our capabilities  We now have over 100 customers with thousands of users across the globe leveraging our iEnergy digital ecosystem to integrate software and workflows across their organizations  regardless if they re Halliburton s  third party or internally developed  This open architecture platform is unique in the industry and  in our view  is the necessary condition for the successful adoption and scaling of digital solutions True to our DNA  we are also bringing to market practical  smart and interconnected products and services that help unlock value for us and our customers  We re pioneering new approaches to subsurface understanding  well construction and reservoir recovery  Let me spend a few minutes on each First  we transformed subsurface understanding using big data  digital frameworks and evergreen models  We ve created a unique geological model of the entire earth to provide insights into the origin and productivity of reservoirs  Once drilling starts  we deliver improved field measurements with next generation wireline and logging while drilling tools  fiber and sensors  We then translate these measurements into faster and more informed decision making using a new class of models made possible by digital technologies  For example  our EarthStar ultra deep resistivity sensor automatically feeds into our industry first scalable earth model that updates in real time  Customers can now make faster decisions about their development programs and reduce cycle times by a factor of 10 Second  we improve well construction through collaborative well engineering and drilling automation  Landmark s digital well program enables seamless collaboration between operators and service companies across a multitude of software platforms  The iCruise drilling system increases the number of built in sensors by a factor of 5 and offers self guiding capabilities  Working with our rig partners  our digital twin technology delivers better collaboration and faster decision making  All of these solutions boost efficiencies and lower costs  while demanning the process of well construction Last but not least  we improved recovery and production by using our digitally enabled tools to connect customers  assets and leveraging this to monitor and enhance performance outcomes  In completions  we use our intelligent completions for monitoring production trends and connecting them to broader reservoir management studies  In artificial lift  we leveraged digital to monitor ESP health and extend run life  In stimulation  we use our industry leading fracture modeling software and full scale asset simulator to model fracture propagation and frac hits  These are examples of how we deliver digital innovation today  with a focus on specific domains and aligned with the customers  buying behavior  They provide immediate value to customers  increased customer loyalty and generate returns for Halliburton  Over time  we believe digitalization will seamlessly connect subsurface  drilling and production  enabling customers to make asset level decisions at the speed of execution  We have a solid foundation  the tools  the open architecture and the domain expertise to successfully deliver this vision Let me summarize what we ve talked about today  In 2020  Halliburton is focused on delivering margin expansion  industry leading returns and strong free cash flow  In our view  international growth will continue  Increased activity  disciplined capital allocation  pricing improvements and our ability to compete for a larger share of high margin services  we believe  will lead to international margin expansion in 2020 As North America customer spending declines again this year  Halliburton will continue to execute our playbook to maximize returns and free cash flow  We plan to provide the service capacity that we believe will maximize the returns on our overall fleet  continue to invest in technologies that improve margins  keep strategically growing our non hydraulic fracturing product service lines and continue the implementation of our service delivery improvement strategy  We believe digitalization will define this decade in our industry  Halliburton continues to move full steam ahead on the digital journey and is uniquely positioned to reap its benefits And now  let s open it up for questions Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions  Our first question comes from the line of James West with Evercore ISI  Your line is now open James West    Evercore ISI    AnalystHey  Good morning  Jeff  Good morning  Lance Jeff Miller    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  James James West    Evercore ISI    AnalystSo  Jeff  toward the end of your prepared comments  you ve talked a lot about international and international margin progression  I wondered if we could dig into a little more detail there with mid single digit  it sounds like growth  you may be able to outpace that a touch here as well  plus you re seeing some pockets of pricing strength  How should we think about the margin expansion as we go through the year  what type of incrementals should we be expecting Jeff Miller    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Well  thanks  James  Look  I think I spent a fair amount of time on the catalysts themselves  obviously activity improving  rational project choices and technologies  I think  the key is  it s going to be shaped    we re starting at a higher point going into Q1 than we certainly did last year  And then  I would expect the shape of that to look similar where we start and it moves up a little  just that shape of the international margins should stay consistent  but obviously starting from a hard point James West    Evercore ISI    AnalystOkay  Okay  fair enough  And then  maybe for Lance here  on the free cash flow next year looks like it s going to be pretty significant based on some growth but also lower capex here  How should we think about when we re going to see the free cash flow start to show up  will it be similar to this year or it should be backend loaded or would it be more even throughout the year Lance Loeffler    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Look  I think you re right in terms of the expectations to grow free cash flow this year  You re right around the    I don t think that the    our ability to drive sort of the working capital consumption is going to remain in the first half of the year like it has historically for us  I expect some of the extreme volatility that we saw last year to not repeat this year  but there still is a consumption of cash from a working capital perspective  But overall  with the reduction in capex  the improvement around margins and some stability around our working capital  we expect free cash flow to grow in 2020 James West    Evercore ISI    AnalystGood  Thanks  guys Lance Loeffler    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you OperatorOur next question comes from Sean Meakim with JPMorgan  Your line is now open Sean Meakim    JPMorgan    AnalystHey  Good morning Jeff Miller    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning Sean Meakim    JPMorgan    AnalystSo  you touched on the margin progression internationally  Can you maybe just talk about how that translates into D E in 2020  So we had the margin ramp in 4Q  maybe 70 basis points or so comes from the D E benefit that will help year on year in  20  But  can we see 2020 margins on a full year basis get back to 2017  2018 levels  Do we think we can get back to a double digit type of outcome for the year  And I m just curious how you think investors will get comfortable with the trajectory like that  just given it s been a difficult business to forecast last couple of years Jeff Miller    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Sean  it has been difficult to forecast  but we ve done a lot of things during that time  So  the platform around our iCruise technology and EarthStar has been rolling out  At the same time  we re seeing international    a lot of international choppiness  now we see some recovery sort of happening  which obviously lends itself toward D E  And so  I think these are multi year efforts that we    and we view them that way  I d say  digital as well will contribute to probably early days to D E  So  for all of those reasons  I don t think it s unreasonable also to expect that we get back to  I think  2018 looking kind of number or beyond Sean Meakim    JPMorgan    AnalystGot it  Okay  Thank you for that  And then  so on the digital strategy  competitors made a lot more noise about their strategy maybe than you have so far  But the  Indecipherable  Repsol contracts sound pretty similar in terms of the offering  Could you maybe just expand a little bit in terms of the scalability that you see for those types of avenues maybe across a broader set of customers and where you see the most opportunity Jeff Miller    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I think I tried to describe today our vision around digital and then the mechanics for realizing that vision  which then quickly becomes in today s market what are the things we actually do  So  I used an example of some of the tools that are in the market  As we integrate those  obviously the moat expands around those  So  I think it will take many forms over time  Again  it will be big projects  which we ve talked about a few of those where it s either a cloud infrastructure and the cloud environment that we either install or operate  and we ve got examples of each of those  But equally important will be the day in  day out march around how this work really gets done  which is around drilling  production and reservoir filling in those spaces with tools that all contribute to that vision  And so  I think that there is a lot of scalability here And I think what s most important is really the production capital that Halliburton has invested in Landmark that really makes it scalable  In fact  to do these things at scale  there s a lot of discipline and practice and agile DevOps that are required at scale to reliably develop software and then operate  maintain and then ultimately continue to advance  and we have that  So  I m really confident in how that rolled out over the longer term  And I think the thing to focus on is  what are those tools that we re doing now that deliver returns  Obviously they contribute to the vision Sean Meakim    JPMorgan    AnalystGot it  Very helpful  Thank you Jeff Miller    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Angie Sedita with Goldman Sachs  Your line is now open Angie Sedita    Goldman Sachs    AnalystThanks  Good morning  guys Jeff Miller    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Angie Angie Sedita    Goldman Sachs    AnalystSo  Jeff  on C P specific to North America  could you talk a little bit about the cost cutting that s unwinding here  You said you have a  100 million left  Is there more that could be done beyond that  100 million  It s for Jeff or Lance  And then  maybe you could talk also about the pricing  Have you seen the market starting to stabilize on the frac side for pricing  are you still seeing pressure in frac and across the other product lines Jeff Miller    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Thanks  Angie  Look  the  300 million in savings  and we ve moved quickly on that  And I think  the  200 million that we ve taken out on an annualized basis already  expect to get the rest of that done in Q1  And I think that really speaks to how that team in North America executes  And we execute very quickly and with a lot of purpose  And so  obviously that contributes Beyond that  we ve talked about our playbook and how we expect to execute our strategy in North America  And I think over time that continues to drive improvement in margins  less concentrated in a moment  but obviously a set of activities that yield value over time  From a pricing standpoint  it s still very    it s competitive information  obviously Q4 was quite competitive  And so  I think the market in spite of attrition is still oversupplied  What s important though is that we make our own choices around how to maximize fleet profitability  And by virtue of doing that  I view it as more stable in that respect Lance Loeffler    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerAngie  I might add a comment too on the  300 million in cost savings  Just to be clear too to add to Jeff  that s sort of cash structural savings Jeff Miller    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYes Angie Sedita    Goldman Sachs    AnalystOkay  Okay  thank you that s helpful  And then  maybe staying along the themes on pricing  It s obviously the reverse internationally  Maybe you could talk a little bit or give more color on the pricing power or momentum you re seeing in the international markets  Is it fairly widespread  Is it by specific regions or product lines  And do you think there could be a little bit of momentum going into 2020  or is it slow and steady Jeff Miller    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerLook  I d more describe it as slow and steady  Angie  And I think  what the key is that the setup is constructive  And so  managing capital in a more prudent way  focusing on profitable growth as opposed to growth  all of those things conspire to create an environment  where we re able to get better pricing  Is it widespread  I d say it s generally widespread  but there is probably pockets who are more concentrated than others  sometimes driven by availability and complexity of work and things that would normally and rationally drive our pricing  And so  I think that s what we re seeing in the market  And yes  it is getting traction Angie Sedita    Goldman Sachs    AnalystRight  Thanks  I ll turn it over  OperatorOur next question comes from Bill Herbert with Simmons  Your line is now open Bill Herbert    Simmons   Co     AnalystThank you  Good morning  Lance  you talked about it conceptually  but I d like to kind of refine it  if you will  with regard to the discussion of the evolution of working capital for this year  less pronounced seasonal trends  you were a huge consumer  cash  working capital was in the first half of 2019 at a nice contributor to cash in the second half  I m trying to kind of peg the order of magnitude of the reduction in cash consumption during the first half of this year versus the first half of last year Lance Loeffler    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I think  what you see  Bill  is sort of a year over year comparison as we don t have    I mean  last year we were carrying a lot of inventory associated with the boost in the iCruise rollout and in some of our C P product lines that I don t think that you see that consumption taking place again this year as we consume more of that inventory as opposed to build it  The collection cycle is still going to be very similar  albeit as the international business becomes a bigger part of our business that typically has longer DSOs  so we may see some impact there  But still a view where we build receivables early in the year and then unwind those as we get into the later part of the year Bill Herbert    Simmons   Co     AnalystOkay  And so  just to take a stab at it  would you expect that your cash consumption from working capital in the first half of this year would run it like half of what it did in 2019  I mean  is that a reasonable starting point Lance Loeffler    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerI think that s probably a reasonable starting point Bill Herbert    Simmons   Co     AnalystOkay  And then  secondly  again a lot of moving parts  but it s kind of a 20  reduction in capex  you should have better working capital improvement for this year  Net income should be up as well  So  at least from my numbers  I m getting to kind of a free cash flow yield  assuming a  24 stock price of kind of 7  to 8   which is getting pretty sporty  And I m just curious with regards to priorities of the deployment of that surplus cash flow  Is it still a reduction of net debt first and foremost Lance Loeffler    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I think it is  I think with the excess cash  I think we do have a near term priority on reducing debt  The reality is  Bill  is while we re focused on that debt reduction in the near term  what it does and what it offers us as we continue to chip away at it  is give us more flexibility to return cash to shareholders in the future  And I think  today  our business  we need to address the  3 8 billion of debt that we have coming due over the next six years  So  I think we ll do that    do some of that in the near term  but also with an eye on ultimately returning cash to shareholders Bill Herbert    Simmons   Co     AnalystOkay  thank you Lance Loeffler    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanks  Bill Jeff Miller    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Bill OperatorOur next question comes from Scott Gruber with Citigroup  Your line is now open Scott Gruber    Citigroup    AnalystYes  good morning Jeff Miller    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Scott Scott Gruber    Citigroup    AnalystKind of staying on a similar line of questioning  Lance  you mentioned the  1 2 billion of capex in 2020  which is good to see  Could you just provide some color on how you think about the sustainability of capex around that level  There is a few moving pieces year on year in  20 and there will be a few more in  21 in particular with the Saudi chem supplying investment not recurring  But  just how should we think about kind of broad strokes on that level of capex and feel free to frame it as a percent of sales  if it s easy Jeff Miller    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Scott  this is Jeff  I think the key is around prioritization  And we are focused on the best returning opportunities  But we were able to fund international growth in 2019 and expect with that level of capex can continue to fund the growth that we see in 2020  So  it isn t that we are starving anything  the reality is we re feeding things appropriately and around our return expectations  We think about spending this year  it s probably two thirds international  a third US  but in our view very sustainable  And so  we re comfortable with that level of capex and also what it means to making better returns Lance Loeffler    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I would add  in an environment    in an increasing pricing environment that generates the appropriate returns  we may spend more  but it will be commensurate with the focus on returns and overall driving better free cash flow Scott Gruber    Citigroup    AnalystGot it  And then  just a question  circling back on the domestic frac market  With pricing hopefully stabilizing here in early 2020  and Jeff  you had mentioned a focus on maximizing returns on the frac fleet  But broad strokes  does that strategy likely mean that your frac business trends with the market in 2020 or they had lagged the market to a degree in 2020  would be focused on returns  How should we think about it Jeff Miller    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I think that it will    yeah  I would expect we stay consistent with the market  but we don t feel like we have to just because we mostly focus on the returns and free cash flow out of that business  But I wouldn t think we would be out of the market at any point in time  But that said  we re focused on the slice of customers that make the best returns for us  which gets to a number of factors  efficiency  but also calendar cadence piece of spend  This year going into Q1  for example  we re 95  committed on the fleet  which is the best we ve been since the downturn Scott Gruber    Citigroup    AnalystGot it  Appreciate the color  Thank you OperatorOur next question comes from David Anderson with Barclays  Your line is now open David Anderson    Barclays    AnalystHi  good morning  Jeff  going back to your comments on the digital side  as we move beyond the proof of concept and it becomes more broadly accepted  you kind of talked about sort of two different types of customers out there  I guess as sort of maybe on the E P side  as those who have kind of realized  they can do themselves and you provide certain discrete operations  different applications like you just mentioned on some of your tools  On the other side  you have other bigger broader customers  which you can implement your ecosystem across the organization kind of the announcements you made today  How do you see those two sets of customers evolving over the next  let s say  next several years  Is it fair to assume just kind of the former and then the former is the majority of that business and then hopefully it kind of evolves more into more the broader implementation  Can you just talk about how you see the customers  acceptance Jeff Miller    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Look  I think customers do this at the pace at which they can digest it realistically  And that is the reason why I think you see that bifurcation today  it s more apparent just because customers that can actually operate and execute at that level of integration are fewer and far between today  And I kind of view it that way  It gets implemented at the pace it could be absorbed  That s why I tend to talk about the vision and then bring it down to    OK  here are the more digestible groupings being drilling  production and reservoir  and then even down into the tools  Because the reality is  number of these tool don t have to be integrated but they can be and they re more effective when integrated And so  if I use a fairly simple example  like in EarthStar tool  it s a tool  it s metal  it runs in the well  it s fantastic tool  but what s most important about it is the answer product  which is the 3D inversion  And now that 3D inversion becomes even more valuable when integrated in an Earth model  and likely yet again more valuable when integrated into the entire ecosphere  But that s difficult for everyone to do that at one time  and it s very hard to do that  given sort of the proliferation of different systems  So  the key in my view is  we continue to advance the platform  the ecosystem as you described it  while at the same time driving immediate returns around these tools  And they re available to be integrated into that ecosystem  I hope that s helpful David Anderson    Barclays    AnalystThat makes a lot of sense  Jeff  Thanks  Now  the other side of digital here is that it appears to be deflationary to traditional oilfield services going forward  Your customers can do more with less  Would you agree with that  And do you think that future digital revenue to Halliburton  presumably it comes at higher margins  it s more sustainable  can that more than offset this deflation over the next several years Jeff Miller    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerI think it can  because I think what s missing in this deflation discussion is the moat that comes in around our equipment that allows so much cost savings on the client side    part of the business that we ll be able to reap better margins and better returns on those assets to deliver those solutions  And obviously  at the same time  we ll likely be reducing our own costs as we work through this  So  I think it will be deflationary in some ways  but I think the value and the returns on the    not just the componentry but how that componentry is part of that ecosphere really widens the moat that may be isn t there  is prevalent today  but I think we ll see that widen and that ultimately drives better returns for us  in spite of what might be deflationary in a number of other areas of the business David Anderson    Barclays    AnalystThank you Jeff Miller    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you OperatorOur next question comes from Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America Merrill Lynch  Your line is now open Chase Mulvehill    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystHey  Good morning  I guess  I want to come back to the capex question and ask it maybe a different way  If we think about that  1 2 billion of capex  what s the split between D E and C P Lance Loeffler    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Chase  this is Lance  I would say that it s very similar to the 60  40  split that we talked about between NAM and international is a good proxy Chase Mulvehill    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystOkay  So  60  C P  is that what you re saying Lance Loeffler    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerNo  no  no  60  D E Chase Mulvehill    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystGot it  Okay  All right  If you re 40   I think that puts you sub 4  of C P revenues if we think about capex as a percentage of revenues  Obviously  lower than kind of what you did in 2016 as a percentage of revenues  if we look over the next couple of years and kind of call it a sluggish modest growth North America environment  how should we think about C P capex over the next couple years and maybe frame it on a percentage of revenues Lance Loeffler    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  Look  I think structurally lower  as we described it  based more on the market and the opportunity set that we see  But we re really careful not to    we don t peg this to percents of revenues and others things because then when get sort of odd answers when we see markets growing  and I don t think growth is geared that way to our capex necessarily  And so  we will continue to focus on the best returning opportunities where we see those  But the idea that it s going to have to move    the capex is going to move as a percentage with revenues is really not    that s not how we approach them Chase Mulvehill    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystOkay  That makes sense  And then  coming back to frac  you talked about 22  less frac horsepower  Is that the amount that you ve actually retired or is that the amount that you ve actually taken out of the market from an active fleet reduction  And then  a quick one follow up to that  You talked about improvement in frac utilization in 2020 for your active fleets  Do you care to kind of quantify that  How much improvement in utilization across your active fleets you think you can get in 2020 Lance Loeffler    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerLook  I ll start with the first question  The 22  that we described is out of the market sold by the pound retired  but that s done some good things for us  I mean  the reality is that we re 90  Q10s at this point  our costs are lower  our service quality is the best it s ever been  So that s how we view that  The activity  I guess  is    as we look out at the balance of the year or in terms of utilization  part of maximizing profitability of that fleet and the returns on that fleet is keeping it busy  And as I described earlier  we started the year 95  committed  which is the best we ve been in sometimes  So I m encouraged by that outlook based on the fleet that we have Chase Mulvehill    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystOkay  All right  That s all I have three  I ll turn back over  Thanks  Jeff Jeff Miller    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks OperatorOur next question comes from Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital Markets  Your line is now open Kurt Hallead    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystThank you  Hey  good morning Jeff Miller    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Kurt Kurt Hallead    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystHey  thanks for that great rundown  I was kind of curious first and foremost on the international front  when we look at 2020  Where do you think the best relative growth prospects are for Halliburton  You mentioned that Asia Pac was a major contributor here in  19  so just kind of curious on how you see the regional dynamics play out for 2020 Jeff Miller    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Thanks  Kurt  Look  I think it s  again  led by Asia Pac in 2020  Europe CIS continues to be strong as we get into a full year of activity on a number of the contracts we talked about in the past  Africa grows but it will be a bit more choppy  as it works through exploration and regulatory sort of resetting in that market  Middle East remains robust  but obviously starts at a fairly high point as the market itself  and LatAm likely brings up the rear Kurt Hallead    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystOkay  Appreciate that dynamic  And then  I just want to get a little bit better understanding here on just the guidance you provided for first quarter on the margin progressions for C P and D E  And I want to try to get in this context  For C P  when you look at the margin degradation on a quarter on quarter basis  could you give us some general sense of how much is that related to the absence of the tool sales versus market dynamics Lance Loeffler    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I mean  Kurt  this is Lance  Yes  it s definitely impacted by just a non recurring nature of year end product sales in the C P division  which were probably up 10  to 15  versus what we saw in 2018  So we had a good fourth quarter at our C P division in terms of year end equipment sales Kurt Hallead    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystOkay  And then  can the same be said for D E Lance Loeffler    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerI m sorry  I ll let you continue  Lance  Sorry  No  And then    and that is obviously  those margins are accretive  So  what we see replacing that in the first quarter in terms of activity  largely in the resumption of our pressure pumping business in North America is coming at lower margins  And so  you see the offset of that in the guidance Kurt Hallead    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystOkay  Can the same be said for D E Lance Loeffler    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  same can be said for D E  probably more comparative  flattish year over year in terms of year end product sales in our D E division Kurt Hallead    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystThat s great  Appreciate that incremental color  Thanks  guys Jeff Miller    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Kurt OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Marc Bianchi with Cowen  Your line is now open Marc Bianchi    Cowen    AnalystThank you  Jeff  you were talking about oversupply still in the frac market  and with your retirements and what we ve heard from the others  there has been a pretty significant reduction so far  What do you think is needed from here to kind of balance the market and what do you think the timeline is for that Jeff Miller    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Look  I think  what s most important is that that attrition is real  I get this question a lot  And I think a quarter ago  I said    I thought it was 20   which was viewed as high  turns out that s right in the fairway  So  that attrition is in fact occurring  And the market forces or the forces that drove that attrition haven t changed at all in terms of amount of sand pumps  number of stages per day  All of those things that drive that attrition haven t changed  And so  I suspect we continue on a pace that s at least consistent with that As far as the timeline of when we see it  it happens at some point  It doesn t change the way we go to the market today  And so  we are so focused on delivering our strategy around cost reduction and our service delivery improvement that when that happens  it will be terrific and we ll see a great boost from that  But I think in the meantime  we ve got a plan to deliver solid free cash flows and return sort of in any market Marc Bianchi    Cowen    AnalystOkay  Thanks for that  Maybe somewhat related  we ve got the guidance here for first quarter for C P margins  which includes the full benefit of all the cost cutting you re doing  Where do you think those margins can get absent any kind of pricing recovery for the frac side of business  Is there    just through the self help I think you re talking about a bogey that you would point to over the next number of quarters Jeff Miller    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerLook  no  I mean  I think we ve provided guidance on Q1  I view strategy as something that we executed and we continue to see the value and benefit from  And so  we re taking a very long view of this business and the actions that we re taking beyond Q1 to continue to contribute and improve the business  And I think that we will continue to outperform  like we have the highest margins today in North America and we ll continue to add to that Marc Bianchi    Cowen    AnalystGreat  Thanks so much OperatorAnd that will conclude today s question and answer session  I d like to turn the call back to Mr  Miller for closing remarks Jeff Miller    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Liz  Before we wrap up  I d like to close with a few points  First  I expect that Halliburton s international growth will continue in 2020  and that the combination of capital discipline  pricing improvements and technology will lead to margin expansion  Second  Halliburton will continue executing our North America playbook to maximize returns and free cash flow  And finally  I believe digitalization will define the next decade  and Halliburton is uniquely positioned to reap the benefits  Look forward to talking to you again next quarter Liz  please close out the call Operator Operator Closing Remarks Duration  62 minutesCall participants Abu Zeya    Senior Director  Investor RelationsJeff Miller

Let s delve into some key aspects of the company s regulatory filing 
TechnipFMC envisioned its fourth quarter non cash impairment charges to be  2 4 billion  primarily due to sinking market capitalization induced by geopolitical turmoil and softened commodity prices  The company is a leading manufacturer and supplier of products  services and fully integrated technology solutions for the energy industry 
Energy Players Write Down Valuable Gas Assets 
Apart from TechnipFMC  some industry players suffered huge write offs in the fourth quarter  CA based Chevron Corp    NYSE CVX   incurred  10 4 billion write down during the period while maintaining its capital discipline  This adversity majorly resulted from the Appalachian natural gas assets due to the commodity s price plunge  The energy player is one of the largest publicly traded oil and gas entities in the world based on proved reserves 
Further  Halliburton   NYSE HAL    the world s second largest oilfield services company after Schlumberger   NYSE SLB    reported its post tax impairment charges of  2 2 billion for the fourth quarter  This write down is in response to a weak commodity price causing a ramped down shale activity in North America 
Provision of 2019 Outlook
TechnipFMC estimates its full year revenues to be 13 5 billion  indicating a movement toward the midpoint of the earlier guided range 
The company is likely to have borne corporate expenses within its previously provided projection of  210  215 million 
TechnipFMC expects its full year adjusted EBITDA margin for the Subsea  Onshore Offshore and Surface Technologies units to meet or exceed the respective past expectation of 11 5   16 5  and 10  TechnipFMC plc Price

 Reuters    ProPetro Holding Corp  N PUMP  this month cut about 150 workers  people familiar with the matter said on Monday  the latest sign of growing trouble in the oilfield services sector as U S  shale producers reduce drilling 
The job cuts reflect slowing shale activity due to weak prices for oil and gas  and producers exhausting their spending budgets for the year  one of the people said 
Midland  Texas based ProPetro said last week it would cut the number of hydraulic fracturing fleets operated this quarter by as much as 28   far surpassing analysts  expectations  The fleets send water  sand and chemicals at high pressures underground to release trapped oil and gas 
The layoffs represent a roughly 9 5  reduction in staff  based on the company s latest annual filing 
The job cuts came amid a board committee s fact finding review of past accounting practices  which has prompted a shake up of top management and required senior executives to reimburse the company roughly  370 000 
No senior executives were affected by the job cuts  which were unrelated to the accounting probe  the person said

211967,433483,HAL,Why Offshore Drilling Stocks Can Make A Comeback In 2020,opinion,Uptick in new project opportunities are expected to reverse years of decline in offshore drilling contractor revenues  With the energy sector emerging from the crude slump and debt driven overhaul  renewed interest in the offshore drilling space is finally raising hopes for the industry s recovery Crude Plunge Aggravates Offshore Industry StrugglesWhen oil was in the triple digit territories of 2014  energy companies had billions of dollars in exploration budgets  The aggressive approach was essentially tied to commodity prices and severely dented balance sheets when prices fall to a 13 year low of around  26 per barrel in 2016  With operating profitability compromised  the worst oil crash in over half a century triggered major restructuring and a change in the companies  long term focus  Most producers concentrated on becoming leaner by shunning large  capital intensive projects In particular  the price slump forced the top energy companies to cut spending on the costly offshore drilling projects due to lower profit margins  This  in turn  meant less work for the beleaguered drillers  With old contracts rolling off  the companies either got rigs stacked or bore high reactivation costs and accepted much reduced dayrates  As a result  overall revenues were impacted  Most offshore drilling stocks lost billions in market value during this period Sustained Oil Prices Above  60 Per Barrel to Spur RevivalWTI crude  the U S  benchmark  bounced back above  60 per barrel following the recent agreement on a phase one trade deal between U S  and China  The development   coming after months of wrangling   is seen to prop up the oil demand outlook on the back of revival in global economic growth  Also boosting oil  the OPEC  group announced cutting output by as much as 500 000 barrels per day from Jan 1 for three months  This is in addition to the existing production curbs of 1 2 million barrels per day by OPEC  Russia and other non member oil producers Sustained prices over  60 is likely to drive operators to make longer term plans  as deepwater projects become cost effective if taken up for a long term  Consequently  demand for offshore drilling services should picked up  Sector consolidation  adoption of superior technologies  new operational systems  optimization of the fleet by strategic sell offs and acquisition  seeking profitable collaborations  among other strategic strides  will certainly help boost future prospects of the drilling companies  While one does not expect the sunny days of the drilling industry to return immediately  signs of recovery can definitely be seen Let s discuss the most important factors shaping the industry s turnaround Depleting Onshore Reserves  One of the key positive arguments for offshore drillers is the focus on reserve replacement rate  With less oil being discovered on land and a number of upstream operators depleting their reserves fast  capital is moving into offshore projects  In fact  supplies from offshore fields are expected to be the primary contributor in meeting reserve shortfalls in the long run  There is just no alternative Radical Cut in Costs  Operators think that the lessons learnt during the bust years will help them undertake sizeable expenditures  while maintaining the target capital structure  With the offshore players greatly reducing costs amid stronger operating efficiencies  most of the projects are likely to generate decent returns even at today s oil prices  The lower breakeven and attractive project economics are leading to more offshore projects being sanctioned Considerable Growth in E P Cash Flows  The good news is most exploration and production companies have plenty of cash to invest  A tight leash on expenditure and conservative spending plans have resulted in cash flow coming in at higher rates  driving offshore spending and drilling activity  Oilfield services major Halliburton   NYSE HAL   estimates that investments by oil producers in international offshore markets will increase 14  this year and continue in 2020 Improving Day Rates   Utilization  The offshore spending growth  particularly in markets like Brazil  Guyana and Mozambique  has led to rising day rates and utilization  Both are now comfortably off the bottom in most global operating regions and for majority of the market segments  While nowhere near the boom year highs  they still remain quite strong and at levels rarely see in recent times Drone Strike Over Saudi Oil Infrastructure  The September attack on Saudi Arabia s oil installations have raised the risk quotient associated with onshore oil production  Following the strike on the state run Saudi Arabian Oil Company s  Aramco  SE 2222   Abqaiq plant   a key crude processing facility   and the Khurais complex  which houses the kingdom s second largest oilfield  market watchers have stressed the need to diversify oil supply sources  This would mean more investments in offshore projects  which are considered relatively immune to geopolitical risks How to Profit from This Recovery With the offshore

211975,433491,HAL,When NOT To Own Energy,opinion,"I have been keeping an eye on energy stocks for quite awhile not   I wrote this article at the end of May wondering out loud if Halliburton  NYSE HAL  was nearing a bottom   At the time HAL was trading at  21 29 a share  It dropped as low as  16 97   20   by the end of August   As of today  it is back up to  22 30   Is the bottom in in energies   No one can say for sure  but I have been reading from a lot of different sources about how much energies are loathed and beaten down and overdue for a bounce  
Of course  the more I read people saying that the more I wonder if it is still a little early   But to put things into perspective  Figure 1 displays Fidelity Select Energy Services with a custom indicator called  Vixfixaverageave   I know  I know  bad name   which is basically a double smoothed version of an indicator called  VixFix   which was devised by legendary trader Larry Williams  a number of years ago 







Figure 1   Fidelity Select Energy Services  Courtesy AIQ TradingExpert 
Note that previous extreme peaks in the indicator have marked some fairly significant low areas for energy services   Given the current extreme reading for the indicator it would seem to make sense to be looking at now as a reasonable time to start allocating more to energy stocks 















Looking At Things On A Seasonal BasisOn a seasonal basis the month of December historically represents a very good time to be looking at energies   As it turns out  the energy services sector  and the overall energy sector as a whole  is one of the most highly cyclical sectors around   Figures 2 and 3 tell you pretty much everything you need to know Figure 2   FSESX Cumulative   return  December through April  1985 2019Figure 3   FSESX Cumulative   return  May through October  1986 2019In Figure 2 we see that the cumulative total return for ticker Fidelity  Select Energy Service Portfolio only during the months of December through Apr has been  6 624  since 1985 In Figure 3 we see that the cumulative total return for ticker FSESX only during the months of May through November has been a stunning   94   since 1985 So  when do you want to hold energy related stocks  Note that as divergent as these numbers are  there still are no  sure things  in the world of investing   Note that the Dec Apr period has showed a gain 76  of the time on a year by year basis   So do not make the mistake of thinking that energy prices are sure to be higher 5 months from now  Likewise  note that the May Nov period has showed a gain 44  of the time   So  despite the massive cumulative loss over time  remember that on a year by year basis it is almost a coin flip Summary
The energy sector has been beaten down and has remained down for a number of years   Broad based energy proxies such as ticker Energy Select Sector SPDR  Fund  NYSE XLE  and ticker Fidelity  Select Energy Portfolio both topped out in 2014   Ticker XLE is presently trading at the exact same level it was at roughly 13 years ago   So yes  the energy sector does qualify as a bullish contrarian play at this point 
The only problem is no one knows for sure when or where the bottom is   So  what is an investor to do   Given the seemingly  washed out  nature of the sector itself and the fact that it just entered it s  bullish seasonal period  it may be a decent time for a long term investor to consider establishing a position in the energy sector in anticipation that it will perform better overall in the years ahead   and more specifically in the months ahead  
Just remember that there are no sure things and that you must likely be prepared to  ride it out  for a period of time to reap any rewards   Given this  also remember that position sizing is of critical importance   i e    dip a toe  don t bet the ranch  ",2019-12-09,Jay Kaeppel,https://www.investing.com/analysis/when-not-to-own-energy-200491197,200491197

Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Halliburton 
For Halliburton  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 55  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Halliburton will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Halliburton would post earnings of  0 30 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 35  delivering a surprise of  16 67  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Halliburton doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-halliburton-hal-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200473181,200473181

are highlights from Tuesday s Analyst Blog  5 Reasons Offshore Drilling Stocks Are Poised for a ReboundIncreases in new project opportunities are expected to reverse years of decline in offshore drilling contractor revenues  With the energy sector emerging from the crude slump and debt driven overhaul  renewed interest in the offshore drilling space is finally raising hopes for the industry s recovery Oil Price Collapse Pummeled Offshore IndustryWhen oil was in the triple digit territories of 2014  energy companies had billions of dollars in exploration budgets  The aggressive approach was essentially tied to commodity prices and severely dented balance sheets when prices fall to a 13 year low of around  26 per barrel in 2016  With operating profitability compromised  the worst oil crash in over half a century triggered major restructuring and a change in the companies  long term focus  Most producers concentrated on becoming leaner by shunning large  capital intensive projects In particular  the price slump forced the top energy companies to cut spending on the costly offshore drilling projects due to lower profit margins  This  in turn  meant less work for the beleaguered drillers  With old contracts rolling off  the companies either got rigs stacked or bore high reactivation costs and accepted much reduced dayrates  As a result  overall revenues were impacted  Most offshore drilling stocks lost billions in market value during this period Signs of Gradual RecoverySteadiness of oil prices at the current levels is driving operators to make longer term plans  as deepwater projects become cost effective if taken up for a long term  Consequently  demand for offshore drilling services have picked up  Sector consolidation  adoption of superior technologies  new operational systems  optimization of the fleet by strategic sell offs and acquisition  seeking profitable collaborations  among other strategic strides  will certainly help boost future prospects of the drilling companies  While one does not expect the sunny days of the drilling industry to return immediately  signs of recovery can definitely be seen Let s discuss the most important factors shaping the industry s turnaround Reserves Growth Challenge  One of the key positive arguments for offshore drillers is the focus on reserve replacement rate  With less oil being discovered on land and a number of upstream operators depleting their reserves fast  capital is moving into offshore projects  In fact  supplies from offshore fields are expected to be the primary contributor in meeting reserve shortfalls in the long run  There is just no alternative Lower Breakeven Costs  Operators think that the lessons learnt during the bust years will help them undertake sizeable expenditures  while maintaining the target capital structure  With the offshore players greatly reducing costs amid stronger operating efficiencies  most of the projects are likely to generate decent returns even at today s oil prices  The lower breakeven and attractive project economics are leading to more offshore projects being sanctioned Growing E P Cash Flows  The good news is most exploration and production companies have plenty of cash to invest  A tight leash on expenditure and conservative spending plans have resulted in cash flow coming in at higher rates  driving offshore spending and drilling activity  Oilfield services major Halliburton estimates that investments by oil producers in international offshore markets will increase 14  this year Improving Day Rates   Utilization  The offshore spending growth  particularly in markets like Brazil  Guyana and Mozambique  has led to rising day rates and utilization  Both are now comfortably off the bottom in most global operating regions and for majority of the market segments  While nowhere near the boom year highs  they still remain quite strong and at levels rarely see in recent times The Attack on Saudi Oil Facilities  The recent attack on Saudi Arabia s oil installations have raised the risk quotient associated with onshore oil production  Following the strike on the state run Saudi Arabian Oil Company s  Aramco  Abqaiq plant   a key crude processing facility   and the Khurais complex  which houses the kingdom s second largest oilfield  market watchers have stressed the need to diversify oil supply sources  This would mean more investments in offshore projects  which are considered relatively immune to geopolitical risks How to Profit From This Recovery With the offshore energy industry looking ready to

212024,433540,HAL,Probe of U S  Interior Secretary Zinke s conduct referred to DOJ  reports,news,"WASHINGTON  Reuters    The U S  Interior Department s acting inspector general has referred a probe into Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke s conduct to the Justice Department for further investigation  media reports said on Tuesday  citing unnamed sources 
Referring a probe to the Justice Department means it will explore whether evidence warrants a criminal investigation  Mary Kendall  the acting inspector general of the Interior Department  is conducting at least three probes into Zinke s conduct  but it was not clear which one had been sent to the Justice Department  the Washington Post said 
Among other investigations  Kendall is probing Zinke s involvement in a Montana land deal and a decision not to grant two tribes approval to run a casino in Connecticut 
A senior White House official said the White House understands the DOJ investigation is looking into whether the secretary  used his office to help himself   according to the Washington Post 
The Interior Department s inspector general said in a letter to lawmakers in July that the office was investigating a Montana real estate deal involving a foundation set up by Zinke and a development group backed by the chairman of oil service company Halliburton  NYSE HAL  Co 
The letter said the inspector general had launched the probe on July 16 to look into a development deal in Zinke s hometown of Whitefish  Montana  between a group funded by David Lesar  Halliburton s chairman  and the foundation  The deal was first reported by Politico 
A Lesar spokeswoman said in July that his personal investment had nothing to do with Halliburton and that the company was confident the Interior Department would not be influenced by it 
The Interior Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment  Zinke told CNN that he had not been contacted by the Justice Department  that he follows the law  and that the DOJ investigation was  politically driven  and  has no merit  

Nancy DiPaolo  spokeswoman for the Interior Department s inspector general office  said she could not comment on any ongoing investigation  The White House and the Department of Justice did not immediately respond to requests for comment ",2018-10-30,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/us-interior-department-watchdog-sends-zinke-probe-to-doj-washington-post-1666421,1666421

212026,433542,HAL,Halliburton Company Beat Earnings Expectations  Domestic Headwinds Ahead,opinion,"In a July 22 research note  analyst Praveen Narra reported that Raymond James lowered its target price on Halliburton Company  NYSE HAL  to  37 per share from  39  the current share price is  23 03   The change reflects Raymond James reducing its H2 19 estimates on the energy company by 2  due to current weakened oilfield activity in North America and lower drilling and evaluation  D E  margins 
Narra highlighted that despite those factors  Halliburton s Q2 19 results were  ahead of expectations on better than expected completion and production  C P  margins  
Further  looking forward  Narra purported that Haliburton should continue generating free cash flow despite today s flat oil prices if it continues cutting costs and potentially reduces capex in 2019  Raymond James expects Halliburton to generate  assuming a higher oil price  free cash flow of around  1 billion and  1 6 billion for 2019 and 2020  or  at today s prices  a yield of 5  and 8   respectively 
With respect to margins in specific corporate divisions  Narra pointed out that Halliburton likely will not see a rebound in its C P numbers until 2020  This is because a slowing U S  North American oilfield typically translates to depressed C P margins for the company  Another reason is the likely continuing uncertainty in Q4 19 due to seasonality and exhausted budgets 
In contrast  Narra noted  D E margins are  poised for improvement  because  international markets are expanding with early signs of pricing strength in pockets   That stronger offshore and international activity could offset some of the weakness in North America  Also  as the rigs get working at the company s North Sea and India projects   this should lead to strong incremental margins   added Narra  For D E in Q3 19  Raymond James models roughly 65  increments and in Q4 19  11 4  margins

212052,433568,HAL,Earnings Preview  Halliburton  HAL  Q2 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Halliburton  HAL  reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 22  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This provider of drilling services to oil and gas operators is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 30 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  48 3  
Revenues are expected to be  5 97 billion  down 2 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3 77  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Halliburton 
For Halliburton  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 13  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  5 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Halliburton will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Halliburton would post earnings of  0 23 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 23  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Halliburton doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-halliburton-hal-q2-earnings-expected-to-decline-200439816,200439816

212079,433595,HAL,U S  trained engineer takes on Algeria s energy monolith,news,"By Lamine Chikhi ORAN  Algeria  Reuters    When the U S  educated CEO of Algeria s state energy company Sonatrach ended a speech to staff by seeking questions  an executive sitting next to him quickly picked up the microphone   There are no questions   he said  and some 1 000 employees filed straight out  The scene revealed the scale of the challenge facing Abdelmoumen Ould Kadour  who took over Sonatrach a year ago with a mission to improve communication and transparency in a company that is central to stability in Algeria and beyond  Sonatrach funds 60 percent of the state budget  and falling oil prices have created pressure for change  while Algeria s role as a major gas supplier to Europe means new tension between the continent and gas giant Russia could play into his hands  He will soon unveil a plan to lift stagnant output and has revived ties with European oil majors  But project delays  fraud scandals  secrecy and red tape abound in a country where adults remember civil war and change is often resisted   It s hopeless   he confided to colleagues accompanying him to the company office in the northwestern city of Oran  one of dozens of such visits by the 66 year old alumnus of MIT and Harvard to Sonatrach outposts witnessed by Reuters  On his first day  he said on another occasion  he was given so much paperwork to sign he feared he would do little else   There was no medium and long term strategy  there was no communication  no coordination between Sonatrach s executives  every single piece of information was confidential   No stranger to setbacks  he spent two years in an Algerian jail for collaborating with foreigners after a decade in charge of a joint Algerian U S  engineering company co owned by oil services firm Halliburton  NYSE HAL   He has brought in his own team to lead the revamp at Sonatrach  declining requests for an interview but sharing his views during his tour of the company  A company source said his turnaround plan would be unveiled  within weeks  if not days   Designed partly to attract foreign investment  it is likely to come during or before a conference he hosts on April 16 18 which the CEOs of France s  Total   PA TOTF   Italy s  ENI   MI ENI  and Norway s  Statoil   OL STL  are expected to attend  FOREIGN PARTNERS His broad goal is to turn Sonatrach into an integrated energy company by 2030 from its current sprawling state  which includes an aircraft maker and extensive social programmes and excludes renewables  which come under the environment ministry  While Western CEOs will expect concrete steps after years of bold announcements  the plan has spread unease among executives  several of whom told Reuters they feared sweeping management changes in Ould Kadour s declared battle with red tape  In Oran  he told staff that Statoil  set to resume work at the Hassi Mouina gas field  had previously left because of bureaucracy   Better communication  a better environment is key to convince foreign partners to work in Algeria   he said  A Sonatrach source said Statoil is expected to invest  500 mln in gas  a figure described by a Statoil source as  speculation   Last month Statoil and Britain s  BP   L BP  agreed to strengthen cooperation in upstream oil exploration and explore solar energy to allow Algeria to export more of its gas  In December Ould Kadour revived ties in December with Total  ENI and  Saipem   MI SPMI   but his ability to nurture those relationships and reverse years of stalling production will depend on how his company s 40 000 employees respond to his message of change  He is an unlikely manager in a country known for secrecy and a suspicion of Westerners dating from ties to the Soviet Union and the trauma of the 1954 1962 independence war with France  But energy revenues have halved since 2014 and President Abdelaziz Bouteflika  the 81 year old leader who might run for a fifth term next year  is struggling to maintain a welfare state necessary for social stability  The government has launched austerity measures  banning the import of 900 goods and freezing public sector hiring and development projects  Doctors and teachers have been on strike in several cities for three months demanding better pay and conditions and the state has been unable to end dissent by paying out as it did when a barrel of crude cost  100 instead of  70 as now  This has turned improving the efficiency of the state oil company into a political imperative   Ould Kaddour has no choice but to succeed as Sonatrach s CEO   a former energy minister told Reuters  Critics of the CEO say he has only been appointed because of Bouteflika and will last no longer than his many predecessors   If Bouteflika quits  Ould Kaddour would be sacked in the next five minutes   a former Sonatrach executive said  BALANCING ACT With the presidential election looming  Ould Kadour has sought to cut Algeria s import bill by recruiting oil trader Vitoil to swap crude for the petrol in growing need at home   The strategy was to show that Algeria  which is a big oil producer  is not spending gigantic sums on imports of products   an oil insider said  One delayed gas field was brought online last year with three more slated to start producing this year  lifting annual gas output of 94 billion cubic metres by 9 billion cubic metres  Sonatrach has signed a  1 billion deal with Turkey to build a petrochemical facility  discovered crude in Niger and explored cooperation with Iraq  It is also considering shale  but protests in 2015 from Algerians fearing environmental damage have made that politically unpalatable for now  In further signs of a balancing act  company sources say Sonatrach will offer more flexible short term gas contracts on terms of 10 15 years or less instead of 20 25 and invest  250 million in the Tinhert gas field project using Algerian firms  Ould Kadour s sentencing by a military court in 2007 on charges working for a foreign country was part of an internal regime conflict typical for Algeria  observers say  An elite made up of the ruling FLN party  army and security has controlled Algeria since independence  with officials or executives of state firms sometimes losing jobs when a new faction takes over in power plays behind closed doors  After serving his two year jail term  he worked in Qatar  France  Senegal and the United Arab Emirates before Bouteflika made him Sonatrach CEO in March 2017  Anis Rahmani  owner of private Ennahar TV station  said the CEO had told him he was devastated by being branded a traitor   But the man has vision  a plan to transform the company into a modern and performing one  which is not the case now   he said  He is more powerful than the energy minister  one insider said  but must also win backing from politicians resistant to opening up the country too much  A key energy law has been stalled for years but a draft is now due in July  
It is likely to retain Sonatrach s majority stake in all energy projects but offer tax incentives for investors  a Sonatrach executive said   The law needs to be attractive   he said   If not it will be useless  ",2018-03-29,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/ustrained-engineer-takes-on-algerias-energy-monolith-1369413,1369413

212083,433599,HAL,What The HAL ,opinion,"Some industries are cyclical in nature  And there is not a darned thing you   or they   can do about it  Within those industries there are individual companies that are  leaders   i e   well run companies that tend to out earn other companies in that given industry and whose stock tends to outperform other companies in that industry 
Unfortunately for them  even they cannot avoid the cyclical nature of the business they are in  Take Halliburton Company  NYSE HAL  for example  Halliburton is one of the world s largest providers of products and services to the energy industry  And they do a good job of it  Which is nice  It does not however  release them from the binds of being a leader in a cyclical industry 
A Turning Point at Hand 
A quick glance at Figure 1 clearly illustrates the boom bust nature of the performance of HAL stock 
Figure 1   Halliburton  HAL   Courtesy AIQ TradingExpert 
Which raises an interesting question  is there a way to time any of these massive swings  Well here is where things get a little murky  If you are talking about  picking timing tops and bottoms with uncanny accuracy   well  while there are plenty of ads out there claiming to be able to do just that  in reality that is not really  a thing   Still  there may be a way to highlight a point in time where 
 Things are really over done to the downside  and
 For a person who is not going to get crazy and  bet the ranch   and who understands how a stop loss order works and is willing to use one 
  there is at least one interesting possibility 
It s involves a little known indicator that is based on a more well known another indicator that was developed by legendary trader Larry Williams  roughly 15 or more years ago  William s indicator is referred to as  VixFix  and attempts to replicate a VIX like indicator for any market  The formula is pretty simple  as follows  the code is from AIQ Expert Design Studio  
 hivalclose is hival  close  22  
 vixfix is    hivalclose  low   hivalclose  100  50 
In English  it is the highest close in the last 22 periods minus the current period low  which is then divided by the highest close in the last 22 periods  The result then gets multiplied by 100 and 50 is added 
Figure 2 displays a monthly chart of HAL with William s VixFix in the lower clip  In a nutshell  when price declines VixFix rises and vice versa 

Figure 2   HAL Monthly with William s VixFix  Courtesy AIQ TradingExpert 
Now let s go one more step as follows by creating an exponentially smoothed version as follows  the code is from AIQ Expert Design Studio  
 hivalclose is hival  close  22  
 vixfix is    hivalclose  low   hivalclose  100  50    
 vixfixaverage is Expavg vixfix 3     
 Vixfixaverageave is Expavg vixfixaverage 7     
I refer to this as Vixfixaverageave  Note to myself  get a better name  because it essentially takes an average of an average  In English  OK  sort of   first Vixfix is calculated  then a 3 period exponential average of Vixfix is calculated  vixfixaverage  and then a 7 period exponential average of vixfixaverage is calculated to arrive at Vixfixaverageave  got that  
Anyway  this indicator appears on the monthly chart for HAL that appears in Figure 3 
Figure 3   HAL with Vixaverageave  Courtesy AIQ TradingExpert 
So here is the idea 
 When Vixfixaverageave for HAL exceeds 96 it is time to start looking for a buying opportunity 
OK  that last sentence is not nearly as satisfying as one that reads  the instant the indicator reaches 96 it is an automatic buy signal and you can t lose   But it is more accurate  Previous instances of a 96  reading for Vixfixaverageave for HAL appear in Figure 4 

Figure 4   HAL with previous  buy zone  readings from Vixfixaverageave  Courtesy AIQ TradingExpert 
Note that in previous instances  the actual bottom in price action occurred somewhere between the time the indicator first broke above 96 and the time the indicator topped out  So  to reiterate  Vixfixaverageave is NOT a  precision timing tool   per se  But it may be useful in highlighting extremes 
This is potentially relevant because with one week left in May  the monthly Vixfixaverageave value is presently above 96  This is NOT a  call to action   If price rallies in the next week Vixfixaverageave may still drop back below 96 by month end  Likewise  even if it is above 96 at the end of May   as discussed above and as highlighted in Figure 4  when the actual bottom might occur is impossible to know 
Let me be clear  this article is NOT purporting to say that now is the time to buy HAL  Figure 5 displays the largest gain  the largest drawdown and the 12 month gain or loss following months when Vixfixaverageave for HAL first topped 96  As you can see there is alot of variation and volatility  
Figure 5   Previous 1st reading above 96 for HAL Vixfixaverageave
So HAL may be months and or many   points away from an actual bottom  But the main point is that the current action of Vixfixaverageave suggests that now is the time to start paying attention ",2019-05-28,Jay Kaeppel,https://www.investing.com/analysis/what-the-hal-200425692,200425692

212139,433655,HAL,Earnings Preview  Halliburton  HAL  Q1 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Halliburton  HAL  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 22  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This provider of drilling services to oil and gas operators is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 23 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  43 9  
Revenues are expected to be  5 54 billion  down 3 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 06  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Halliburton 
For Halliburton  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 82  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Halliburton will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Halliburton would post earnings of  0 37 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 41  delivering a surprise of  10 81  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Halliburton doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-halliburton-hal-q1-earnings-expected-to-decline-200406818,200406818

212197,433713,HAL,Why Halliburton  HAL  Is Poised To Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider Halliburton  NYSE HAL   This company  which is in the Zacks Oil and Gas   Field Services industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
This provider of drilling services to oil and gas operators has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 0 17  
For the most recent quarter  Halliburton was expected to post earnings of  0 49 per share  but it reported  0 50 per share instead  representing a surprise of 2 04   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  0 59 per share  while it actually produced  0 58 per share  a surprise of 1 69  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Halliburton  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Halliburton has an Earnings ESP of  2 31  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on January 22  2019 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-01-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-halliburton-hal-is-poised-to-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200375304,200375304
212198,433714,HAL,Earnings Preview  Halliburton  HAL  Q4 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Halliburton  NYSE HAL  reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 22  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This provider of drilling services to oil and gas operators is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 37 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  30 2  
Revenues are expected to be  5 89 billion  down 0 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 5 34  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Halliburton 
For Halliburton  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  2 28  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  5 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Halliburton will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Halliburton would post earnings of  0 49 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 50  delivering a surprise of  2 04  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Halliburton doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-halliburton-hal-q4-earnings-expected-to-decline-200375747,200375747

212234,433750,HAL,Oil prices climb nearly 9  on OPEC agreement,news,"Investing com   Oil prices rose by nearly 9  today  climbing after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC  agreed to slash production  The price of Brent Oil and West Texas Crude Oil both increased on Wednesday  with U S  crude futures settling at 49 98 and Brent futures settling at 50 45 
OPEC ministers said the production pact had been several months in the making   Over the past two months  this committee has done some excellent work  The meetings it has undertaken have been extremely constructive  providing us all with a better appreciation and understanding of the various viewpoints among OPEC and non OPEC producers   said Mohammed Bin Saleh Al Sada  Qatar s Minister of Energy and Industry and President of the OPEC Conference  in remarks earlier today   The last time we met as a conference was in Algiers on September 28  This historic occasion  with OPEC Member Countries unified in approving the already mentioned  Algiers Accord   saw an agreement on a new OPEC production target range  The focus was on accelerating the drawdown of the stock overhang and bringing the market rebalancing forward

212322,433838,HAL,U S  payrolls surge  bolster Fed rate hike prospects,news,"By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  employment gains surged in February  the clearest sign yet of labor market strength that could further ease fears the economy was heading into recession and allow the Federal Reserve to gradually raise interest rates this year 
Nonfarm payrolls increased by 242 000 jobs last month  the Labor Department said on Friday  The unemployment rate held at an eight year low of 4 9 percent even as more people piled into the labor market 
 This is the best news the Fed could have expected going into the meeting  With jobs bouncing back  you can be sure that rate hikes are just around the corner   said Chris Rupkey  chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York 
The economy added 30 000 more jobs in December and January than previously reported  The only blemish in the report was a three cent drop in average hourly earnings  but that was mostly because of a calendar quirk 
The average length of the workweek also fell last month 
Economists had forecast employment increasing by 190 000 last month and the jobless rate holding steady 
The employment report added to data such as consumer and business spending in suggesting the economy had regained momentum after growth slowed to a 1 0 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter  Growth estimates for the first quarter are around a 2 5 percent rate 
Fears of a recession in the wake of poor economic reports in December and slowing growth in China sparked a global stock market rout at the start of the year  causing financial market conditions to tighten 
Financial markets have priced out bets of a rate rise at the Fed s March 15 16 policy meeting and see a roughly 50 percent chance of a hike at the September and November meetings  according to CME FedWatch 
Economists  however  believe the strong jobs market and improved growth outlook  together with signs that inflation is creeping up  could prompt the Fed to lift borrowing costs in June 
The Fed raised its key overnight interest rate in December for the first time in nearly a decade 
Prices of U S  Treasuries fell after the data  while U S  stock index futures rose  The U S  dollar gained against the euro and hit session highs against the yen and Swiss franc 
SLOWER WAGE GROWTH
Fed Chair Janet Yellen has said the economy needs to create just under 100 000 jobs a month to keep up with growth in the working age population 
The labor force participation rate  or the share of working age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job  increased two tenths of a percentage point to 62 9 percent  the highest level in just over a year 
Adding to the report s strength  a broad measure of joblessness that includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part time because they cannot find full time employment fell two tenths of a percentage point to 9 7 percent 
The employment to population ratio also increased to 59 8 percent last month  the highest since April 2009  from 59 6 percent in January 
While wage growth weakened in February  it was largely payback for January s jump  which was driven by a calendar quirk  Growth in wages is seen accelerating as the labor market settles into full employment 
The drop in average hourly earnings lowered the year on year gain in earnings to 2 2 percent from 2 5 percent in January  The average workweek fell to 34 4 hours from 34 6 hours in January 
In February  job gains were almost broad based  though manufacturing and mining employment fell  The services sector created 245 000 jobs after adding 153 000 jobs in January  Mining lost a further 18 000 jobs after shedding 9 000 positions in January 
Mining payrolls have declined by 171 000 jobs since peaking in September 2014  with three fourths of the losses in support activities  More losses are likely after oilfield services provider  Halliburton Co   N HAL  said last month it would cut a further 5 000 jobs because of a prolonged slump in oil prices 

Manufacturing employment lost 16 000 jobs  reversing some of January s surprise increase  Private education jobs rebounded after plunging in January  Construction payrolls increased 19 000 and government added 12 000 jobs ",2016-03-04,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/economic-indicators/u.s.-payrolls-surge,-bolster-fed-rate-hike-prospects-388007",388007

Key Events
On Friday  animal spirits roared back to life as all three major US indexes the Dow  NASDAQ and S P 500 hit fresh records  As well  the S P registered its 48th record of the year as it finished a sixth straight week of gains 
The dollar and yields also closed higher on domestic political developments  The Senate approved President Donald Trump s  4 trillion budget  which paves the way for Congress to consider his tax reform proposal 
Once again today  politics dominates the market narrative  beginning with Japan where President Shinzo Abe s snap election didn t have anything close to the dismal outcome seen by UK PM Theresa May in June  Rather  Abe s decision to call an early vote paid off big time  He won by a landslide  even as Typhoon Lan pummeled parts of the country 

Abe s victory sets him on course to becoming Japan s longest serving  post WW2 leader  Spurred by the victory  Tokyo s Nikkei 225 Index reached a 21 year high  the Japanese index is on its longest winning streak in its 70 year history 
While politics was the impetus for the move  economics has provided legitimacy  with Japan seeing 6 straight quarters of growth right now  Oki Motsumoto  CEO and Chairman of Monex Group  a Tokyo based financial services firm  says Abe s win   but sees the move as done  since expectations of Abe s win have now been  discounted by today   Nevertheless  he believes it will continue to be good for markets in the longer term too 
It could also be said that Abe s win is a green light for  Abenomics   the massive economic stimulus plan championed by the Prime Minister  Following that logic to its conclusion  the green light extends into the future for the Bank of Japan to resume its massive asset purchasing program  And  of course  it also provides a green light for Abe to resume with this consumption tax increase 
Global Financial Affairs

Politics continues to drive European markets as well  Investors sold off the euro this morning  for a second day  as they await the resolution of a pair of thorny eurozone standoffs  Catalonia s increasingly dramatic secession effort in Spain and stalled Brexit negotiations  The single currency is potentially forming the right shoulder of an H S top  Will it complete before any resolutions emerge 
With Spain s threat of direct rule now on the table  Catalonia s parliament is scheduled to meet on Thursday in order to decide on their response which may be a formal declaration of independence  The next level would then be for Spain to remove regional President Carles Puigdemont from office and charge him with treason  whereupon he could face up to 30 years in jail  After that  what happens in Catalonia is anyone s guess 
While politics has been driving a sense of uncertainty  investors are likely to focus on the more familiar uncertainty of monetary policy going forward  The global financial community is entering a period where there just may be a changing of the central bank guard  led by the departure of US Fed Vice Chair Stanley Fischer earlier this month and the much anticipated Trump nomination of the next Fed Chair 
The potential for an additional Fed rate hike this year remains an ongoing question  though some believe there may be more than one   while the ECB potentially moving in a new policy direction direction could lead to a clear policy path vacuum  Should this happen  the uncertainty might create ripple effects across global financial markets 
Up Ahead
UK PM Theresa May is expected to speak to Parliament today on the progress of Brexit negotiations 
The US Q3 GDP  released on Friday  is expected to have expanded at 2 5 percent YoY in the third quarter  taking into account the effects of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma 
US big ticket Durable Goods Orders are expected to have increased  a sign of firmer manufacturing growth 
Earnings reports today include Halliburton  NYSE HAL  which reports before the open  consensus EPS  0 38 vs  0 01 YoY  and T Mobile  NASDAQ TMUS  which reports after the close  consensus EPS  0 44 vs  0 27 YoY

212406,433922,HAL,With options dwindling  BP seized a chance to settle oil spill case,news,"By Jessica Resnick Ault  Dmitry Zhdannikov and Terry Wade NEW YORK LONDON HOUSTON  Reuters    In early May  with its legal options dwindling and investors impatient   BP   LONDON BP  Plc saw a chance to negotiate what became a  18 7 billion settlement that ended five years of litigation over the worst offshore oil spill in U S  history  An unexpected opportunity to secure a global deal that would wipe the slate clean of hundreds of claims and untold billions of dollar in penalties opened up when Chief Executive Bob Dudley met with Patrick Juneau  the lifelong Louisiana litigator who BP had panned for handing out  absurd  sums of money as part of a class settlement in 2012  The British giant was ready to bury the hatchet after years of acrimony over payouts  which had ballooned to more than  10 billion  It had bigger problems  unresolved claims by the federal government  five Gulf of Mexico states and hundreds of local municipalities stemming from Macondo well blowout  Toward the end of an over hour long conversation about the claims  Juneau  a mediator by trade  steered it toward the bigger cases BP still faced from the 2010 disaster that killed 11 men and gushed oil into the Gulf of Mexico for 87 days   I suggested to Mr  Dudley that it seemed to me that I  along with Judge Shushan and Louie Freeh  thought that those matters can be and should be addressed   he told Reuters  Sally Shushan  the eastern Louisiana district court magistrate  and former Federal Bureau of Investigation director Freeh  who had been enlisted to investigate Juneau s oil spill claims program  were already deeply steeped in the issue  Within weeks  District Court Judge Carl Barbier  who had overseen years of acrimonious lawsuits  had designated this trio to shepherd the sides to what would be the largest corporate settlement in U S  history  according to people involved  Within a day  BP signaled its interest in further talks  Juneau said  Its executive board put chief financial officer Brian Gilvary  a mathematics PhD and career BP man  in charge of the effort  hoping it would turn out better than in 2012  when an initial round of settlement talks collapsed  Dudley returned to meet Juneau  Shushan and Freeh in New Orleans later in May  bringing the credibility of an American who grew up just a two hour drive away in Hattiesburg  Mississippi   That s how you settle  you get the CEO to walk into the room   said Jim Hood  the attorney general of Mississippi  one of the five states involved in the settlement  It took BP nearly two months of 10 hour sessions  often through the weekend  to reach the provisional agreement signed a week ago  finally putting a price tag on the spill s civil damages  The deal swelled BP s total bill for Macondo to  53 8 billion  yet provided a sense of closure for investors and boosted the share price of the company valued around  120 billion by as much as 5 percent   Graphic   With a federal confidentiality order still in effect and a final agreement yet to be signed  much is still unknown about the secret negotiations that headed off what could have been another decade of litigation  But conversations with half a dozen people directly involved or briefed on the matter show how a series of legal decisions and deft maneuvering by a trio of insiders paved the way   They were losing at every count   said New Orleans attorney Walter Leger Jr   who represented several local parishes and municipalities in the litigation against BP   I think they finally realized that all the forces of the universe suggested they d better talk   ROAD TO A DEAL The road toward a settlement was laid by a series of rulings by Barbier  New Orleans based Eastern Louisiana District federal court judge who has been involved in Macondo related cases since a few months after the accident  In September 2014  he ruled BP was  grossly negligent  in the disaster and last January set the size of the spill at 3 19 million barrels  Taken together  the rulings meant the BP was on the hook for a fine of up to  13 7 billion under the Clean Water Act alone  Billions more could be levied from a federal Natural Resource Damage Assessment  Then  in March  BP took a pivotal step and withdrew a bid to remove Juneau as the administrator overseeing the payouts of individual and business damage claims from the uncapped 2012 class action settlement  Juneau said he med Dudley shortly thereafter to  reset the button   Freeh had set up the meeting  By early May  Barbier had named the  panel of neutrals  to guide the process  TIME TO MOVE BP was also under mounting internal pressure to free itself from a financial albatross that stymied planning  Executives feared an unexpectedly large penalty could force a new round of asset sales  undercutting growth  The company also hoped state attorneys would be more flexible on a payout after an oil market crash that had halved prices since mid 2014  sliced BP s earnings and threatened jobs in oil states such as Texas and Louisiana  A BP spokesman in Houston declined to comment  Weeks of meetings and hundreds of phone calls  with anywhere from 5 to 50 people at a time  followed  The trio mostly used conference rooms at two New Orleans hotels  but also Freeh s office in Washington  D C   to hold meetings with everyone from federal lawyers to community representatives  Juneau said  Shushan  a former commercial litigator who has served as U S  magistrate judge since 1999 and often negotiated settlements in complex cases  proved particularly pivotal as she was seen taking a firm hand when necessary   The magistrate started pulling the bull by the horns   said Hood   That lady worked hours and hours and hours  and if anybody deserves the credit in this thing  it s Judge Sally Shushan    MILESTONES  While the talks continued under wraps  a series of milestones related to Macondo passed by  eliminating some of the uncertainty stemming from the disaster  Barbier held off making a final ruling on the Clean Water Act penalty  as widely expected  while the talks continued in private  On May 20  BP resolved a chunk of messy litigation by settling all cross claims from the spill with well services company Halliburton  NYSE HAL  Co and driller  Transocean Ltd   NYSE RIG   Then  the deadline for submitting business or individual claims from the accident closed on June 8  Finally  just three days before the settlement was announced  the Supreme Court dealt BP another blow  dismissing the company s appeal of Barbier s ruling that the company was liable under the Clean Water Act  At this point  Barbier could formally penalize the company at any moment  On the morning of July 2 BP signed the deal   5 5 billion for Clean Water Act violations  less than the maximum   8 1 billion for natural resources damages   4 9 billion to settle economic claims from the Gulf of Mexico states  and up to  1 billion reserved for local government claims  It is not quite over  Local entities  including the La Fourche Parish Veterans district in Louisiana  must still approve the agreement by July 15  and it may take months to complete the legal paperwork for the federal agreement and get a binding deal approved by the court  The hard work  however  appears finished  With the ink not yet dry on the deal last week  CFO Gilvary was already heading back to London to begin a holiday

The mighty US dollar is looking for conviction and that is not expected to come ahead of tomorrows FOMC rate decision  2 00 pm EDT  
The markets this week are moving to the beat of company and industry dynamics as investors brace for the tomorrows Fed decision  when U S policy makers will weigh robust global growth against meagre inflation and mixed U S  economic data  Expectations are for policy makers to keep rates on hold  as the market searches for clues to the fate of the Fed s balance sheet  which should be key 
Overnight  the dollar has surrendered some of its short lived gains as concerns about the U S economy and politics returned to the fore  Global equities trade mixed  while gold is heading for it s first loss in four sessions  and crude oil gets a lift for a second day supported by the Saudi s promise yesterday to further cut crude exports 
1  Stocks mixed bag 
In Japan  the Nikkei share average edged down  0 1  overnight in choppy trade as investors braced for the outcome of the Fed s two day policy meeting that begins this morning  The market is also concerned that the long term rising trend in the broader Topix maybe somewhat hitting toppish levels  it fell  0 3  in the session 
Note  The techies note that the Topix is falling below its 25 day moving average on a closing basis for the first time in three months 
In Hong Kong  stocks finished flat as gains in the technology sector were outweighed by declines concentrated in energy and industrials stocks  The Hang Seng index ended up  0 02  after yesterday s posted two year high on Monday  The Hang Seng China Enterprise  CEI  was down  0 35  
In China  the major stock indexes retreated overnight  led lower by resource firms after their recent strong rally  The blue chip CSI300 index fell  0 6   while the Shanghai Composite Index lost  0 2  
In Europe  most indices are trading in the black  led higher by the Spanish Ibex and the FTSE100  which have rebound after sharp falls yesterday  Investor sentiment has been further boosted following a strong German Ifo reading for July  see below  marking a post reunification high  Earnings continue to be at the forefront

2  Oil extends gains as Saudi pledges export curbs  gold lower
Oil prices have extended yesterday s gains after Saudi Arabia pledged to curb exports from next month  Gains have also been supported by a warning from Halliburton  NYSE HAL  that the growth in North America s rig count was  showing signs of plateauing   a possible threat to U S shale oil production 
Brent crude for September delivery is up  22c  or  0 5  at   48 82 a barrel after settling up  1 1  yesterday  U S West Texas Intermediate  WTI  futures are up  23c  or  0 5  at   46 57 a barrel 
In Russia yesterday  OPEC and non OPEC producers discussed extending their deal to cut output by  1 8n bpd beyond March 2018 if necessary 
The Saudi s indicated that they would limit its crude exports to  6 6m bpd next month  almost  1m bpd below the levels of a year ago  while Nigeria voluntarily agreed to join the deal by capping or cutting its output from  1 8m bpd  once it stabilizes at that level  up to now  Nigeria had been exempt from the output cuts 
Crude price direction now looks forward to today s U S API oil inventory numbers  04 30 am EDT   The market is expecting a drawdown of  3m barrels last week 
Ahead of the U S  open  gold prices are a tad softer   0 3  to   1 251 87 an ounce   after hitting a one month high in the previous session  buoyed by political uncertainty in the U S  as investors wait for tomorrow s Fed decision 

3  Yields   EU US spreads widen

Note  The U S  Treasury will sell   26B 2 year notes today    34B 5 year notes tomorrow and   28B 7 year notes Thursday  
Aside from traders having to make room to take down supply  global yields direction will depend on tomorrows FOMC meeting and Friday s initial report on U S  Q2 GDP 
The Fed is not expected to hike rates  but the market is looking for any change in tone from policy makers  especially since they have leaned towards being a little  dovish  in recent weeks  U S  10 Year yield is trading atop of  2 27  
Euro data yesterday showing Germany s private sector growing at a slower pace in July  while French business activity slowed more than expected last month to a six month low gave investors another incentive to move back into fixed income that have been rattled by concerns over tapering 
German Bunds have backed up  1 bps to  0 52   while French OAT s are little changed at  0 75   UK Gilts have added less that  1 bps to  1 191  

4  Dollar diddles in the middle 
The EUR   1 1652  got a lift this morning after Germany s Ifo business sentiment surged  see below  to a record high in July  but it stays short of Monday s 23 month peak of  1 1683  with investors cautious ahead of tomorrow s FOMC rate announcement  Some EUR  bears  remain wary that the single units recent strong rise may soon dampen German exporter sentiment 
Overnight  USD JPY hit a five week lows below  110 85 before rebounding  The two new Bank of Japan  BoJ  board members  Kataoka and Suzuki  in their inaugural press conference showed that they are a  team player  under Governor Kuroda and helped the pair regain a foothold above the psychological  111 00 level to trade at  111 44 
Note  The new board members replace Kiuchi and Sato  who were dissenters  Yen  bears  believe that the incoming members will support the camp for QE

212455,433971,HAL,The Energy Report  Oil Drawdowns Across The Board,opinion,"Shale Pains and OPEC 
Oil prices are on the rise as Saudi Arabia pledges to reduce oil exports and the fact that US shale pains are becoming more obvious to the market  Halliburton  NYSE HAL  is warning that the US oil rig count is about to plateau or  peak shale  which we predicted in my recent energy webinar and for an article I wrote on the Fox Business Network website 
The Houston Chronicle reported that while oil service firm Halliburton saw its revenue jump in the second quarter as its North American hydraulic fracturing business boomed  the company expects the pace of growth to slow  Halliburton s executive chairman Dave Lesar said that the rig count growth is showing signs of plateauing  and customers are tapping the brakes   said Lesar  who will remain executive chairman until he retires at the end of 2018 
Marketwatch reported that shares of Anadarko Petroleum  NYSE APC   APC   0 34  fell more than 3  late Monday after the oil and gas exploration and production company reported a larger than expected second quarter loss  Anadarko said it lost  415 million  or 76 cents a share  in the quarter  compared with a loss of  1 36 a share in the second quarter of 2016  Adjusted for certain items  the company lost  423 million  or 77 cents a share  in the quarter  Some of this loss was due to a Colorado pipeline explosion but also due to shale oil losses 
Zero Hedge reported about Anadarko s big miss and said that what should be  far more concerning to shale bulls  and perhaps oil bears   is that the company admitted that it can no longer support its capital spending budget  and it would cut its 2017 capital budget by  300 million  becoming the first major U S  oil producer to do so  because of depressed oil prices  In March  Anadarko had forecast total 2017 capex of  4 5 billion to  4 7 billion  a continuation of the recent CapEx rebound which troughed in Q3 2016  In other word  this lack of investment and eventual shale pullback will reduce  once again  the outlook for US shale oil supply 
It seems most oil analysts are not seeing this potential pullback in US shale supply  Zero hedge reports that Horseman Global s Russell Clark  in his latest letter to investors  said that   the rising decline rates of major US shale basins  and the increasing incidents of frac hits  also a cause of rising decline rates  have convinced me that US shale producers are not only losing competitiveness against other oil drillers  but they will find it hard to make money     at some point debt investors start to worry that they will not get their capital back and cut lending to the industry  Even a small reduction in capital  would likely lead to a steep fall in US oil production  If new drilling stopped today  daily US oil production would fall by 350 thousand barrels a day over the next month  
This is what I am hearing from producers in the oil patch  Investors and the energy junk bond market is looking bad and investment capital for shale projects is falling  I covered all of this in my recent webinar that you can still get  In the heat of the oil rig frenzy  when folks were claiming that shale producers could produce oil even in the thirties  I warmed that they were getting ahead of themselves  The realities of losing money on every barrel and trying to make up for it in volume or debt for that matter  is not a winning long term strategy  Hopefully shale investors got the message through the shale oil excitement 
Rig counts in the Key Permian basin region have been stopping and uncompleted wells have been rising  The warning signs are there 
OPEC really must get some credit as the market  unlike the last OPEC announcement  is taking it as a positive  Saudi Arabia showed it will do whatever it takes  saying it will limit exports to 6 6 million barrels a day in August  1 0 million lower than last year  While it appears that Libya and Nigeria at this point have no formal quota  Libya will be allowed to keep increasing production to 1 25 million barrels a day  Nigeria is expected to cap or reduce production if they sustain production of 1 8 million barrels a day  Even though those are not hard and fast quotas  the market knows that they will at least have a cap somewhere  Besides  we might need some Nigerian and Libyan sweet to offset US shale condensate loses 
Oil drawdowns are going to start to matter  We should see another 3 million barrel drawdown in crude supply this week  We should also see equivalent drawdowns in the oil products  At some point the market is going to realize we are draining the oil inventories at a record pace and that will wipe away the surplus faster than people think ",2017-07-25,Phil Flynn,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-energy-report-07-25-17-200203242,200203242

212457,433973,HAL,The Energy Report  Oil Steals The Show As Inventory Rises,opinion,"Give me those Old Time Fundamentals
Oil prices had its biggest up move of the year  rising 3 3  on lower supply and higher demand  I don t mean to be so fundamental about the fundamentals  but in truth  that s why we soared 
Oil prices surged even before the American Petroleum Report  API  reported another massive crude oil crude withdrawal  The 10 23 million barrel draw  if confirmed by the Energy Information Administration  EIA   means that US oil supply is down almost 55 million barrels since the end of March  even as the Strategic Petroleum Reserve added over 13 million of barrels of oil into the marketplace 
The API brings the total inventory for crude oil in 2017 to a net draw of 7 534 million barrels  the first net draw for 2017 since January according to Oilprice  So we see that OPEC and non OPEC cuts do matter  As I told Marketwatch  the API reported crude supply draw erases the myth that shale can offset OPEC and non OPEC cuts barrel for barrel 
This comes as we get reports of surging oil demand in China and in the US against a back of more pledges of cutbacks and warnings for oil service companies and producers that shale output may have topped out  David Lesar  Halliburton  NYSE HAL  CEO and President  said in an earnings call that   rig count growth is showing signs of plateauing and customers are tapping the brakes   Anadarko Petroleum s Al Walker  the company s chief executive officer  cited   current market conditions  that  require lower capital intensity given the volatility of margins realized in this operating environment  
China s economy is growing faster than even the Chinese government predicted and that is raising the forecast for Chinese oil demand  Reports show that China oil demand is expected to rise by 400 000 barrels as its own domestic production plummets as those Chinese teapot refineries run hard 
Zhang Haichao  vice president of SINOPEC Group  HK 2386   told Reuters that Chinese crude oil imports are expected to exceed 400 million tons this year  China crude imports are running 13 8 percent above a year ago coming in at  8 55 million barrels of oil a day 
The UPI also reported yesterday that   A militant attack on a crude oil pipeline in Nigeria has sidelined more than 100 000 barrels of oil per day   the head of a state oil company announced  Maikanit Baru  the head of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corp   said as yet identified saboteurs caused a breach on a major transit artery  curbing 150 000 barrels of oil per day  The rupture from the Trans Niger pipeline came as parties to a committee monitoring a production agreement coordinated by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  of which Nigeria is a member  met to consider its impacts 
Today we will await the EIA to see if this surge in US oil demand continues  Surging US gasoline and diesel demand has come back with a vengeance after many thought that US demand had strictly changed  some of the demand numbers were under reported or influenced by transitory factors and the data looks like it is going to make up for lost time 
US oil production numbers will be closely watched as well to see if there is sign of sputtering output  We are predicting that US shale output will soon start to disappoint  High decline rates and uncompleted wells will start to reduce oil output expectations  API said gasoline inventories rose 1 903 million barrel build for the week ending July 21  compared to analyst expectations that inventories for the fuel would fall by 1 25 million barrels 
Platts is reporting that the US Treasury Department is crafting sanctions which would prohibit the import of Venezuelan crude oil into the US  one of several sanctions options the White House is considering in response to an expected vote Sunday in Venezuela  an administration source said Tuesday  But the Trump administration  which has studied the impact of the potential crude oil import sanctions on the US refining sector  is not expected to impose Venezuelan oil sanctions  at least in the near term  the source said   Treasury is preparing them  but that doesn t mean they ll implement them   the source said ",2017-07-26,Phil Flynn,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-energy-report-07-26-17-200203546,200203546
212458,433974,HAL,The Energy Report  Are Oil Supplies In Balance ,opinion,"Shell  LON RDSa  Versus Shale 
Who says that the U S  oil supply picture in not getting in balance  Oil supply in the US fell by 7 2 million barrels down over 50 million barrels since the end of March  It would have been over 60 million barrels if it were not for the reclassification of oil released from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve  That puts supply at the lowest level this year and 7 1  below last year  US crude production faltered last week  a sign that US shale producers are getting wobbly  Yet Shell posted better than expected blow away earnings as opposed to shale firms that are struggling to stay solvent 
Shell revenue came in at  72 13 billion vs  expected  67 78 billion  according to Reuters in a bright spot for bigger oil  Shell made money on reefing as strong margins and growing demand against a backdrop of near record productions for products boosted the bottom line  Reuters reported that Shell s net profit  on a current cost of supplies  CCS  basis  at  3 6 billion  up a whopping 245 percent from  1 billion for the second quarter of 2016  Shells CEO said that Shell promised to  remain very disciplined  to avoid seeing earnings impacted by the low prices of oil  He also suggested that oil prices lately have been driven by market sentiment and not fundamentals 
Shell s good fortunes are not being repeated in the shale front  Yesterday  Hess Oil said it would be cutting spending and exploratory expenditures forecast to  2 15B from original guidance of  2 25B after posting a bigger than expected loss  This comes after the CEO at Halliburton  NYSE HAL  said that rig count growth is showing signs of plateauing and customers are tapping the brakes  Hess sold assets in the Permian basin but is still trying to entice investors with the promise of more oil  The Hess cut was lower than Anadarko s  300 million capex cut due to losses on shale oil production  Sanchez Energy also announced  75 million to  100 million in 2018 spending cuts as shale oil is not yielding them a profitable price 
This comes as U S  oil production fell by 19 000 barrels a day  Most of the drop was in Alaska and the lower 48 saw production rise in the Gulf of Mexico  but shale production gains are still below estimates of growth  More cuts in capex and rig counts slow down  decline rates and capped wells could hurt as many shale guys are bleeding cash  OPEC cuts do matter and there are clear signs the market is on a path to a much tighter market than we have had since the global financial crisis 
Still oil is overbought technically and we need to see sustained follow through or consideration to perhaps make that big move  We have kept a bullish outlook as we knew that despite the price  the oil market was focusing on present supply and not future tightness due to a change in market players that the future would some day come  That day is here and now and we still maintain that oil can break out and hit 70 by the end of the year  Oil inventories globally will continue to drain a record pace at elevated prices  Shale producers will be in the process of pulling back for the rest of this year 
Shale  at this point  is not a swing producer  Unlike Saudi Arabia that can quickly raise or lower output in a crisis  shale producers have a much slower reaction time  Someday shale will get there but they are not there yet 
Gasoline demand also soared once again as concerns about demand are now in the rear view mirror  Supply also fell by 1 million barrels  U S  oil exports and exports of diesel and gasoline gain as the US becomes refiner to the world  Venezuelan sanctions have not hit their oil exports yet but if it does  US gas prices will pop  Tensions with Iran and Nigerian oil disruption added support ",2017-07-27,Phil Flynn,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-energy-report-07-27-17-200203876,200203876
212459,433975,HAL,Oil s Big Comeback,opinion,"The oil market is finally getting it that supplies are falling as geopolitical risks are rising and OPEC is going to clamp down on members that are over producing quotas  In the meantime  the US oil rig count increased by just 2 rigs this week as shale producers are making some cutbacks  Our  Summer Solstice  turnaround on oil that we covered in our webinar is coming together almost on cue as the outlook for higher oil prices in the second half of the year is back on track 
OPEC needs to get some credit  Since the market dismissed OPEC s extension of cuts and tanked prices near  42 00 a barrel  they hurt many shale producers causing warnings from Halliburton  NYSE HAL  that the sector is going to pull back  After a slew of capital cut announcements by producers  now comes word from OPEC that they will hold a meeting with some non OPEC members Aug  7 8 in Abu Dhabi to assess how the group can increase compliance with production cuts  OPEC wants to crackdown on the cheaters and continue to drain global supply that has already fallen at breakneck speed since the end of March  U S  crude inventories have fallen by 10 percent from their March to 483 4 million barrels  Low prices have also encouraged strong demand as gas demand in the US has surged  dismissing arguments that it has recently topped out while demand from India  China and Europe is surging  The Saudis also gave support to oil when they said that would reduce exports to 6 6 million barrels a day  That led to others like the UAE and Kuwait to pledge to reduce exports 
The US may impose more sanctions on the Venezuelan oil infantry after strongman Nicolas Maduro slaughtered his own people and continues to pillage what is left of the Venezuelan economy  Over the weekend the U S  called the election of Nicolas Maduro a sham and a statement was issued that   The United States stands by the people of Venezuela  and their constitutional representatives  in their quest to restore their country to a full and prosperous democracy  We will continue to take strong and swift actions against the architects of authoritarianism in Venezuela  including those who participate in the National Constituent Assembly because of today s flawed election   At this point  there are no sanctions on Venezuelan oil but on the industry itself  That will make it harder for Venezuela to keep production rising and ultimately will mean a higher cost for US drivers who will feel the impact of reduced shipments of heavy crude into the United States 
Russia retaliated against US sanctions leading to more concerns about where we go next  North Korea also set off more missiles that theoretically could hit the Untitled States  The Trump adminstration lashed out at China claiming that they need to do more to reign in North Korea 
Dow Jones reported that in Europe  a production outage at Shell  LON RDSa  s 404 000 barrel per day Pernis refinery in the Netherlands following a fire sent benchmark European diesel margins  which reflect the profit made from refining crude oil into the road fuel  to their highest since November 2015 at  14 60 per barrel 
We are looking for more drawdown in oil supply this week as the great rebalancing is underway  It will be just a matter of time and we will see many start to raise their oil price forecast soon after they just lowered them  Weather needs to be watched as well as Tropical Storm Emily formed in the Eastern Gulf Of Mexico  ",2017-07-31,Phil Flynn,https://www.investing.com/analysis/oils-big-comeback-200204592,200204592

	Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations    

Here are highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog  

Halliburton vs  Schlumberger  Which Is Better Pre Earnings  

	Analysts have made their predictions  Now it s time for the actual results  Energy infrastructure provider Kinder Morgan Inc   NYSE       kicked off the energy earnings season when it reported second quarter results yesterday after the market close 

	Now  it s the turn of the oil services companies   providers of technical products and services to drillers of oil and gas wells   to come out with Apr Jun numbers  which are likely to provide a better understanding of the sector s prospects in the near future  In particular  key oil services earnings scheduled for release over this week and the next  includingSchlumberger Ltd   NYSE       and Halliburton Co   NYSE        assume greater significance 

	The world s largest oilfield services provider Schlumberger is scheduled to report on Jul 21  while smaller rival Halliburton will release its second quarter earnings report on Monday  Jul 24  As such  this may be a good time to consider which of these is a better stock  Both of them carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see   

	Let s dive in 

	Schlumberger and Halliburton are both major players in the  industry  which is ranked a lowly 208 out of the 256 industries in our coverage  bottom 19    The broader  sector of which it is a part  is also staring down the barrel   currently sitting at the bottom of the Zacks Sector Rank  16 out of 16    To learn more visit    

Price Performance

	Schlumberger and Halliburton shares have suffered this year  as have shares of all oil related companies  to reflect the commodity s price slide and uneven outlook  That said  both have done better than their peers  While the Zacks Oil and Gas   Field Services Industry has lost  28 4   Halliburton is down by just  15 7  year to date and Schlumberger has witnessed its share price decrease by  19 7  since Jan 

Earnings History and ESP

	Halliburton has an incredible history when it comes to beating earnings estimates  Investors should note that Halliburton hasn t missed earnings estimates since mid 2014  As far as recent history is concerned  the TX based firm delivered earnings beat in each of the trailing four quarters  with an average positive earnings surprise of 68 49   On the other hand  Schlumberger has delivered positive surprises in just two of the prior four quarters with an average earnings surprise of a modest 4 55  

	The situation does not change when considering  values as well  with Halliburton clocking in at  15 79  while Schlumberger s reading stands at  3 33   You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  

Dividend Yield

	Schlumberger s dividend yield over the last one year period is 2 97   higher than the broader industry s figure of 2 12   With a dividend yield of 1 58  Halliburton shareholders earn significantly lower dividend yield than Schlumberger as well as the industry at large 

Valuation

	Compared with the S P 500  the Oil and Gas   Field Services industry is undervalued  This implies that the industry has the potential to gain in the near future  The industry has an average trailing 12 month EV EBITDA  enterprise value to earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization  ratio   which is often used to value oil and gas stocks  given their significant debt levels and high depreciation and amortization expenses   of 8 56  which is below the S P 500 average of 11 01  Hence  it might be a good idea not to stay away from stocks belonging to this industry 

	Coming to the two stocks under consideration  with an EV EBITDA ratio of 34 16 Halliburton is overvalued compared to the S P 500 and the industry  However  though Schlumberger also looks pricey compared to the industry and the S P 500  with an EV EBITDA ratio of 11 69  it defeats Halliburton decisively 

Investment Style

	According to the Zacks   Halliburton has a Value Score of D  Growth Score of A and Momentum Score of A  This stock is therefore most suitable for growth and momentum investors 

	Schlumberger has a Value Score of D  Growth Score of C and Momentum Score of F  which means that the stock is best avoided 

Other Metrics

	Schlumberger s expected EPS growth for  3 5 years  is 16 10   This is better than Halliburton s growth rate of 8 00  

	Also  beta for Schlumberger is 1 02  which shows marginally less volatility than Halliburton s beta of 1 04 

	Net profit margin for Schlumberger is 4 95   This is way better than Halliburton s net profit margin of  0 29  

	Also  Schlumberger has a lower leverage as evident by its debt to equity ratio of 0 40 compared with Halliburton s ratio of 1 20 

Conclusion

	The comparative analysis shows Halliburton has witnessed a more favorable share price movement throughout the year  possesses a fantastic surprise history  which means it is more predictable  and boasts of a better style score  Additionally  it carries a much higher ESP reading of  15 79   as against Schlumberger s figure of  3 33 

	However  Schlumberger is superior when considering dividend yield and valuation  Moreover  when considering EPS growth  profit margin and debt load  Schlumberger is clearly a better stock

It was the latest legal challenge to the settlement filed by the London based oil major  which has complained previously that Juneau has been too generous and liberal when approving claims  Juneau has said he is just applying the rules of the settlement agreement 
BP originally expected the March 2012 class action settlement to resolve economic and health claims by more than 100 000 individuals and businesses to cost  7 8 billion 
It has since said the uncapped program could cost  9 2 billion and that this amount could grow 
The filing in U S  District Court in New Orleans said Juneau lacks neutrality because he had advocated for claimants before the court appointed him to run the claims program

212495,434011,HAL,BP s Deepwater Horizon Spill Caused By Gross Negligence  Judge Says  Opening Company Up To Billions Of Dollars Of Claims ,news,"By    A U S  federal judge on Thursday ruled that British energy company BP Plc NYSE BP  LON BL  acted with gross negligence that resulted in 2010 s Gulf of Mexico accident that killed 11 people and poured millions of gallons of crude into the water over three months  The ruling may force the energy company to pay billions of dollars of claims against it  according to Bloomberg News 
The judge  Carl Barbier  conducted the trial without a jury  The case also included Transocean Ltd  NYSE RIG and Halliburton Co  NYSE HAL and they too were found negligent 

 BP s conduct was reckless  Transocean s conduct was negligent  Halliburton s conduct was negligent   the judge wrote in a decision released by his New Orleans chambers 
According to Bloomberg 
BP  which may face fines of as much as  18 billion  has set aside  3 5 billion to cover those penalties  The company had taken a  43 billion charge to cover all the costs related to the spill  according to a July 29 earnings statement  The ultimate cost is  subject to significant uncertainty   BP said 
The decision nevertheless may expose BP to unspecified punitive damages for claimants who weren t part of the  9 2 billion settlement the company reached with most non government plaintiffs in 2012  The judge left that unclear in his ruling 
Barbier determined that BP was 67 percent responsible for the disaster  while Transocean was responsible for 30 percent with the remaining 3 percent apportioned to Halliburton 
In July a study released about the accident at the Deepwater Horizon well said the impact of the 2010 spill is far more widespread than previously thought  Researchers say the spill s  footprint     the range of the marine ecosystem affected by the Deepwater Horizon disaster    extends twice as far from the site of the well leak than data first revealed   
BP s Deepwater Horizon    a deepwater oil drilling rig 40 miles off the coast of Louisiana    exploded April 20  2010  killing 11 crewmen and sparking a fire that could be seen from the mainland  The fire burned for 36 hours before the rig sank to the ocean floor  The resulting oil spill continued until July 15  releasing nearly 5 million barrels  or 210 million gallons  of oil and gas into the environment

212496,434012,HAL,BP   Business As Usual  For Offshore Oil Despite Ruling,news,"By    British energy giant BP PLC NYSE BP won t curb its plans to drill for offshore oil  even after a U S  judge found it was  grossly negligent  in the 2010 Gulf of Mexico disaster  the company s technology chief says  The ruling on Thursday could put BP on the line for up to  18 billion in new civil penalties for its role in the biggest offshore oil spill in American history 
 We are carrying on to invest in the plans that we had the day before yesterday   David Eyton  BP s group head of research and technology  said Friday on Bloomberg Television   For the rest of us  really  it s business as usual  
He skirted questions on whether the  18 billion fine could hurt the economics of its offshore projects  which cost significantly more to operate than onshore fields   You re making an assumption there   he told the Bloomberg reporter   We don t agree with the judgment that s been made and we are appealing that judgment  
The finding by U S  District Court Judge Carl Barbier in New Orleans assigns most of the blame for the Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion to BP  The incident killed 11 workers and caused millions of barrels of oil to gush into the Gulf  devastating coastal ecosystems and destroying fishing  tourism and recreation related businesses 
Ruling that BP was  grossly  negligent    not merely negligent    quadruples the maximum Clean Water Act penalty that the company could be required to pay  The full size of the fines depends on how many barrels of oil are considered to have spilled 
BP shares fell by about 6 percent on Thursday  or roughly  8 5 billion  though they rebounded slightly on Friday 
The energy firm is the largest leaseholder in the deepwater U S  Gulf of Mexico and produces fossil fuels from more than 15 fields in the region  BP s most recent discoveries  the Gila  Kaskida and Tiber prospects  signal that the Gulf  will be a vital part of the world s energy future for many years to come   according to its website 
Transocean NYSE RIG  the owner of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig  indicated that Barbier s ruling won t hinder the U S  offshore oil industry  The judge found Transocean held 30 percent of the blame for the explosion four years ago  Halliburton Co  NYSE HAL  a contractor involved in the incident  was apportioned 3 percent of the blame 

Barbier s decision is  a favorable and welcome ruling for Transocean  its employees and all offshore drilling contractors   a spokeswoman for Transocean told Oil   Gas Journal on Thursday 
Louisianans affected by the spill said they are frustrated that oil companies are continuing to drill the Gulf of Mexico even as the Deepwater Horizon recovery drags on  BP has already spent  28 billion on damage claims and cleanup costs  but thousands of claimants have yet to receive any money  In some cases  BP had frozen payments to Gulf Coast companies while it sought to appeal the terms of a March 2012 claims settlement  The U S  Supreme Court ruled in June that BP must stand by the agreement 
Chick Foret  a trial attorney in Metairie  Louisiana  who represents about  100 million in  business economic loss  claims  said that many of his clients have yet to be compensated   It s very disappointing that the federal government would allow BP to go back to business as usual   Foret told International Business Times   No one else is back to business as usual  ",2014-09-05,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/bp:-'business-as-usual'-for-offshore-oil-despite-ruling-308162,308162

212513,434029,HAL,UPDATE 2 Technip ups 2009 outlook  Q2 profit hike surprises,news,"  2009 revenues seen at high end of earlier guidance
   Q2 net profit up 12 8 percent y y at 116 million euros
   Margins strong and improving  despite tough market
 
  Adds details  dealer comment 
 By Sophie Taylor
 PARIS  July 23  Reuters    French oil engineering group
Technip posted a surprise rise in second quarter profits on
Thursday and gave an improved outlook for the year  bucking a
trend of weak demand and profits in the oil services sector 
 Technip said second quarter net income rose 13 percent to
116 2 million euros  helped by fatter profit margins  A Reuters
poll of five analysts gave an average forecast of 88 million
euros 
 Analysts had expected attempts by oil companies to cut costs
in response to lower oil prices to eat into Technip s sales and
margins  
  Analysts are going to have to significantly upgrade their
earnings forecasts for this year and next on the back of this  
one dealer said 
 The result compares with big profit falls at rivals such as
Norway s Acergy and U S  firms Halliburton Co and Weatherford
International 
 Technip said it saw 2009 revenue coming in towards 6 4
billion euros  against an earlier indication of 6 1 6 4 billion
euros 
 Profit margins in its high growth subsea engineering
division  which supplies underwater pipelines and construction
vessels  are now predicted to be at the top end of Technip s
earlier disclosed range of 16 18 percent 
 The sharp fall in oil prices from a record above  147 barrel
a year ago has forced exploration and production companies to
slash their spending 
 Companies are ordering fewer rigs  new production facilities
and other equipment and are pressing oil services companies to
offer discounts on what they do buy 
 Technip has been less impacted than many rivals because its
business involves large engineering projects which cannot be
quickly cancelled in bad times  or sanctioned in good times 
 Nonetheless  its second quarter order intake fell to 873
million euros  compared to 1 408 billion a year earlier  helping
to cut its order backlog to 6 066 billion euros  versus 6 928
billion in the first quarter 
 But Technip said a recovery in oil prices  and lower costs
for some equipment and services was encouraging oil companies to
open their wallets again and move ahead on projects 
  Our tendering activity has been increasing   the company
said in a statement 
 On Monday  the world s second largest oil services company 
Halliburton Co  said its second quarter net profits were around
half the level of the same period in 2008  Smaller rival 
Weatherford International said profits fell 77 percent 
 Acergy said last week that net profits fell to  76 million
in the second quarter from  90 million in the same period a year
earlier 
 Technip s shares closed down 0 76 percent at 38 05 euros on
Wednesday  compared to a broadly flat CAC 40 index

212515,434031,HAL,This Week On Wall Street  Are Natural Resources Due For A Turnaround ,opinion,"There s never a slow week in the world of finance 
In the last few days  we learned that the U S  will soon begin pulling out of the Paris Climate Agreement  for better or for worse 
Whether or not you liked the agreement  we can all agree that it will have some significant long term effects on our resource and energy markets 
For now  though  there s plenty of short term upside in this potentially undervalued sector  That s why Rick Rule  CEO of Sprott U S  Holdings  recently sat down with The Oxford Club s newest strategist   
ERIC  Rick  the natural resources sector has been pretty treacherous lately  So I thought I d check in with you to hear your latest thoughts and find out what opportunities you might be seeing in this battered and bruised sector 
RICK  Yes  we re definitely in a rough patch at the moment  But it s times like these that create buying opportunities  We re at a place now in the midst of a choppy market where the generalist financial institutions are getting redemptions from their clients  These institutions raise cash by selling off the stocks they understand the least  and those stocks are almost always in the natural resources sector 
Sometimes these institutions make some really spectacular mistakes  They dump some truly great resource stocks  which creates wonderful investment opportunities for those of us who understand what we re buying 
ERIC  Okay  so let s take a tour of the resource markets  What do you like right now 
RICK  I normally start portfolios from the least speculative names to the most speculative ones  So I would start by looking at Adams Natural Resources Closed Fund  NYSE PEO   which is a closed end fund on the New York Stock Exchange 
ERIC  Yep  I think that s an  oldie but goodie  

RICK  It s really well run  but the last time I looked  it was selling at a 14  discount to net asset value  NAV   And that discount amortizes a reasonable amount of sin 
There are times when the sector returns to favor and the thing actually sells at a premium to NAV  You understand that argument 
ERIC  Yes  I ve been around closed end funds since the 1980s  So I do know how that works  If you buy Adams at a 14  discount  for example  you re buying its portfolio for  0 86 on the dollar  That creates some embedded leverage  So then if the stocks in the portfolio go up  and the fund s discount to NAV narrows or closes entirely  you get a kind of  double win  on your investment 
RICK  Right  So Adams is something you might look at in terms of establishing positions  Next  I believe we re beginning a renewed spending cycle in oil and gas  and not just in the shale plays  So I think people should look at the biggest and the best of the oil field services businesses as a consequence of that  Names like Halliburton  NYSE  NYSE HAL  and Schlumberger  NYSE  SLB  are appealing to me 
ERIC  Absolutely  I agree  and these big names are possibilities for options plays as well 
RICK  There is really quite a lot of good stuff in the market right now

212551,434067,HAL,Here s What Happened The Last Time OPEC Cut Oil Production,opinion,"It finally happened  For the first time since 2008  the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC  agreed to a crude oil production cut last week  renewing hope among producers and investors that prices can begin to recover in earnest after a protracted two year slump  one of the worst in living memory 
The last three times the cartel agreed to trim output in 2008  2001 and 1998 oil rallied in the following weeks and months  Of course  there s no guarantee the same will happen this time around  as other market forces are at play  but it s helpful to look at the historical precedent 

OPEC s decision follows a strong endorsement from Goldman Sachs  which upgraded its rating on basic materials to overweight for the first time in four years  Analysts see commodities gaining 9 percent on average over the next three months  11 percent over the next six months 
As reported by TheStreet s  Goldman s change of heart was prompted by  the recent acceleration in global PMIs  purchasing managers  indexes    which  suggests commodity markets are entering a cyclically stronger environment  
The JPMorgan Global Manufacturing PMI rose slightly in November to a 27 month high of 52 1  extending sector expansion for the sixth straight month very encouraging news 
As I ve shared with you many times before  our own research has shown a strong correlation between PMI performance and commodity prices three and six months out  I m thrilled to see Wall Street and media outlets coming around to this realization as well 
In short  OPEC s production cut is constructive for energy in the near term  while a rising PMI is good news for the long term 
 70 Oil Next Year 
Since oil collapsed in September 2014  as much as  4 billion have been wiped from oil workers  wages in the U S  alone  according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data  Countries that rely heavily on oil revenue Venezuela  Colombia  Russia and Nigeria  notably have had to stretch balance sheets  And for the first time in nearly 40 years  Alaska  where the oil industry accounts for half of all economic activity  is scheduled to impose an income tax by 2019 
Many analysts now find reason to be optimistic about a recovery in energy  Speaking to the  David Pursell of energy investment bank Tudor  Pickering  Holt   Co  predicts  2017 will be a better year for oil and gas activity than we anticipated   Pursell sees crude possibly rallying above  70 a barrel sometime next year 
The OPEC deal  announced last Wednesday  aims to reduce production by 1 2 million barrels a day  or about 1 percent of global output  For comparison s sake  the cartel  which controls a third of all oil production  agreed to a reduction of 2 2 million barrels a day in 2008  Although not an OPEC member  Russia has also agreed to trim production by about 300 000 barrels a day the first time it s cooperated with OPEC since 2001 
Following the announcement  West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude surged above  50 a barrel 

Meanwhile  investors piled into oil ETFs  with inflows into one surpassing  1 billion on Thursday alone  Shares of Halliburton  NYSE HAL   Continental Resources  NYSE CLR  and California Resources  NYSE CRC  all saw dramatic spikes 

The Challenges Ahead
Some investors are understandably cautious  OPEC doesn t have the authority to enforce compliance from its 14 member nations  and output has typically exceeded quotas 
What s more  it s likely U S  shale producers  which today operate at lower costs compared to other players  will be first to take advantage of a bump in prices  Drilling activity is already accelerating  Since May  the number of active oil rigs in North America has climbed 50 percent to 474  as of November 23 

 U S  oil production growth is all but guaranteed to return in 2017   according to  founder of oil research firm Infill Thinking  Triepke adds that as many as 150 rigs could be reactivated next year in Texas  Permian Basin alone 
It s there  in the Wolfcamp formation of the Permian  that the United States Geological Survey  USGS  recently discovered  of  technically recoverable  oil  the largest deposit ever to be found in the U S  Bloomberg reports that the deposit is worth an estimated 
On the demand side  higher prices could spell trouble in emerging countries whose currencies have weakened against the U S  dollar in recent months  especially since Donald Trump won the presidential election  Because oil is priced in dollars  it s become more expensive in China and India  the second and third largest oil consumers following the U S 
Gold Looks Technically Oversold  Ready for a Price Reversal
As I often say  every asset class has its own DNA of volatility  which is measured by standard deviation  Specifically  standard deviation gauges the typical fluctuation of a security or asset class around its mean return over a period of time ranging from one day to 12 months or more 
This brings us to mean reversion  which is the theory that  although prices might trend up for some time  as in a bull market   or fall  as in a bear market   they tend to move back toward their historic averages eventually 
Such elasticity is the basis for knowing when an asset is overbought or oversold and when to sell or buy 
As you can see in the oscillator below  gold looks oversold right now and is nearing a  buy  signal  after which we can statistically expect it to return to its mean 

Gold s current standard deviation for the 60 day period is about 7 percent you can reasonably expect it to move this much over a two month period  therefore  68 percent of the time 
For more on standard deviation and mean reversion  you can download my whitepaper on the subject

212552,434068,HAL,The Final Nail In The Coffin Of Halliburton Company,opinion,"Halliburton Company  NYSE HAL  was primed for a monster breakout on the stock chart today  The stock chart had a perfect bull flag setup  it just needed catalyst  Then it happened  Overnight  non OPEC oil producing nations announced a cut in production  Oil surged dramatically going into today s action  This seemed like a perfect catalyst for a massive breakout  Halliburton Company jumped at the open    
Within 10 minutes  the stock had topped  Then Halliburton Company  NYSE HAL  slowly sold off the rest of the day  This is insanely brearish not only for the constant institutional selling all day long  but because it is a failed breakout and the resulting candle on the daily stock chart is a topping tail  Topping tails are reversal signals  extremely bearish

212560,434076,HAL,On The Verge Of 2200,opinion,"We re almost there  The S P may have been down on Friday  but it was up nearly 1  for the week and could now basically lean forward and reach 2200  Several of the editors  Steve  Jeremy  Kevin Matras and Tracey just to name a few  believe that it could hit that mark during the short Thanksgiving week  That would be a great way to start the holiday season 
The S P was down 0 24  on Friday to 2181 9  but was up 0 8  for the week  The Dow declined 0 19  to 18867 9  eking out a 0 1  increase for the week  The NASDAQ was off 0 23  in the session to 5321 5  yet advanced 1 6  in the week  It should be noted that the Russell 2000 has kept its winning streak intact at 11 sessions of gains  It was up 0 47  Friday to a new high of 1315 6 
In the portfolios  Tracey added to both of her services  She added two names to Insider Trader and one to Value Investor  Also  Stocks Under  10 filled one of its vacancies with a new buy  Both of these editors are expecting to add again next week  Read more below Marvellous Returns for Surprise Trader
  The Surprise Trader went to the bank on Friday  Eric sold half of three positions all of them were positive and two brought double digit returns  Marvell Technology  MRVL   destroyed  earnings estimates in its quarterly report yesterday  so the editor sold half of the position and made 11 3   Quintiles  Q  was halved as well for a 10 4  profit  Even half of Halliburton  NYSE HAL  was enough for a gain of 5 2   Remember  the editor is still hanging onto shares of each of these positions to capture more upward momentum Today s Portfolio Highlights 
  The Insider Trader added two stocks on Friday with 10  allocations in each  First up  shares of Church   Dwight  CHD  have slumped 10  in recent months as consumer products companies have fallen out of favor  However  the pullback prompted the CEO and the Chief Marketing Officer to pick up shares of their own company this month  Tracey thinks this could be a turnaround play  so she added it to the portfolio 
The other buy was Black Stone Minerals Partnership  BSM   which is one of the largest owners of oil and natural gas mineral interests in the country  The editor sees this MLP as a unique play on the recovery of the energy industry  BSM reported a solid third quarter recently  but its share price has been limited by the depressed price of crude  Over the last week  the company s President   CEO made a massive purchase with buys on four different days  Read more about both of today s buys  and be ready for more additions next week 
  There are plenty of vacancies in Stocks Under  10 right now  so on Friday Brian added Bioamber  BIOA   This chemical company works on renewable feedstocks and sustainable chemicals that would be replacements for petroleum  It has some positive momentum going for it right now  Though its earnings history isn t that great  the editor was impressed with its three straight quarters of sequential revenue growth  Earnings estimates for BIOA are moving in the right direction  which explains its Zacks Rank  2  Buy  status  The complete write up has a lot more information on this new addition  and the editor plans to make another buy on Monday 
  It s difficult to find value right now as nearly every index stretches to new all time highs but Tracey found one  Unifi  UFI  makes multi filament polyester and nylon textured yarns and other raw materials  It s a small cap in a niche market  but the editor likes the space and says it should do well in 2017 if the consumer sees improvement  Thanks to record results in its international segment  UFI beat on revenue in its fiscal first quarter report  But Tracey was most impressed with its price to sales ratio of 0 9  which is difficult to find right now  A reading under 1 0 can mean a company is undervalued  She added this Zacks Rank  2  Buy  to Value Investor on Friday  Read a lot more about this addition in the complete commentary    Moderate weakness in equities today after S P cash came within 4 handles of all time highs  Too many on one side of the ship expecting the breakout can make things difficult  which is why we saw the small pullback in the late morning hours  I m expecting the move higher to 2200 to happen early next week  Mutual fund Monday should give markets a head start and the short  low volume week will make markets easier to push around  Look for a 2200 print Tuesday or Wednesday  It will make for a great headline Thanksgiving morning  Wall Street loves positive headlines on holidays   said Jeremy in Zacks Counterstrike

EUR USD   moved higher despite the strong GDP data out of the US  which showed that the economy is growing at a faster pace than expected  This in turn has increased the odds of a rate hike this year even further  However  news that the FBI will investigate Clinton again for her emails caused the USD to lose strength 
USD JPY   moved higher to reach the highest level since the end of July after the US GDP data was better than expected  However  when news broke that the FBI will reopen its investigation of Clinton  the JPY strengthened significantly  not only because the USD lost strength  but also because the JPY is a safe haven  which usually strengthens on insecurity and fear in the market  
GBP USD    also benefitted from the FBI probe  but will be mainly looking at the data this week out of the UK  We obviously have the FED rate decision on Wednesday  but on Thursday the BOE follows and we will also be waiting to see if BOE Governor Carney will need his term in 2018 as originally planned  or extend his term to 2021  In case he decides he will quit in 2018  it will create yet more uncertainty  something which unlikely to be good for the GBP  especially in the situation it is in already  
USD MXN    was already moving up for the last few days  but saw a large spike when news of the Clinton probe broke  as this is seen as increasing the chances of Trump on Election Day

S P 500   traded up for most of the day and got another boost after the strong GDP data  but also here  the news about Clinton cause the S P to drop  However  we are seeing a sharp correction this morning

Gold   as the Clinton affair was the major mover late Friday  it should come as no surprise that also gold was influenced and moved up as it is a safe haven  We are currently trading just above the resistance support around the 1276 level 
Natural Gas   saw another test of the upwards trend line on Friday  and this trend line is still in place 
Oil   moved down as it was unable to break above the psychological 50 level and also because there are more and more doubts any meaningful agreement will be reached between OPEC members and also with non OPEC members  This weekend there was a meeting between different oil producing countries  which didn t lead to anything  OPEC produced more in September than before and this obviously underlines the difficulties in actually reaching an agreement  as no country seems eager to be cutting production and wants others to do that  We saw that the number of active rigs decreased for the first time in weeks  albeit by 2

GE   is reportedly looking to set up a new entity with Baker Hughes in a transaction that could be as high as  30 billion  It remains to be seen if they reach an agreement and also if this will go through  as Baker Hughes and Halliburton  NYSE HAL  also reached an agreement but was stopped by the anti trust regulators ",2016-10-31,AvaTrade,https://www.investing.com/analysis/market-update-–-31-10-2016-200161626,200161626

212587,434103,HAL,Are These Energy Stocks Changing The Game ,opinion,"The energy sector is constantly changing   We know that there is a 

high dependence on oil and I like to say that oil is the fuel for 

the world s economy  With oil prices rebounding amid talk of an 

OPEC production cut investors are looking at the sector for some 

new ideas  

 
At Zacks Investment Research  I manage the Game Changers portfolio 

where I look for stocks that are positioned to benefit from large 

shifts in demand   It might be tech  it might be consumer staples 

and it might be energy   Right now  I hold two stocks in the energy 

space in the portfolio  but I want to review other potential 

additions as well 


Trusting the Rank


At Zacks  we focus most of our energy on earnings  and more 

specifically stocks that show positive earnings estimate revisions  

 The Zacks Rank is an algorithm that tells me which stocks are 

seeing the best earnings estimate revisions  and I use it on a 

daily basis to screen for stocks 


Helix Energy Solutions  HLX  is a Zacks Rank  1 

 Strong Buy  stock that has seen a great run over the last several 

weeks as it moved from  7 to more than  10 per share today  Last 

night the company presented a slide in a presentation that wasn t 

especially positive  but the market doesn t seem to mind   The 

company see FY16 revenues of  505M  down slightly from  510M that 

was the previously guided number   The reason the stock is up is 

that the Wall Street consensus was calling for  500M in revenue  so 

it is a slight uptick 


The company just posted earnings  0 10 when the Zacks Consensus 

Estimate was calling for a  0 04   That  0 06 beat is a 150  

positive earnings surprise and just what I like to see in a 

candidate for my Game Changers portfolio 


Gushing Over Another Stock


Baker Hughes  BHI  is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and is 

slated to report earnings soon   The company is on a bit of a skid  

as it has missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last 

three reports   


I see the Zacks Consensus calling for revenue of  2 427B in revenue 

and a loss of  0 44 per share 


BHI isn t really changing the game for me right now  but we will 

learn more about this stock following the earnings report which is 

expected out early next week 


Another Oil Name


Halliburton  NYSE HAL  is also a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  

and coming off a solid earnings report  The company reported 

earnings of  0 01 when the Zacks Consensus Estimate was looking for 

a loss of  0 07   The  0 08 beat translates into a positive 

earnings surprise of 114   and that is music to my ears 


Earnings estimates for next year are a little stagnant as they have 

not move moved that much over the last five months   In that time 

period  the number was as high as  0 90 and as low as  0 88 and is 

currently  0 89   


That said  the  0 89 looks great compared to a loss of  0 16  which 

is the current Zacks Consensus Estimate for FY16 


Not Oil  But Close


Energy Recovery  ERII  was the  a few weeks ago and I 

strongly encourage you to check that article out  I go into the 

recent earnings history  estimate changes and valuation as well in 

that write up   ERII is not really oil  but they are involved in 

the industrial fluid flow markets  

 
ERII does a lot of work in the desalinization industry but is also 

a player in the oil and gas industry   Remember there is a large 

part of the eco system of oil that is industrial products and 

services to help keep the world s engine all greased up 


ERII is the exact type of stock that I look for in Game Changers 


Low Price  Big Potential


The other service I manage at Zacks is Stocks Under  10   This 

looks to leverage the Zacks Rank and stocks that are priced under 

 10  Right now  I only have 12 stocks in that portfolio and I am 

looking to expand it to the normal level of 15 names in the near 

future 


One potential addition is Precision Drill  PDS  as 

it is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and of course  priced below  10   The 

company is expected to report earnings tomorrow before the open so 

I will be watching it closely

	The energy sector is constantly changing  We know that there is a high dependence on oil and I like to say that oil is the fuel for the world s economy  With oil prices rebounding amid talk of an OPEC production cut investors are looking at the sector for some new ideas 

	At Zacks Investment Research  I manage the Game Changers portfolio where I look for stocks that are positioned to benefit from large shifts in demand  It might be tech  it might be consumer staples and it might be energy  Right now  I hold two stocks in the energy space in the portfolio  but I want to review other potential additions as well 

Trusting the Rank

	At Zacks  we focus most of our energy on earnings  and more specifically stocks that show positive earnings estimate revisions  The Zacks Rank is an algorithm that tells me which stocks are seeing the best earnings estimate revisions  and I use it on a daily basis to screen for stocks 

Helix Energy Solutions  NYSE      is a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stock that has seen a great run over the last several weeks as it moved from  7 to more than  10 per share today  Last night the company presented a slide in a presentation that wasn t especially positive  but the market doesn t seem to mind  The company see FY16 revenues of  505M  down slightly from  510M that was the previously guided number  The reason the stock is up is that the Wall Street consensus was calling for  500M in revenue  so it is a slight uptick 

	The company just posted earnings  0 10 when the Zacks Consensus Estimate was calling for a  0 04  That  0 06 beat is a 150  positive earnings surprise and just what I like to see in a candidate for my Game Changers portfolio 

Gushing Over Another Stock

Baker Hughes  NYSE      is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and is slated to report earnings soon  The company is on a bit of a skid  as it has missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last three reports 

	I see the Zacks Consensus calling for revenue of  2 427B in revenue and a loss of  0 44 per share 

	BHI isn t really changing the game for me right now  but we will learn more about this stock following the earnings report which is expected out early next week 

Another Oil Name

Halliburton  NYSE      is also a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and coming off a solid earnings report  The company reported earnings of  0 01 when the Zacks Consensus Estimate was looking for a loss of  0 07  The  0 08 beat translates into a positive earnings surprise of 114   and that is music to my ears 

	Earnings estimates for next year are a little stagnant as they have not move moved that much over the last five months  In that time period  the number was as high as  0 90 and as low as  0 88 and is currently  0 89 

	That said  the  0 89 looks great compared to a loss of  0 16  which is the current Zacks Consensus Estimate for FY16 

Not Oil  But Close

Energy Recovery  NASDAQ     was the  a few weeks ago and I strongly encourage you to check that article out  I go into the recent earnings history  estimate changes and valuation as well in that write up  ERII is not really oil  but they are involved in the industrial fluid flow markets 

	ERII does a lot of work in the desalinization industry but is also a player in the oil and gas industry  Remember there is a large part of the eco system of oil that is industrial products and services to help keep the world s engine all greased up 

	ERII is the exact type of stock that I look for in Game Changers 

	Low Price  Big Potential

	The other service I manage at Zacks is Stocks Under  10  This looks to leverage the Zacks Rank and stocks that are priced under  10  Right now  I only have 12 stocks in that portfolio and I am looking to expand it to the normal level of 15 names in the near future 

	One potential addition is Precision Drill  NYSE      as it is a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and of course  priced below  10  The company is expected to report earnings tomorrow before the open so I will be watching it closely

Hundreds Laid Off as Norway Oil Workers Strike Continues

	The Norwegian oil service strike is causing labor turmoil in the nation s energy industry  sparking hundreds of layoffs 

Pink Slips for 350 Oil Workers

	As per the Norwegian Oil and Gas Association   an industry forum for oil employers on the Norwegian Continental Shelf   approximately 350 oil related jobs have been lost due to the strike that began on Wed  Sep 21  Of the axed workers  majority  or roughly 300  were from Baker Hughes Inc   NYSE       while local units of fellow U S  oilfield services behemoths Halliburton Company  NYSE      and Schlumberger Ltd   NYSE      accounted for the rest 

Reasons for the Strike

	Called by the Norwegian Union of Industry and Energy Workers  or  Industri Energi    the union representing service firm employees  the strike was implemented after wage talks broke down with the Norwegian Oil and Gas Association 

	The oil companies maintained that they were not in a position to increase wage bills at a time when crude prices have more than halved in the last two years  This prompted Industri Energi to take out more than 300 of its members employed with large subcontractors   like Baker Hughes  Schlumberger  Halliburton and Oceaneering International Inc   NYSE        to the country s oil and gas industry 



Strike Affecting Drilling Operations

	The week long strike has taken its toll on drilling and well operations on the Norwegian Continental Shelf  where Norway s entire oil reserves are located  Incidentally  Norway is the largest oil producing country in Europe 

	With offshore installation jobs shut down and rigs stopping operations due to the strike  oil firms   already financially challenged due to the commodity price rout   have been forced to lay off personnel  they no longer require  to reduce losses 

More Layoffs to Come 

	While the number of workers laid off as a result now exceeds the total who actually downed tools  the Association  terming the strikes as  unnecessary   fears more such extreme steps over the next few days

212631,434147,HAL,Halliburton  HAL  Slips To Loss In Q2  Beats On Revenues ,opinion,"Major oilfield services provider  Halliburton Company  NYSE HAL   reported narrower than expected second quarter 2016 loss following higher fluid works and improved pipeline services in the North Sea  However  lower pricing and reduced global activities   especially North American pressure pumping works   hurt results significantly over the year ago quarter 
	Loss per share from continuing operations came in at 14 cents  narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 19 cents  The company had posted profits of 44 cents in second quarter 2015 







	Halliburton is the first member of the  big 4 oil service companies  to come up with second quarter earnings  Baker Hughes Inc    Schlumberger Ltd  and Weatherford International Ltd    the other members   are expected to release earnings on Jul 28  Jul 21 and Jul 27  respectively 

	Halliburton s revenues of  3 835 million surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 744 million owing to higher sales of completion tools in Nigeria  However  the top line witnessed a 35 2  year over year decline  

	During the quarter  North America accounted for approximately 39 5  of Halliburton s total revenues Segmental Performance
	Revenues at Halliburton s Completion and Production segment came in at  2 1 billion  down 38 2  year over year and almost 9  sequentially  Lower prices of product service lines and pressure pumping works in North America did the damage  However  the negatives were partially offset by higher sales of completion tools in Nigeria and improved the North Sea pipeline services 
	The segment s operating loss came in at  32 million while it had reported profits of  313 million and  30 million  the year ago and prior quarter  respectively  Lower pricing and reduced global activities   especially North American pressure pumping works   played foul this time around

	Moreover  the segment s operating income fell 62  from the year ago quarter and 36  from first quarter 2016 to  154 million due to reduced activities and pricing weakness primarily in North America and Middle East Asia Balance Sheet
	Halliburton s capital expenditure in the second quarter totaled  213 million  As of Jun 30  2016  the company had approximately  3 1 billion in cash cash equivalents and  12 2 billion in long term debt  representing a debt to capitalization ratio of 56 9     Outlook
	Halliburton expects rig count to increase modestly during the second half of 2016 which should push up North American activities

The decline from 74 33 to 37 21 looks like a textbook five wave impulse  So  the rest of the price action has to be some kind of a corrective pattern  In fact  it appears to be an  in progress  If this is the correct count  we should expect one last push by the bulls towards 50 20

U S  Rig Count Rises on Higher Oil Drilling  Gas Rigs Fall

In its weekly release  Houston based oilfield services company Baker Hughes Inc      reported a higher U S  rig count  number of rigs searching for oil and gas in the country  than the previous week  The West Texas Intermediate  WTI  oil futures are currently trading at around  49 per barrel Analysis of the Data
	Weekly Summary  Rigs engaged in exploration and production in the U S  totaled 431 in the week ended Jul 1  2016  This was up by 10 from the week before 
	The current nationwide rig count is less than half the prior year level of 862  Notably  the count had peaked at 4 530 in 1981  Inversely  an all time low was recorded in March and since then  the rig count has recovered marginally 



Rigs engaged in land operations were 408 compared with 397 in the previous week  Inland water activity involved four rigs  up by one from the prior week  Offshore drilling was down by two to 19 units 
	Natural Gas Rig Count  The count fell by one from last week to 89  However  the current natural gas rig count is almost 95  below the high of 1 606 reached in late summer 2008  In the year ago period  there were 219 active natural gas rigs 
	Oil Rig Count  The count was up by 11 from the previous week at 341  The number had skyrocketed to 1 609 in Oct 2014   the highest figure to have been reported since Baker Hughes started breaking up oil and natural gas rig counts in 1987  The current tally is well below the previous year s rig count of 640 
	Rig Count by Type  The number of vertical drilling rigs was up by eight to 61  while the horizontal directional rig count  encompassing new drilling technology that can drill and extract gas from dense rock formations  also known as shale formations  was up by two to 370 
	Gulf of Mexico  GoM   The GoM rig count was down by two to 18 units Conclusion
	Key Barometer of Drilling Activity  The Baker Hughes data  issued since 1944  acts as an important yardstick for energy service providers in gauging the overall business environment of the oil and gas industry 
	An increase or decrease in the Baker Hughes rotary rig count weighs heavily on demand for energy services like drilling  completion and production provided by companies that include large cap firms such as Halliburton Co       Schlumberger Ltd     and Weatherford International plc

212664,434180,HAL,Top Trade Ideas  Halliburton,opinion,"Halliburton  NYSE HAL  started lower with oil prices in July 2014  The pace of decline slowed in 2015 and it found a bottom in February 2016  In fact it was a double bottom  as it is now confirmed with a move over the October and November 2015 consolidation area 
In April the price also pushed over the 200 day SMA for the first time since October 2014  This was followed in May with a golden cross  the 50 day SMA crossing up through the 200 day SMA 
The price action is building a 3 wave pattern now that targets 47 50 on the third leg  This would be confirmed on a move over the May 2nd high  It has support to move up from the rising and bullish RSI and the rising MACD  The Bollinger Bands  are also opening to the upside  That would put the stock within a stone s throw of the May 2015 high at 50 
There is resistance along the way at 42 95 and 44 50  followed by 46 40 then 48 15 and 50  Support lower comes at 41 50 and 40 followed by 38 60  Short interest is low at 2 8  and the company is expected to report earnings next on July 20th 
The options chains show most of the open interest this week below the current price  The call side is biggest at 42 and the put side from 41 to 41 50  In the June monthly expiry  the largest open interest is above at the 44 strike calls with big size at the 42 call as well and then smaller at the 40 put 
The July monthly expiry is also largest on the call side  this time at 42 and then 41  but all the put action below from 41 to 35  The July 22 expiry  the first after the earnings report  is just starting to build 
Finally  the August open interest is also small relative to June and July  but focused below the current price 

Trade Idea 1  Buy the stock on a move over 43 with a stop at 41 25 
Trade Idea 2  Buy the stock and add a July 22 expiry 42 5 40 put spread  offered at 90 cents  and sell a July 22 expiry 46 covered call  54 cents  
Trade Idea 3  Buy a July 42 call and sell a June 44 call   1 71  for a call diagonal 
Trade Idea 4  Buy a July 40 42 46 bullish call spread risk reversal   1 06  
Trade Idea 5  Sell a June 43 straddle   1 67  and buy a July 22 expiry 43 straddle   3 59  
Trade 1 is a straight stock buy and Trade 2 adds protection with a collar  though earnings for an extra 36 cents  Trade 3 looks for the upside with the large open interest in June options to hold it at 44 next week  then continue  Trade 4 looks for a run up into earnings and for the stock to remain over 40 along the way  Trade 5 looks to give an earnings set up to move either way with nearly half the cost funded if it does not move much the next 2 weeks ",2016-06-06,Gregory W.

212688,434204,HAL,Trading Chances  AUD CAD  AUD JPY  Macerich  MAC  And Halliburton  HAL ,opinion,"AUD CAD
In this forex pair we can see a very young uptrend in the medium trend size  The last correction led the price deep down into the green correction zone  At the lower edge  enough buyers appeared to create the next move  Yet the price fell back down over and over again  and the trend was unable to continue up until now  But the DowHow signals are still valid  and we have the chance to speculate on a trend continuation once more  With regard to a long trade  the stop should be placed below the green zone 

AUD JPY
In this pair we have a similar occurrence  By means of the last DowHow signals  we were able to see that the recent increase led the price up to the last point two at 86 40 JPY  and has created a new point two at 86 67 JPY  After this  the price fell back into its correction zone  but not too far  and it attempted a new increase immediately  However  the trend was unable to continue since we do not have a close above 86 76 JPY  This means that the current correction zone between 86 40 JPY and 83 90 JPY still remains valid  As we can observe now  with the most recent green candles we have received a new DowHow signal  and we are able to start a new attempt at a long trade  A stop should be placed below the green zone  and the first target should be located at the last point two at 86 67 JPY 

Macerich Company  NYSE MAC 
In this value we come across a very interesting situation  First we see a young downtrend with a correction zone between  74 55 and  82 88 on the upper side  In the meantime  the price has corrected deep into this zone and then bounced at the visible upper trend line of this current trend channel  Here we can speculate that enough sellers will appear to ensure that we see a trend continuation  As you can see  I have placed a short order with a stop above the red zone 

Halliburton  NYSE  NYSE HAL 
My short trade begins with today s opening  I am trading the medium trend size here  and speculating on a trend continuation because   as Charles Dow argued   a trend continuation is more likely than a trend break  but only if the trend is not too mature yet  We will see if this trade works well

212689,434205,HAL,Avoiding Cheap  Value Stock Cigarette Butts,opinion,"Too many investors hang their hat on investments that seem  cheap   Unfortunately  too often something that looks like a bargain turns out to be a cigarette butt from which investors are hoping to take a last puff  As the old adage states   you get what you pay for   and that certainly applies to the world of investments  There are endless examples of cheap stocks getting cheaper  or in other words  stocks with low price earnings ratios going lower  Stocks that appear cheap today  in many cases turn out to be expensive tomorrow because of deteriorating or collapsing profitability 
For instance  take Halliburton Company  NYSE HAL   an energy services company  Wall Street analysts are forecasting the Houston  Texas based oil services company to achieve 2016 EPS  earnings per share  of  0 32  down  79   The share price currently stands at  37  so this translates into an eye popping valuation of 128x P E ratio  based on 2016 earnings estimates  What has effectively occurred in the HAL example is that earnings have declined faster than the share price  which has caused the P E to go higher  If you were to look at the energy sector overall  the same phenomenon is occurring  with the P E ratio standing at a whopping 97x  at the end of Q1  
These inflated P E ratios are obviously not sustainable  so two scenarios are likely to occur 
The price of the P E  numerator  will decline faster than earnings  denominator 
AND OR

The earnings of the P E  denominator  will rise faster than the price  numerator 
Under either scenario  the current nose bleed P E ratio should moderate  Energy companies are doing their best to preserve profitability by cutting expenses as fast as possible  but when the product you are selling plummets about  70  in 18 months  from  100 per barrel to  30   producing profits can be challenging 
The Importance of Price  or Lack Thereof  
Similarly to the variables an investor would consider in purchasing an apartment building   price  is supreme  With that said   price  is not the only important variable  As famed investor Warren Buffett shrewdly notes  the quality of a company can be even more important than the price paid  especially if you are a long term investor 
 It s far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price  
The advantage of identifying and owning a  wonderful company  is the long term stream of growing earnings  The trajectory of future earnings growth  more than current price  is the key driver of long term stock performance 
Growth investor extraordinaire Peter Lynch summed it up well when he stated 
 People concentrate too much on the P  but the E really makes the difference  
Albert Einstein identified the power of  compounding  as the 8th Wonder of the World  which when applied to earnings growth of a stock can create phenomenal outperformance   if held long enough  Warren Buffett emphasized the point here 
 If you aren t willing to own a stock for ten years  don t even think about owning it for ten minutes  Put together a portfolio of companies whose aggregate earnings march upward over the years  and so also will the portfolio s market value  
Throw Away Cigarette Butts
I have acknowledged the importance of aforementioned price  but your investment portfolio will perform much better if you throw away the cigarette butts and focus on identifying market leading franchises that can sustain earnings growth  The lower the growth potential  the more important price becomes in the investment question  see also   
Here are the key factors in identifying wining stocks 
Market Share Leaders  If you pay peanuts  you usually get monkeys  Paying a premium for the  1 or  2 player in an industry is usually the way to go  Certainly  there is plenty of money to be made by smaller innovative companies that disrupt an industry  so for these exceptions  focus should be placed on share gains   not absolute market share numbers 
Proven Management Team  It s nice to own a great horse  i e  company   but you need a good jockey as well  There have been plenty of great companies that have been run into the ground by inept managers  Evaluating management s financial track record along with a history of their strategic decisions will give you an idea of what you re working with  Performance doesn t happen in a vacuum  so results should be judged relative to the industry and their competitors  There are plenty of incredible managers in the energy sector  even if the falling tide is sinking all ships 
Large and or Growing Markets  Spotting great companies in niche markets may be a fun hobby  but with limited potential for growth  playing in small market sandboxes can be hazardous for your investment health  On the other hand  priority  1   2  and  3 should be finding market leaders in growth markets or locating disruptive share gainers in large markets  Finding fertile ground on long runways of growth is how investors benefit from the power of compound earnings 
Capital Allocation Prowess  Learning the capital allocation skillset can be demanding for executives who climb the corporate ladder from areas like marketing  operations  or engineering  Regrettably  these experiences don t prepare them for the ultimate responsibility of distributing millions billions of dollars  In the current low negative interest rate environment  allocating capital to the highest return areas is more imperative than ever  Cash sitting on the balance sheet earning 0  and losing value to inflation is pure financial destruction  Conservatism is prudent  however  excessive piles of cash and overpaying for acquisitions are big red flags  Managers with a track record of organically investing in their businesses by creating moats for long term competitive advantage are the leaders we invest in 
Many so called  value  investors solely use price as a crutch  Anyone can print out a list of cheap stocks based on Price to Earnings  Enterprise Value EBITDA  or Price Cash Flow  but much of the heavy lifting occurs in determining the future trajectory of earnings and cash flows  Taking that last puff from that cheap  value stock cigarette butt may seem temporarily satisfying  but investing in too many value traps may leave you gasping for air and force you to change your stock analysis habits

212753,434269,HAL,Canada s Very Accommodative Monetary Policy,opinion,"The speech given yesterday by Carolyn Wilkins  the Bank of Canada s Senior Deputy Governor  in no way reassured markets with respect to the Canadian economy  In addition to specifying that the economy has room to grow  Ms  Wilkins also stated that current low crude oil prices represent a risk to the country s financial stability  Schulumberger  Halliburton  NYSE HAL  has also announced layoffs to its workforce  eliminating close to 5 000 positions  These decisions are another sign that major oil and gas companies are postponing or cancelling exploration and expansion projects 
According to Ms  Wilkins  the Bank of Canada has the tools required to help the country s economy get through this rough patch  This speech was entirely consistent with market expectations for another key rate cut  Consequently  the loonie could remain weak in the short term 
Lastly  attention will now turn to Europe  specifically on the crucial meeting of European finance ministers that gets underway today  Have a great day

The Markets 
Stocks plunged on Monday as the price of oil took another leg lower  weighing once again on the energy sector  The price of Oil is now down by almost 54  since hitting its 2014 high of  107 68  a free fall that is becoming reminiscent of the 2009 swoon  The 2009 low is the next significant point of reference  providing the best opportunity for a rebound attempt  Prior to the strong rise in the commodity from 2004 through to 2008  multi year resistance was evident around  40  That previous level of resistance turned into support during the 2008 2009 collapse  This level is expected to act as support once again As prices nears  40  negative bets on the commodity are likely to be shed and speculators will become willing to enter  providing momentum for a long overdue bounce  Recall that the period of seasonal strength for the commodity is around the corner  gaining  on average  from the end of February through to May as supply and demand imbalances shift in favour of higher prices through the spring  The upcoming trade in Oil and the energy sector continues to hold appeal  assuming support is maintained over the weeks ahead 





The longer term prospect for the commodity market  however  remains questionable  The US Dollar Index continues to climb following the bottoming pattern charted over the last many years  With the breakout in the currency benchmark above resistance at 89  confirmation of a positive long term trend has been provided  the impact of which is certain to weigh on commodities priced in the domestic currency  During the late 90 s  the last time the US Dollar realized a sustained multi year rise  commodities were the weakest performing asset class  weighing upon stocks in the materials sector  A trend of underperforming returns amongst material stocks is already evident  losses on an absolute basis may now be following  Seasonally  the US Dollar Index tends to rise through the first two months of the new year  a threat to material stocks over the short term

212795,434311,HAL,How To Profit From The Surge In Domestic Oil Production,opinion,"Crude Oil has pulled back from its recent price strength  but it s still holding up pretty well above the  100 00 per barrel mark for West Texas Intermediate  WTI  
Energy is still a top sector for equity portfolios  but it is the case that many oil stocks have already moved up tremendously and valuations are a little stretched 
I m a big believer in energy infrastructure and pipelines for income seeking investors and junior energy stocks for risk capital investors 
It s more difficult to find value in this market  that s for sure  But domestic oil and gas production  transportation  and storage remain a growth industry 
Halliburton Company  Halliburton Company  NYSE HAL  just reported another great quarter  with its oil and gas services still being pretty robust worldwide 
In particular  Halliburton s management noted solid strength in the U S  market for energy services  and that s on top of several tremendously good years in recent history 
According to the company  2014 second quarter sales came in at  8 1 billion  up solidly from first quarter sales of  7 35 billion and comparative second quarter sales of  7 32 billion last year 
Recent quarterly revenues were a new record for Halliburton  with notable strength in its North American operations  In fact  domestic operations are so strong that management plans to immediately add new equipment  transportation capabilities  and work crews for hydraulic fracturing 
The company s operating margins are rising  internationally  as well   and the board just increased its share repurchase authorization by a huge  4 8 billion to  6 0 billion in total 
Halliburton s share price is up 40  year to date  and I d say there s a good probability the position is going higher yet  as it s not overpriced for double digit growth 
The company s stock chart is featured below 

The oil business is a good one  and while some operations go in and out of favor with institutional investors  there is still near  to medium term opportunity stability in domestic production growth and related infrastructure 
One business I like for income seeking investors is Kinder Morgan Energy Partners  L P   NYSE KMP   which is a master limited partnership with a current yield of just less than seven percent  
What I like about this partnership is its track record of increasing payments to unit holders  In its most recent quarter  Kinder Morgan increased its quarterly distribution to  1 39  which represents a five percent increase over the second quarter of 2013  This is the 52nd occurrence of increased distributions to unit holders since new management took over in early 1997 
Domestic oil and gas infrastructure is a good business to be in  likely for the rest of this decade 
Pipeline companies are also strong contenders for income portfolios  at a lot of these companies  revenues are not related to oil or natural gas prices  Longer term contracts are common within the industry  and it makes for a good business model when domestic oil production is on the rise 
Of course  the oil and gas business is cyclical  It always has been and always will be  And there will be shocks to the system that are way beyond your control  especially regarding geopolitical events 
This is why I d say stick with those oil and gas companies that have large domestic operations  Oil infrastructure  which includes transportation  pipelines  and storage  offers a solid business model for the next several years

After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed Saturday which  heading into the  Sell in May and Go Away  season sees the equity markets looking better  Elsewhere look for Gold to consolidate in its uptrend with a bias higher while Crude Oil continues lower  The US Dollar Index seems biased lower while US Treasuries are biased higher  The Shanghai Composite and Emerging Markets are both biased to the upside  Volatility looks to remain subdued keeping the bias higher for the equity index ETF s SPY  IWM and QQQ  The indexes themselves all look better to the upside in the short term with the SPY strongest followed by QQQ and then IWM  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

212818,434334,HAL,Jumping Into The Big Oil Gush,opinion,One name in the Oil and Gas services sector gave a clue that a turn around higher was coming  Halliburton  HAL   Back in late April it broke the bullish flag higher  and has not looked back  Are you too late  No  The target on a AB CD brings it to 50 93  That exceeds 11  higher from the close  But quite often these extend to CD   127  of AB  or even 168  of AB  This gives a target higher to 54 75  near the target from a Measured Move out of the flag  or even 59 68  Midway from a breakout some may find the reward to risk unfavorable  This can be handled by using options  Harmonics gives an estimate of mid July for  D  to print  One way to play it is to buy the July 46 Call for  1 62  where it was offered near the Halliburton  close Monday  3 5  of the cost of buying the stock  It also has 9 weeks to play out  which is plenty of time  If that is too much though  you can plan to reduce the cost by selling some options against it  Selling the July 40 Puts for 37 cents  brings it down less than 3   but opens you up to owning the stock on a close under 40 on July Expiry  You can cut off another 21 cents by selling the May weekly 46 50 Calls for a Calendar Spread  This is the same structure that we traded for clients in ExxonMobil  XOM   with a June October 95 Call Calendar and short an October 85 Put  This can still be traded in XOM  and the Exxon trade was easier to start  as it just broke a long channel on Monday  but the Halliburton trade shows a better example of how to play a stock that is running  Minimize your capital at risk and if selling naked options do it at a level where the stock is a good buy  Good Luck The information in this blog post represents my own opinions and does not contain a recommendation for any particular security or investment  I or my affiliates may hold positions or other interests in securities mentioned in the Blog  please see my  page for my full disclaimer ,2013-05-20,Gregory W.
