7141,228656,ALBO,Biodel To Capitalize On New Treatments In The  10B Diabetes Market,opinion,Glucose is one of the most important chemical structures because it is essential in providing the body with energy  It is integral in the chemical process called aerobic respiration  which generates a usable form of energy  Glycolysis is the beginning of this process  which oxidizes glucose to form CO2  H20  and adenosine triphosphate  ATP   ATP is a chemical structure that stores energy and transfers it throughout the body  When our bodies have trouble regulating the uptake of glucose into the blood stream  not enough energy is created and distributed to important organs  especially the brain  Since glucose is a necessary chemical in our bodies  problems with the uptake of this chemical can cause major issues  Diabetes is a disease that causes the body to have problems regulating the uptake of glucose in the bloodstream  The uptake of glucose through the blood stream is controlled by a balance between glucose and a peptide hormone released by the pancreas called insulin  The amount of glucose in the blood stream is important because too much glucose can lead to hyperglycemia  but too little can lead to hypoglycemia  Hyperglycemia can lead to blindness  loss of kidney function  and nerve damage while hypoglycemia can result in dizziness  fainting  confusion  and increased heart rate  Since diabetes has become such a prevalent disease  several biotech companies have created therapies to help patients regulate insulin and glucose in the blood stream  Biodel  BIOD  is one such biotech company that is developing specialized therapies for diabetes  Biodel s lead drug candidate BIOD 123 is a therapy for patients with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes  Although still in clinical trials  BIOD 123 has the potential to be a better therapy than those currently on the market  The drug s faster onset of action and non invasive routes of delivery improve the efficacy  safety  compliance  and convenience for the patients  Pipeline  BIOD 123The goal of diabetic therapies is to help the body s cells uptake the glucose in the blood stream by providing insulin  There are two different types of diabetics that need a constant need for insulin    type 1 and Type 2  In Type 1 diabetes  the body attacks the cells in the pancreas that produce insulin  which is usually caused by a genetic condition  In Type 2 diabetes insulin resistance occurs  causing the body to not produce enough or ignore available insulin  Although Type 2 diabetes has some genetic risk factors  it is predominately caused by lifestyle choices  In both cases  patients require a supplementation of insulin in order to regulate their blood glucose levels  Biodel s BIOD 123 is a proprietary form of injectable recombinant human insulin  RHI  that is injected to help regulate blood glucose level  It is designed to be an ultra rapid acting formulation when compared to the current  fast acting  mealtime  prandial  insulin that already exists on the market  Although still in early clinical trials  Biodel is taking the next step in insulin based therapies by developing an ultra rapid acting therapy  If eventually approved  the ultra rapid acting insulin formulation would take a majority share of the diabetic market because it would be the superior option  as it addressing several of the market s unmet needs  Improvement over Current TherapiesThere are several advantages of the ultra rapid acting insulin therapies that would represent a significant upgrade over current therapies  Current insulin  analogs  are synthetic lab made recombinant forms of human insulin on the market and aren t perfect in performing their desired task  After eating a meal  the body naturally creates insulin within minutes to react to glucose entering the blood stream  This first phase insulin spike is not easily mimicked by injected insulin  which takes about 120 to 180 minutes to reach peak levels in the blood stream  One of the significant milestones in diabetic treatments was the invention of the rapid acting insulin analogs  which takes about 50 to 70 minutes to reach peak level  which is a significant improvement over injected insulin  The major goal of companies who have brought insulin products to market is to mimic that exact function of real insulin release with as little time delay as possible  However  even the most advanced rapid acting insulin analogs on the market today have a significant time delay  peak in the bloodstream  The failure of currently marketed insulin products to adequately mimic the first phase insulin release results in deficient insulin levels at the beginning of a meal and excessive insulin levels between meals  This time lag in insulin delivery can result in excessive glucose levels shortly after eating  leading to hyperglycemia and then  two to three hours later  inadequate glucose levels between meals  which may lead to hypoglycemia  These swings between excessive and inadequate levels of insulin are highly deleterious to the health of people with diabetes  Ultra rapid acting insulin has significant advantages  since it most effectively mimics the natural release of insulin in the body that science can provide  The faster the insulin can reach the bloodstream  the better the glycemic control  As seen above  lack of glycemic control can lead to hypoglycemia  weight gain  blindness  kidney disease  nerve damage  and amputation  Improvement of insulin absorption and delivery into the bloodstream would be a huge leap for diabetic patients  Mannkind Corporation  MNKD  is one company working on a similar form of ultra rapid acting insulin with its product AFREZZA  which is delivered through an inhaler similar to what Asthmatics use  Mannkind believes it can capture a large share of the diabetic therapy market  due to the advantages of its solution over current therapies on the market  If Mannkind can deliver good data  it should be seen as a strong positive for Biodel shareholders  as it proves that ultra rapid acting insulin would be a viable therapy to bring to market  Additionally  although Mannkind is further along in clinical trials  there is a significant gap in speculation value between the two companies  As of today  Mannkind has a market cap of about  2 24B  while Biodel has a market cap of about  60M  Also  Mannkind as an investment is significantly riskier  due to its huge debt and traditional problems getting inhaled diabetic therapies approved within the market space  Eli Lilly and Company  LLY  currently owns one of the blockbuster therapies for rapid acting mealtime insulin injections with Humalog    Humalog brought in  2 40B in 2012  Other products on the market include Novo Nordisk s Novolog and Sanofi aventis  Apidra  Mannkind and Biodel are on the cutting edge of improving diabetic therapies with their ultra rapid acting insulin solutions  If Mannkind and Biodel can gain approval for their respective drugs  the opportunity exists for both companies to realize massive revenue and profit  Near Term CatalystsThe company is expecting   With the market for these products estimated to be about  10 billion in value  good results for Biodel s product would be a major step for the company and serve as top notch catalyst for biotech investors  Biodel chose Eli Lilly s Humalog as its comparator for BIOD 123 and in Phase I trials has shown very positive results  BIOD 123 showed a better pharmacokinetic profile  PK  than Humalog and an improvement in injection site tolerability  After successful Phase I data  Biodel began a Phase II trial  with results expected in the third quarter 2013  as Biodel CEO Dr  Errol De Souza stated in the   We are pleased to report progress across the breadth of our portfolio of pipeline product candidates  Enrollment is fully complete in our Phase 2 clinical trial of RHI based ultra rapid acting insulin BIOD 123 and more than half of the subjects have finished the study  as we remain on track to report top line data in the third calendar quarter of 2013  On the research front  our new concentrated insulin candidate BIOD 531 has demonstrated an ultra rapid acting onset and basal duration profile in diabetic swine which could offer medical practitioners a novel therapeutic to improve prandial coverage while maintaining basal coverage in both severely insulin resistant patients and patients who use premixed insulins  BIOD 123 will be compared to Humalog with the primary endpoint being HbA1c control  which is a lab test designed to see how well a patient is controlling his blood glucose levels  The secondary endpoints are aimed at demonstrating the superiority of ultra rapid acting insulin by measuring postprandial glucose control  glycemic variability  hypoglycemic event rate  and weight changes  With the company already producing positive Phase II data with its previous formulation Linjecta  it can be speculated that BIOD 123 has a great chance of also producing positive Phase II results  Linjecta  Past Failure Aids Biodel s New TrialsBiodel s first insulin analog  Linjeta  was expected to be approved by the FDA in November of 2010  but instead the company received a Complete Response Letter  CRL   in most part due to tolerability issues relating to localized discomfort  pain  at the site of injection  There was also an issue that occurred at a clinical site in India where some blood samples were compromised  Nonetheless  the CRL came as a shock to a lot of analysts and investors because the product was seen a sure shot win for approval  After receiving the CRL  the company decided to scrap Linjeta and start working with newer  better formulations of insulin  Based upon the complete response letter and subsequent feedback that the FDA provided to us at a meeting in January 2011  we decided to study newer RHI based formulations in earlier stage clinical trials  After reviewing the results of a Phase 1 clinical trial of two newer formulations  BIOD 105 and BIOD 107  we determined that the overall pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of these formulations did not demonstrate our target product profile  We subsequently conducted a Phase 1 clinical trial of two additional formulations  BIOD 123 and BIOD 125  and announced top line results from that trial in April 2012  We determined that both formulations achieved our target pharmacokinetic  pharmacodynamic and toleration profiles  With the new formulation  Biodel aimed to address several of the problems the FDA had with Linjecta  The company relocated the trials to the United States  so that there would not be a discrepancy between any data reported  The company also addressed the issue with injection site tolerance in the Phase I clinical trials for BIOD 123    Biodel explains the Phase I results and details how tolerance was measured  Both RHI based formulations and Humalog  were well tolerated  with injection site toleration generally perceived by patients to be similar to that of their usual mealtime injections used at home  As measured on a 100 mm visual analog scale  or VAS  in which 100 mm is defined as the worst possible injection discomfort  local toleration was not significantly different for BIOD 123 compared to Humalog   BIOD 123 mean VAS 3 6   2 1 mm  Humalog  1 8   1 1 mm  p NS   The VAS score for BIOD 125 was slightly higher as compared to Humalog   mean VAS 6 8   2 9 mm  p   0 05   What is most significant from these results is that the site injection profile is at least as good if not better to that of Humalog s  Absorption rates of BIOD 123 and BIOD 125 were significantly faster than that of Humalog  as indicated by 64  and 54  reductions  respectively  in mean times to half maximal insulin concentrations  p   0 001 for both BIOD 123 and BIOD 125 compared to Humalog   The company has done some major restructuring in regard to its clinical trial design as well as a major overhaul with its actual drug candidates  Out of four formulations  the two best formulations were chosen for development in drug programs  and it seems that Biodel has put some major thought into advancing development of its best and most effective RHI products  BIOD 125  which was previously Linjeta  has been modified to enhance injection tolerability and BIOD 123  Instead of trying to get Linjecta approved again  Biodel smartly chose to address the concerns the FDA had with the previous trials and now should have a greater chance at obtaining approval in the future  Instead of going forward with an inferior drug and trying to gain approval  Biodel decided to design a new formulation and a revamped trial  which should be beneficial for the company  With such a large market opportunity  it is worth the company s time and money to successfully bring to market a drug that could generate billions in revenue  Partnerships and Patent ProtectionBiodel has patented its ultra rapid acting insulin in a variety of ways  The company has protection in the United States and the European Union  which will expire in 2026 and 2025  respectively  The patents protect ultra rapid acting insulin formulations that include  RHI based  analog based  subcutaneous delivery  sub lingual delivery  non hexameric insulin  and multiple combinations of excipients  With several large pharmaceuticals looking to either capture a larger share of the diabetes market or protect its existing products  a partnership with Biodel would be seen as a smart decision for a larger pharma  as we see referenced in Elly Lilly s   The U S  patent for Humalog expires in May 2013  Humalog is currently protected in Europe by formulation patents  We do not currently expect the loss of patent protection for Humalog to result in a rapid and severe decline in revenue  To date  no biosimilar version of Humalog has been approved in the U S  or Europe  however  we are aware that other manufacturers have efforts under way to develop biosimilar forms of Humalog  and it is difficult to predict the likelihood  timing  and impact of biosimilars entering the market  Since Humalog generates over  2B in revenues for the company  Elly Lilly will be looking for ways to keep competitors from stealing market share  A partnership with Biodel could be a smart option for the future  Additionally  Cymbalta accounts for about  4 9B in revenues and it too will have a patent expiration this year  These two patent expirations seem to signal that Elly Lilly will be very active in leveraging itself to make sure it doesn t lose any of its  22 6B in revenue  There also might be some competition to receive a partnership because of Biodel s BIOD 250 program  Biodel s technology was added to several of the existing drugs on the market including Elly Lilly s Humalog  Novo Nordisk s Novolog  and Sanofi s Apidra  In January  management announced positive trial results in converting existing insulin analog drugs into ultra rapid acting insulin  With several of these large pharmaceutical s patents expiring in 2013 and 2014  Biodel might receive a partnership  At these current stages  partnering with Biodel would be seen as a value add and a small price to pay to help protect future revenue  Since Biodel currently has such a small market cap  any partnership with a large pharmaceutical would be seen as another key milestone for the company  Top Institutional Holders Baker Brothers Advisors holds 540 000 shares of Biodel  which is a bullish sign to me  Baker Brothers have had good success this year with several small cap biotechs  realizing huge gains in a short time frame  Vanda Pharmaceuticals  VNDA  has seen a huge appreciation in its stock price recently  hitting a 52 week high of  13 30 on June 12th  I wrote about Vanda in August of 2012  believing it was undervalued and gave it a one year target price opinion of  10 a share  The recent huge run with Vanda began when its developmental drug tasimelteon  a Phase III clinical trial for the treatment of a circadian rhythm sleep disorder  The stock has more than doubled since April of this year  Baker Brothers Advisors holds 5 745 000 share of the company  which is now a huge winning position for them  Clovis Oncology  CLVS  has been on an epic run over the past year  rallying from  11 19 in November 2012  to a recent 52 week high on June 3rd of this year  The company presented positive results at The American Society of Clinical Oncology  ASCO  Annual Meeting in Chicago  from its ongoing Phase I II trials for both CO 1686 and rucaparib  Rucaparib is a potent poly ADP ribose polymerase  PARP  inhibitor active in patients with ovarian  breast and pancreatic cancers  while CO 1686 is designed to treat non small cell lung cancer  NSCLC   Baker Brothers Advisors are very intelligent when it comes to small cap biotech investing  Seeing them with a position in Biodel is a very good sign  Also worth noting  is  2 874 153 shares in Biodel  with 1 478 643 of those recently added  Orbimed is also known to have a very good record with investing in small cap biotechs  Financial and Share Structure Biodel burns roughly  5M a quarter  so the company has enough cash to get through the next year Chart The chart above looks very solid  with the uptrend resuming after being initially overbought as indicated by the MACD histogram  yellow indicator   I see a nice pattern of continuation with lower highs and higher lows  Because this is a low float stock  the price movement can be very sudden and drastic  ConclusionWith a current market cap of about  60M and products in development for the multi billion dollar diabetes market  Biodel is significantly under speculated  So far  it seems evident that the company has addressed the issues the FDA had with Linjecta and the company is ready to move forward with BIOD 123  With catalysts looming  speculation of partnerships  and a large market opportunity  it is my opinion that Biodel will see a significant run in the coming months  My short term target is  6 00  If positive data is announced  then I expect the stock to double from current levels to between  8 and  9  Disclosure  I am long BIOD  Disclaimer  This article is intended for informational and entertainment use only  and should not be construed

7142,228657,ALBO,Biotech Catalyst Trade Watch List  4 To Keep An Eye On,opinion,Today  I list 4 biotech companies with significant near term catalysts ahead  Under normal market conditions  these stocks should see decent to very strong appreciation in the short term  There are various ways to play these catalyst trades  Traders and investors can choose to sell their shares before the actual catalyst event to reduce risk  or increase their risk by holding their shares through the actual events  Personally  if I believe a company will have a sucessful catalyst event  I will roll profit out of the stock and roll it into the option chain via calls  Buying calls allows for a set limited max loss    if the catalyst event is a failure  the most a trader investor can lose is the price paid for the calls  However  if holding a position in the stock through the event  the losses can extremely significant  beyond a set limited loss  Investors and traders should consider these factors before making any trade investment  Biodel  BIOD  focuses on the development and commercialization of treatments for diabetes in the United States  Biodel is expecting to release Phase II clinical

patients and patients who use premixed insulins  We look forward to progressing BIOD 531 into clinical trials   In 2010  the Federal Drug Administration  FDA  gave Biodel a complete response letter for Linjecta  which was an injectable  fast acting human insulin for patients with Type I or Type II diabetes  Instead of going forward with that formulation  management decided to study four new formulations  BIOD 105  BIOD 107  BIOD 123  and BIOD 125  BIOD 123 and BIOD 125 were found to be the statistically better formulations  With management focused on correcting the problems it had with the Linjecta studies  BIOD 123 should have a more competitive chance at producing positive data  With a market cap of only about  64 Million  Biodel is under spec valued  GTX  GTXI  engages in the

from the two pivotal clinical trials termed POWER 1 and POWER 2 soon this year  Both of the pivotal trials are placebo controlled  double blind  and were fully enrolled by the 4th quarter of 2012  The data from these trials are of the utmost importance for patients with muscle wasting because there is currently no approved treatment    Chief Executive Officer of GTx   We are pleased that the DSMB  Data Safety Monitoring Board  has recommended that GTx continue as planned with our clinical studies of enobosarm under the existing protocols  The extensive safety database GTx is compiling from the numerous clinical studies of enobosarm will be a critical component of GTx s application for marketing approval  which we hope to submit following receipt of topline data from our Phase III clinical trials in the 3rd quarter of 2013   In both trials  patients with stage III or IV NSCLC were randomized at the time they began first line chemotherapy and were either treated with placebo or 3 mg of enobosarm  The study measured the response rates of enobosarm vs  placebo  on maintaining or improving total lean body mass  To test this  doctors had patients perform a stair climb to assess the individual s power at day 84 of treatment  Additionally  the study used dual x ray absorptiometry  DXM  to measure the patient s bone mineral density at five months of treatment  If the data turns out to be good for GTX here  we can easily see a double in stock price from its current level of  6 81  with a market cap of  429 24M  Sarepta Therapeutics  SRPT  focuses on the discovery and development of RNA based therapeutics for the treatment of rare and infectious diseases  Sarepta should receive a decision from the FDA on whether or not to grant eteplirsen an accelerated approval  which wouldbypass a Phase III trial and go straight to market  Eteplirsen is an antisense PMO based therapeutic for the treatment of young boys with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy  DMD   The FDA decision is expected some time in the 3rd quarter  possibly early Q3  Some analysts have put a  50 price target on Sarepta  and if early approval is granted here  it s my opinion the stock will surpass the  50 range temporarily  so traders and investors might consider selling what I believe will be a gap to over  60  as it s likely the stock will sell the gap back down to the low  40 range  Remember  should the FDA grant the early approval  a lot of investors and traders will be looking at massive profit  and are likely to take that profit  In turn  I would expect short sellers to take advantage of this and sell the gap as well  Sarepta is a stock investors and traders should keep on close watch    I believe the FDA will grant the requested early approval before the end of summer this year  Antares Pharma  ATRS  focuses on developing and commercializing self administered parenteral pharmaceutical products and technologies  and topical gel based medicines worldwide  Antares expects a Prescription Drug User Fee Act  PDUFA  approval decision from the FDA on or before October 14  2013 for OTREXUP  formely known as Vibex MTX   OTREXUP is a rapid subcutaneous  SC  self administered injection of methotrexate  MTX   MTX is a medicine used to treat and control severe psoriasis or rheumatoid arthritis  Investors and traders might have Antares and its OTREXUP under the radar  so to speak  Although its current market cap of  517 32M might seem a bit high on the surface  I feel it s actually somewhat low  OTREXUP is pretty much a given to receive FDA approval in October  and could bring upwards over  1B in revenue to the company in lifetime sales  Factoring in this product alone  Antares is roughly about  300M undervalued in my opinion  If we take into consideration its well positioned partnership with Teva Pharma  TEVA  for some of its other products like TevTropin  10mg  Vibex  EPI  and Vibex  Sumatriptan  Antares could easily see a market cap over  2B in 4 to 5 years  Antares also has warrants issued that are due to come to expiration this month  so I would expect the remaining warrants to be exercised soon  Last year  Antares saw a similar situation with warrant expiration  At the time  the stock ran up from around  3 to  5 58 in a very short period of time  I also speculate that Antares will be acquired this year by Pfizer  PFE   so I expect many warrant holders to hold their shares  rather then sell them  Disclosure  I am long BIOD  GTXI Disclaimer  This article is intended for informational and entertainment use only  and should not be construed as

7146,228661,ALBO,Q4 Earnings Season Gets Underway,opinion,"The strong earnings report from AutoZone Inc  NYSE AZO  started the Q4 earnings season for us  though we are still a few weeks away from the from the earnings season taking the spotlight  Companies with fiscal quarters ending in November are reporting these days and all of these get counted as part of the Q4 earnings tally  We have 39 companies reporting results this week  including 12 S P 500 members  This week s list of reporters includes a number of industry bellwethers like FedEx  NYSE FDX   Nike  NYSE NKE   Oracle  NYSE ORCL  and others  The market has plenty of domestic economic data to digest this week in a backdrop of persistent oil market weakness  On the docket this week are a host of housing  inflation  and manufacturing sector reports  but the focus will be on the FOMC meeting  particularly Fed Chairwoman Yellen s press conference  It will be interesting to see if the Fed will finally come around drop the  considerable time  phrase from its post meeting statement Estimates Keep Coming Down Estimates for 2014 Q4 started coming down at an accelerated pace as companies predominantly guided lower on the 2013 Q3 earnings calls  consistent with the trend we have been seeing for almost two years now  Total Q4 earnings for companies in the S P 500 are currently expected to be down  3 3  from the same period last year  a material decline from the  9 6  growth expected at the start of the quarter in early October  The table below presents the summary picture for Q4 contrasted with what companies actually reported in the Q3 earnings season  Please note that the Q3 earnings season isn t officially over yet  as one S P 500 member has yet to report results for that quarter  Joy Global  NYSE JOY  reporting this week will be the last S P 500 member to report Q3 results 

The chart below shows how estimates for Q4 have evolved since the quarter got underway  Please note that the magnitude of negative revisions for Q4 is the highest we have seen at comparable periods in other recent quarters  with the Energy sector as the biggest drag 

The negative revision trend is widespread  but is particularly notable for the Retail  Basic Materials  Autos  and Transportation sectors  in addition to Energy  Utilities is the only sector where estimates have modestly gone up while Business Services saw estimates remain unchanged  The chart below shows the sectors with big negative revisions 

With roughly two thirds of S P 500 companies beating earnings expectations in any reporting cycle  actual Q4 results will almost certainly be better than these pre season expectations  In fact  a look at the revisions trend for the last 5 quarters show that the actual growth rate at the end of the reporting cycle roughly approximates what was originally expected at the start of the quarter  You can see this trend play out clearly in the chart below 

What this means is that at the growth rate at the start of the  calendar  quarter is a good representation of what is actually achieved in that period  For example  earnings were expected to be up  6 3  in Q3 at the start of the quarter in July  But those growth estimates came down over time and fell to  3  by the time the Q3 reporting season got underway  The actual growth in Q3  however  turned out to be  6 3   Will we see a repeat performance in Q4 as well  We will have to wait through the end of February to find out

7147,228662,ALBO,Radius Health  RDUS  Reports Wider than Expected Q1 Loss,opinion,"Radius Health  Inc    NASDAQ RDUS   posted a loss of 94 cents per share in the first quarter of 2016  wider than both the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 83 cents and the year ago loss of 47 cents  primarily due to an increase in research and development  and general and administrative expenses 

The company has yet to generate any revenues 
The Quarter in Detail
Research and development  R D  expenses were  27 5  million  up 137 8  year over year due to an increase in contract service costs related to the development of pipeline candidate RAD1901 to support a phase I study in metastatic breast cancer that commenced in late 2014 and a phase IIb study in postmenopausal vasomotor symptoms  Expenses also rose due to higher compensation expenses resulting from an increased headcount 
General and administrative expenses were up 183 3  to  13 6 million primarily due to higher professional support costs and legal fees that included costs related to the increased headcount  and preparations for a potential commercialization of abaloparatide SC 
Pipeline Update
Radius Health filed for an approval of its lead candidate  abaloparatide  postmenopausal osteoporosis   in the EU  which is currently under review  The company expects an opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use  CHMP  on its application later this year 
In Mar 2016  Radius Health submitted a new drug application  NDA  in the U S  for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis  It expects to hear from the FDA on the acceptance of an NDA for abaloparatide SC in the second quarter of 2016  The company is also looking for a collaboration partner for the potential commercialization of abaloparatide SC prior to its launch 
A potential approval would allow Radius Health to record its first commercial sales in 2016  The company also is developing abaloparatide transdermal   abaloparatide TD  for potential use as a short wear time transdermal patch  In Dec 2015  the company initiated a human replicative clinical evaluation to compare the optimized abaloparatide TD patch with its subcutaneous formulation  with an update expected by mid 2016 
Meanwhile  a phase I multicenter  open label  two part  dose escalation study on RAD1901 in postmenopausal women with advanced estrogen receptor positive and HER2 negative breast cancer  is currently ongoing  While the phase I study is designed to evaluate escalating doses of RAD1901 in Part A  the Part B expansion cohorts allow for an evaluation of additional safety  tolerability and preliminary efficacy 
Our Take
Radius Health s wider than expected loss in the first quarter and surging expenses were disappointing  We expect investor focus on further updates on the NDA submission of abaloparatide in the U S   which has already experienced a quarter s delay  The company is now gearing up for a potential launch in both the U S and the EU  On the other hand  expenses are expected to rise even higher as the company increases its investment and launch preparations 
Radius Health carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Some better ranked stocks in the health care sector are Shire plc   NASDAQ SHPG    Biodel  Inc    NASDAQ BIOD   and Nektar Therapeutics   NASDAQ NKTR    All these stocks have a Zacks Rank  2  Buy

7148,228663,ALBO,Intercept  ICPT  Q1 Loss Narrower Than Expected  Sales Lag,opinion,"Intercept Pharmaceuticals  Inc    NASDAQ ICPT   posted a loss of  3 33 per share in the first quarter of 2016  narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of  3 58 but wider than the year ago loss of  1 78 

The company generated licensing revenues of  445 000  down significantly from  1 4 million in the year ago quarter and even below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  490 000 
Quarter in Detail
Intercept is currently seeking FDA approval for its lead candidate  Ocaliva  obeticholic acid   for primary biliary cholangitis  PBC  
Research and development expenses shot up 87 4  year over year to  37 4 million primarily due to additional personnel for the development team to manage increased activities related to the Ocaliva development program and higher manufacturing activities 
General and administrative expenses jumped to  90 4 million from  13 1 million in the year ago quarter owing to an increase in pre commercial activities in both the U S  and internationally 
2016 Outlook
Intercept expects operating expenses in the range of  360  400 million  higher in the second half than the first half   much higher than the 2015 level  The increase will primarily support the clinical development program of Ocaliva in PBC  nonalcoholic steatohepatitis  NASH  and primary sclerosing cholangitis  PSC   phase II   higher OCA manufacturing activities  and continuation of the development of INT 767 and other preclinical programs 
Pipeline Update
In Dec 2015  the FDA extended the PDUFA date for priority review of Ocaliva in the treatment of PBC by three months to May 29  The FDA asked for additional clinical data analyses  which Intercept has already submitted 
Last month  the FDA s Gastrointestinal Drugs Advisory Committee voted unanimously  in the ratio of 17 to 0  in favor of the company s lead pipeline candidate  Ocaliva  The committee recommended accelerated approval of the candidate for PBC 
Although the FDA is not bound to abide by the Advisory Committee s recommendation  it generally takes the same into consideration while reviewing candidates  The candidate is also under review in the EU and a decision is expected in late 2016  first sales in 2017  
Apart from PBC  OCA is being evaluated for a variety of chronic liver diseases including NASH and PSC  OCA is currently in a phase III study  REGENERATE  in NASH patients with advanced liver fibrosis  Enrolment in the trial is expected to be complete by the first half of 2017  The candidate is also in a phase II trial  CONTROL  which will evaluate its effect  in combination with statin therapy  on lipid metabolism in patients with NASH  Enrolment in the trial is expected to be completed by 2016 end  Apart from these  the company initiated a phase I study on INT 767 in Nov 2015  which is expected to be complete this year 
Our Take
Intercept s narrower than expected loss in the first quarter of 2016 was encouraging  We expect investor focus on the important upcoming regulatory event  the PDUFA date for Ocaliva in PBC  in May 2016  A potential approval of Ocaliva for PBC will be a big boost for the company as it plans a launch in Jun 2016 and may record its first revenue later this year 
Intercept currently carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   Some better ranked stocks in the health care sector are Shire plc   NASDAQ SHPG    Biodel  Inc    NASDAQ BIOD   and Nektar Therapeutics   NASDAQ NKTR     All these stocks carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy
