105939,327454,IGT,Exclusive  Billionaire founder fights back for control of Japan s Universal,news,"By Emi Emoto and Nathan Layne TOKYO NEW YORK  Reuters    Nearly three months after his ouster from the board at  Universal Entertainment  Corp  T 6425   billionaire Kazuo Okada is fighting back to try to regain control of the  2 2 billion Japanese gaming group  At a news conference in Tokyo on Thursday  Okada is expected to say he has reinstalled himself as director of Okada Holdings Ltd  the Hong Kong parent of Universal  according to a person close to the 74 year old tycoon   That development  which the person said was made possible by a recent change of heart by Okada s daughter to support her father  marks a significant step in his effort to wrest back control of Universal itself   Winning back the gaming empire he founded five decades ago is just the latest challenge Okada faces in a chequered career He is locked in a legal battle with former associate Steve Wynn  and has been subject to a slew of tax  gaming and law enforcement probes  including those related to a  2 4 billion casino in the Philippines   But his ouster from Universal in June was more personal   His son  daughter and wife voted him out of Okada Holdings in May  replacing him with two directors friendly to Universal s board  which then dismissed him based on allegations he misappropriated  20 million in company funds  Okada has denied wrongdoing   Universal did not respond to questions about the changes at Okada Holdings  It has also declined to make its president  Jun Fujimoto  available for interview   People familiar with the matter say Fujimoto largely engineered the boardroom coup that ousted Okada   How the battle for Universal shakes out could alter the course of a long running dispute between Universal and Wynn Resorts  O WYNN   say people familiar with the litigation strategy on both sides   Writing to a Universal shareholder in June  Fujimoto said Okada was  unfit  to represent a public company  echoing Wynn s reasoning for dismissing Okada as a director of Wynn Resorts in 2012   Okada says he is worried Fujimoto will settle with Wynn to access more than  2 billion held in escrow while the suit is ongoing  The money is owed to a Universal subsidiary  and not Okada  who wants a trial    This is what scares me most   Okada told Reuters in an interview on July 13   It s natural for them to think that getting the money is the smart thing to do   CHANGING SIDES  Okada says his son Tomohiro and daughter Hiromi turned against him partly because they were not being paid the full dividends on their stakes in Okada Holdings  a problem he blamed on subordinates   Contacted by phone  Tomohiro declined to comment  Hiromi could not be reached for comment   Okada managed to get Hiromi back on his side over a series of meetings this summer  the person close to Okada said  but his relationship with Tomohiro remains strained  Okada owns 46 4 percent of Okada Holdings   With support from his daughter s 9 8 percent holding  Okada last month submitted a filing to Hong Kong s corporate registry seeking to reinstate himself as director  Tomohiro  who owns 43 5 percent  is contesting the move  and the registry has not made any documents public  citing  issues with the company    Even if Okada takes back control of Okada Holdings  re establishing himself at Universal is not a given  some legal experts say  noting the Universal board could fight him in court  citing the misappropriation allegations   Okada wrote to the Universal board last month demanding a special shareholders  meeting to install a new board  including himself  Okada Holdings  which owns two thirds of Universal  has the right to call such a meeting under Japanese corporate law  HIGH STAKES For Okada  the stakes go beyond his position at Universal  He also owns Aruze Gaming America  a slot machine maker that competes globally with International Game Technology Plc  N IGT  and others   Okada s ability to defend himself against Universal s allegations could impact Aruze Gaming America s licenses to operate in the United States   Gaming regulators in Nevada  Mississippi and Louisiana told Reuters that they were investigating Universal s allegations against Okada    I m concerned   said Allen Godfrey  executive director of the Mississippi Gaming Commission  referring to Universal s allegations that Okada committed fraud against the company    But there are always two sides to every story  The dust hasn t settled on this yet    
Okada and Universal sued Reuters for defamation in Tokyo in2012 for its reporting on a  40 million payment made by a Universal affiliate in 2010 to a Philippine consultant  Three courts found the case had no merit  including Japan s Supreme Court  which rejected a final appeal in July ",2017-09-13,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusive-billionaire-founder-fights-back-for-control-of-japans-universal-528661,528661

105942,327457,IGT,Zacks com Featured Highlights Include  DaVita  Kraton  ADT  Universal Forest Products And International Game,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   August 8  2019   Stocks in this week s article are DaVita Inc    NYSE DVA    Kraton Corporation   NYSE KRA    ADT Inc    NYSE ADT    Universal Forest Products  Inc    NASDAQ UFPI   and International Game Technology PLC   NYSE IGT   5 Value Picks Boasting Strikingly Low EV EBITDA RatiosThe price to earnings  P E  ratio  given its apparent simplicity  is preferred by many investors while uncovering stocks that are trading at attractive prices  A widely favored approach by value investors is to chase stocks that have a low P E ratio  However  even this widely popular valuation metric is not without its pitfalls Is EV EBITDA a Better Alternative to P E While P E enjoys huge popularity in the value investing world  a more complicated valuation metric called EV EBITDA works even better  The ratio offers a clearer picture of a firm s valuation and earnings potential  EV EBITDA  also referred to as enterprise multiple  determines the total value of a firm  while P E just considers its equity  is essentially the enterprise value  EV  of a stock divided by its earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA   EV is the sum of a company s market capitalization  its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents  Simply put  it is the total value of a company EBITDA  the other constituent  is a true reflection of a company s profitability as it strips out non cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that reduce net earnings  It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows Just like P E  the lower the EV EBITDA ratio  the more appealing it is  A low EV EBITDA ratio could be a sign that a stock is potentially undervalued However  unlike P E ratio  EV EBITDA takes into account the debt on a company s balance sheet  For this reason  EV EBITDA is usually used to value possible acquisition targets  Stocks with a low EV EBITDA multiple could be seen as potential takeover candidates Another limitation of P E is that it can t be used to value a loss making entity  A firm s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  On the other hand  EV EBITDA is difficult to manipulate and also can be used to value entities that have negative net earnings but are positive on the EBITDA  is also a useful yardstick in measuring the value of firms that are highly leveraged and have a high degree of depreciation  Moreover  it can be used to compare companies with different levels of debt Then again  EV EBITDA has its flaws too  It varies across industries  a high growth industry normally has higher multiple and vice versa  and is typically not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries given their diverse capital expenditure requirements Thus  instead of just relying on EV EBITDA  you can club it with the other major ratios such as price to book  P B   P E and price to sales  P S  to achieve the desired results For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at

105943,327458,IGT,MGM Resorts  MGM  Sells Properties In A Move To Free Capital ,opinion,"MGM Resorts   NYSE MGM   announced on Tuesday that they would be selling their Circus Circus Las Vegas property for  825 million to an affiliate of Treasure Island owner  Phil Ruffin  The gaming giant also announced that they would be putting their landmark Las Vegas property  the Bellagio  into a joint venture controlled by Blackstone Group   NYSE BX    MGM will receive a 5  stake in the venture   4 2 billion in cash  and will continue to operate the hotel and casino  which it will rent from the venture for  245 million a year  The transaction valued the Bellagio hotel at  4 25 billion 
Paul Salem  chairman of MGM s real estate committee  stated   We want to make sure   if and when the next recession comes   we have a fortress balance sheet   The company has been evaluating potential property deals to raise cash and pay down debt since its board of directors formed a real estate committee in January  The sale will free up cash  offering MGM flexibility to operate in new and different ways  said MGM Resorts Chairman and CEO Jim Murren  Murren said he would be open to using the newly acquired capital to expand their sports gambling initiatives 
Sports Gambling 
MGM s CEO made it clear that he is keeping his sights set on the future of the industry and sees sports gambling as a potentially lucrative market  Ever since the Supreme Court overturned a ruling that banned sports betting in every US state except Nevada  casino and gaming companies like Caesars Entertainment   NASDAQ CZR    Scientific Games   NASDAQ SGMS    and International Game Technology   NYSE IGT   have all been scrambling to position themselves in the emerging market 
Scientific Games has made deals with Wynn Resorts   NASDAQ WYNN   and Caesars in the US  and recently won a joint venture bid in Turkey  International Game Technology has struck deals with FanDuel and DraftKings  along with a smaller agreement with Boyd Gaming   NYSE BYD    However  IGT s biggest deal yet was its agreement to provide a sports betting platform for MGM Resorts in Las Vegas and New Jersey 
MGM believes that involving itself with actual sports leagues is the best way to incorporate itself in sports gambling  In April 2018  MGM made a deal with the NBA that will allow MGM to use the league s data and images in its wagering  In addition to forming partnerships with the major sports leagues  MGM has even made an agreement with popular sports bar Buffalo Wild Wings  which will bring sports betting into the restaurants  MGM is using its sports betting venture  Roar Digital  which is half owned by GVC Holdings  to bring BetMGM to venues across the U S 
Bottom Line 
MGM Resorts  latest move to sell its two properties shows that they are willing to free up capital in order to make investments in areas they believe will be the future of the industry  The company is clearly gearing up for an arms race between the gaming and gambling industry s titans for control of the emerging sports gambling market 
MGM is looking to expand their sports gambling presence past their casinos through the latest deal they made with Buffalo Wild Wings  The Buffalo Wild Wings deal puts MGM in a position to snag market share in areas where there are no casinos  MGM sits at a Zacks Rank  3  Hold

During European morning trade  the DJ Euro Stoxx 50 gained 0 41   France s CAC 40 advanced 0 71   while Germany s DAX climbed 0 54  
Market sentiment found support after official data earlier showed that China gross domestic product expanded by 2  in the second quarter  compared to expectations for 1 8  growth  after a rate of 1 4  growth in the first quarter

105970,327485,IGT,5 Value Picks Boasting Strikingly Low EV EBITDA Ratios,opinion,The price to earnings  P E  ratio  given its apparent simplicity  is preferred by many investors while uncovering stocks that are trading at attractive prices  A widely favored approach by value investors is to chase stocks that have a low P E ratio  However  even this widely popular valuation metric is not without its pitfalls Is EV EBITDA a Better Alternative to P E While P E enjoys huge popularity in the value investing world  a more complicated valuation metric called EV EBITDA works even better  The ratio offers a clearer picture of a firm s valuation and earnings potential  EV EBITDA  also referred to as enterprise multiple  determines the total value of a firm  while P E just considers its equity  is essentially the enterprise value  EV  of a stock divided by its earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  EBITDA   EV is the sum of a company s market capitalization  its debt and preferred stock minus cash and cash equivalents  Simply put  it is the total value of a company EBITDA  the other constituent  is a true reflection of a company s profitability as it strips out non cash expenses like depreciation and amortization that reduce net earnings  It is also often used as a proxy for cash flows Just like P E  the lower the EV EBITDA ratio  the more appealing it is  A low EV EBITDA ratio could be a sign that a stock is potentially undervalued However  unlike P E ratio  EV EBITDA takes into account the debt on a company s balance sheet  For this reason  EV EBITDA is usually used to value possible acquisition targets  Stocks with a low EV EBITDA multiple could be seen as potential takeover candidates Another limitation of P E is that it can t be used to value a loss making entity  A firm s earnings are also subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation  On the other hand  EV EBITDA is difficult to manipulate and also can be used to value entities that have negative net earnings but are positive on the EBITDA  is also a useful yardstick in measuring the value of firms that are highly leveraged and have a high degree of depreciation  Moreover  it can be used to compare companies with different levels of debt Then again  EV EBITDA has its flaws too  It varies across industries  a high growth industry normally has higher multiple and vice versa  and is typically not appropriate while comparing stocks in different industries given their diverse capital expenditure requirements Thus  instead of just relying on EV EBITDA  you can club it with the other major ratios such as price to book  P B   P E and price to sales  P S  to achieve the desired results Screening CriteriaHere are the parameters to screen for value stocks EV EBITDA 12 Months Most Recent less than X Industry Median  A lower EV EBITDA ratio represents a cheaper valuation P E using  F1  less than X Industry Median  This metric screens stocks that are trading at a discount to their peers P B less than X Industry Median  A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that the stock is undervalued P S less than X Industry Median  The lower the P S ratio the more attractive the stock is as investors will have to pay a smaller price for the same amount of sales generated by the company Estimated One Year EPS Growth F 1  F 0  greater than or equal to X Industry Median  This parameter will help in screening stocks that have growth rates higher than the industry median  This is a meaningful indicator as decent earnings growth always adds to investor optimism Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 100 000  The addition of this metric ensures that shares can be traded easily Current Price greater than or equal to  5  This parameter will help in screening stocks that are trading at a minimum price of  5 or higher Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  No screening is complete without the Zacks Rank  which has proven its worth since inception  It is a fundamental truth that stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  have always managed to beat adversities and outperform the market  of less than or equal to B  Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential Here are five of the 13 stocks that passed the screen DaVita Inc

105989,327504,IGT,Zacks Investment Ideas Feature Highlights  Wynn Resorts  Las Vegas Sands  Caesar   s Entertainment  Penn National Gaming And International Game Technology,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   May 16  2018   Today  Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Features  Wynn Resorts   NASDAQ WYNN    Las Vegas Sands   NYSE LVS    Caesar s Entertainment Corp   NASDAQ CZR    Penn National Gaming  PENN  and International Game Technology   NYSE IGT   SCOTUS Decides to Let States Regulate Sports Betting  Who Wins  Who Loses The U S  Supreme court announced Monday that it has decided 6 3 to allow states to regulate their own sports gambling  overturning a 1992 law that outlawed sports gambling nationwide except in the state of Nevada where it has been legal for decades The ruling does not mean that sports gambling is immediately legal across the nation  but rather that states are free to devise their own regulatory structures  potentially allowing betting on sporting events in several states where the move has public support Nevada based casinos and collegiate and professional sports leagues have been staunch opponents of an expansion in sports gambling   Vegas Casinos have had a near monopoly on legal sports betting which they are reluctant to relinquish   The NCAA  NFL  NBA and MLB have expressed concern that widespread gambling on their events could incentivize nefarious activity on the part of players  coaches and officials  They also have a bit of an image problem   Though they are aware that illegal betting on sports increases their gate revenue and viewership by an unquantifiable amount  they  and their sponsors  would prefer to be seen as family entertainment rather than an enterprise that exists purely for gambling   like a horse racing track Ironically  individual owners of professional sports franchises cheered the news   Ted Leonsis  owner of the Washington Wizards and Washington Capitals and Mark Cuban  owner of the Dallas Mavericks both applauded the decision for its potential to take a bite out of the illegal gambling market  but also for its potential to increase the value of their holdings   In what was probably a bit of hyperbole  Cuban said on CNBC Monday   I think everyone who owns a top four professional sports team just saw the value of their team double  Several states   most notably New Jersey  who filed the original lawsuit in an attempt to prop up its falling Atlantic City revenues   look likely to quickly approve their own plans to allow sports gambling as quickly as possible So who will the winners and losers be when sports betting is allowed in much of the U S   It s worth noting here that obviously the biggest losers will be the proprietors of existing illegal sports betting operations  but since none of those are public companies  we will ignore them here   The same goes for individual states who will be able to tax sports gambling for the first time   It might be a big win for state budget coffers  but since you can t invest in them  we ll ignore them  too  Existing Casino OperatorsCasino stocks were mixed on the news  with a bright line drawn between the companies that operate primarily in Nevada and those that have properties spread around the rest of the U S Wynn Resorts and Las Vegas Sands both derive the majority of their revenues from the Asian markets

105998,327513,IGT,These 4 8  5 9  Yield Stocks Could Get Hacked Apart,opinion,"A stock s yield is only as good as its cash flow because  after all  a dividend is nothing more than a promise from a company 
CenturyLink  NYSE CTL  recently reminded us of this  Its promised  0 54 per share dividend exceeded its ability to pay  The firm s payout ratio of 130    the percentage of profits that it was paying as dividends   was an absurd overpromise that couldn t last forever 
CenturyLink s Payout Promise Was Always on Borrowed Time

CEO Jeffrey Storey insisted his team remained  committed to and confident in our ability to maintain the dividend   I understood the commitment  but questioned the confidence taking on debt to pay dividends is a losing game  But then again  what else is the guy going to say  
As recently as February 8  I warned investors that CenturyLink was a high yield trap  It was inevitable that its lack of cash would topple any commitment and confidence  Sure enough  just six days later  Jeff and the boys made me look good by slashing their payout by a cool 54  
The  all knowing  market sniffed out some of Jeff s BS beforehand  but not the full extent of it  CTL topped in late August and has spiraled downwards since  Shares are down 45  in just six months 
A 54  Dividend Cut   A 45  Price Cut  and Counting 

As we ve discussed time and again  dividends are  magnets  that drag their share prices along  This is great when dividends are growing  but disastrous when they are slashed 
With CTL s latest payout cut now in the rearview mirror  my publisher patted me on the back and tasked me with finding eight more dividends likely to drop  Luckily for me  we have access to Blockforce Capital s  DIVCON  system 
Macy s  NYSE M   M 
Dividend Yield  5 9 
DIVCON Score  2
While Macy s  NYSE M   M  DIVCON score of 2 suggests the retailer is  likely to decrease cut their dividends in the next 12 months   I think the timeline is a bit longer than that  At the moment  Macy s is paying out only 36  of its adjusted profits as earnings  and it generates enough free cash to pay its dividends more than twice over
That s the nicest thing I can say about this dinosaur 
Macy s operations are in terminal decline  Back in 2016  roughly 100 of the retailer s locations were performing so poorly that the company said it would just shut their doors as their leases expired rather than spend the money to turn things around 
Shares have plunged roughly two thirds from their 2015 peak as revenues have waned and profits have waffled  And it s not going to get better  A quick look at what the analysts see going forward 

Those numbers are troubling in so many ways 
Wall Street s typically optimistic leaning analysts think that Macy s is going to improve its sales by a rounding error for the next two years 
These same analysts think that Macy s is going to have an increasingly difficult time making a profit off those sales 
Based on these projections  Macy s payout ratio would jump from 36  to 51  without touching its dividend 
That dividend isn t growing  either  The writing was on the wall in early 2017 when Macy s failed to announce its usual increase  its quarterly dole has been stuck at 37 75 cents for three years now  If Macy s does adjust its dividend  DIVCON s analysts suggests it would be to cut or eliminate it 
International Game Technology  NYSE IGT 
Dividend Yield  5 8 
DIVCON Score  1
When you think of casino stocks  you think of the glitzy  glamorous resort companies  MGM Resorts International  NYSE MGM   MGM   Las Vegas Sands Corp  NYSE LVS   LVS  and Wynn Resorts Limited  NASDAQ WYNN   WYNN  
International Game Technology  IGT  is what you find when you pop open the hood 
IGT is a multinational gaming company that produces video slot games such as Wheel of Fortune Cash Link and Fuzzy s Fortune  But more importantly  they also have developed various systems for sports betting  lottery  even casino rewards  If you ve been in a casino  there s a decent chance that IGT has in some way shaped your experience 
Despite its breadth of products and global reach  IGT has hit a plateau  Revenues declined in 2018 for the second consecutive year  and the company has posted losses in three of the past four years  The company s 20 cent per share quarterly dividend has remained flat since 2015  and has been fully funded by profits just one year during that time  Negative free cash flow is a regular occurrence 
The only reason the yield keeps going up is because the stock keeps sinking  IGT shares plunged 12  in a single day this March after the company posted adjusted earnings of 24 cents per share that were well short of expectations for 33 cents 
That was the company s sixth quarterly miss in two years 
DIVCON gives IGT its lowest score  and it s well deserved  Profits and cash are sparse  and management can t even manage analyst expectations  Don t keep sinking your dollars into this money hole 
Don t Be Lured In by IGT s Inflated Yield

Kraft Heinz  NASDAQ KHC 
Dividend Yield  4 8 
DIVCON Score  1
In February 2019  Kraft Heinz  KHC  the consumer staples Frankenstein backed by Warren Buffett s Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa   BRK B  and 3G Capital said it would pay a 40 cent quarterly dividend 
The problem  That was 36  less than it paid the prior quarter

105999,327514,IGT,5 Best Stocks To Buy For Sinful Gains This May ,opinion,The idea of investing in  vice stocks   which are involved in activities considered immoral  is often off putting  But  products or services in this space are relatively inelastic  and business is recession proof  The very nature of their business ensures a stable stream of consumers  irrespective of market conditions  which eventually leads to higher margins and solid profits And we cannot ignore the current stock market turbulence and specter of slower economic growth  which are already unnerving investors  U S  China trade tensions are currently triggering global growth fears and compelling investors to stay away from riskier assets like equities The International Monetary Fund is also raising red flags  The international agency projected a slowdown in global growth for this year  thanks to macroeconomic stress in Argentina and Turkey and disruptions in Germany s auto sector  to name a few  By the way  from Fed to ECB to Bank of Japan and Bank of England  all have shifted to an accommodative stance due to global growth concerns  which makes investing in sin stocks more desirable But before we zero in on stocks from this tempting space  let s take a look at what s in store for these companies Marijuana Fever Here to StayThe cannabis industry is likely to create a lot of noise this year  After all  Canada has become the first major economy to legalize recreational pot  with quite a number of U S  states giving green signal to cannabis in some capacity last year The U S  Food and Drug Administration did approve its very first cannabis derived drug  and thus marijuana became a legitimate business model last year  This year  in fact  the global consumer marijuana outlays are estimated to climb 38  to  16 9 billion  up from a projected  12 2 billion last year   9 5 billion in 2017  and  6 9 billion in 2016  per Arcview Market Research and BDS Analytics  Additionally  compounded global annual sales growth of cannabis from 2017 to 2022 is projected at  31 3 billion Investment bank Cowen   Co further added that the legal weed market is expected to reach a worth of as much as  75 billion by 2030  This indicates that there are plenty of opportunities for investors to make money from both direct and subsidiary players  who won t touch the plant but will surely benefit from this fast growing industry Booze Consumption Picks UpLast year  no doubt  was a horrible year for alcohol stocks  Both sales and profit margins were under severe pressure  pushing share prices down  Booze consumption  however  is increasing at a slow but steady pace this year  according to data researcher Nielsen  And the rise in consumption is certainly a positive for alcohol stocks Innovation and more shake ups in recent times like Anheuser Busch InBev SA NV s   NYSE BUD   takeover of SABMiller  LON SAB  will further help alcohol stocks spiral up this year Things Looking Up for Gaming CompaniesRobust initiatives helped multi jurisdictional gaming companies progress by leaps and bounds  But  let s admit that things are looking up for such companies mostly due to consumer confidence Americans are now feeling more optimistic about their present and future conditions  According to the Conference Board  the consumer confidence index climbed to 129 2 in April from 124 2 in March  The key economic indicator that measures attitudes on economic prospects exceeded analysts  expectations of a 126 9 reading and has rebounded in April after a drop in March The future expectations index also moved up to 103 from 98 3  And people s confidence in present situations improved from 163 in March to 168 3 in April  Both indexes are now close to their highest levels in a decade 5 Sinfully Good Stocks to BuyAs mentioned above  sinful stocks are poised to do much better this year  Such stocks not only celebrate good times but are also useful during recessionary periods

The idea of investing in  vice stocks   which are involved in activities considered immoral  is often off putting  But  products or services in this space are relatively inelastic  and business is recession proof  The very nature of their business ensures a stable stream of consumers  irrespective of market conditions  which eventually leads to higher margins and solid profits 
And we cannot ignore the current stock market turbulence and specter of slower economic growth  which are already unnerving investors  U S  China trade tensions are currently triggering global growth fears and compelling investors to stay away from riskier assets like equities 
The International Monetary Fund is also raising red flags  The international agency projected a slowdown in global growth for this year  thanks to macroeconomic stress in Argentina and Turkey and disruptions in Germany s auto sector  to name a few  By the way  from Fed to ECB to Bank of Japan and Bank of England  all have shifted to an accommodative stance due to global growth concerns  which makes investing in sin stocks more desirable 
But before we zero in on stocks from this tempting space  let s take a look at what s in store for these companies 
Marijuana Fever Here to Stay
The cannabis industry is likely to create a lot of noise this year  After all  Canada has become the first major economy to legalize recreational pot  with quite a number of U S  states giving green signal to cannabis in some capacity last year 
The U S  Food and Drug Administration did approve its very first cannabis derived drug  and thus marijuana became a legitimate business model last year  This year  in fact  the global consumer marijuana outlays are estimated to climb 38  to  16 9 billion  up from a projected  12 2 billion last year   9 5 billion in 2017  and  6 9 billion in 2016  per Arcview Market Research and BDS Analytics  Additionally  compounded global annual sales growth of cannabis from 2017 to 2022 is projected at  31 3 billion 
Investment bank Cowen   Co further added that the legal weed market is expected to reach a worth of as much as  75 billion by 2030  This indicates that there are plenty of opportunities for investors to make money from both direct and subsidiary players  who won t touch the plant but will surely benefit from this fast growing industry 
Booze Consumption Picks Up
Last year  no doubt  was a horrible year for alcohol stocks  Both sales and profit margins were under severe pressure  pushing share prices down  Booze consumption  however  is increasing at a slow but steady pace this year  according to data researcher Nielsen  And the rise in consumption is certainly a positive for alcohol stocks 
Innovation and more shake ups in recent times like Anheuser Busch InBev SA NV s  BUD  takeover of SABMiller  LON SAB  will further help alcohol stocks spiral up this year 
Things Looking Up for Gaming Companies
Robust initiatives helped multi jurisdictional gaming companies progress by leaps and bounds  But  let s admit that things are looking up for such companies mostly due to consumer confidence 
Americans are now feeling more optimistic about their present and future conditions  According to the Conference Board  the consumer confidence index climbed to 129 2 in April from 124 2 in March  The key economic indicator that measures attitudes on economic prospects exceeded analysts  expectations of a 126 9 reading and has rebounded in April after a drop in March 
The future expectations index also moved up to 103 from 98 3  And people s confidence in present situations improved from 163 in March to 168 3 in April  Both indexes are now close to their highest levels in a decade

106046,327561,IGT,IGT  Massive Upside Earnings Bets Roll In Ahead Of Announcement,opinion,International Game Technology  IGT  is a global gaming company specializing in the design  development  manufacture  and marketing of electronic gaming equipment and systems products  including online and mobile solutions The company has earnings due out today AMC but it caught my attention because of the high option volume  relative to average  scan   it s the top result in the entire market   as well as the vol explosion Let s turn to the Stats Tab and day s biggest trades sections  below  We can see that IGT has traded nearly 18 000 contracts on a total daily average of just 1 345  Calls have traded on a 4 5 1 ratio to puts The action is in the front month 13 calls   and that s really what caught my eye  We can see from the day s biggest trades  above  that essentially every large trade today has been in those calls  The flow looks long to me based on circumstantial evidence of vol rising and the prices relative to the NBBO Let s turn to the Options Tab I ve highlighted the Nov 13 calls   check out that volume which is nearly 11 000 in the first four hours of trading in a stock that had a total existing OI of just 57 000 before today  We can also see the existing OI in that line is substantially smaller than the trade size   these are opening positions While the option volume is more than 1300  its daily average in the first four hours of the day  the stock volume is still below the daily average  If we extrapolate the stock volume from this point to the end of the day  it will be a heavy stock trading day  but maybe in 120  130  higher than average level   nothing close to the 2000  range the option volume will likely see Let s turn to the IGT Charts Tab below  one year   The top portion is the stock price the bottom is the vol  IV30    red  On the stock side we can see some pretty poor performance over the last six months  But even more eye popping is the stock move off of the last earnings result in mid July  circled in yellow   The stock dropped from  14 69 to  11 76 or a 20  drop in a day On the vol side we can see that the IV30  hit 52 53  right before that earnings announcement and at the time  that was highest level IV30  had reached in this time period we re examining  note that I have circled that vol level  Today  however  the vol is absolutely exploding  with IV30  up 35   The 52 wk range in IV30  is  28 36   52 56    so the level today is well into new annual high territory  In fact  the level today is a multi year high I ll skip the Skew Tab as the image isn t needed   Nov is extremely elevated to Dec  In fact  we can look at the top of the Options Tab  above  and see that Nov vol is priced to 85 33  up nearly 30 vol points today  while Dec is priced to 48 77   up 7 5 vol points  One thing I do note  and it s a big one  the skew in the Nov 13 calls does not show a kink    so there is no price discovery going on  That might mean two sided trading    just a  might  Ultimately this is a fascinating stock today  Earnings are due out AMC and vol has exploded to a multi year high while the OTM front month calls are trading size and the last earnings report saw a large gap in the stock price the next day  This is definitely one to watch Disclosure  This is trade analysis  not a recommendation ,2012-11-09,Ophir Gottlieb,https://www.investing.com/analysis/igt:-massive-upside-earnings-bets-roll-in-ahead-of-announcement-142945,142945
