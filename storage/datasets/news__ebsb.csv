22304,243819,EBSB,5 Safe Picks Amid Partial Inversion Of Treasury Yield Curve ,opinion,There seems no respite to the year old  trade conflict between the United States and China  This has resulted in severe volatility  which has clearly taken Wall Street in its grip  On May 29  all three major stock indexes    the Dow  the S P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite    tumbled 0 9   0 7  and 0 8   respectively Equities are suffering as investors are flocking to safe haven sovereign bonds  This shift in investment pattern has two consequences  First    major stock indexes are on the verge of closing in the negative territory in May  for the first time since 2012  when the European debt crisis had occurred  Second  yield on U S  Treasury bonds are gradually falling Partial Inversion of Treasury Yield CurveYields on several U S  government bonds are witnessing a free fall since May 23  On that day  yield on the benchmark 10 year U S  Treasury Note  long term 30 year U S  Treasury Note and short term 2 year U S  Treasury Note tumbled owing to stock market uncertainty and concerns about a prolonged trade war On May 28  yield on 10 year U S  Treasury Note continued to fall  touching 2 264   its 19 month low  Moreover  yields on long term 30 year U S  Treasury Note and short term 2 year U S  Treasury Note declined to 2 075  and 2 127   respectively  However  yield on 3 month U S  Treasury Note stayed at 2 356   signifying partial inversion between 10 year and 3 month yield curves Further on May 29  yield on 10 year U S  Treasury Note plunged to 2 21   its lowest since September 2017  before settling at 2 26   However  yield on 3 month U S  Treasury Note stayed at 2 362   resulting in a negative spread of a significant 10 basis points The yield curve  which measures interest at any given point of time for bonds of same quality but different maturity dates  of government bonds are generally upward sloping  implying that a higher rate of interest is needed for individuals to hold longer maturity bonds  However  an inverted yield curve is generally characterized as market s diminishing expectations about future economic growth In fact  several economists consider inversion between the 3 month and 10 year bond yields as a clear indication of an upcoming recession  However  a more powerful indicator is the yield inversion between 2 year and 10 year U S  Treasury Notes  Currently  the spread between these two government bonds is just about 15 basis points Yield on Government Bonds Fall GloballyLingering trade conflict between the United States and China has already dented investors  confidence internationally  Notably  European Union is the second largest trading partner for both United States and China Consequently  yield on 10 year Treasury bond Germany  Switzerland and Japan are currently in negative territory  Moreover  yields on 10 year Treasury bonds declined to less than 1  in France  Spain and the U K 5 Top Safe PicksIt will be
