 ABBV popped 1 71  or 2   to 87 76  with a high of 87 88  on 7 75 million shares on Monday  This stock is a swing that we ve been putting out for about a month now that has gone from the high 60 s  low 70 s to 90  It has reached all of my targets and then some  Now  I m targeting 95 and 99 
Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals  Inc   ARWR ARWR has been a monster for us  It has been in a swing which I gave to you at 4 5 00 around March 2018  and then we had another swing in Feb 2019 at 14 3 4  Subsequently  it had a run on Monday  jumping 7 79  or 15 83   to 56 99  reaching a 52 week high of 59 70  on 5 2 million shares  That s the biggest volume since May when it was flying  This may very well extend into the high 60 s  low 70 s

BBBY reversed on Monday with a nice spike back  jumping 1 04  or 8 3   to 13 57  with a high of 13 61  closing just pennies off the high  on 7 2 million shares  I think that was a 5 wave  corrective pullback to the trendline and 50 day  and right now  we re on our way back up again  I m targeting 14 90  16 and 18

Inogen  Inc   INGN INGN is moving and on Monday  it was up 3 07  or 4 2   to 76 15  with a high of 76 26  on 409 185 shares traded  It popped out of a coil that I ve been showing you for a week  There s a gap up here  so watch the level at about 77 1 2  It s almost there  The next target is 82  and then we ll looking at the mid 90 s

Nutanix  Inc   NTNX  
NTNX is an example of what can happen after hours  On Monday  it closed down 55 cents  or 1 88   to 28 75  with a high of 29 80  on 5 2 million shares  but in after hours  it jumped 6 20  or 21 57   This swing stock had great earnings  and then exploded  after dipping down to 27 it went vertical to 34 1 2  and right now  it s coiling and consolidating  You may very well see 36 7 in the next session

 Clovis Oncology   NASDAQ CLVS  has been a favorite of ours for quite some time  After the run up that started in Nov  I told everyone that this stock was extended and needed to get a retrace  Well  it got one  and a big one  going from 17 to 8 3 4  Then  on Tuesday  the Fibonacci retracement took it up 1 39  or 13   to 12 10  reaching a high of 12 60  on 18 million shares traded  This is going to be a real test of this stock  Either we hold at 12 60 and pull back and consolidate for a while  or it explodes through the 13 range to retest 17  and then onward and upward

130342,351857,ARWR,Arrowhead Pharma Heads Down Midday After Downgrade,news,"Investing com   Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals took a tumble midday Friday following a research downgrade that argued the stock is now fairly valued 
Arrowhead  NASDAQ ARWR  shares sank about 6  
Cantor Fitzgerald cut the stock to neutral from overweight  leaving its price target at  24 
It s time for shares to take a breather after a two rally that s seen the stock rocket about 1 700  higher  Cantor Fitzgerald argued

130343,351858,ARWR,Here s Why Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals Stock Soared 410  in 2019,news,"What happened
Shares of Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ ARWR  rose 410  last year  according to data provided by S P Global Market Intelligence  That easily topped the 28 8  gain of the S P 500 in 2019  The pharma stock had climbed 150  by the end of August  although the bulk of the annual gains came during the fourth quarter  
Perhaps the biggest single event of the year occurred at the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases  AASLD  annual meeting in November  Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals and Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  subsidiary Janssen presented promising data from two ongoing phase 1 studies in chronic hepatitis B  CHB  that touched off an epic end of year rally 

So what
The pharmaceutical industry is racing to develop a functional cure for CHB  which is the leading cause of liver cancer worldwide and kills more people than malaria each year  Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals and Janssen might just be the best bet right now  
The duo presented data for two combination therapies at AASLD  The most impressive results came from a triple combination of a nucleos t ide analog  NA   a gene silencing drug candidate developed by Arrowhead that s now called JNJ 3989  and a third drug candidate designed to disrupt the formation of new hepatitis B viral particles called JNJ 6379  
All 12 individuals who received the triple combination for 16 weeks achieved reductions of at least 90  in two important biomarkers of CHB  Steeper reductions are likely needed to qualify the treatment as a functional cure  but the early results are very promising because levels of the biomarkers were still declining at the 16 week mark  Janssen is now enrolling up to 450 individuals in a phase 2b study that will follow patients for up to two years 
Now what
Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals has a relatively deep pipeline with much promise  The lead drug candidate  ARO AAT  is being studied in a phase 2 3 trial as a treatment for alpha 1 antitrypsin  AAT or A1AT  deficiency  The study could generate data to support a new drug application  but the market for the rare disease is likely to become a little crowded with various genetic medicines in development across the industry  That means most of the company s frothy valuation is wrapped up into the CHB indication  While it could deliver for shareholders  the early stage nature of the results suggests the company s market valuation may fall a bit in the near term ",2020-01-09,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pfzze,2056152

130347,351862,ARWR,Here s Why Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals Lost as Much as 14 2  Today,news,"What happened
Shares of Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals  NASDAQ ARWR  fell over 14  today after the investment bank SVB Leerink initiated coverage of the stock with an underperform rating  Arguing that the company is overvalued relative to recent developments and near term catalysts  analyst Mani Foroohar gave the stock a price target of just  32  a market valuation of about  3 2 billion   For comparison  shares ended Friday s trading session at over  56 apiece  a market valuation of about  5 6 billion   
Of course  comments made by Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals CEO Christopher Anzalone at the J P  Morgan Healthcare Conference haven t helped the debate over the company s market valuation  According to Biopharma Dive  Anzalone said of a potential acquisition   It would shock me if anybody could write a big enough check to make sense to our shareholders   Investors interpreted that as an indication the company was off the table for an acquisition  which cooled speculation of a buyout that had been fueled by a solid year of progress in 2019  
As of 11 38 a m  EST  the pharma stock was down 12 1  

So what
It s really not too surprising that investors and analysts are reconsidering the market valuation of Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals  While encouraging early stage results from an experimental treatment for chronic hepatitis B  CHB  sent shares soaring last November  a market valuation of nearly  7 billion was a little too good to be true 
For instance  consider that the CHB results were from 12 individuals after 16 weeks of follow up  The next study will enroll up to 450 individuals and follow them for two years  It s also worth noting that Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals lacks a reliable source of recurring revenue  which will force the business to burn through its cash balance at an accelerated clip as programs mature  Then again  the business exited September with  221 million in cash and raised an additional  267 million in gross proceeds in early December through a public stock offering 
Now what
Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals possesses an abundance of long term potential on paper  but it will take time to demonstrate that potential in the real world  Investors can debate whether the business is fairly valued at  3 billion  the price target of SVB Leerink   but those with a long term mindset shouldn t be concerned with the week to week stock movements  The results of ongoing clinical trials are what really matters ",2020-01-21,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pkxp5,2064091

PolarityTE Inc  NASDAQ COOL  had a nice snapback day on Monday  jumping 2 54  or 11   to 26 08  on 911 300 shares traded off of key support  What I like about Monday is that although the volume wasn t great  it was still up 911 300  which was extremely strong volume for this stock for the last 3 4 weeks  The 29 30 zone is key resistance  Monday s action took it back above resistance  above the 50  and I think it s going to follow through  and at least test 28 28 40  and maybe 30  32 3

Arrowhead Research Corporation  NASDAQ ARWR  is in a bottoming pattern  with a nice pullback retest  It worked its way up to resistance at the 16 90 level  pulled back to test it  consolidated for a week  and on Wednesday  it was up 77 cents  or 4 77   on 2 9 million shares  Although that wasn t big volume  it made it through the 17 45 area  and looks like it could take a run to 18 1 4 1 2  and then the low 20 s

130466,351981,ARWR,SPY Filled The Gap  A Good Thing,opinion,"These are my thoughts on the SPY ETF in my Daily Trade Ideas which include many more charts and setups 
 Change your thoughts and you change your world    Norman Vincent Peale
Some weakness today for markets but the good news is they just filled recent gaps so they should begin to reverse higher now 
Things can t go up everyday and yesterday was constructive action that set us up for a nice move higher which should be more sustainable instead of just a quick pop like we ve seen 
I still think we have another 2 or more years to run in this bull market but who knows with the fed going to begin raising rates perhaps later this year  I did a decent amount of buying today and would like to buy more of stocks with the right setups who are breaking out 
Unfortunately we did take a hit yesterday with Arrowhead Research Corporation  NASDAQ ARWR  which was working so well for us from our  8 buy point last week but with these healthcare and biotech stocks news can come from nowhere and either help or hinder  and in this case it hindered 
I took my loss and am moving on since that s all we can do  No point dwelling on it and really  there is no lesson to learn since it was acting so well last week  I wish there was a lesson to learn but this was an act of god I guess  It happens 
I am going to do another round of real time trading which will go from February 1st until May 31st since that is generally the end of the great winter moves  We may be able to take things a bit easier in the summer if the rest of this winter plays out as I hope 

SPY filled the gap back to 202 50 and that isn t a bad thing Breakaway gaps are great but they generally happen near the end of moves so this tells us we have a while left in the bull market most likely Still  things look fine and leading stocks with nice bases are moving or are set to soon ",2015-01-13,Warren Bevan,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/spy-filled-the-gap,-a-good-thing-238238",238238

Exelixis  Inc   NASDAQ EXEL  was put out as a swing trade  I like the way it s looking  up 4 06 to 37 10  or 12 3  on 10 1 million shares on Wednesday  It appears to me that the left shoulder head right shoulder is a result of the stress that s going to take it to 8 00 9 00 eventually 
Intra Cellular Therapies  Inc   NASDAQ ITCI  made a monster move on Wednesday  up a whopping 22 68 to 48 79  or 86 86   on 13 7 million shares  This was a major breakout on positive drug news   potentially a game changer  Look for this stock to consolidate and edge a little For sure  Wednesday s low at 42 will be support  Target is in the mid 50s 
Vera Bradley  Inc   NASDAQ VRA   one of our swing trades  after the big pop pulled back in a nice  orderly wedge on low volume  popped 55 cents to 13 74  or 4   on 457 500 shares traded  The volume was not as big as I would like to have seen it  Technicals look good  It feels like it could retest 14   The target is 16
