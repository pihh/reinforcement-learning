148530,370046,DE,Deere Outlook Dissappoints as Trade War Keeps Farmers Frugal,news," Bloomberg     Deere   Co   NYSE DE  delivered a more cautious outlook than expected for the year ahead as simmering U S  China trade tensions and difficult growing conditions keep North American farmers from replacing large equipment  the company s top moneymaker  Shares fell 
Demand for machinery has taken a back seat as trade concerns have farmers worrying about who will buy their products  while financial services results have come under pressure due to operating lease losses  Construction equipment purchases are also set to decline 
Giving his first guidance for fiscal 2020  newly appointed Chief Executive Officer John May projected net income in a range of  2 7 billion to  3 1 billion  That compares with the  3 46 billion average analyst estimate 
Global sales of agriculture and turf equipment are forecast to fall 5  to 10  for fiscal 2020  driven by lower demand for large equipment in North America  Construction and forestry equipment sales are anticipated to slide 10  to 15   Last quarter  Deere announced cost cuts and said it would lower output compared with retail demand to manage growing inventories 
For its fiscal fourth quarter  the top tractor maker reported better than expected sales and earnings that were broadly in line with estimates  Adjusted earnings of  2 14 a share compares with  2 30 a year ago and an average analyst estimate of  2 13  Sales rose 4 3  to  8 7 billion 
Shares dropped as much as 4 9  before the start of regular trading Wednesday 
There are positives  A deal between the U S  and China could provide a stimulus for North American agriculture  Moreover  U S  government payments  so called bailout money paid to farmers to compensate for the harm from the trade war  should reach growers in Deere s first quarter  which could improve demand 
 Farm fundamentals should still be positive  with pent up replacement demand both in North American and South American large agriculture  and significant government payments helping support farm income   analysts at Jefferies LLC including Stephen Volkmann said in a Nov  25 report 
CEO May said the longer term outlook remains healthy  Executives will discuss the financial results on a conference call at 10 a m  New York time",2019-11-27,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/deere-outlook-dissappoints-as-trade-war-keeps-farmers-frugal-2029284,2029284
148531,370047,DE,Deere bets on cost cuts  services push to boost profits,news,"By Rajesh Kumar Singh
CHICAGO  Reuters     Deere   Co    N DE  on Wednesday said it will cut costs and ramp up investment in data driven agriculture technology and its services business to make itself more profitable 
In a pitch to investors  Chief Executive Officer John May said the measures are expected to boost operating profit margin to 15  by 2022 from 12 5  projected for this year 
The steps  outlined by the company s new leadership  are part of a broader trend in the U S  manufacturing sector which is facing its deepest slump in more than a decade 
In a bid to smooth earnings volatility  manufacturers such as  Caterpillar   N CAT  are slashing costs and focusing on more profitable parts and services businesses 
May  who took over Deere s reins in November  aims to shore up the company s fortunes which have taken a hit from Sino U S  trade tensions as well as poor weather in the American farm belt that has slowed equipment purchases by farmers 
The Moline  Illinois based company reported lower profits in the latest quarter and has warned of lower earnings this year 
U S  President Donald Trump announced last month that China had agreed to double its pre trade war purchases of U S  agricultural products over the next two years as part of a Phase 1 trade deal  Still  Deere expects industry sales of farm equipment in the United States and Canada  its biggest market  to decline about 5  this year 
In response to weak demand  the company has cut production and laid off workers 
May said Deere is reviewing its overseas manufacturing footprint in markets that have peaked or where it has over invested  He did not provide the names of those facilities 
The company is also carrying out a voluntary separation program for its salaried employees  now projected to result in savings of  120 million  lower than  150 million estimated earlier 
May expects the cuts to add 1 percentage point to Deere s profits by 2022 
The company is aiming to get a similar profit boost from investments in data driven farming  known as precision agriculture  which enables farmers to plant according to the fertility of the soil  helping reduce input costs and enhance yields 
Similarly  it is betting on its parts and maintenance services business to contribute 50 basis points in added profits over the next two years  The segment currently accounts for a fifth of the company s sales ",2020-01-08,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/deere-bets-on-cost-cuts-services-push-to-boost-profits-2055363,2055363

the U S  economy  especially the manufacturing sector  the economy kept expanding last year  In fact  major benchmarks were also able to attain fresh all time highs especially in the second half of

fact  the United States  blacklisting of Huawei Technologies and other Chinese companies  citing security concerns  aggravated the scenario  with China halting purchase of agricultural goods from

148535,370051,DE,Bear Of The Day  Deere And Company  DE ,opinion,"Sometimes the Zacks Bear of the Day is a company with truly dismal prospects   possibly even a stock that s so bad that not only should investors avoid owning it  but aggressive traders might want to consider initiating a short position 
Deere and Company  is not one of those stocks  It s an iconic American heavy equipment manufacturer with truly global reach and solid plans for both cutting costs and expanding product offerings  Unfortunately  it s also been on the wrong side of several global economic trends that threaten to weigh on results in the immediate future 
Recent reductions in company revenue guidance and subsequent negative earnings estimate revisions have landed Deere at the bottom of our rankings   a Zacks rank  5  Strong Sell  
The trade disputes between the US and China   and to a lesser extent  Europe   have really put a squeeze on sales of agricultural equipment  US producers who had grown accustomed to exporting a huge amount of agricultural products abroad saw many of those international purchases drop off to near zero basically overnight 
Difficult weather conditions in the US in 2019 further added to the misery 
It s a basic economic reality that when farmers are experiencing favorable economic conditions  they frequently invest much of the surplus in equipment purchases  When times are tight  they generally curtail or delay big spending plans 
In an strange paradox for Deere  one of their strengths can actually hurt the company in times like these  Deere equipment is renowned for its high quality and durability  Though each new generation of machines adds technological advances that help farmers to work less  increase yields or both  the long useful life of the older equipment means farmers can keep servicing  maintaining and using their aging machinery during periods when they feel the need to tighten their belts 
In fact  it was reported recently that the used market for Deere tractors that are now 40 years old has been firming up lately because that generation of equipment   which lacks many of the modern comfort  convenience and data collection features of newer models   can also be repaired and maintained by even the smallest farmers 
Even though the latest  Phase 1  deal between the US and China will include a significant increase in Chinese purchase of US agricultural products over the next two years  it will take quite a while for those sales to make it to the bottom line for US farmers  meaning they ll probably be making do with old equipment for the foreseeable future 
Deere management certainly hasn t been ignoring the issue  In response to falling revenues  they ve been getting increasingly lean   by cutting staff and unprofitable product lines  and also making strategic investments in new products aimed more at the heavy construction industry rather than just agriculture 
They are also developing  precision agriculture  technologies that allow farmers to plant in ways that decrease costs while increasing yields  
As I mentioned earlier  the current situation is far from a disaster  Deere has been around since 1837 and with more than  32 billion of annual revenues   plus  4 4 billion in cash and over  50 billion in current assets on the balance sheet   they re certainly not going away anytime soon 
The next year or so could be rough however  so Deere shareholders might want to consider alternatives until the dust settles

148572,370088,DE,Size matters  Big U S  farms get even bigger amid China trade war,news,"By Mark Weinraub HAZELTON  N D   Reuters    As the 2018 harvest approached  North Dakota farmer Mike Appert had a problem   too many soybeans and nowhere to put them  Selling was a bad option  Prices were near decade lows as U S  President Donald Trump s trade war with China weighed heavily on the market  Temporary storage would only buy him a little bit of time  particularly in an area where cold weather can damage crops stored in plastic bags   So Appert  who farms 48 000 acres  19 425 hectares   cut a check for  800 000 to build eight new permanent steel bins  Thatallowed him to hold onto his bumper crop and wait for prices to recover   He sold half of the 456 000 bushels stored on his farm throughout the following summer  earning about  1 more per bushel and avoiding storage at nearby CHS elevators or an Archer Daniels Midland Co   N ADM  processor in the area  But most farmers do not have  800 000 to spend on steel bins  and many are going under  The number of U S  farms fell by 12 800 to 2 029 million in 2018  the smallest ever  as the trade war pushes more farmers into retirement or bankruptcy   Roger Hadley  who farms 1 000 acres in Indiana  was unable to plant any corn and soybeans this year after heavy rains added to farmers  woes  He spent most of the summer trying to plant a combination of grasses  a so called cover crop  so he could apply for government aid and try again next year    The guys that got rich are getting richer   Hadley said   It has frustrated a lot of guys   In farming  size does matter  The farms left standing after the trade were will likely be some of the biggest in the business  Appert s operations are more than 100 times bigger than the average American farm and the advantages provided by that magnitude are becoming even more critical as the trade war stretches into a second year  The declining number of U S  farmers could hurt the world s top grain merchants such as ADM and  Bunge   N BG   who will have fewer suppliers  Additionally  farmers will have less need to rent space in the merchants  grain silos as big farmers like Appert have plentiful storage on their own farms  ADM said it would continue changing to meet the needs of its customers  Bunge did not respond to an email seeking comment   By the end of 2018  the average U S  farm size rose to 443 acres  a 12 year high and up from 441 million in 2017  according to the latest U S  Department of Agriculture data   And the biggest farmers are growing their operations even more as retiring farmers choose to lease their land rather than selling it  When land becomes available for lease  only the biggest farmers can readily shoulder the costs needed to expand  The size of the loans smaller farmers would need to buy equipment  for example  are too big for applicants with little collateral  said Dave Kusler  president of the Bank of Hazelton in Hazelton  North Dakota    It is almost impossible with what the costs are   Kuslersaid   In this area you can t make a living on 1 000 acres    Critics say the Trump administration s policy of compensating growers for lost sales due to the trade war pays the bigger farm operations more  since payments are calculated by acres farmed    For a graphic on Trump s trade war farm bailout    The Environmental Working Group  a conservation organization  said in a recent study the top 1  of aid recipients received an average of more than  180 000 while the bottom 80  were paid less than  5 000

It highlights that the U S  Sino trade war is a two way street from which China itself is not immune  That is despite the euphoria surrounding Alibaba s  HK 9988  successful secondary listing yesterday in Hong Kong  and China s oversubscribed U S  dollar bond sale  China s industrial heartland has been hurting from the global slowdown as well  For example  the industrial profits data shows that in the oil processing and ferrous metals smelting sectors  industrial profits have fallen 51 0  and 44 0  respectively 
The Chinese probably have President Trump to thank today  with his trade comments overnight taking the edge of today s China data  President Trump said that the interim trade deal negotiations were in the  final throes  of an agreement  The collective sigh of relief that he hadn t said  death throes  is palpable today 
The positive trade sentiment has kept the global recovery fires burning overnight and this morning  with equities continuing their push higher except for Mainland China  Big box retailer  Best Buy   NYSE BBY   also released positive Q3 results  signalling the U S  consumer remains confident  The results are more critical than first appears  with the U S  consumer seemingly the last global spender still standing tall in the developed world  It is especially so as the Black Friday sales kick off this week  signalling a Le Mans like start to the critical holiday shopping season in North America 
Asia and Europe s data calendars dry up today with this evening s highlight sure to be U S  Personal Spending  Durable Goods and GDP figures from the U S  Consumer spending is expected to rise 0 30   with Durable Goods Orders falling by 0 80  a slight improvement on last months 1 20  fall  U S  GDP estimated is likely to ease from 2 0  to 1 9   still falling yet at the same time  still respectable in the developed world  Of the three  consumer spending is likely to have the most impact  especially if it falls by more than expected ahead of the all important holiday shopping season 
Activity in the financial markets will ease this evening  with Americans migrating home for the Thanksgiving holiday tomorrow  Friday will almost certainly remain quiet as well  as the country loots Black Friday specials from shops across the country  In all likelihood  this means that the trade talk rhetoric will die down  with basting turkey the order of the day  Nevertheless  talks appear to be moving in the right direction  albeit agonizingly slowly  which should leave the global recovery trade intact for the remainder of the week  Let s hope I don t end up with giblets and cranberry sauce on my face

Wall Street crawled still higher overnight  boosted by positive  great  forward thinking and wise China trade comments from President Trump  The S P 500 rose 0 22   the NASDAQ rose 0 18   and the Dow Jones rose 0 19  
Best Buy released pleasing quarterly earnings and a positive last quarter outlook to give equities a lift  If all is well with the U S  consumer  then perhaps it is not so much in the farming and industrial heartlands of the U S  That question may be partially answered this evening as Deere   Company  NYSE DE   of farming equipment fame  releases quarterly earnings 
Asia itself has taken President Trump s  final throes  comment to heart  with Asian indices mostly higher except for Mainland China  The Nikkei 225 is 0 40  higher and the Hang Seng  post Alibaba s successful secondary listing yesterday  is 0 20  higher  South Korean consumer confidence moved higher this morning  perhaps suggesting the worst may be behind them  the KOSPI climbing 0 20  on the news

CurrenciesMajor currencies continued to quietly range against the dollar  as is their lot of recent times  U S  Treasury yields continued to edge lower  contributing to the Dollar Index falling slightly by 0 08  to 98 24 
GBP USD retreated to 1 2860 from 1 2910 as a new opinion poll suggested the Conservative lead over Labour has shrunk  GBP USD remains locked though  in a 1 2800 1 3000 range  A YouGov poll released tonight  and favoured amongst punters as being one of the more accurate  may shed a brighter light on proceedings  We can expect GBP to bounce around on poll releases with half of the election campaign still to run 
Regional currencies are almost unchanged today as currency markets wind down ahead of the U S  Thanksgiving holiday 
Oil
Oil climbed overnight on positive trade rhetoric from the U S  President  It offset yet another rise in API Crude Inventories to 3 55 million barrels overnight  Brent crude spot rose 0 91  to 464 15 a barrel  just below nearby resistance at  64 25  WTI spot rose 0 73  to  58 05 a barrel 
Official U S  crude inventories are expected to fall by 419 000 barrels later today  The data gets released towards the end of the New York session  Another surprise climb could have an outsized negative impact of prices  with most participants at or on their way home for Thanksgiving by that time 
For Brent to challenge resistance at  65 50 a barrel and WTI to overcome resistance at  59 50 a barrel  the U S  Sino trade story probably needs to move from soundbites to hard facts With the U S  in holiday mode  prices in Asia are unchanged on both Brent and WTI today

148618,370134,DE,Farm equipment maker Deere s dealers reel from trade war  bad weather,news,"By Rajesh Kumar Singh
CHICAGO  Reuters    When China announced this week that it had stopped buying U S  agricultural products and might impose additional tariffs on farm shipments from America  Dave Schmidt braced for another blow to his business 
The Salem  Wisconsin based dealer of Deere   Co s  N DE  tractors  planters and combines is grappling with declining sales and higher levels of inventory as farmers have put off equipment purchases in the wake of rain delayed planting in the Midwest and the yearlong Sino U S  trade standoff 
Schmidt says sales at his dealership  in general  declined by as much as 15  in the first half of the year  led by a fall in the demand for large equipment  In a sign of things to come  early orders for planting equipment for next season s soybean and corn crops are down up to 25  
He is not alone  Half a dozen dealers of Deere s agriculture equipment across the Midwest shared similar accounts in interviews with Reuters  One of those dealers  in Geneseo  Illinois  said sales at his dealership were down 50  so far this year from the same period last year 
This is a worrying sign for Deere  which gets nearly 60  of its sales from the United States and Canada  The Moline  Illinois based company is expected to report lower sales at its agriculture   turf segment when it reports its third quarter earnings on Aug  16 
The segment  which accounts for the bulk of the company s sales  is expected to report quarterly sales of  6 24 billion  compared with  6 29 billion a year ago  according to Refinitiv IBES  average analyst estimate 
Overall  Deere is expected to report quarterly earnings of  2 88 per share  compared with  2 78 a share in the corresponding period last year  Revenue for the July quarter is forecast to come in at  9 40 billion  up from  9 29 billion last year 
In May  Deere slashed its full year profit and sales outlook  blaming the U S  trade war with China for weak demand for its farm machines 
The company s shares  however  have gained a little over 14  since its last earnings report on hopes that a rally in corn prices would encourage farmers to buy new equipment 
But dealers are not so sanguine 
 We are not expecting demand for planting equipment to come back up this year   Schmidt said   We might see more repair and upgrading of the existing equipment  
Deere has downgraded the estimates for U S  principal crop cash receipts this year  an important indicator for equipment demand  citing China s retaliatory tariffs on American imports  which have slashed exports earnings of American farmers 
China imported  9 1 billion of U S  farm produce in 2018  down from  19 5 billion in 2017  according to the American Farm Bureau  the largest farm industry group in the country 
U S  shipments to China of soybeans  the country s most valuable farm export  sank to a 16 year low last year as the Asian nation mostly shifted purchases to Brazil  leaving American farmers with surplus stocks  U S  soy prices are down 18  since March 2018  when President Donald Trump launched a tariff war on China and other countries 
Deere rival CNH Industrial  N CNHI  last week said the shift has driven up its order book for tractors and combines in South America  particularly in Brazil 
A record wet spring has devastated a wide swath of the U S  farm belt and inflicted more economic pain on soybean and corn producers  particularly those whose fields were too wet to ever plant  dampening hopes of an improvement in farm income and equipment sales 
HIGHER INVENTORY  PRODUCTION CUTS
To compensate farmers for the market loss due to the trade war  the Trump administration has committed as much as  28 billion in federal aid  The latest tranche of the aid will likely begin to be paid out later this month 
The bailout money  however  is not expected to lift equipment sales 
 We are yet to feel most of the effects of too much water and the lower prices   said Paul Gilsinger  a Deere dealer in Knox  Indiana   In the second half of the year  demand could slow down further  
To prevent a supply glut  U S  agricultural machine maker AGCO Corp  N AGCO  and CNH have slashed production to keep inventory in line with retail demand 
A similar concern prompted Deere to cut production by 20  at two of its large factories in North America 
Yet  Gilsinger expects to be saddled with this year s inventory next year  To move used machinery  he is offering waivers on interest on equipment financing 
Schmidt s dealership has been running a similar incentive program  Yet  the inventory turnover ratio for used tractors has doubled  he said 
Adding to the worry  dealers are also encountering an increase in payment delays 
 When you get into a slowdown  it takes a while for demand to build back up   Schmidt said   These things don t change on a dime  ",2019-08-09,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/farm-equipment-maker-deeres-dealers-reel-from-trade-war-bad-weather-1951471,1951471

Housing market numbers are on the calendar for Friday  with many eager to see whether weakness in homebuilder activity will continue even as lower mortgage rates are supposed to support demand  
The Commerce Department will report on housing starts and building permits for June at 8 30 AM ET  13 30 GMT  
Economists expect that housing starts to rise to an annual rate of 1 257 million last month  up from a reported 1 253 million starts in June 
Building permits an indication of future demand  are forecast to show an increase to a rate of 1 270 million  up from 1 22 million units in June  Homebuilder confidence has been high this year because of low rates  and stocks of home builders have been strong performers as well  The iShares US Home Construction  NYSE ITB  exchange traded fund is up 29  this year  
 
Consumer sentiment data is also expected to be closely watched for an insight into the strength of the US consumer   
The University of Michigan s consumer sentiment index  due at 10 00 am ET  is forecast to show a reading of 97 2  down from the last month s reading of 98 4 while consumer expectations data will also be in focus  
2  Rig Counts on Tap
The weekly instalment of drilling activity from Baker Hughes on Friday  will provide investors with clues on U S  oil production  which remains close to record highs

148623,370139,DE,Machinery Makers Face Continuing Trade War Threat,opinion,"The US China trade war is creating continuing headaches  and makers of machinery and industrial equipment may next feel the pain of the lingering policy beef   

John Deere  NYSE DE  warned on the company s last earnings call that the ongoing trade war between Presidents Donald J  Trump and Xi Jinping could cool sales   and their job postings in China  which never grew to more than a few dozen  have almost completely leveled off  possibly as a result of the spat 
A number of American companies chose to trim job postings in China over the last 18 months  as the trade war has tightened  but there is growing evidence that US companies are restoring hiring and operations there  




Last month the Wall Street Journal reported Deere may turn to US operations and sales amid an increasingly tough international market  but judging by the job postings  it has found scant reasons to start hiring more in America  either   job postings are down 58   according to the company s data 

Between its reliance on trade war sensitive materials for production  and its dependence on farmers who are disproportionately impacted by the continuing policy beef  Deere is between a rock and a hard place  Last month   Wells Fargo   NYSE WFC  analysts downgraded Deere and which will report earnings next month  and  Caterpillar   NYSE CAT   which announces results October 23  Analysts tracked by Zacks Investment Research are expecting EPS of  2 82  





Deere may be sweating the trade war  and  Caterpillar   NYSE CAT  could be doing the same   just a bit less so  Executives cautioned on competitive pricing in China  but the company s job postings haven t declined this year   just like the stock  Caterpillar  CAT  job postings have grown single digits so far this year

148624,370140,DE,Analysts Estimate Deere  DE  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"Deere  DE  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended October 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on November 27  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This agricultural equipment manufacturer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 13 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  7 4  
Revenues are expected to be  8 46 billion  up 1 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Deere 
For Deere  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 76  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Deere will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Deere would post earnings of  2 80 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 71  delivering a surprise of  3 21  
The company has not been able to beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Deere doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-11-19,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-deere-de-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200486779,200486779

148659,370175,DE,U S  disaster aid won t cover crops drowned by Midwest floods,news,"By Tom Polansek MALVERN  Iowa  Reuters    The Black Hawk military helicopter flew over Iowa  giving a senior U S  agriculture official and U S  senator an eyeful of the flood damage below  where yellow corn from ruptured metal silos spilled out into the muddy water  And there s nothing the U S  government can do about the millions of bushels of damaged crops here under current laws or disaster aid programs  U S  Agriculture Under Secretary Bill Northey told a Reuters reporter who joined the flight  The USDA has no mechanism to compensate farmers for damaged crops in storage  Northey said  a problem never before seen on this scale  That s in part because U S  farmers have never stored so much of their harvests  after years of oversupplied markets  low prices and the latest blow of lost sales from the U S  trade war with China   previously their biggest buyer of soybean exports  The USDA last year made  12 billion in aid available to farmers who suffered trade war losses  without needing Congressional approval  The agency has separate programs that partially cover losses from cattle killed in natural disasters  compensate farmers who cannot plant crops due to weather  and help them remove debris left in fields after floods  But it has no program to cover the catastrophic and largely uninsured stored crop losses from the widespread flooding  triggered by the  bomb cyclone  that hit the region in mid March  Congress would have to pass legislation to address the harvests lost in the storm  according to Northey and a USDA statement to Reuters   It s not traditionally been covered   he said   But we ve not usually had as many losses   Indigo Ag  an agriculture technology company  identified 832 on farm storage bins within flooded Midwest areas  They hold an estimated 5 million to 10 million bushels of corn and soybeans   worth between  17 3 million to  34 6 million   that could have been damaged in the floods  the company told Reuters  Across the United States  farmers held soybean stocks of 2 716 billion bushels as of March 1  the largest on record for the time period  the USDA said on Friday  Corn stocks were the third largest on record  Some Congress members have expressed interest in pursuing legislation to provide aid for damaged crops in storage  Northey said  But passing legislation could require a lengthy political process in the face of an urgent disaster  U S  Sen  Charles Grassley told farmers at a meeting in Malvern  Iowa   If we have to pass a bill to do it  I hate to tell you how long that takes   said the senator from Iowa  who joined Northey on the helicopter tour  With farm incomes declining for years before the flood  many farmers had planned to sell their grain in storage for money to live  pay their taxes or finance operations  including planting this spring  THROWING AWAY CROPS From the helicopter  piloted by National Guard members  officials surveyed miles of flooded fields in Iowa  littered with lawn chairs  fuel tanks  furniture  tires and other flood debris  Farmers will have to destroy any grains that were contaminated by floodwater  which could also prevent some growers from planting oversaturated fields  Near Crescent  Iowa  farmer Don Rief said the flood damaged more than 60 000 bushels of his grain  worth hundreds of thousands of dollars  He tried to move the crops before the flood  but dirt roads were too soft from the storm to support trucks    We were just hurrying like hell   Rief said   Hopefully USDA will come in and minimize some of the damage   The USDA does not have a program that covers flood damaged grain because farmers have typically received more advance notice of rising waters  allowing them to move crops and limit losses  said Tom Vilsack  who ran the agency under former President Barack Obama  In this case  floods inundated fields quickly after multiple levees failed when rain and melting snow filled the Missouri River and other waterways  The frozen ground was unable to soak up the water   Near Percival  Iowa  railroad tracks leading up to a grain facility were flooded and broken  A Deere   Co  N DE  dealership  Wendy s restaurant  Motel 6 and gas station nearby were also underwater  along with homes  cars and farm equipment  Some farmers moved machinery such as tractors on to highways to keep it out of the path of the floods  The equipment was still parked there during the flyover on Friday  DISASTER RELIEF  GAP  About 416 000 acres of cropland across six counties in Iowa were flooded  said Amanda De Jong  state executive director for the USDA Iowa Farm Service Agency  Of that  about 309 000 acres will be eligible for the federal program that helps farmers and ranchers remove debris left by natural disasters on farmlands  De Jong said last week  She estimated the program would need about  34 million to clean up the fields  Iowa s agriculture secretary Mike Naig said the U S  government also should help compensate farmers for some of the grain that was damaged    This is clearly a gap that we think needs to be addressed   said Naig  who accompanied Grassley and Northey in the chopper   Time is short for a solution  said Carol Vinton  supervisor of Mills County  Iowa  one of the state s two most heavily damaged counties   Vinton said she was getting calls from farmers whose grain was damaged and are worried about making good on previously signed contracts to deliver those crops to elevators  The USDA wants to do everything it can to help farmers hurt by the disaster  Northey said  
 They spent all last year raising that crop  putting it in the bin and they maybe already have it marketed   he said   And now they re going to have to spend time just to get rid of it   just to clean the place up  ",2019-04-02,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/us-disaster-aid-wont-cover-crops-drowned-by-midwest-floods-1824608,1824608

148662,370178,DE,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Deere  AGCO  CNH  Nutrien And Mosaic,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL  September 12  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Deere   Company   NYSE DE    AGCO Corp    NYSE AGCO    CNH Industrial N V    NYSE CNHI    Nutrien Ltd    NYSE NTR   and The Mosaic Company   NYSE MOS   Here are highlights from Wednesday s Analyst Blog Trade War Weighs on U S  Agriculture  Brazil  Argentina WinChina is one of the world s biggest importers of agricultural products  a significant portion of which comes from the United States each year  But  China has trimmed the import of farm products from the United States due to rising trade tensions This has affected the U S  agriculture sector as farmers keep building crop inventories and companies halt production due to lower demand  Meanwhile  China has now turned to South American countries like Brazil and Argentina instead of U S  producers for soy Trade War Hurts U S  AgriculturePer a report from American Farm Bureau  China imported  19 5 billion farm products from the United States in 2017  which reduced to  9 1 billion in 2018 due to the trade war  Since March 2018  the tariff war has resulted in an 18  drop in soy prices In fact  the shipment of U S  soybeans to China sank to a 16 year low in 2018  as China shifted purchase to Brazil and other South American producers Trade terms worsened in second quarter 2019 as China reduced purchase of agricultural products from the United States as Trump s administration blacklisted Huawei and other Chinese technology firms citing security violations and increased tariffs on products In spite of the tensions  trade talks resumed in July but failed as China insisted on the removal of additional tariff and lifting the ban on Huawei  Instead of going into any further negotiation Trump imposed additional tariffs and Beijing in retaliation levied higher duties and stopped agricultural purchases from the United States On Sep 1  Trump imposed an additional 15  tariff on  125 billion of Chinese goods citing that China is manipulating the fall in its currency  China retaliated by imposing extra tariffs of 5  and 10  on 1 717 products and filed a complaint with the World Trade Organization over U S  import duties for violating the consensus reached by both the countries in Osaka  Japan The trade tussle has not only put farmers in a disadvantageous position but has also eaten into the profit margins of U S  agricultural companies For instance  Deere   Company that produces agricultural machinery had to cut down production as American farmers are putting off equipment purchases due to declining sales and higher inventory levels  During the fiscal third quarter earnings report  Deere had reported a drop in revenues at its agricultural and turf segment  Sales at the United States and Canada segment accounted for 60  of Deere s total sales AGCO Corp  and CNH Industrial N V   both agricultural machine makers  had to slash production to balance inventory and retail demand  AGCO carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see Fertilizer makers Nutrien Ltd  and The Mosaic Company have stated two major reasons for the revenue decline  Firstly  China s demand for fertilizers has been delayed by trade tariffs  which is also weighing on the income generated by U S  farms  leaving farmers with limited funds These companies are now shifting focus to the South American agricultural states as China is now focusing on Brazil and Argentina to fulfill its need for farm products  especially soy Brazil   Argentina Emerge WinnersArgentina and China has been negotiating over soy meal import and have finally agreed to sign a deal  Argentina is the one of the largest processed soy exporters in the world  per Reuters  It expects to export 26 million tons of soy meal and 8 5 million ton of raw beans this year globally as the U S  China trade war has compelled China to look for alternatives Brazil s soybeans export rose 30  as China halted U S  agricultural import  China  in the past 12 months  has imported 71 million tons of soybeans from Brazil alone  In fact  representatives from CNH Industrial in August reported that there is a rise in order for tractors  planters and combined from South America especially  Brazil Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside Zacks has just

148664,370180,DE,Even After FedEx Shares Plunge 45   There s Still No Bottom In Sight,opinion,"The world s largest parcel delivery service  FedEx Corporation  NYSE FDX   has flagged some alarming news to investors  In its 1Q 2020 earnings statement on Sept  17  the company slashed its profit forecast for the year as a worsening economic environment  triggered by the U S  China trade spat  took its toll on the company s Express delivery business   which is widely considered a proxy for the global economy  
The Memphis  Tennessee based transportation giant now expects per share earnings to fall between 16 29  in the current fiscal year  compared with the forecast of a mid single digit percentage decline issued in June  FedEx also lowered its revenue outlook 
Blaming increasing trade tensions and policy uncertainty  Chief Executive Officer Fred Smith said in a conference call   The global economy continues to soften and we are taking steps to cut capacity  
The profit warning comes after the company posted an 11  drop in fiscal first quarter profit  driven by the Express unit s weakness  which delivers packages by jet and is especially vulnerable to global trade disruption 
Ominous Sign for Industrial Stocks
That continuing drag sent FedEx shares tumbling yesterday  falling almost 13  to  150 91  their lowest level in more than two years  The stock is down about 45  from the record high it reached in early 2018 when it hit  274 66 a share 
The deepening slump in FedEx shares is also an ominous sign for other industrial stocks  such as  Caterpillar  Inc  NYSE CAT   and Deere   Company  NYSE DE   as the lingering slowdown in global economic activity could further hurt their sales and delay the recovery 
But investors should remember that in an environment of economic uncertainties like the current one  blaming everything on the economy is a tactic many CEOs use to hide the internal issues  In the case of FedEx  there are also several other triggers for this dismal performance 
The biggest one is the company s continuing troubles at its European business after its costly takeover of TNT in 2015  That deal is still very much a work in progress that has failed to unlock the value investors were hoping to see 
FedEx said in March the integration costs for the acquisition are expected to exceed  1 5 billion through fiscal 2021  with the potential of further escalation  The integration challenges and the slowing European economy have raised doubts about the benefits of the TNT deal  with some analysts questioning the wisdom behind this massive undertaking 
After Q1 earnings on Wednesday  analysts from Stifel  BMO  Deutsche Bank and KeyBanc downgraded the stock  putting into question any hopes of a swift turnaround  Deutsche Bank said in a note it has lowered the rating on the the stock to  hold  from  buy  and cut its target price to  142 from  178 because  

 While some may view this as the bottom in shares  we don t see any support until management takes responsibility for recent performance and clearly articulates a credible path to better results and cash flow  and delivers on it   In the meantime shares will continue to melt lower  and rightfully so   

With the softening economy  FedEx has also been restructuring its operations to cope with the rise of e commerce orders  It recently ended is contract with Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  and announced plans to offer seven day home delivery and to handle more of the packages it used to route through the U S  Postal Service 
Bottom Line
FedEx s outlook on weakening world trade and the economy cements our view that investors should stay away from buying stocks closely tied with the global economy  It s tough to see a bottom in FedEx stock as it faces so many headwinds  including macro weakness  issues related to TNT integration and a huge cost escalation  These negative factors will continue to put pressure on the company s cash flows and sharply diminish the chances for higher dividends ",2019-09-19,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/even-after-fedex-shares-plunge-45-theres-still-no-bottom-in-sight-200465987,200465987

Construction   Forestry segment  backed by upbeat markets  will mitigate the impact of a weak agricultural sector on the company s results  Acquisitions  introduction of advanced technologies in its products and efforts to expand in precision agriculture remain key growth drivers for the company  However  input cost inflation will likely continue to dent the company s margins in the near term   Let s illustrate the factors in detail Construction   Forestry Segment to Buoy Fiscal 2019 ResultsLow commodity prices  sluggish farm incomes and the trade war have affected U S farmers  equipment purchases  This continues to put pressure on Deere s top line  Industry sales of agricultural equipment in the United States and Canada are thus anticipated to be flat compared with the prior year  Sales for the EU28 member nations will also remain flat from the prior year due to the ongoing uncertainty regarding Brexit  The South American industry sales of tractors and combines are projected to be flat to up 5  as strength in Brazil will be offset by weak performance in Argentina  thanks to political and economic uncertainty   Sales in Asia are forecast to be flat to down slightly  Deere anticipates Agriculture and Turf equipment sales to increase a meager 2  in fiscal 2019 However  stellar results from the Construction   Forestry segment will help negate the impact of a weak agricultural sector on Deere s results  For fiscal 2019  U S  GDP  total construction investments  housing starts and oil activity remain at supportive levels for equipment demand  Equipment rental utilization remains high and rental rates are likely to trend higher in fiscal 2019  Global transportation investment is expected to be up about 5   spurring demand for road construction equipment  With order books extending into the fourth quarter  the segment is poised for improved results for fiscal 2019  Deere projects global sales for Construction   Forestry equipment to rise 10  in fiscal 2019 For fiscal 2019  Deere anticipates net sales to improve about 5  year over year  aided by price realization of 3  and the Wirtgen acquisition  Net income is expected at around  3 2 billion in the fiscal  Deere is assessing cost structure by reviewing organization efficiency and footprint assessment  which  in turn will help improve margins Wirtgen Acquisition   Key Growth DriverThe company acquired the world s leading road construction equipment maker  Wirtgen  in December 2017  The buyout significantly enhanced Deere s exposure to global transportation infrastructure  Wirtgen s integration is on track  Deere updated its synergy target to EUR 125 million by 2022  It also completed the acquisition of PLA  which will assist it in providing innovative  cost effective equipment  technology and services to customers Technologically Advanced Products Provide Competitive EdgeDeere will benefit from its concerted focus on launching products with advanced technologies and features  which provides it a competitive edge  The company remains focused on revolutionizing agriculture with technology  in an effort to make farming automated  easy to use and more precise across the production process  Consequently  Deere continues to invest in technology leadership and data analytics  Moreover  the company s efforts to expand in precision agriculture will be a game changer A Few Headwinds RemainDeere s results will continue to bear the brunt of higher raw material costs on account of the implementation of tariffs  The company will be also affected by elevated expenses in fiscal 2019  It expects SA G expense to flare up about 4  in the fiscal  R D expenses are estimated to be up 6  in fiscal 2019 due to strategic investments in precision agriculture and next generation

1  U S  China trade talks drag on
U S  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Friday that trade talks between Washington and Beijing had been  productive   but provided no details apart from the description 
As high level talks wound up in Beijing  several media reports cited sources that said little progress had been made on major issues that could pave the way for a meeting between the two countries 
Having finished discussions with the Chinese Vice Premier Liu He  The New York Times reported that Mnuchin and U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer will meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping later on Friday 
Speculation pointed to the possibility that the three may discuss holding a summit between Xi and U S  President Donald Trump in the near future 
Separately  the South China Morning Post reported that high level trade talks would continue in Washington next week 
2  Global stocks mixed as economic weakness weighs
Global stocks showed mixed signs on Friday as the reported lack of progress in U S  Sino trade talks weighed and weak Chinese data added to disappointing U S  retail sales released a day earlier 
Asian stocks bore the brunt of the selloff as weak Chinese inflation data increased concern over deflationary pressures in the world s second largest economy  China s consumer price inflation unexpectedly slowed  while factory gate inflation hit its weakest level since September 2016  China s Shanghai Composite closed down 1 4  while Japan s Nikkei 225 ended 1 2  lower 
Elsewhere  European bourses struggled to remain afloat in morning trade  but gains in the region s telecoms and industrials helped push indices higher by midday on the Old Continent  Germany s DAX trailed its peers as the country s Ifo Institute warned that proposed U S  auto tariffs could cut German car exports in half 
U S  futures pointed to a flat open as investors held out after the largest drop in retail sales in nine years  At 5 50 AM ET  10 50 GMT   the blue chip Dow futures inched up 19 points  or 0 07   S P 500 futures edged forward 2 points  or 0 09   while the Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 4 points  or 0 05

Ahead of the confidence survey  the New York Fed will issue its measure of manufacturing in the New York region at 8 30 AM ET  13 30 GMT

With 386 of the S P 500 firms having already reported earnings  analysts at The Earning Scout warned that beat rates are below normal as growth has slowed and companies overall are lowering their guidance 
Chipmakers reporting after Thursday s close gave mixed signals 
Shares of NVIDIA  NASDAQ NVDA  soared 5  in premarket trade Friday as investors celebrated a profit beat and its full year sales outlook topped consensus  but Applied Materials  NASDAQ AMAT  had fallen around 1 5  in extended trading as its guidance for current quarter profit missed estimates

148756,370272,DE,Caterpillar leans on old playbook to cope with Trump tariffs,news,"By Rajesh Kumar Singh CLAYTON  N C   Reuters    Six months into the U S  tariffs on imported aluminum and steel   Caterpillar  Inc  N CAT  is finding that one of the best ways it can protect profits is a cost cutting strategy that is more than two years old   At this sprawling factory in central North Carolina where it makes small front end loaders  the company laid off workers in 2016 in response to plunging sales  consolidating two shifts into one under a program it calls the Operation   Execution Model   Even though demand has picked up since then  its Clayton plant still runs a single shift and operates only four days a week  One third of the facility s 550 employees are on flexible contracts  The result  CAT is producing more loaders here with 30 percent fewer people on the factory floor than in the past  the company told Reuters   It has redesigned all new machines it makes with over 20 percent fewer parts  cutting back on the consumption of steel which brings down the cost  Tony Fassino  vice president at Caterpillar s building construction products  said after a factory tour in Clayton   Fewer parts numbers are a huge win   Fassino told Reuters   It improves safety  it improves the quality  it improves the cost   Now  these cost cutting approaches are helping counter the financial impact of U S  President Donald Trump s trade wars  The heavy duty equipment maker estimates the import tariffs will inflate its raw materials costs by up to  200 million between July and December  though it does not provide a forecast for manufacturing costs in 2018  Caterpillar has said it would offset the impact through a price increase that went into effect on July 1 and general cost cutting measures  helping it post a record profit for all of 2018  Caterpillar s increasing emphasis on operating efficiency has proven timely  helping to bring down the cost of production at a time when material expenses are mounting on Trump s import curbs  and capacity constraints are driving up freight costs    For graphic click   An internal calculation provided to Reuters  previously unreported  shows that the measures have accounted for half of the improvements in the profit margins since 2015 at the company s construction industries division  Since January 2017  the efficiency model has been rolled out across the company  but CAT would not disclose more details  CAT  Deere   Co  N DE  and Harley Davidson Inc  N HOG  are among the many manufacturers trying to keep a lid on expenses to cope with a 30 percent rise in U S  steel prices since the start of 2018  Those rising costs  along with a tit for tat tariff war with China  have clouded the earnings outlook for industrial companies  dragging down their shares  Despite a recent rally this month  Caterpillar shares are down about 9 percent from their late January levels  compared with a 0 4 percent decline in S P 500 industrials index  SPLRCI   showing investors have yet to fully reward the company for its industry best efficiency results when it comes to operating margins and return on net operating assets   For graphic click   Steve Volkmann  a machinery analyst at Jefferies  attributes the stock s underperformance to concerns that the company s greater exposure to foreign markets and a sizeable presence in China make it more vulnerable to escalating trade wars   It is disappointing that they can t get paid for good quarters these days   he said  referring to the company s strong earnings in the last quarter  While overseas markets do account for more than half of Caterpillar s sales  the company has an evenly spread manufacturing footprint across the globe  which Volkmann and other analysts say make it better placed to deal with the tariffs  The company has also tried to put at rest worries about its operations in China  saying the trade tensions have not impacted its business there   COST CONTROL  As part of its cost cutting effort  CAT business heads have been mandated to reduce the overall manufacturing cost of every new product by at least 5 percent  one Caterpillar company executive told Reuters  This entails cost cuts by suppliers as well   Donaldson Company Inc  N DCI    which makes filters for CAT s machines   told Reuters that it tries lower the cost of production every year through material substitution or automation or efficiency gains  Cuts in travel and entertainment budgets helped the company improve operating income by 40 basis points in the latest quarter  CAT s Operation and Execution effort affects both production strategy decisions and small details of every operation  For example  it does not make smaller front wheel loaders in the United States even though their sales in North America are growing  Instead  semi finished machines are shipped in from overseas factories to the Clayton facility  where tires and buckets are installed  Fassino said  This not only allows better utilization of the company s factories  but also provides flexibility to tailor the machines to the requirements of local customers  Similarly  CAT has been managing freight contracts for deliveries across North America since 2016  Apart from improving the predictability of deliveries  and reducing insurance and damage claims  the contracts are letting Caterpillar leverage its scale and volume to moderate transportation costs in its supply chain   OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY At the Clayton plant  the company s focus on lean manufacturing  efficiency and flexible cost is on full display  Parts are put in a sequential order in stand up bag carts next to the assembly line so that assemblers do not have to spend time looking for them  Suppliers have been instructed to pack the parts in the same way  In case the parts do not arrive in the required order  workers in the factory warehouse are required to unpack and rearrange the parts before they reach the factory floor  Automation is increasingly being used to test machines  Components and parts are moved on tugger trains instead of by fork lifts to save time and cost   
 Save one minute here and save five minutes there  Add all that up  you have two shifts to one shift   said Caterpillar s Fassino ",2018-09-21,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/caterpillar-leans-on-old-playbook-to-cope-with-trump-tariffs-1618726,1618726
148757,370273,DE,This Is Why Deere  DE  Is A Great Dividend Stock,opinion,"All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio  whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  But for income investors  generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus 
While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments  income investors hone in on dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long term returns  with dividend contributions exceeding one third of total returns in many cases 
Deere in Focus
Based in Moline  Deere  DE  is in the Industrial Products sector  and so far this year  shares have seen a price change of 1 27   The agricultural equipment manufacturer is paying out a dividend of  0 76 per share at the moment  with a dividend yield of 2 01  compared to the Manufacturing   Farm Equipment industry s yield of 0 67  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 99  
Taking a look at the company s dividend growth  its current annualized dividend of  3 04 is up 17 8  from last year  In the past five year period  Deere has increased its dividend 2 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 3 81   Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company s payout ratio  a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Deere s current payout ratio is 31   This means it paid out 31  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Looking at this fiscal year  DE expects solid earnings growth  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  10 22 per share  which represents a year over year growth rate of 8 84  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for many reasons  they greatly improve stock investing profits  decrease overall portfolio risk  and carry tax advantages  among others  However  not all companies offer a quarterly payout 
Big  established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  but it s fairly uncommon to see high growth businesses or tech start ups offer their stockholders a dividend  Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  DE is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-08-05,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/this-is-why-deere-de-is-a-great-dividend-stock-200451400,200451400

revenues for the quarter is pegged at  9 30 billion  up from  9 28 billion reported in the year ago quarter Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement Key Factors to ConsiderConcerns over tariffs and trade policies and lower commodity prices led to farmers getting cautious about their equipment purchases   This will keep depressing Deere s top line  However  industrial sales and replacement demand for agricultural equipment will likely boost order activity for the Agriculture and Turf segment  aiding the upcoming quarterly results  in turn  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales of Deere s Agriculture and Turf equipment segment is currently pegged at  6 2 billion for the quarter to be reported  an expected drop from the year ago quarter s  6 3 billion  The Agriculture and Turf equipment segment s operating income is projected at  718 million  down from the  806 million reported in the prior year quarter The Construction   Forestry segment

148759,370275,DE,CSX  Caterpillar  JPMorgan  Macy s  Wal Mart  Deere   Co   Nvidia And Applied Materials Are Part Of Zacks Earnings Preview,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   August 12  2019   Zacks com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises  This week s list includes CSX Corp    NASDAQ CSX    Caterpillar   NYSE CAT    JPMorgan   NYSE JPM    Macy s   NYSE M    Wal Mart   NYSE WMT    Deere   Co    NYSE DE    Nvidia   NASDAQ NVDA   and Applied Materials   NYSE M   Making Sense of This MarketThe market is juggling a number of balls  ranging from the seemingly never ending trade tariffs issue to worries about global growth and Fed policy  Treasury bond yields have become an excellent proxy for watching the interplay of all these worries in real time  And the relationship has been fairly straight forward  with the major stock market indexes going down as the yield on the 10 year Treasury bond goes down These instruments are not only risk free  from a credit risk standpoint   but also extremely liquid that makes it easy to get in and out  Investors  both local as well as foreign  flocking to Treasury bonds as a safety play in the current uncertain environment when the day to day market movement is driven less by fundamentals and more by something as hard to handicap as a Presidential tweet I have long been sanguine about the outlook for the U S  economy and the eventual resolution of the trade issue  The way to deal with this situation is to tune out the noise and stay focused on long term fundamentals of profitability  valuation and diversification  using every instance of panicky market selling to pick up quality stocks that are on your watch list  Timing the market is never easy and this has become almost impossible to do in the current topsy turvy environment Trade   EarningsThere is little doubt that tariffs are bad for earnings  There is not only the direct relationship of higher tariffs weighing on margins  but also an indirect effect through reduced corporate confidence weighing on spending and investments Companies exposed to international trade have been making this point at every available opportunity this earnings season  from CSX Corp  and Caterpillar to even the big banks like JPMorgan and others partly blaming the trade uncertainty for tepid growth in loan portfolios  We will likely hear more about the trade issue from companies reporting this week  ranging from Macy s and Wal Mart to Deere   Co  and chipmakers Nvidia and Applied Materials In total  we have more than 250 companies reporting results this week  including 11 S P 500 members  By the end of this week  we will have seen Q2 results from 462 companies or 92 4  of the index s total membership  We have a couple of retailers reporting this week  but the earnings focus will solely be on the Retail sector in the coming days Our Take on the Q2 Earnings SeasonThe overall picture emerging from the Q2 earnings season is good enough  not great  but not bad either  The fact that there is not much growth is hardly news to anyone  as we knew all along the very tough comparisons for this quarter  as well as the remainder of this year  Earnings growth was essentially flat in the first quarter of the year and we appear to be on track for a similar performance in Q2 as well Here are the key takeaways from the Q2 earnings season after seeing results from 451S P 500 members through Friday  August 9th First  no major surprises on the growth front  which we knew will be anemic  We should keep in mind however that the growth challenge is more a function of tough comparisons to last year s record results than a cyclical downturn in profitability  Total earnings for the 451 index members that have reported are up  0 7  from the same period last year on  5 1  higher revenues  Earnings and revenue growth for the same cohort of companies had been  0 1  and  4 6  in the preceding earnings season  respectively  In other words  earnings and revenue growth is tracking modestly above what we had seen in the March quarter Second  positive EPS surprises are about in line with historical trends while the proportion of these companies beating revenue estimates is notably on the weaker side  For the 451 index members that have reported results already  75 6  are beating EPS estimates and 57 4  are beating revenue estimates  For the same cohort of companies  the proportion of positive EPS and revenue surprises was 77 4  and 61  in the Q1 earnings season Third  estimates for 2019 Q3 are coming down more than what we saw in the comparable period for the preceding two quarters  but about in line with historical trends  The current  4 1  decline is down from  3 4  last week and  1  in mid June Estimates for full year 2019 are coming down as well  though the magnitude of negative revisions is a lot lower currently than had been the case at the start of the year Q2 Earnings Season Scorecard  as of August 9th We now have Q2 results from 451 S P 500 members or 90 2  of the index s total membership  Total earnings for these companies are up  0 7  from the same period last year on  5 1  higher revenues  with 75 6  beating EPS estimates and 57 4  beating revenue estimates For Q2 as a whole  total earnings for the S P 500 index are expected to be flat from the same period last year on  4 6  higher revenues  which would follow the  0 1  earnings decline on  4 2  higher revenues in 2019 Q1 Join us on Facebook  NASDAQ FB    Zacks Investment Research is under common control with affiliated entities

148786,370302,DE,Cotton makes a comeback in U S  Plains as farmers sour on wheat,news,"By Michael Hirtzer ANTHONY  Kan   Reuters    Farmers in Kansas and Oklahoma are planting more land with cotton than they have for decades as they ditch wheat  attracted by relatively high cotton prices and the crop s ability to withstand drought  A 20 percent increase from last year marks a sharp turnaround for the crop that once dominated the Mississippi Delta into Texas  Just three years ago  low prices led to U S  farmers planting the fewest acres with cotton in over 30 years  The switch to cotton in the southern plains of the United States could be long term as farmers move away from a global wheat market that is increasingly dominated by fast growing supply from top exporter Russia  U S  farmers have struggled to make a profit on wheat due to a global glut  Cotton is a safer bet than wheat because it can be grown with less water  at a time when drought has hit some areas of the U S  farm belt   I have switched out of grain pretty much completely   said southern Kansas farmer Darrin Eck   It s rough to raise beans or corn  But  if we get a little bit of rain  the cotton works    Eck said he will plant 3 000 of his 4 000 acres with cotton  up from 1 700 last year  He also spent around  500 000 to purchase a used John Deere cotton harvester  Even with expectations for more planted acres  cotton futures  are hovering above 80 cents per pound  near the highest levels in about four years  Wheat futures  have recovered from 2016 s decade low of  3 60  fetching about  5 43 per bushel on Friday  The other that crop farmers typically turn to during periods of drought or low rainfall is the animal feed sorghum  Both cotton and sorghum need less water than soybeans  corn or wheat  But China in April targeted sorghum for punitive import tariffs in a tit for tat trade dispute with the United States  a move that sent prices plunging and made cotton the clear winner for many farmers this year  China has since removed the sorghum tariffs  but by then  most farmers had made their planting choice  Growing more cotton is still a gamble  China had threatened to impose tariffs on U S  cotton imports  before tensions eased last week between the world s two largest economies  In Kansas  farmers planned to sow 130 000 acres of cotton  the most ever  according to the U S  Department of Agriculture  Oklahoma cotton plantings were forecast at 680 000 acres  the largest since 1980  Across the country  farmers will likely plant 13 469 million cotton acres  the most since 14 735 million in 2011  after total acres of wheat planted last winter fell to 32 7 million  smallest in about a century  SEEDS AND GINS Seed firms are already seeing the benefits  U S  sales of  Monsanto   N MON  cotton seeds and traits in the first half of fiscal year 2018 were  243 million  up from  224 million during the same period in 2017  according to a company spokeswoman  With both Monsanto and rival DowDuPont  N DWDP  offering cotton seed with traits that help boost yields  the crop will likely be an option for many farmers for years  said Kansas farmer Eck   Cotton will be here to stay until the grains get better   he said  Some peanut farmers in states such as Georgia are also turning to cotton  USDA projected peanut plantings will drop 18 percent  Peanut production reached a record last year  but high cotton prices are luring farmers who need to rotate crops   Because cotton prices are attractive    it gives peanut farmers a chance to get their rotation back in order   said Bob Parker  president and chief executive of the National Peanut Board  an industry group  Demand for cotton harvesters  which strip cotton from the plants and make bales  is  off the charts   said Greg Peterson  founder of the Machinery Pete website which hosts auctions for farm equipment  The Southern Kansas Cotton Growers in Anthony  Kansas  plans to double its capacity to separate cotton fibers from seed this year  The machine that does that  the gin  has already run at record capacity after a big harvest last year  said Gary Feist  president of the Kansas Cotton Association that operates the gin   HEAVY EQUIPMENT At Hurst Farm Supply in Lorenzo  Texas  there are roughly five farmers interested in each Deere   Co  N DE  CS690 cotton harvester they have to sell  said Randy Sparks  a sales manager  The store collected names from farmers interested in the equipment and pulls a name out of a hat when a harvester becomes available  to ensure they are fair to their local customers    These guys out of Oklahoma and Kansas  there s no local machinery for them to purchase so they have to come where it s at   Sparks said   The machinery demand is a bright spot for Deere  which has been battling tepid demand in North America due to four years of declining U S  farm income  Equipment sales suggest the turn to cotton may be longer term  said CoBank analyst Ben Laine

148788,370304,DE,Deere  DE  Up 3 8  Since Last Earnings Report  Can It Continue ,opinion,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Deere  DE   Shares have added about 3 8  in that time frame  outperforming the S P 500 
Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is Deere due for a pullback  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts  Deere Q2 Earnings Lag Estimates  Trims FY19 GuidanceDeere   Company  NYSE DE  reported second quarter fiscal 2019  ended Apr 28  2019  adjusted earnings of  3 52 per share  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 58 by a margin of 2   However  the reported figure recorded an improvement of 12  from the prior year quarter s adjusted earnings per share of  3 14 Ongoing concerns over the impact of the escalating trade war between the United States and China on U S  exports of key commodities  weakening agricultural market and delayed planting season in much of North America are resulted in farmer s getting cautious about their equipment purchases  Deere has this trimmed fiscal 2019 guidance  The company s shares fell 5  in pre market trading  Including one time items  the company had reported earnings per share of  3 67 in the prior year quarter  There were no adjustments in the currently reported quarter Net sales of equipment operations  which comprise Agriculture and Turf  Construction and Forestry  came in at  10 27 billion  up 5  year over year  Revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  10 15 billion  Total net sales  including financial services and others  came in at  11 34 billion  up 6  year over year  Operational UpdateCost of sales in the reported quarter advanced 6  year over year to  7 8 billion  Gross profit in the reported quarter came in at  2 5 billion  reflecting year over year improvement of 4  Selling  administrative and general expenses inched up 1  year over year to  947 million  Equipment operations reported operating profit of  1 366 million in the quarter under review compared with  1 315 million in the prior year quarter  Total operating profit  including financial services  increased to  1 536 million from  1 494 million reported in the year ago quarter  Segment Performance Agriculture   Turf segment s sales were up 3  year over year to  7 3 billion  primarily driven by higher shipment volumes and price realization offset by unfavorable currency translation impact  Operating profit at the segment declined 4  year over year to  1 019 million  owing to higher production costs  and increased research and development expenses  These were partially mitigated by price realization and higher shipment volumes  Construction   Forestry sales increased 11  year over year to  2 99 billion from the prior year quarter  aided by the Wirtgen acquisition  higher shipment volumes and price realization  somewhat offset by unfavorable foreign exchange  This segment reported operating profit of  347 million  an improvement of 34  from the prior year quarter figure of  259 million  The Wirtgen acquisition contributed operating profit of  102 million in the reported quarter  Apart from it  price realization and higher shipment volumes partially offset by higher production costs and less favorable product mix  drove profits  Net revenues at Deere s Financial Services division totaled  886 million in the reported quarter  up 11  year over year  The segment s operating profit came in at  170 million  a decrease of 5  year over year  Financial Update Deere reported cash and cash equivalents of  3 5 billion at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2019 compared with  4 2 billion at the end of the prior year quarter  Cash utilized in operations was  1 5 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2019  compared with  1 2 billion in the prior year quarter  At the end of the reported quarter  long term borrowing was approximately  28 3 billion  up from  26 3 billion at the end of prior year quarter  Fiscal 2019 Outlook Deere trimmed fiscal 2019 guidance considering continued weakness in the agricultural sector   Due to the company s prudent management of field inventories  it anticipates production levels to be below retail sales in the second half of the year For fiscal 2019  Deere lowered expectation of equipment sales year over year growth to 5  from the prior expectation of 7   The Wirtgen acquisition will contribute about 1  to net sales for the fiscal  The forecast also factors an unfavorable impact of 3  for foreign currency translation for fiscal  higher than previous projection of an impact of 2   For the fiscal  the company now anticipates net sales to increase about 5  year over year  down from its previously guided growth expectation of 7   The expectation for net income for the fiscal is now at about  3 3 billion compared with its earlier expected  3 6 billion  For the Agriculture   Turf segment  Deere projects industry sales of agricultural equipment in the United States and Canada to be flat to up 5  in fiscal 2019  Industry sales in the EU28 member nations are forecast to be flat  South American industry sales of tractors and combines are expected to be flat to up 5  aided by strength in Brazil  Sales in Asia are likely to be flat to down slightly  Industry sales of turf and utility equipment in the United States and Canada are expected to be flat to up 5  for 2019  The Construction   Forestry segment s results will benefit from the addition of a full year of Wirtgen sales  adding 4  to its sales  compared with 10 months in fiscal 2018  The company anticipates generally positive fundamentals and economic growth worldwide  In forestry  global industry sales are expected to be flat to up 5  mainly on account of higher demand in EU28 countries and Russia  For the Financial Services segment  results are expected to benefit from a higher average portfolio  partially offset by less favorable financing spreads  higher provision for credit losses  and higher selling and administrative expenses  
How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then 
In the past month  investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates  The consensus estimate has shifted  12 47  due to these changes

148789,370305,DE,Positive Vibe Returns As Fed Gathers  With Potential ECB Stimulus Pondered,opinion," Tuesday Market Open  After several days of lackluster trading  it feels like there s a little more energy in the air today as the Fed begins its two day meeting  The positive vibe stemmed partly from comments European Central Bank  ECB  President Mario Draghi made Tuesday about the possibility for more stimulus 
European stocks ricocheted from losses to gains after Draghi spoke  and U S  markets appeared to also catch the wave in pre market trading  We ll have to wait and see if this rolls on as the day continues  because traditionally the two days of a Fed meeting are pretty slow and featureless 
As the Fed begins its deliberations  the futures market still suggests low odds of any rate move this week  However  those chances moved solidly higher over the last 24 hours  to nearly 30   That compares with 15  as of late Monday 
If stocks end up rallying on hopes of the Fed cutting rates  it might be worth keeping some perspective  A rate cut still seems unlikely tomorrow  but if it does happen  it s likely a reaction by the Fed to what it sees as a slowing economy  The  good news  is  bad news  scenario discussed here last week still holds  Many economists see Q2 U S  gross domestic product  GDP  and earnings growth slowing from Q1  and that s not such a good thing 
Recent manufacturing and jobs data haven t been as strong  and the European and Chinese economies are taking a beating  Tariffs still overhang everything  with the threat of more to come  The real story might be told next month when earnings season starts and investors begin hearing from CEOs about the economic climate 
On the corporate news front  Facebook  NASDAQ FB  shares got some buzz this morning as FB launched a new cryptocurrency called Libra  Oracle  NYSE ORCL  shares fell in pre market trading after an analyst downgrade  The  FAANG  stocks  which FB is one of  were among the market leading areas Monday  so we ll see if that has any legs 
U S  housing starts for May released early Tuesday beat analysts  expectations  coming in at 1 269 million  That compared with the consensus of around 1 24 million  One data point isn t a trend  but this does look like a bit of positive news for the economy 
Home on the Range  More Like Stuck
 Range bound  became more than a saying this last week  It started to look like a way of life 
Over the four sessions starting last Wednesday  the S P 500 Index  SPX  has barely moved  The low over that stretch was 2874 on Wednesday  and the high was 2897 yesterday  So in four days of trading  the SPX stayed locked in a 23 point range  or well below 1  
This kind of dull  directionless trading isn t too uncommon heading into a Fed meeting  though it s seldom this pronounced  Maybe things will get more exciting once Fed Chair Jerome Powell and company finish pondering the economy and get out in front of an audience tomorrow afternoon  The Fed s decision is scheduled for 2 p m  ET Wednesday 
A lot of the talk so far ahead of the Fed meeting centers on hopes among some investors that the Fed might not cut rates  but at least could hint at possible future cuts  However  some analysts have said the Fed might disappoint people who are thinking that way  The Fed could want to get a look at what happens at the G20 conference next week before making any big moves or even hinting at its next step  according to this school of thought 
The economy  on the other hand  does appear to be slowing  so that s a tack the Fed could conceivably take if it delivers any dovish language tomorrow  Short of actually saying it s considering a rate cut  the Fed might let its  dot plot  do the talking  Many analysts expect this chart of future rate projections to take a noticeable downward curve from where we last saw it back in March  based on slowing U S  and global growth 
The futures market sees odds of at least one rate cut by the July meeting at 88   and chances of at least one cut by September at 97   The only question  if we take the futures market as a good predictor  is exactly how much the Fed might move  There s a better than 75  chance of rates falling 50 basis points from current levels between now and September  futures prices indicate  though it looks like it would happen in separate moves  not all at once 
G20 Another Overhang After Fed Meeting
The other major overhang is next week s G20 meeting  That one is closely associated with the trade situation  and if there s no progress or worse  a rise in tension between China and the U S  coming out of that gathering it might be tough on Wall Street  On the other hand  one might argue that a potential negative outcome could already be having an impact  with few investors apparently eager to buy at these relatively lofty levels when the trade situation is still out there 
U S  Treasury yields  for one  don t seem to be making the case for a quick turnaround on trade  They dropped to a new low for the year of 2 03  as rate cut odds moved higher  A lot of the pressure on yields might be associated with investors dialing in potential rate cuts in coming months  Weak data like Monday s surprisingly soft Empire State Manufacturing Survey might also play into the low yields  and into hopes for a quicker move by the Fed  Today s housing numbers aren t the last housing data of the week  Friday is scheduled to bring existing home sales for May  The question going into that one could be whether falling mortgage rates this spring got more people out to those open houses  On the other hand  nasty weather around much of the country might be a weight on that market Wednesday and Thursday have a couple of earnings reports on the calendar  including Oracle  NYSE ORCL  and Kroger  NYSE KR   KR   See more on ORCL below 
VIX Levels Out
With the market in such a tight range  it might not come as too big a surprise to hear that volatility as measured by the CBOE Volatility Index  VIX  has also been pretty flat over this stretch  oscillating between 15 and 16  It hasn t moved above 17 or below 15 since June 4 
The question might be what happens next once the Fed meeting gets out of the way  Some choppiness might come back with the end of the quarter and the G20 meeting both looming  especially as we get into next week  but we ll have to wait and see  For now  it seems like the SPX is well enclosed in that range between the 50 day moving average of 2874 and psychological resistance at 2900  a level it s tested several times lately without being able to close above Meanwhile  crude also appears to be in a range of between roughly  51 and  53 a barrel for U S  front month futures  The price sank back to near the bottom of that range Monday despite no sign of easing tension between the U S  and Iran  
Figure 1  STUCK IN PLACE  Looking for trading excitement  It s been very hard to find the last few days  This chart of the S P 500 Index  candlestick  and the Cboe Volatility Index  purple line  shows just how much things have flattened out over the last month as investors await the Fed meeting and next week s G20 gathering  Data Sources  CBOE Global Markets  S P Dow Jones Indices  Chart source  The thinkorswim  platform from TD Ameritrade  For illustrative purposes only  Past performance does not guarantee future results 
Curtain Call  With just a couple of weeks left in the quarter  we could be heading into a little seasonal volatility  It s around now that some fund managers tend to engage in a time honored practice called  window dressing   No  we re not talking about choosing the right shades or curtains  It s a practice designed to make their clients  portfolios look more palatable before those quarterly progress reports go in the mail  or now  the virtual mail   This means you could see some money shifting out of some of the poorer performing sectors into some sectors that have more shine  and into some stocks with big recent gains

Oracle Steps to the Plate Tomorrow  While most people are watching the Fed closely tomorrow  that might not include the executives at Oracle  ORCL   They ll be getting ready to share earnings after the close that afternoon  Most analysts expect a year over year revenue dip  although they also expect earnings per share  EPS  to rise in ORCL s fiscal Q4  Guidance is likely to also get a close look  with the company saying last quarter that it expects double digit EPS growth during the fiscal year 
Over the last year or two  we ve often seen companies that report lower revenue get hurt a bit in the market  That means if revenue falls  investors might want to consider checking closely to see if ORCL had a corresponding cut in expenses during the quarter  Or  if expenses grew  can the company really justify that growth  ORCL is a major player in cloud computing  a sector that s seen growing competition lately  The company s earnings could give investors a bit more insight into whether slowing international growth and tariffs might be affecting that industry

148816,370332,DE,Trade war backfire  Steel tariff shrapnel hits U S  farmers,news,By Tom Polansek and P J  Huffstutter KANE COUNTY  Ill   Reuters    Lucas Strom  who runs a century old family farm in rural Illinois  canceled an order to buy a new  71 000 grain storage bin last month   after the seller raised the price 5 percent in a day   The reason  steel prices jumped right after U S  President Donald Trump announced tariffs  Throughout U S  farm country  where Trump has enjoyed strong support  tariffs on steel and aluminum imports are boosting costs for equipment and infrastructure and causing some farmers and agricultural firms to scrap purchases and expansion plans  according to Reuters  interviews with farmers  manufacturers  construction firms and food shippers  The impact of rising steel prices on agriculture illustrates the unintended and unpredictable consequences of aggressive protectionism in a global economy  And the blow comes as farmers fear a more direct hit from retaliatory tariffs threatened by China on crops such as sorghum and soybeans  the most valuable U S  agricultural export  A P Grain Systems in Maple Park  Illinois   the seller of the storage bin Strom wanted to buy with a neighboring farmer   raised its price two days after Trump announced aluminum and steel tariffs on March 1 to protect U S  producers of the metals  Strom and his neighbor backed out    Would that price destroy us  No   Strom said   But these days  you have to be smart about your expenses   The metals tariffs also hitting makers and sellers of farm equipment  from smaller firms like A P Grain to global giants such as Deere   Co  N DE  and  Caterpillar  Inc  N CAT   Such firms are struggling with whether and how to pass along their higher raw materials costs to farmers who are already reeling from low commodity prices amid a global grains glut  The world s two largest economies have threatened each other with tariffs on tens of billions of dollars of goods recent weeks   Trump imposed tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum in a move mainly aimed at curbing imports from China  He has since temporarily excluded the European Union and six other allies from the duties and given them until May 1 to negotiate permanent exemptions  A P Grain President Dave Altepeter said the steel used in their bins is made in the United States  but domestic steel prices also have soared because of the tariffs  U S  steel mills typically adjust their prices once a year  normally in the first quarter  Altepeter said  But this year  those prices have jumped four times  he said  The price of steel used in A P s grain bins has jumped about 20 percent since January 1   Any time there s any type of negative talk that affects the steel mill  they ve raised the price   said Altepeter  Last year  about 95 000 tons of steel was shipped to the agriculture industry  compared to the 14 million tons for the U S  auto industry  according to the American Iron and Steel Institute  an industry group  Other factors had been driving up steel prices before the recent trade disputes  including an improving global economy and accelerating manufacturing and construction  particularly in the U S  The White House referred questions from Reuters to the U S  Department of Agriculture  which did not respond to a request for comment  Trump and Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue have vowed the U S  government will protect farmers from China s tariffs  but not explained how   U S  farmers can ill afford any loss of sales  Farm income has dropped by more than half since 2013  following years of massive harvests that have depressed prices for staples such as corn and soybeans  U S  competitors Brazil  Argentina and Russia have all raised grain output in recent years  eating into the U S  share of global markets  Mexico imported ten times more corn from Brazil last year and is set to buy even more in 2018 on worries that renegotiations of the NAFTA trade pact could disrupt their U S  supplies   Strom said he has also pushed back plans to build a new metal storage building to house his planter and the combine head he uses for harvesting corn and soybeans  Other farmers  food producers and beer makers have scrambled to finalize deals for steel based equipment before prices climb more  CONSTRUCTION POSTPONED  In Riverton  Illinois  farmer Allen Entwistle said he postponed construction of a new  800 000 storage system for grain after AGCO Corp s  N AGCO  GSI unit increased prices by 15 percent  Entwistle  who voted for Trump  will instead store corn in bags on the ground   President Trump keeps telling us he s going to get a better deal   Entwistle said   When are we gonna make it better   AGCO said Trump s tariffs will raise its costs and make price hikes to customers unavoidable   As the entire grain storage industry has weathered increased steel prices  AGCO and GSI are constantly looking for new ways to maximize efficiency and minimize the impact to customers   said spokeswoman Kelli Cook  Other companies  including Deere and Caterpillar  are also facing pain from rising steel prices  which account for about 10 percent of equipment manufacturers  direct costs  Deere CEO Samuel Allen told Reuters last month the company will have to absorb the price increase and cut costs elsewhere  China s threatened tariffs on U S  crops could hurt the company even more by undermining demand from farmers  he said    This has a huge effect on livelihood of the farmer right now  and at the same time it has a huge impact on manufacturers   said Dennis Slater  president at the Association of Equipment Manufacturers  an industry group  U S  net farm income is forecast to drop to  59 5 billion in 2018 dollars  down from  64 9 billion in 2017  an 8 3 percent decline  according to the USDA   TARIFF  DOOM AND GLOOM  In Sheffield  Iowa  Sukup Manufacturing has seen steel prices soar 40 percent since November  said Brent Hansen  the company s commercial accounts manager   The maker of grain bins and pre manufactured steel buildings has encouraged customers to buy quickly before prices jump more  But some have already postponed projects  Hansen said   That s obviously a big price increase for an industry that s a little bit doom and gloom over tariffs   Hansen said   Sukup used to give customers up to two months to consider its bids for projects  Now  it allows just a week in some cases because of volatile steel prices  Hansen said  Prices have jumped by 25 percent for thermal insulated panels that keep food cold   which can use either steel  aluminum or both  said Glenn Todd  owner of Todd Construction Services  The company has built food processing and storage facilities for Bumble Bee Seafoods and poultry company Foster Farms  Richard Adkins  director of sales at Discovery Designs Refrigeration in Mukwonago  Wisconsin  thought his company wouldn t have to worry about Trump s tariffs  Most of the metal they use to design industrial refrigeration systems comes from Canada and Mexico  he said  and the president has exempted both countries from the levies   It didn t matter  Price hike notices from vendors landed in Adkins  mailbox days after Trump announced the duties    There s this knee jerk reaction   Adkins said   We re quoting prices for projects that won t be awarded for another six or eight months  and no one wants to be hung out to dry

reported disappointing second quarter fiscal 2019 results  The company s earnings lagged estimates for the fifth straight quarter  forcing it to cut its fiscal 2019 outlook  which reflects the escalated tension in the U S  China trade war  This is especially true as farmers  particularly  have been caught in the crossfire of trade and commodities  such as soybeans  which were the worst hit  However  the company s revenues exceeded the consensus mark Earnings per share came in at  3 52  well below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 58 but improved 12  from the year ago period  Moreover

148819,370335,DE,Bear Of The Day  Lindsay Corporation  LNN ,opinion,"Shares of Lindsay Corporation  LNN  have fallen roughly 16  over the last 12 months  which falls below its industry s 5  average decline  The irrigation and road safety equipment maker is coming off a worse than expected quarter on the back of U S  China trade war worries  which have only escalated since it reported its second quarter fiscal 2019 results in early April    
Overview   Recent Performance
Lindsay Corporation is a manufacturer and distributor of irrigation and infrastructure equipment and technology  The company is well known for its massive Zimmatic irrigation equipment  and other offerings  that have become popular with farmers around the world  The Omaha  Nebraska based company also operates an infrastructure division  which includes transportation safety and roadway maintenance products such as energy absorbing crash cushions and moveable barriers 
The company has been negatively impacted by the ongoing trade fight between the U S  and China that has hurt farmers and caused uncertainty  Lindsay Corporation s revenue fell 16  last quarter  some of which was attributed to previously announced business divestitures  Meanwhile  LNN posted a quarterly net loss of  3 4 million  or  0 32 per diluted share  down big from positive earnings of  0 16 per share in the prior year period 
Lindsay Corporation did report positive adjusted Q2 earnings and saw its international irrigation segment revenue jump 15   driven by strong sales in developing markets  Nonetheless  shares of LNN have dipped roughly 4  since it reported and 15  in 2019   North America irrigation sales volumes were significantly lower than anticipated as the unresolved US China trade dispute contributed to a further decline in farmer sentiment   CEO Tim Hassinger said in prepared remarks last quarter 
Overall  shares of LNN are down roughly 4  over the past five years  which falls well below its industry s 30  climb and the S P 500 s 53  expansion  Lindsay Corporation stock closed regular trading Tuesday at  80 61 per share  down roughly 26  off its 52 week intraday trading highs 
 
 
Outlook   Earnings Trends 
Looking ahead  the company s current quarter revenue is projected to fall over 19  to  136 87 million  based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimate  The firm s full year fiscal 2019 revenue is then expected to slip nearly 14  to  472 03 million  Peeking ahead to fiscal 2020  the company is projected to see its full year revenue pop 6  above our 2019 estimate to reach  500 79 million  This  however  would still fall well below 2018 s  547 71 million 
Moving onto the bottom end of the income statement  LNN s adjusted quarterly EPS figure is projected to plummet over 41 5  to  0 97 per share  The firm s adjusted fiscal 2019 earnings are expected to fall roughly 37   Luckily for current long term LNN holders  the company s earnings are projected to soar 70  above our 2019 estimate in fiscal 2020 
With that said  the company s earnings estimate revision activity has moved completely in the wrong direction recently  Investors will also notice just how much its quarterly and full year earnings estimates have come down

This will be backed by strong demand for equipment and the Wirtgen acquisition  With order books extending into the fourth quarter  the segment seems on track for improved results in the remaining half of the fiscal In forestry  global industry sales are expected to be flat to up 5   primarily driven by higher demand in EU28 countries and Russia  The segment s operating margin is projected to

U S  GDP  total construction investments  housing starts and oil activity remain at supportive levels for equipment demand  Equipment rental utilization remains high and rental rates will continue to improve in 2019  Global transportation investment this calendar year is anticipated to be up about 4   spurring demand for road construction equipment  such as milling machines  rollers and asphalt pavers  which are all important product lines for Wirtgen  It should be noted that Deere acquired the world s leading road construction equipment maker  Wirtgen for  5 2 billion in cash and debt in December 2017  The buyout significantly enhanced Deere s exposure to global transportation infrastructure  The company has updated its synergy target to 125 million euro by 2022 Deere expects Agriculture and Turf equipment sales to increase about 2  in fiscal 2019  Industry sales of agricultural equipment in the United States and Canada are anticipated to be flat to up 5   This will be backed by demand for both large and small equipment Per the USDA s latest available projections  net farm is anticipated to increase 10  year over year in 2019 to  69 4 billion  after a decline of 16  in 2018  Further  the USDA has announced a  16 billion aid program for American farmers who have been affected by the U S  trade war with China  This is likely to improve farmer sentiment and bolster

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of  1 68   A quarter ago  it was expected that this agricultural equipment manufacturer would post earnings of  1 80 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 54  delivering a surprise of  14 44  
Over the last four quarters  the company has not been able to surpass consensus EPS estimates 
Deere  which belongs to the Zacks Manufacturing   Farm Equipment industry  posted revenues of  10 27 billion for the quarter ended April 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 23   This compares to year ago revenues of  9 75 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Deere shares have lost about 2 1  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 14 7  
What s Next for Deere 
While Deere has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Deere was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

148855,370371,DE,Trade War Stings Again  Market Cycles Likely To Push Even Lower ,opinion,"Summary 

The S P 500  SPX  fell 21 points last week to 2860  a decline of 0 7  
Stocks chopped around as headlines mostly pointed to an escalation in trade tensions between the US and China 
Our projection this week is for stocks to chop around with a downward bias increasing into the first two weeks of June 

The stock market was volatile last week  falling sharply early on  rallying into resistance and falling again at the end of the week  Stocks sank early in the week on escalating trade tensions between the US and China  who imposed retaliatory tariffs in response to President Trump s tariff increase  This occurred after economic advisor Larry Kudlow had acknowledged that the trade war would impact both economies negatively 
Trump later signed an executive order that declared a national emergency with regard to communications technology  The Commerce Department then added Chinese telecom Huawei to an entity list that prohibits US companies from purchasing their products 
Deere   Company  NYSE DE  fell by 7  after earnings came in at  3 52 compared to the average estimate of  3 62  while marginally beating revenue expectations  Yet management cut their projected revenue increase from 7  to only 5  based in part on concerns related to the trade war 
The trade war also appears to be affecting at least some Chinese firms  Baidu Inc  NASDAQ BIDU  tanked by 16  after posting a huge earnings miss of  2 77 versus a  3 99 expectation  pointing to slowing ad revenue to explain the results 
CEO Robin Li said that  We are taking a cautious view that online marketing in the near term will face a more challenging environment   While 14 analysts lowered their price targets  no one is recommending to sell the stock 
S P 500  SPX  Daily Chart 
Our approach to technical analysis uses market cycles to project price action  While the SPX recently started a new rising phase of the short term cycle  our projection for this week is for more choppy action with an overall downward bias  We believe the recent shift to negative momentum is significant and will exert downward pressure on price action 
Keep an eye on the 2801 level  which is the cycle low  If we push below that point  it is a negative indicator for the remainder of this cycle  While it s certainly possible  we don t expect this to occur however until the first two weeks of June ",2019-05-18,Steve Miller,https://www.investing.com/analysis/as-trade-war-stings-again-market-cycles-likely-to-push-even-lower-200422778,200422778

148922,370438,DE,U S  farmers tighten belts to compete with cheap LatAm grain,news,"By Mark Weinraub and P J  Huffstutter
CHICAGO  Reuters    When Kansas farmer Tom Giessel drove over a deer carcass and punctured a tire on his combine during harvest this fall  he did not have the time or cash to fix it  He borrowed his neighbor s tractor to finish 
U S  farmers are cutting costs any way they can to compete against cheaper producers in Argentina and Brazil  Four years of global oversupply have pushed down grain prices  reduced agricultural revenues and put more expensive producers under financial pressure 
In response  U S  farmers have bought cheaper seeds  spent less on fertilizers and delayed equipment purchases as they seek to ride out the downturn  But more bumper harvest forecasts and rising energy prices herald another tough year for farmers in 2018 
 The logical thing to do is stop farming   said Giessel  64  who farms about 5 000 acres and has worked on the land all of his adult life 
Giessel has cut spending on what he can control   seeds  chemicals  fertilizer  rented land   and chewed through his farm s savings  He stands to lose  93 an acre  or nearly  15 000  on one corn field alone this year 
 My burn rate is a raging fire  And I am no different than anyone else out here   Giessel said 
Some farmers have had to sell assets to keep afloat  Others have gone into bankruptcy 
U S  farmers have taken another hit this year because of rising prices of labor  fuel and electricity  Those costs together account for about 14 5 percent of total expenses and are largely out of farmers  control  Interest expenses have also risen as banks have tightened credit to the agricultural sector 
These items were expected to push overall costs up 1 3 percent in 2017  which would mark the first year since 2014 that farmers have failed to reduce total costs 
Farmers cut  40 20 billion to bring total costs down to  350 49 billion between 2014 and 2016  according to the U S  Agriculture Department s Economic Research Service 
The downturn in spending has hurt farm equipment manufacturers 
Sales in the agriculture division at Deere   Co  N DE  and  CNH Industrial   MI CNHI  fell sharply during 2015 and 2016  Deere expects farm equipment sales in the United States and Canada to be down another 5 percent this year  and CNH said in July that sales in North America were down 
CROP PRICES  YIELD
Falls in crop prices have outpaced the cuts farmers have made in spending 
Corn futures  Cv1  have dropped about 12 percent during 2017 from 2014 averages while soybean prices are 17 percent lower and wheat has tumbled 24 percent 
Farmers are looking for bigger yields through better seed and pesticide technology to improve their ability to compete with their counterparts in Latin America and elsewhere  But they are struggling to afford the expensive latest varieties as they tighten their belts 
Hardier seed breeds and rising yields have for years boosted U S  farm productivity  But they have also contributed to the massive oversupply in global grains markets 
Saving money on capital purchases is one thing  But cuts to farm inputs   from reducing how many seeds are planted to cutting back on fertilizer use   will eventually hurt productivity  say farmers 
     You find yourself in a Catch 22   said Jeff Fisher  who grows corn and soybeans on 1 600 acres in Illinois 
 You just hope the yield won t be hit too bad next year  
David Miller  who grows corn and soybeans on 500 acres in southern Iowa  saved about  8 per acre for beans and some  20 per acre for corn by using cheaper seeds 
The risk is that they will produce a smaller harvest  Adding to that concern  After a dry summer  he expects his poorest soybean field to yield around 20 bushels per acre  65 percent off the state average 
Even with the cuts  U S  farmers are still spending more per acre than their competitors in Latin America 
In Argentina  corn was expected to cost just under  200 per acre in the 2017 2018 season  according to Ezequiel de Freijo  analyst at farm association Sociedad Rural s Institute of Economic Studies  well below the around  310 per acre in the United States in 2016 
Soy farmers in the Latin American country are spending around  115 an acre  compared to around  163 in the United States during 2016
The lower costs have helped Latin American producers take market share from their competitors in the United States  Brazil and Argentina combined are expected to capture nearly 42 percent of the global corn export market in the 2017 2018 crop year  up from under 38 percent in 2014 2015 
During the same period  the United States saw its share of global corn exports drop to around 31 percent of the market from 33 5 percent 
Latin American farmers  like their counterparts in the north  are also searching for ways to cut costs to boost their margins and take more of the global market from competitors 
 We are cutting use of fertilisers  for example   said Jos  Fernandes  who farms 400 hectares  or nearly 1 000 acres  of soy in Brazil s key Mato Grosso production region 

 We have been  burning fat  for a long time here on costs  ",2017-10-26,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/us-farmers-tighten-belts-to-compete-with-cheap-latam-grain-548011,548011

148924,370440,DE,Deere Bets On Favorable Demand   Acquisitions Amid Cost Woes,opinion,On Feb 28  we issued an updated research report on Deere   Company   NYSE DE    The company is poised to gain from improving construction markets and growing replacement demand for agricultural equipment  acquisitions and introduction of advanced technologies in its products  However  the trade uncertainty continues to affect the buying activity of customers  Moreover  higher raw material costs and unfavorable foreign currency is likely to affect margin performance  Let s illustrate the factors in detail  Upbeat End Markets to Stoke Growth For fiscal 2019  Deere anticipates net sales to increase about 7  year over year and projects net income of about  3 6 billion  The company remains well poised to grow on the back of improving demand in agricultural and construction equipment markets  Deere estimates Agriculture and Turf equipment sales to increase about 4  in fiscal 2019  up from the previous forecast of 3  growth  Industry sales of agricultural equipment in the United States and Canada are anticipated to be flat to up 5   This will be backed by demand for both large and small equipment  Replacement demand also continues to drive order activity on account of the pressing need to replace older fleet and take advantage of the new technology available  U S  crop cash receipts  an important indicator for equipment demand  are estimated to be about  124 billion in fiscal 2019   the highest since 2014  Further  higher corn  wheat and cotton prices will offset softness in the soybean market  Following the aid of  1 65 per bushel from the U S  Department of Agriculture  the dynamics for soybean will also improve this year  Moreover  per the USDA s latest available projections  net farm is anticipated to increase 12  year over year in 2019 after a decline of 8  in 2018  Deere projects global sales for Construction   Forestry equipment to rise 13  in fiscal 2019 backed by strong demand for equipment and the Wirtgen acquisition  In forestry  global industry sales are expected to be up 5  to 10  primarily driven by higher demand in EU28 countries and Russia  The segment s operating margin is projected to be about 12   The economic environment for the construction  forestry and road building industries holds promise and continues to support elevated demand for new and used equipment  Acquisitions Support Deere Deere acquired the world s leading road construction equipment maker  Wirtgen  in December 2017  The buyout significantly enhances Deere s exposure to global transportation infrastructure  Wirtgen s integration is on track  The company has updated its synergy target to EUR 125 million by 2022  It also completed the acquisition of PLA which will assist it in providing innovative  cost effective equipment  technology  and services to customers  Technological Advancement in Products to Provide Competitive Edge Deere will benefit from introduction of advanced technologies in its products  The company s proprietary and foundational precision technologies such as guidance  telematics  onboard computing and digital operations center  all of which calls for up to 20 years of investment  These foundational elements serve as key enablers for its latest advanced technologies and the combination creates the most differentiated and integrated solution in the marketplace  Moreover  Deere s efforts to expand in precision agriculture will be a game changer  In September 2017  Deere acquired Sunnyvale  CA based Blue River Technology  a pioneer in bringing machine learning to agricultural spraying equipment  Blue River s technology has aided precision agriculture by shifting farm management decisions from the field level to the plant level  Impact of Trade War The implementation of tariffs and apprehensions regarding stretched out trade talks between the United States and China have weighed on market sentiment and caused farmers to become more cautious about making major purchases  It will continue to hinder the company s results till a resolution is reached  Further  the implementation of tariffs has led to raw material cost inflation   Few Headwinds in Fiscal 2019 Deere will be affected by elevated expenses in fiscal 2019  It expects SA G expense to rise about 5  for the fiscal  R D expenses are forecasted to be up 5  in 2019 owing to strategic investments in precision agriculture as well as next generation new product development programs for large agricultural product lines  Furthermore  unfavorable impact of acquisition cost and purchase accounting related to the Wirtgen buyout will dampen earnings  The company expects an unfavorable impact of 2  for foreign currency translation for fiscal 2019

U S  China Trade OptimismChina and the United States are currently in the final stages of negotiating a trade deal  Washington is looking forward to lift almost all U S  tariffs on  200 billion worth of Chinese goods as long as China promises to protect intellectual property rights and buy significant number of American products  At the same time  Beijing is willing to offer lower tariffs and other sanctions on American products  including farm  chemical and auto Talks have now progressed significantly  which could help Chinese premier Xi Jinping and U S  President Donald Trump reach a formal agreement when they meet around Mar 27  Trump had already mentioned that the economies were  getting very  very close  to a deal  while Zhang Yesui  a spokesman for the National People s Congress  recently told reporters in Beijing that U S  and Chinese officials  have conducted fruitful and intensive consultations and made important progress on many issues of common concern  An end

buy now given that a China U S  trade deal is near  Strangely  it s the same companies that suffered the most when the trade war actually started off WalmartThe world s largest retailer Walmart Inc  should be a clear winner when the trade issues finally cool off  After all  almost three fourths of the merchandise sold in Walmart stores are manufactured in China And a 10  to 15  increase in the

company struggles to sell products overseas market due to trade tensions For instance  the 25  tariff China imposed on the U S  grown soya beans has put an end to the crop s sale in China  As a result  domestic farmers aren t interested in buying agricultural equipment including tractors and pickers from the likes of Deere  Therefore  the company will largely benefit from a halt in the tariff war Deere currently has a Zacks Rank  3  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its next quarter earnings has moved 1 9  north in the past 60 days The company s expected earnings growth rate for the current

148926,370442,DE,Why Is Deere  DE  Down 2 6  Since Last Earnings Report ,opinion,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Deere  DE   Shares have lost about 2 6  in that time frame  underperforming the S P 500 
Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is Deere due for a breakout  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers  Deere Earnings Miss  Revenues Beat Estimates in Q1 Deere   Company  NYSE DE  reported first quarter fiscal 2019  ended Jan 28  2019  adjusted earnings of  1 54 per share  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 80 by a margin of 14   However  the reported figure logged an improvement of 14  from the prior year quarter s earnings per share of  1 35  Notably  earnings improved despite the impact of material cost inflation  Further  concerns over tariffs and trade policies seem to be weighing on customer sentiment with farmers becoming cautious and subsequently delaying their equipment purchases  Including one time items  the company had incurred a loss of  1 66 in the prior year quarter  There were no adjustments in the currently reported quarter  Net sales of equipment operations  which comprise Agriculture and Turf  Construction and Forestry  came in at  6 9 billion  surging 16  year over year  Revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  6 8 billion  Total net sales  including financial services and others  came in at  7 98 billion  up 16  year over year  Operational Update Cost of sales in the reported quarter advanced 16  year over year to  5 4 billion  Gross profit in the reported quarter came in at  2 55 billion  surging 16  year over year  Selling  administrative and general expenses increased 8  year over year to  764 million  Equipment operations reported operating profit of  577 million in the quarter under review compared with  419 million in the prior year quarter  Apart from the contribution from the Wirtgen acquisition  higher shipment volumes  price realization drove results  However  these gains were partially offset by higher production costs  higher warranty related expenses and unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange  Total operating profit  including financial services  increased to  769 million from  636 million reported in the year ago quarter  Segment Performance Agriculture   Turf segment s sales were up 10  year over year to  4 7 billion  primarily driven by higher shipment volumes and price realization offset by unfavorable currency translation impact and higher warranty related expenses  Operating profit at the segment declined 10  year over year to  348 million  owing to higher production costs  improved warranty related expenses  less favorable product mix  and higher research and development expenses  These were partially mitigated by price realization and higher shipment volumes  Construction   Forestry sales increased 31  year over year to  2 26 billion from the prior year quarter  aided by the Wirtgen acquisition  higher shipment volumes and price realization  somewhat offset by unfavorable foreign exchange  This segment reported operating profit of  229 million  a significant improvement from the prior year quarter figure of  32 million  The Wirtgen acquisition contributed operating profit of  14 million in the reported quarter  Apart from it  price realization  partially offset by higher production costs and a less favorable product mix  led to the improvement in profit  Net revenues at Deere s Financial Services division totaled  855 million in the reported quarter  up 10  year over year  The segment s operating profit came in at  192

148927,370443,DE,Doves Fly As Fed Keeps Rates Unchanged  Signals Easy Policy For Rest Of Year,opinion," Wednesday Post Fed  If anyone was losing sleep about the prospect of the Fed getting more hawkish in coming months  it looks like they might be able to grab some shut eye  Today  citing slowing economic growth  the Fed held rates steady and sent strong signals that there might be no more rate hikes at all this year 
Going into the meeting  many investors had been thinking the Fed might have another 2019 hike in its pocket  but this brings that into question  The Fed s dovishness today was more pronounced than we ve seen in the recent past  and that appeared to send stocks higher and Treasury yields lower in the immediate wake of the decision  The dollar  meanwhile  tumbled to a six week low 
Most Fed officials whose estimates appeared in a new  dot plot  projecting future rates forecast no increase in 2019  The Fed also reduced its expectations for U S  economic growth and inflation and raised its projection for unemployment  None of this would appear too surprising  judging from comments Fed Chair Jerome Powell and other Fed officials have made recently about the slowing economy  and from the latest set of benign inflation data 
Though stocks initially reacted positively to the Fed announcement  it s not necessarily positive for the economy to see the Fed cut its GDP estimate for 2019 to 2 1  from 2 3   It also trimmed its Personal Consumption Expenditures  PCE  inflation forecast to 1 8  from 1 9  
The Fed said economic growth has  slowed  from Q4  and that job growth has been  solid   It previously had called job growth  strong  
 Recent indicators point to slower growth of household spending and business fixed investment in the first quarter   the Fed said in updated language from the previous statement 
Trade Situation Might Have Played Into Fed Decision
This might square with news that just came out this morning  when FedEx Corporation  NYSE FDX  reported weaker than expected earnings and sales  while reducing guidance as it cited a weak international trade situation  see more below   Seeing the Fed drop its productivity estimate for the U S  even as FDX and other companies report troubles in their international markets seems to tie many of today s stories together  especially how the trade battle with China might be hurting the economy 
In another move likely to get a close look from many investors  the Fed said it plans to start tapering its balance sheet runoff in May  ending in September  That s probably not a surprise  because the Fed foreshadowed this with comments members made in recent speeches  By slowing and then ending the balance sheet reduction  the Fed could be hoping to give the economy a little stimulus without taking the more dramatic step of lowering rates 
However  it doesn t look like all the investors out there necessarily agree that adjusting its balance sheet strategy will provide the Fed enough ammunition as the economy slows  Chances of a Fed rate cut by the end of the year quickly climbed to above 35  after the Fed decision  according to the CME futures market  The odds had been around 22  earlier this week 
Checking The Dots
Along with its statement  the Fed issued an updated  dot plot  showing where Fed officials see rates going in coming years 
What might have been surprising was the Fed s forecast not only for no change in rates this year  but for rates to be 50 basis points lower by the end of 2020 than it had forecast just three months ago  Back in December  the Fed had forecast rates to be in a range between 2 9  and 3 4  by the end of next year  Now the range is 2 4  to 2 9  
Looking at the last dot plot vs  the new one side by side  it seems pretty striking how estimates have come down  That s especially true for next year  which looks far less hawkish than expectations a few months ago 
In his post meeting press conference  Powell said weakening economies in Europe and Asia are weighing on the U S  economy 
Stocks have been on a tear thanks in part to the Fed s desire to stay  patient  and watch the data come in  At the same time  U S  benchmark 10 year Treasury yields traded near two month lows below 2 59  before the Fed s decision Wednesday  Rates have fallen from above 3 2  last fall as investors factor out chances of more Fed rate hikes and as the global economy slows  Weakness from China and Europe might both be factoring into the lower borrowing costs 
One thing investors might want to consider keeping in mind as they pore over the Fed s statement and check in on Powell s press conference is for any hint of where the Fed now sees the so called  neutral  short term rate  That s the level where the Fed believes rates aren t too tight or too loose  In December  this level ranged between 2 5  and 3 5   according to Fed officials  The Fed s benchmark rate now is between 2 25  and 2 5   If the neutral level comes down  The Wall Street Journal noted  that could imply that the Fed sees less need for future rate hikes 
President s Words On China Seem To Unsettle Markets
Before the Fed decision Wednesday  U S  stock indices took a dive as concerns grew over the tariff situation  This seemed to be driven by comments made by President Trump and reported by several media outlets that he s prepared to leave tariffs in place on Chinese goods for a  substantial amount of time  
According to The Wall Street Journal  Trump said he isn t considering removing the tariffs on China because he wants to make sure China  lives by the deal   Before today  there was hope that a deal might mean an end or at least a cut in U S  and Chinese tariffs on each others  goods 
The U S  has levied tariffs on  250 billion of Chinese goods  about half the value of all Chinese exports to the U S  Beijing has retaliated with tariffs on  110 billion of U S  goods  about 90  of what the U S  exports to China  After Trump s words  shares of some China sensitive stocks like Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  and Deere  NYSE DE  both fell  and semiconductors another area with wide exposure to China also weakened 
The rough patch for Wall Street before the Fed decision accompanied both Trump s latest words and a media report yesterday questioning progress in the negotiations  It looks like the market remains on tenterhooks regarding trade  and the FedEx  FDX  earnings this morning where the company talked about a soft international trade situation appeared to add to investors  jitters 
Stocks and Treasuries have both been steadily climbing  That s kind of an unusual situation  10 year yields are at two month lows below 2 6   while stocks surged back from early weakness Wednesday after the Fed decision 

Wild Day On Wall Street  This intraday chart for Wednesday shows the S P 500  candelstick  falling quickly on China worries before surging higher after the Fed decision  Meanwhile  the 10 year Treasury yield  purple line  fell fast as the Fed indicated more dovishness  Data Sources  S P Dow Jones Indices  Cboe  Chart source  The thinkorswim  platform from TD Ameritrade  For illustrative purposes only  Past performance does not guarantee future results 
Close Approach  Earlier this week before the Fed meeting  the S P 500 Index  SPX  briefly came within 100 points of its all time intraday high of 2940 9 posted last Sept  20  It hit 2852 Tuesday before sliding on a report of possible U S  China trade talk troubles  Some analysts are wondering if the SPX  now up more than 12  year to date  may have gotten a bit ahead of itself with the sharp rally since Christmas Eve  The rally has stretched the forward price to earnings  P E  ratio to around 16 3 on the S P 500  FactSet reported  up from holiday lows below 14  While the P E is now below the five year average  it s well above the 10 year average 
It looks like some investors began getting comfortable with a higher P E once the Fed announced its intention to retreat on rate hikes earlier this year  at least judging from market action  However  if investors see any signs of hawkishness in the Fed s language that just got released  the higher P E could come into question  That s also taking into account that analysts widely expect Q1 earnings to fall year over year  and also that the China trade situation another factor where optimism has arguably helped lead the P E higher remains unresolved 
Dollar Watch  The Fed s retreat from rate hikes might be one factor keeping the Dollar Index a bit soft this week  In the hours before the Fed meeting concluded  the Dollar Index traded near 96 40  down from highs above 97 6 earlier this month  The dollar has been oscillating a bit but staying in a relatively tight range between about 95 and 97 5 over the last three months  A dovish Fed policy might normally be associated with a weaker dollar  but the dollar could also be drawing some strength from worries about U S  China trade  Brexit  and Europe s slowing economy 
At its current level  the dollar is near the middle of a longer term range between roughly 89 and 103 over the last three years  Some U S  multinationals have reported the dollar weighing on international sales  but it doesn t seem to be at levels yet that would necessarily cause major problems 
Crude Conditions  The dollar s recent bout of weakness might be helping crude oil a bit  Crude  which is priced in dollars  tends to move inversely to the dollar  Crude futures appeared to get another jolt of bullish buying earlier Wednesday and briefly topped  60 a barrel for the first time since November after the U S  government reported a much bigger than expected weekly inventory draw of 9 6 million barrels  U S  crude oil inventories are about 2  below the five year average for this time of year  the government said  and gasoline inventories also fell pretty dramatically 
On the one hand  this is arguably good news  It seems to imply that the U S  economy is spinning along pretty well  something that might also be seen from recent strong data elsewhere  On another note  it might be evidence of just how dependent the economy is getting on higher U S  crude production  The U S  produced 12 1 million barrels of oil a day last week  near all time highs and up from 10 4 million a day last year at this time  It s kind of interesting to think about where crude prices might be without that extra 1 7 million barrels a day of U S  production year over year  especially with OPEC continuing to produce at a reduced level  OPEC production is down around 1 5 million barrels a day from its 2017 average  It s also a bit alarming to think of just how pricey oil might be now if U S  production had never moved up from historic lows of around 5 million barrels a day back in the years between 2005 and 2008

148950,370466,DE,Deere shareholders run for the exits following mixed Q2,news,"Investing com   Deere   Company  NYSE DE  shares were crashing on high trading volumes on Friday as traders ran for the exits following the company s second quarter results and ensuing analyst downgrade 
Deere reported in the pre market session Friday that it earned more than analysts were expecting in the second quarter while revenue was a miss  Net income rose to  641 8 million  or  1 97 a share  from  488 8 million  or  1 55 a share  in the same period a year ago  The result also surpassed the FactSet consensus for EPS of  1 93  Total revenue rose to  7 81 billion from  6 72 billion but missed the consensus of   7 90 billion  
The company noted that agriculture and turf sales rose 13  to  5 34 billion  below the FactSet consensus of  5 42 billion  Construction and forestry revenue jumped 29  to  1 50 billion  in line with expectations 
Even though the results were mixed  traders sold off their holdings  Shares were down just over 5  in afternoon trading  7 84 million shares had changed hands as of midday Friday  more than triple the typical daily average  Shares have staged a very good performance this year  climbing 20  as of Thursday s closing bell 
Commenting on the result  in a note Baird analyst Mircea Dobre cut his rating to Neutral from outperform since Oct  31  and dropped his stock price target by  10 to   130   The stock had a good run  it s about to get tougher going forward   Dobre wrote ",2017-08-18,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/deere-shareholders-run-for-the-exits-following-mixed-q2-520221,520221
148951,370467,DE,Collect 200  SPX Above Key Moving Average As Geopolitical Optimism Surges,opinion," Wednesday Market Open  Stocks around the world are swimming in a sea of green Wednesday morning as optimism continues to grow about possible resolutions to some of the major geopolitical issues haunting the markets  The S P 500 Index  SPX  starts the day above its 200 day moving average for the first time in more than two months 
A double dose of good news got the U S  market back on a positive track Tuesday after several days of malaise  and the U S  gains spread overseas to Europe and Asia early Wednesday  Stocks are reacting to hopes for a deal to potentially avoid a government shutdown this weekend  along with the potential for a looser deadline for China trade negotiations  President Trump said Tuesday he might let the early March deadline slip if progress is being made  Talks between the two countries resume this week  and there were media reports early Wednesday that China s President Xi might meet with U S  negotiators 
Early Wednesday  The Wall Street Journal reported that the president is expected to sign a congressional deal on border security  which would keep the government open after Friday s deadline 
The SPX is now at its highest level since early December  and boasts a three day winning streak  while the Dow Jones Industrial Average   DJI  and Nasdaq  COMP  ride seven week win streaks of their own 
As investors digested the new developments affecting two of the major global storylines  volatility eased  However  other risk meters remained slightly elevated  as gold rose on Tuesday and U S  Treasuries barely moved off of recent highs  From those indications  it might appear that at least some investors are keeping a little powder dry for now  perhaps because geopolitical events tend to change so quickly  The 10 year Treasury note yield remains under its year ago level despite the recent strong stock rally  though a dovish Fed might explain some of that 
Fresh data landed on investors  desks early Wednesday when the U S  government reported consumer price data for January  The headline consumer price index  CPI  reading was flat  while core CPI which strips out food and energy rose 0 2   in line with expectations 
Declining energy prices were offset by rises in food and shelter costs  the Labor Department said  Headline inflation rose just 1 6  year over year  the lowest since June 2017  Core inflation rose 2 2   the same reading as November and December 
At first glance  the data didn t seem to show much  if anything  for inflation hawks to get excited over  The consensus projections heading into the report had been for an overall reading of 0 1  and a core rise of 0 2   according to Briefing com 
Headline Risk Hasn t Gone Away
Investors might want to consider that there s also the potential for things to turn on a dime with any of the geopolitical stories  Yesterday  the news was good  Today or perhaps tomorrow  a headline could change the market s positive tone  It really becomes about the story of the day  Any rumor on how China U S  negotiations are doing has the potential to color the entire tone of any given session 
Another factor to potentially keep an eye on is the sector standings  Yesterday saw a lot of strength in  risk on  areas like financials and industrials  If investors remain generally optimistic about the global stage  it wouldn t be too surprising to see this sort of sector emphasis continue  One way to possibly measure the market s degree of concern  especially about the China situation  is to watch the performance of so called  defensive  sectors like utilities  health care and staples  as well as volatility and the dollar  Any strength in these areas might reflect renewed worries 
Early Wednesday  the dollar index resumed its recent climb and rose back above 96 80  Recent dollar strength appears to reflect weakness in Asian and European economies  as well as worries about Brexit  The greenback rally  if it continues  could potentially begin to weigh on U S  stocks  However  the SPX and the dollar have been marching upward in sync over the last month or so 
Activision Blizzard  Cisco Among Earnings Highlights
Earnings season is still humming along as well  and Activision Blizzard  NASDAQ ATVI  reported late yesterday  Shares of the video game company rose more than 3  in pre market trading despite the fact that it missed analysts  revenue estimates and put out lower than expected guidance  It s possible that the stock is reacting to word that ATVI plans a stock buyback and cost cuts  analysts said 
Earnings season continues after the close today with Cisco  NASDAQ CSCO   Investors might want to listen to CSCO executives for any hint at how Asian sales are going  and for any discussion of how the company might be affected if the U S  and China resume their tariff battle 
Deere  NYSE DE  is another big multinational stock reporting earnings later this week  Walmart  NYSE WMT  steps to the plate early next week 
Back Above 200 For SPX
It might be interesting to watch over the next day or two whether the SPX can hold these gains above the 200 day average  which now stands at around 2743  It s topped that technical level a few times in recent months  but never for long  An extended string of closes above the 200 day could potentially be another positive sign 
With the SPX closing just a point above the 200 day on Tuesday  perhaps we re at an inflection point  Last week  the SPX challenged the technical resistance here and then pulled back  Today and the rest of the week have the potential to show if investors are ready to push the SPX into higher ground above that mark 

Figure 1  ECLIPSING 200  The S P 500 Index  candlestick  finally eclipsed its 200 day moving average  blue line  again Tuesday  by one point  closing above that level for the first time in two months  Some analysts might see this as a positive development from a technical perspective  Data Source  S P Dow Jones Indices  Chart source  The thinkorswim  platform from TD Ameritrade  For illustrative purposes only  Past performance does not guarantee future results 
What s Driving Transports  One metric that s been galloping higher lately is the Dow Jones Transportation   DJT   which motored its way to 1 25  gains Monday and 1 3  gains Tuesday  The rails contributed to Monday s strength  especially Norfolk Southern  NYSE NSC   Shares of NSC rose more than 3  after the company outlined cost cutting and operational efficiency plans at an investor conference 
We just saw airlines post a great earnings season with many companies saying the cost of energy isn t slowing them down  Rails conceivably get the same benefit  and are seeing great traffic  They re also benefiting from a positive price environment where they ve seen the ability to charge more  If you ask anyone who s been around the markets for a long time  they ll likely tell you that when transports do well  the market does well  That s not always the case  but transports tend to do best when the economy thrives  and this could be another sign of economic strength  The low price of crude is something the transportation sector has really been eating up 
Additional Financial Sector M A Seen Challenging  Earlier this week  we mentioned additional bank merger and acquisition activity as a possible spark for the sector following last week s merger between SunTrust  NYSE STI  and BB T  NYSE BBT   However  some argue it would be a change of pace if M A does pick up among financials  As Barron s pointed out recently  the environment in some ways just doesn t favor M A  despite competition among banks and rising technology costs that might have you think mergers could make sense  For one thing  Barron s said  suitable partners are rare  and top banks are so big that regulators might cast a fish eye on anything that potentially makes them bigger  Also  pickings just seem kind of slim  In 1984  there were 14 450 commercial banks  and that s fallen to 4 746  Today  Barron s notes  roughly 56  of assets in the U S  are controlled by the top five banks 
Name Your Price  A year ago  it seemed like every new data point had the potential to cause a mini panic over how the Fed might react  Remember  for instance  how volatility spiked and stock prices crashed early last year after annual wage growth came in higher than expected in the January jobs report  sparking concerns that the Fed might get more hawkish  Now  with the Fed seemingly on pause for a while  it s perhaps a little easier for some investors to sit back and watch the numbers roll in without having to keep a nervous eye on the VIX 
Tomorrow sees release of producer prices for January ahead of the open  According to the Briefing com consensus  analysts expect the headline number to rise 0 1  and core PPI to be up 0 2   compared to negative numbers in December  A lot of the softness then was driven by falling energy prices  which weren t so big a factor in January  However  processed and finished goods for intermediate demand also fell in the final month of 2018  maybe a sign that producer inflation might be moderating in general meaning not just an energy story  Meanwhile  the Fed needle isn t budging much  with futures trading predicting less than 4  chances for a March rate hike and about 7  for a June hike

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of  14 44   A quarter ago  it was expected that this agricultural equipment manufacturer would post earnings of  2 44 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 30  delivering a surprise of  5 74  
Over the last four quarters  the company has not been able to surpass consensus EPS estimates 
Deere  which belongs to the Zacks Manufacturing   Farm Equipment industry  posted revenues of  6 94 billion for the quarter ended January 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 87   This compares to year ago revenues of  5 97 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Deere shares have added about 8 9  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 9 5  
What s Next for Deere 
While Deere has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately

Heading into today  shares of the agricultural equipment manufacturer had gained 6 06  over the past month  lagging the Industrial Products sector s gain of 9 85  and the S P 500 s gain of 8 01  in that time 
Wall Street will be looking for positivity from DE as it approaches its next earnings report date  This is expected to be February 15  2019  The company is expected to report EPS of  1 80  up 37 4  from the prior year quarter  Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of  6 89 billion  up 15 38  from the year ago period 
DE s full year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of  11 44 per share and revenue of  35 95 billion  These results would represent year over year changes of  21 83  and  7 79   respectively 
Any recent changes to analyst estimates for DE should also be noted by investors  These revisions help to show the ever changing nature of near term business trends  With this in mind  we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company s business outlook 
Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near term share price momentum  Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank  This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple  actionable rating system 
The Zacks Rank system  which ranges from  1  Strong Buy  to  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive outside audited track record of outperformance  with  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  Over the past month  the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0 03  higher  DE is currently a Zacks Rank  3  Hold

148982,370498,DE,Deere  DE  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Deere  DE  reports results for the quarter ended January 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 15  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This agricultural equipment manufacturer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 80 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  37 4  
Revenues are expected to be  6 89 billion  up 15 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 21  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Deere 
For Deere  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  3 40  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Deere will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Deere would post earnings of  2 44 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 30  delivering a surprise of  5 74  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Deere doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-02-07,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/deere-de-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200385796,200385796

Britain  which on Thursday freed up an extra 23 billion pounds   28 6 billion  to invest in rail  telecoms and housing infrastructure   all good news for machinery makers  It is still early days in the recovery  For example  U S  heavy equipment maker  Caterpillar   N CAT  did not have booths at the Shanghai show this year   a contrast with 2012  when it filled a hall with a 12 000 square metre display  But after one of the grimmest years in decades  other signs are rosier  Beyond Shanghai  John Deere  N DE   Japan s Komatsu  T 6301  and others have given cautiously positive outlooks in recent weeks  And Caterpillar itself last week reported a third consecutive month of sales growth in Asia  driven by China  and said it sees growth ahead in 2017   if Chinese government support for projects continues   Most see growth in other parts of Asia too  as Chinese construction firms go into southeast Asia or Pakistan  A weak yuan   it has fallen 6 percent against the dollar so far this year   will also make Chinese companies more competitive internationally    Business confidence is coming back    and  firms  are starting to see some good results   Karin Sun  Beijing based senior consultant at Off Highway Research  said in reference to China   Chen Dewei  vice general manager of excavator and wheel loader maker Fujian Jingong Machinery in southern China  said his company has been able to trim inventories to what he called a  reasonable  level  He said it planned to spend a few hundred million yuan in January to open a factory in Jiangsu province  which is a province north of Shanghai  that will increase its manufacturing capacity by 30 percent  The facility  initially planned in 2011  had been mothballed amid the industry slump   From our company s perspective this industry is slowly warming up    Our new products have also performed well in the last few years providing us with the conditions we need to open a northern base   he said  Still  many are wary about predicting the strength of the recovery  Even a recovery  said one executive at Shandong Lingong Construction Machinery  will not be the same as before   Chinese companies are smarter now  we won t manufacture in large quantities like last time   Liugong s Beatenbough was among those taking a cautious view   Some of us have been in the industry long enough in other parts of the world that we ve

149028,370544,DE,Deere  DE  Stock Slides Ahead Of Earnings  What To Expect,opinion,"Shares of Deere   Company   NYSE DE   slid 2 7  during regular trading hours Tuesday  the last session before the agricultural equipment maker is scheduled to release its latest quarterly earnings results  Deere s losses outpaced losses seen by broader indexes in what was a tough day for many stocks  underscoring Wall Street s nervousness about the company s report 
Deere   Co  is the parent company of John Deere  one of the most iconic brands in agriculture  Deere s core business is farm equipment  but it also sells construction and forestry equipment and provides financial services to borrowing customers 
Shares of Deere   Co  are down roughly 10  on the year ahead of its report  largely due to industry specific headwinds  Notably  the agriculture business has been hampered by supply and demand issues evidenced by low stocks to use ratios in key crops and global trade concerns  Deere has thus far said that replacement demand is outweighing tariff pressure  but whether that trend can hold up is unclear 
Moreover  Deere has grappled with elevated expenses throughout the current fiscal year  Management said this is a result of an unfavorable product mix  higher overhead  and increased incentive compensation 
Deere still has time to turn things around and end the year positive  however  An excellent earnings report tomorrow would certainly help in that task  Let s take a closer look at the market s expectations to see how likely that is Deere   Company Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Earnings Outlook
Deere   Co  will report it fiscal 2018 fourth quarter financial results before the opening bell on Wednesday morning  Here s what analysts are expecting  according to our latest Zacks Consensus Estimates 
Earnings  Deere is projected to report earnings of  2 43 per share  which would represent year over year growth of 54 8   There has been one positive revision to these estimates within the past week  lifting the consensus by a penny 
Positive estimates just ahead of a report are generally a bullish indicator  but a number of negative revisions to next quarter and next year estimates have dragged the stock to a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   Moreover  our Most Accurate Estimate a metric that averages the most recent estimates sits at  3 36  about 2 7  lower than the consensus 
Despite a positive revision in the past week  recently issued estimates have likely not been upbeat 
Revenue  Analysts have Deere s revenue for the quarter pegged at  8 59 billion  This would represent growth of 21 1  from the  7 09 billion recorded in the prior year quarter  Full year revenue is expected to total  33 7 billion 
Bottom Line
The earnings trend for Deere has been mixed ahead of its report  and the stock has already struggled in the face of several specific headwinds this year  This market basically demands a strong beat and raise quarter if a stock wants to see an uptick in the immediate aftermath of a report  so the pressure is on Deere to deliver 
There s no saying that the company can t impress Wall Street tomorrow  but some trends look to be stacking against the company

U S  stocks were in the green on Wednesday morning  as Wall Street hoped to rebound from its worst start to Thanksgiving week in decades  The Dow and S P 500 erased their year to date gains on Tuesday  and the latter of those two key benchmarks posted its worst two day open to the short holiday week since 1973 
Part of today s rebound was fueled by more positive results from the retail sector  Foot Locker   NYSE FL    for instance  saw its stock soar after reporting better than expected earnings and revenue  The athletic retailer also notched comps growth of nearly 3  and issued upbeat guidance for the full year 
Investors were also sending Gap   NYSE GPS   shares higher after its report  The retail umbrella company saw strong numbers at Old Navy and Banana Republic  which was enough to send its stock higher after a tough year  There are still question marks about the namesake brand  and guidance was light  but investors responded optimistically today 
Another major earnings report today was from agriculture equipment giant Deere   Co    NYSE DE    The parent company of John Deere posted shaky number  missing estimates on the top and bottom line and issuing relatively muted revenue guidance 
Nevertheless  shares of Deere rallied into the green after the company s conference call  perhaps suggesting that investors are in the mood to start buying again after a difficult stretch for the broader market

149042,370558,DE,John Deere announces the layoff of 100 manufacturing employees,news,"Investing com    Deere   Company  N DE   the parent company of tractor manufacturer John Deere  announced on Friday that it is laying off approximately 100 manufacturing employees  effective on April 1 
John Deere  an Iowa based manufacturer of agricultural  construction and forestry machinery  said the layoffs will occur at two of its factories in the state   located in Davenport and Dubuque  Both facilities are part of the company s forestry and construction divisions  Roughly four fifths of the layoffs will take place at the company s John Deere Davenport Works Facility  while the remaining workers will come from a unit in nearby Dubuque  
 The layoffs reflect the company s ongoing efforts to balance the size of its manufacturing workforce with market demand for products at individual factories   John Deere said in a statement  
Last week  John Deere said its first quarter earnings fell 34  to  254 4 million  amid weakening demand in equipment sales  Net profits among its Construction and Forestry segment declined by 23   as a result of lower shipment volumes and the negative impacts from foreign exchange translation  Moving forward  the company expects equipment sales to decline 8  in the second quarter and approximately 10  for the year as a whole  
 John Deere s first quarter results reflected the continuing impact of the downturn in the global farm economy as well as weakness in construction equipment markets   John Deere CEO Samuel Allen said in a statement  
In November  John Deere informed 220 employees at a Seeding and Cylinder facility in Moline  Illinois  that they were being placed on indefinite leave in early 2016  amid forecasts for declining agricultural sales

149051,370567,DE,Deere  DE  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"The market expects Deere  DE  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended October 2018  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on November 21  2018  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This agricultural equipment manufacturer is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 42 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  54 1  
Revenues are expected to be  8 59 billion  up 21 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 76  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Deere 
For Deere  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 55  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Deere will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Deere would post earnings of  2 77 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 59  delivering a surprise of  6 50  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Deere appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2018-11-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/deere-de-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200359184,200359184

149066,370582,DE,Machinery makers smell opportunity as China s farms think big,news,"By Dominique Patton BEIJING  Reuters    The world s largest makers of tractors and combines are finding a rare opportunity for growth in China despite a sharp slowdown in the world s No  2 economy  with big farm machines in demand as the rural labor force shrinks and plot sizes grow  For manufacturers like U S  based AGCO  N AGCO  and Deere   Co  N DE  and Italy s  CNH Industrial   MI CNHI   Chinese demand for big machines could help to offset weakness in North America and Europe  where farm incomes are declining with global commodity prices  The trend also contrasts with stalling sales in construction equipment and passenger cars  which have been hit by the slowing Chinese economy  Driving this binge on bigger  more powerful equipment to till larger farms is a combination of labor migration to the cities  land reforms and government subsidies that is spurring consolidation of the country s vast small landholdings   People are just getting ready   said Alexious Lee  head of China industrial research at investment bank CLSA  pointing to the widespread move towards larger farms   Whether from the dealers or the financing side  everyone is skewing towards this angle   The average farm in China was smaller than a football field in 2012  but still nearly 900 000  family farms  had an average size of 13 3 hectares  33 acres   according to data from China s agriculture ministry  While these family plots were still less than a tenth of the average U S  farm  further expansions in size are expected as Beijing urges more efficient agriculture and takes steps towards reforming land rights   Several thousand state and co op farms of about 3 500 hectares each also need bigger tractors and combines to cultivate and harvest their agribusiness size plots   Total sales of 100 129 horsepower  hp  tractors in China increased 38 percent in the first half of 2015 compared with the same period last year  according to AGCO  owner of the Massey Ferguson brand  And even though overall farm equipment sales for AGCO and others in China were flat through the first half of the year  long term prospects look brighter  Asia Pacific accounted for only 5 percent of AGCO s  9 7 billion in revenues last year  but the company   which recently opened its fifth factory in China   is targeting  1 billion in sales from the overall region before 2020 and expects its China business to quadruple by then   CO OPS AND SUBSIDIES The slowdown in agricultural sales in the United States and other markets is probably too big for China to counter alone  although CNH International expects  significant acceleration  in the country overall  said Luca Mainardi  head of agriculture construction operations in China for CNH International    The main growth is from cooperatives  which have been growing rapidly in number the last five years thanks to Chinese government support   Mainardi said  CNH sells tractors of 140 230 hp in China  the high end of the market  and just started producing combines there  Mainardi reckons there could be about 5 000 co op farms in China  with their number growing by 15 20 percent each year   Subsidies   which can cover up to 30 40 percent of the cost of a tractor or give incentives for deep ploughing   have also encouraged rapid gains in mechanization in a sector still dominated by the lower horsepower tractors and other machinery used on smaller farms    There are a lot of subsidies  and with a bigger land area you get more efficiency and more income   said Zhao Shuanzhen  director of the Gaocheng Zengshou Agricultural Machinery Service Cooperative in Hebei province  Zhao s cooperative originally only leased equipment and services to farms across China  but since 2011 has also been farming on its own account  and now rents 40 hectares from more than 100 households   The co op has more than 200 wheat harvesters   including more than 30 it bought this year   180 tractors and 24 corn harvesters  almost all of them domestic brands   If our land area was bigger  we might consider buying some good  foreign  equipment   said Zhao   Foreign players now account for an estimated 80 percent of the high horsepower market  although they can expect to face greater competition from local counterparts in the future

Though the shares have regained the bulk of that loss in the meantime  the message from investors was clear   It s not a case of  What have you done for me lately    but something more like  What are you going to do for me going forward  This attitude was on display again Friday  in the opposite direction  as John Deere  reported disappointing fiscal Q2 earnings of  3 14 share  missing the Zacks Consensus estimate of  3 33 share  and revenues of  9 75B  basically in line with estimates 
Deere share rallied sharply on Friday to  155  up  8 59 or 6  on the day 
Higher materials and freight costs were the culprit for the earnings shortfall  Deere is a major consumer of steel and freight services rely on petroleum products  both of which have been more expensive of late 
Sales to the Agricultural sector are about 80  of Deere s revenues and the report references rising prices and accelerating future estimates for U S  grains  Corn  Wheat and Soybeans   yet higher costs are impacting the bottom line for farmers  with net cash income for producers expected to fall in 2018  despite the higher sales prices 
Though financial metrics presented by Deere were somewhat mixed  the company provided an optimistic forecast  projecting full year adjusted earnings of  3 1B  up from the prior guidance of  2 85B

149114,370630,DE,Deere Q1 Earnings Preview  Despite  Pre Buying   A Slow Quarter ,news,"By    Deere   Company  NYSE DE   maker of the iconic green farm tractors  is expected to see net income drop about 13 percent in its fiscal 2014 first quarter as weak crop prices slashed agricultural demand  offsetting a slight increase in construction equipment sales  Results also will suffer in comparison to an unusually strong year earlier quarter 
Analysts expect the Moline  Ill   manufacturer  which reports fiscal 2014 first quarter results Wednesday before markets open  to book net income of  562 87 million  or  1 55 per share  compared with  649 70 million  or  1 65 per share  Excluding one time events  earnings per share will be  1 52 compared with  1 65 
Revenue will decline 2 5 percent to  6 62 billion from  6 79 billion in the year earlier November through January period  
John Deere commercial vehicles are seen at a dealer in Longmont  Colorado Reuters
 We re coming off a major bull market   said William Blair   Co  analyst Lawrence De Maria   Prices are lower and the market is slowing  
The fate of John Deere  one of the largest manufacturers of agricultural and construction equipment  has always been tied to North American farmers    who have had a tough first fiscal quarter following a positive 2013  
After a major drought in 2012  farmers received large insurance payments and spent accordingly  In the first quarter of last year Deere s earnings jumped 26 9 percent from the same period a year earlier  
But in the past few month the price of crops such as soybeans and wheat fell due to a global oversupply  Lowering demand for ethanol hasn t helped corn prices  either  Cash is short  and farmers simply aren t buying what they did last year  
   Prices of key crops have been declining in recent months thanks to a global surplus    USDA   John Deere  
Meanwhile  rules took effect in January that made farmers less likely to purchase equipment  
Starting in 2014  American and European governments have new regulations on emissions on certain types of engines  The environmentally friendly versions are more expensive to manufacture  and these costs get passed on to customers  Meanwhile  a certain section of IRS code that once allowed farmers up to  500 000 of tax deductions from equipment purchases has been changed to just  25 000    another deterrent to purchasing that took effect this year  
Though this didn t bode well for January  it probably caused a spike in December sales    as customers sought to  pre buy  equipment before the more expensive versions hit the market  
Analysts from Goldman Sachs wrote in a note that this might result in a  near term upside  for Deere  but it isn t enough to offset declining farmer returns and high levels of inventory at company dealers  Plus  it s likely that farmers bought more equipment than they needed at the time  which doesn t augur well for the rest of the year  either  
The company also has a large construction sector  which is in better shape  but still presents a challenge  
 It s going to be difficult to say  because the weather was so bad  and their construction business is really all North America   said Adam Fleck of Morningstar  But the big picture for construction in the Novermber through January fiscal quarter is likely to be positive  as the American economy edged slowly forward  
 Deere s construction machinery business will benefit from improved U S  construction spending in the near term   wrote Fleck in an note    
The company mainly operates in the United States and Canada but also has substantial operations abroad  which means economic and political changes in South America and Europe are keenly felt  
 If you look at the sales in Brazil for January  they were down sharply from a year ago   said Fleck  citing a recent jump in Brazilian interest rates after government run financing in the past few months  
Meanwhile  Europe represents about 20 percent of Deere s revenue and could also make a mark on sales in the company s fiscal first quarter  
 While European economic weakness does not present a critical risk for Deere  renewed global headwinds could lead to equipment sales declines  dealer inventory destocking and credit challenges for Deere s financial services industry   wrote Fleck in a Nov  20 note   
Deere s first quarter of fiscal 2014 is not likely to be its last challenging quarter of the fiscal year 
 It s looking under pressure   said Eli Lustgarten  a senior research analyst at Longbow Securities   The expectation is that the year will become more problematic as it goes on  ",2014-02-11,International Business Times,"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/deere-q1-earnings-preview:-despite-'pre-buying,'-a-slow-quarter-265600",265600

to expand in March  The Philadelphia Fed manufacturing index slipped to 22 3 from 25 8 in February  But  the gauge remained well above zero  which indicates improving conditions  In fact  the survey found out that nearly 37  of the manufacturers felt that the conditions have improved over the month while only 14  reported that conditions have worsened The indices for current new orders and shipments showed notable improvement this month  The survey showed that the current new orders index went up 11 points  with 52  of the responding firms reporting an uptick in new orders  Similarly  the index that measures the quantity of goods shipped increased 17 points New York Manufacturing Index Trends HigherManufacturing activity has also been growing in New York State this month  the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said in its latest news release  The Empire State manufacturing index that had been lagging Philly  climbed to a reading of 22 5 from 13 1 in February  The survey showed that 38  of respondents reported felt manufacturing activity had improved  while 15  felt drop in such activity  The new orders index increased 3 points to 16 8 and the shipments index rose 15 points to 27  Not only had this reading show strong growth in the regional manufacturing hub  firms are also optimistic about future business prospects and capital spending plans  remain strong   added the New York Fed  Factories See Fastest Growth Since May 2004Broader manufacturing activities  in fact  expanded at the fastest pace in February since May 2004  as per figures from the Institute for Supply Management  ISM   Improving global economies and firm business investment helped factories expand at a record pace  This expansion comes on the heels of a pickup in consumer spending levels  After all  consumer outlays increased at the fastest pace in the fourth quarter in more than a year The factory index went up 1 7 points to 60 8 in February from 59 1 in the prior month  while measures of new orders dropped to 64 2 from 65 4  However  any reading above 50 indicates expansion  Overall  15 out of 18 manufacturing industries expended last month  mostly led by machinery  printing and primary metals Manufacturers Are Hiring Manufacturers also kept adding jobs at a faster pace than the rest of the economy  They have added 222 000 new jobs last year  resuming a recovery that had paused in 2015 and 2016  Recently  the ISM report showed that the employment gauge hit a four month high of 59 7 in February from 54 2 in the prior month Manufacturers  in the meantime  are paying better than other jobs  Average weekly earnings for production and non supervisory employees came in at  900 55 last month  more than  757 12 for the private sector taken together  Lest we forget  job additions in the manufacturing sector have a multiplier effect as it invariably leads to other jobs  Thus  a booming manufacturing sector bodes well for the overall economy Will Trade War Hit Manufacturers The manufacturing sector  however  has been under some pressure owing to Trump s tariff plans  Trump has slapped tariffs worth  60 billion on Chinese imports  while similar taxes have been imposed on all foreign steel and aluminum items But  Peter Navarro  the top adviser on international economic exchanges  boosted confidence by saying that  Trump s tough approach to global trade will not necessarily provoke retaliation from trading partners   Moreover  Trump s new top economic adviser  Larry Kudlow could help the United States avoid a trade war  Kudlow is primarily known for his free trade views and is a more moderate voice in the White House 5 Top PicksIt will  therefore  be prudent to invest in fundamentally sound manufacturing stocks that can make the most of the promising trend  We have  thus  selected five such companies that carry a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  Applied Industrial Technologies  Inc    NYSE AIT   distributes industrial products

149124,370640,DE,Deere to lay off more than 600 at four U S  plants,news," Reuters    Deere   Co  the world s largest maker of farm equipment  said it would indefinitely lay off more than 600 employees at plants in Illinois  Iowa and Kansas as falling grain prices hurt demand for tractors  harvesters and other agricultural machinery 
The company reported a 5 percent drop in third quarter sales on Wednesday and cut its full year profit forecast 
Deere had about 67 000 full time employees as of Oct  31  2013  of which about 33 900 were in the United States and Canada 
The layoffs are at plants in Moline and East Moline  Illinois  Ankeny  Iowa  and Coffeyville  Kansas 
Deere  whose shares were little changed at  84 90 in early trading on Friday  said it would also implement seasonal and inventory adjustment shutdowns at the affected plants that would result in temporary layoffs 
The company operated 26 plants in the United States and Canada as of Oct  31  of which 17 primarily make agriculture and turf equipment  Deere also makes construction and forestry equipment 
The U S  Department of Agriculture has forecast record U S  corn and soybean crops this year   a prospect that has sent prices plummeting and discouraged farmers from buying equipment 
Up to Thursday s close  Deere s stock had fallen 6 percent this year  It fell about 2 percent on Wednesday

149127,370643,DE,As U S  farm cycle turns  tractor makers may suffer longer than farmers,news,"By James B  Kelleher  CHICAGO  Reuters    Farm equipment makers insist the sales slump they face this year because of lower crop prices and farm incomes will be short lived  Yet there are signs the downturn may last longer than tractor and harvester makers  including Deere   Co  N DE   are letting on and the pain could persist long after corn  soybean and wheat prices rebound   Farmers and analysts say the elimination of government incentives to buy new equipment  a related overhang of used tractors  and a reduced commitment to biofuels  all darken the outlook for the sector beyond 2019   the year the U S  Department of Agriculture says farm incomes will begin to rise again   Company executives are not so pessimistic    Yes commodity prices and farm income are lower but they re still at historically high levels   says Martin Richenhagen  the president and chief executive of Duluth  Georgia based Agco Corp  N AGCO   which makes Massey Ferguson and Challenger brand tractors and harvesters   Farmers like Pat Solon  who grows corn and soybeans on a 1 500 acre Illinois farm  however  sound far less upbeat   Solon says corn would need to rise to at least  4 25 a bushel from below  3 50 now for growers to feel confident enough to start buying new equipment again  As recently as 2012  corn fetched  8 a bushel   Such a bounce appears even less likely since Thursday  when the U S  Department of Agriculture cut its price estimates for the current corn crop to  3 20  3 80 a bushel from earlier  3 55  4 25  The revision prompted Larry De Maria  an analyst at William Blair  to warn  a perfect storm for a severe farm recession  may be brewing   SHOPPING SPREE  The impact of bin busting harvests   driving down prices and farm incomes around the globe and depressing machinery makers  worldwide sales   is aggravated by other problems   Farmers bought far more equipment than they needed during the last upturn  which began in 2007 when the U S  government    jumping on the global biofuel bandwagon    ordered energy firms to blend increasing amounts of corn based ethanol with gasoline   Grain and oilseed prices surged and farm income more than doubled to  131 billion last year from  57 4 billion in 2006  according to USDA   Flush with cash  farmers went shopping   A lot of people were buying new equipment to keep up with their neighbors   Solon said   It was a matter of want  not need    Adding to the frenzy  U S  incentives allowed growers buying new equipment to shave as much as  500 000 off their taxable income through bonus depreciation and other credits    For the last few years  financial advisers have been telling farmers   You can buy a piece of equipment  use it for a year  sell it back and get all your money out   says Eli Lustgarten at Longbow Research   While it lasted  the distorted demand brought fat profits for equipment makers  Between 2006 and 2013  Deere s net income more than doubled to  3 5 billion   But with grain prices down  the tax incentives gone  and the future of ethanol mandate in doubt  demand has tanked and dealers are stuck with unsold used tractors and harvesters   Their shares under pressure  the equipment makers have started to react  In August  Deere said it was laying off more than 1 000 workers and temporarily idling several plants  Its rivals  including CNH Industrial NV  MI CNHI  and Agco  are expected to follow suit   Investors trying to understand how deep the downturn could be may consider lessons from another industry tied to global commodity prices  mining equipment manufacturing   Companies like Caterpillar Inc   N CAT  saw a big jump in sales a few years back when China led demand sent the price of industrial commodities soaring   But when commodity prices retreated  investment in new equipment plunged  Even today    with mine production recovering along with copper and iron ore prices    Caterpillar says sales to the industry continue to tumble as miners  sweat  the machines they already own   The lesson  De Maria says  is that farm machinery sales could suffer for years   even if grain prices rebound because of bad weather or other changes in supply   Some argue  however  the pessimists are wrong    Yes  the next few years are going to be ugly   says Michael Kon  a senior equities analyst at the Golub Group  a California investment firm that recently took a stake in Deere    But over the long run  demand for food and agricultural commodities is going to grow and farmers in major markets like China  Russia and Brazil will continue to mechanize  Machinery manufacturers will benefit from both those trends    In the meantime  though  growers continue to flock to showrooms lured by what Mark Nelson  who grows corn  soybeans and wheat on 2 000 acres in Kansas  characterizes as  shocking  bargains on used equipment   Earlier this month  Nelson traded in his Deere combine with 1 000 hours on it for one with just 400 hours on it  The difference in price between the two machines was just over  100 000   and the dealer offered to lend Nelson that sum interest free through 2017

149140,370656,DE,Earnings Season Ain t Over  3 Stocks Likely To Beat Estimates This Week,opinion,"Stocks opened lower on Tuesday morning  suggesting that celebrations over the end of the recent sell off may have been premature  Markets looked prime to bounce back strong from their worst week in two years after Monday s strong gains  but investors have again been reminded that volatility appears to be back in play 
What is most interesting about the recent market volatility is that it comes on the back of a strong earnings season  Critics will point to large disparities between GAAP and non GAAP results created by one time tax reform charges as a reason to be skeptical  but revenue growth was truly impressive  and guidance was encouraging across the board 
We have certainly moved past the busy stretch of Q4 earnings season  but a few marquee reports are still trickling in  Athletic retail giant Under Armour   NYSE UAA   just announced its latest results this morning  and tech giants like Cisco Systems   NASDAQ CSCO   and Applied Materials   NASDAQ AMAT   are expected later this week 
With that said  one of the best ways for investors to avoid the possibility of continued volatility over the next few trading periods is to target companies that are likely to outperform earnings estimates  Luckily  Zacks Premium customers can utilize the  in order to search for stocks that are expected to beat 
This is done because  generally speaking  when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release  it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago 
A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat  In fact  our 10 year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70  of the time 
Today  we are giving our readers a very special treat  a free look at three of the strongest stocks that are popping up on our Earnings ESP Screener right now  Check them out 
1        Warrior Met Coal  Inc     NYSE HCC   
Warrior Met Coal is a producer and exporter of premium metallurgical coal  operating primarily in Alabama  The company is scheduled to release its brand new quarterly report after the market closes on Feb  14  HCC is currently sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and has an Earnings ESP of 5 00  
Based on our current consensus estimates  we expect Warrior Met to report earnings of  1 00 per share and total revenues of  227 72 million  The stock s Most Accurate Estimate  which is the representation of the most recent analyst predictions  is calling for earnings of  1 05 per share 
 
2        Huntington Ingalls Industries  Inc     NYSE HII   
Huntington Ingalls designs  builds  and maintains nuclear and non nuclear ships for the U S  Navy and Coast Guard and provides after market services for military ships around the globe  The defense firm is scheduled to release its latest report before the market opens on Feb  15  HII is currently holding a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and an Earnings ESP of 5 32  
Our overall consensus estimates are calling for earnings of  2 92 per share and revenues of  2 01 billion  These results would represent growth rates of  20 4  and  4 3   respectively  from the year ago period 
 
3        Deere   Company    NYSE DE   
Deere   Company  the parent of the John Deere brand  builds agricultural  construction  and lawn care equipment  The famous American manufacturer is scheduled to release its latest quarterly earnings report before the opening bell on Feb  16  DE is currently sporting a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and has an Earnings ESP of 4 89  
According to our latest consensus estimates  Deere   Company is expected to report earnings of  1 13 per share and revenues of  6 40 billion  These results would represent year over year growth of 85 3  and 36 3   respectively

149141,370657,DE,These 5 Companies Are Earnings Perfection ,opinion,"Earnings season isn t over yet  This week  there are still several hundred companies reporting  including some of the most famous names in business 
But not every company has a great earnings track record  It s not easy to beat every quarter  or nearly every quarter  for years at a time  It s rare 
It takes good management and a relationship with analysts who clearly know the company  Sometimes it even takes a little bit of luck 
These 5 companies  though  are doing it 
Can they keep their perfect earnings records intact in 2018 
Companies with Perfect Earnings Surprise Records
1     Shopify   NYSE SHOP   hasn t missed since it s 2015 IPO  Not only that  it s earnings beats have been large nearly every quarter  It s not just beating by a penny  When will the analysts catch up to the good news 
2     Shake Shack   NYSE SHAK   is an example of the principle that the beat isn t everything  Just because a company hasn t missed since its 2015 IPO  doesn t mean that the shares are necessarily going to skyrocket  With Shake Shack  same shack sales also come into play  Watch labor costs as well this quarter 
3     AMN Healthcare   NYSE AMN   is overlooked by investors even though it hasn t missed in 5 years and the shares are hitting new 5 year highs  This medical staffing company seems to be in the right niche just as the economy is heating up 
4     CBS Corporation   NYSE CBS   hasn t missed in 5 years either  but shares have been all over the map during that time  They have again pulled back off the high  Will the earnings report turn the shares around 
5     Deere   Company   NYSE DE   has a heck of a track record  with no misses in the last 5 years  It managed expectations well in 2013 through 2016 when the agriculture industry went into the doldrums and farmers stopped buying new equipment  It often lowered guidance ahead of time to keep its track record intact  But now  it appears to be a hot construction equipment market which is driving the stock  With shares near 5 year highs  has it lost control of expectations

 By Edward Krudy
 NEW YORK  Aug 19  Reuters    U S  stocks slipped on
Wednesday as a drop in Chinese shares prompted renewed selling
in global equity markets on fears stock prices have outpaced
the economic recovery 
 But heavier losses earlier in the session were tempered by
gains in energy shares after a government report showed U S 
crude stockpiles logged a steep surprise decline as imports
dropped sharply and domestic refiners boosted operations 
 Oil futures posted a 2 percent rise after weekly data from
the U S  Energy Information Administration  boosting shares in
energy companies such as Exxon Mobil Corp  which climbed 1 3
percent and was the top boost to the Dow industrials 
  The rise in oil prices is erasing some of the pessimism
that we ve had about recovery in the past few days   said Peter
Jankovskis  director of research at OakBrook Investments LLC in
Lisle  Illinois 
 The data helped shares recover from a near 1 percent slide
earlier in the day prompted by another sell off in Chinese
stocks  which have fallen 20 percent in the last two weeks on
concerns prices have advanced beyond the pace of an economic
recovery 
 The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 12 39 points  or
0 13 percent  to 9 205 55  The Standard   Poor s 500 Index fell
1 41 points  or 0 14 percent  to 988 26  The Nasdaq Composite
Index lost 6 00 points  or 0 31 percent  to 1 949 92 
 Also weighing on the market  Hewlett Packard Co warned
about demand from businesses after narrowly beating analysts
estimates after the bell on Tuesday  while agricultural
equipment maker Deere   Co  which posted better than expected
earnings before the bell  said it expected to barely break even

 In China  the Shanghai Composite index dropped to a

 NEW YORK  Aug 19  Reuters    U S  stocks advanced on
Wednesday as a strong rebound in oil prices boosted investors 
confidence in the market s run up  sending major indexes up
close to 1 percent 
 The surge in crude oil erased early losses triggered by a
heavy sell off overnight in Chinese shares 
 Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp  both Dow components 
rose more than 2 percent  contributing the most to the index s
advance  Exxon Mobil was up 2 4 percent at  68 09  and Chevron
gained 2 2 percent to  68 39  The S P Energy Index gained 2 2
percent 
 U S  front month crude oil rose 3 2 percent to  72 45 a

since May 
 Wall Street had opened lower after the Shanghai Composite
index fell to a two month low as investors fretted that a 20
percent slide over the past two weeks would continue

149151,370667,DE,UPDATE 4 Agco cuts profit forecast  shares plummet,news,"  Cuts 2009 EPS view to  1 30  1 50
   Sees Q3 net income at or below break even
   Agco shares down nearly 12 pct  Deere off 0 6 pct
  Adds CFO comments on credit issues in Central and Eastern
Europe  background on dairy prices and Agco brands 
 By Nick Zieminski
 NEW YORK  Sept 16  Reuters    Farm equipment maker Agco
Corp  cut its 2009 earnings forecast on Wednesday 
citing weak demand in Europe  and said it could post a net loss
in the third quarter 
 The announcement  which sent Agco s shares down as much as
12 percent  was the latest sign that the farm sector  which had
been largely insulated from the worldwide economic downturn
last year  is no longer immune as lower commodity prices and
falling demand for equipment take a toll on the industry 
 It follows word last week from industry leader Deere   Co
  that it was laying off more than 367 workers at its
primary harvester factory in East Moline  Illinois  and would
idle most of the plant s other employees for a month  because
of reduced demand for combines 
 Agco said it now expects full year adjusted earnings of
 1 30 to  1 50 per share  below analysts  average forecast of
 2 06  It expects third quarter sales to be down 30 percent to
35 percent from a year earlier  with net income at or below
break even 
 The company  which makes tractors and harvesters sold under
the Challenger  Fendt  Massey Ferguson and Valtra brand names 
said demand continued to be especially weak in the credit
challenged markets of Eastern Europe  Central Europe and
Russia 
  Right now that market is very depressed   Andy Beck  the
company s chief finance officer said at a conference in New
York   There is not any available financing in the marketplace 
and as a result  market conditions are almost nonexistent in
terms of demand  
 Before the global economic crisis  demand for farm
equipment in those markets was growing at a rate of 40 to 50
percent a year  Beck said 
 Adding to Agco s problems in Europe has been a sharp
deterioration in milk prices in the European Union  which have
left dairy farmers    key Agco customers    struggling 
 FALLING CROP PRICES  INCOMES
 Agco shares were last down  3 85 at  28 71  while Deere was
off 26 cents at  44 91  both on the New York Stock Exchange 
 In July  Agco cut its full year forecast to a range of  2
to  2 25 per share  from an earlier forecast of  2 to  2 50  At
the time  Richenhagen told Reuters  2 50 was still achievable 
 ID NN30374861 
 The company plans to report third quarter results on Oct 
27 
 At a conference in New York hosted by JP Morgan  Beck said
the weakness had spread in recent months to North America  a
region that had held up better than other markets  and might
drag the company s recently profitable operations there back
into the red 
  We expect the additional production cuts and dealer
destocking will lead to lower net sales and margins in the
second half of the year in North America   Beck said   We are
looking for North American operating income to be around or a
little below breakeven for the second half of the year  
 A key factor for the sector has been a retreat in commodity
prices from last year s record levels  which will translate
into sharply lower farm income this year and next  according to
the U S  Department of Agriculture 
 Since sales of tractors  harvesters and other agricultural
equipment rise and fall along with farm income  Agco  Deere and
rival CNH Global NV  have all been scaling back
production

149154,370670,DE,What s In The Offing For Emerson  EMR  In Q1 Earnings ,opinion,"Emerson Electric Co    NYSE EMR   is scheduled to report first quarter 2018 results before the opening bell on Feb 6  Last quarter  the company reported earnings of 83 cents per share  reflecting a beat of 3 8  
We expect Emerson to score an earnings beat in the to be reported quarter 
Why a Likely Positive Surprise  
Our proven model shows that Emerson has the right combination of the two key ingredients  A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  This is perfectly the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP for Emerson is  1 39  as the Most Accurate estimate of 55 cents is pegged higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 54 cents  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Emerson Electric Company Price and EPS Surprise
   Zacks Rank  The company carries a Zacks Rank  3  which when combined with a positive ESP  makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat 
Conversely  we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions 
Reasons Driving Better than Expected Results 
Emerson is well positioned to benefit from global infrastructure growth  as its core businesses hold dominant positions in markets tied to energy efficiency and infrastructure spending  Going forward  Emerson believes telecommunications infrastructure demand will continue to be one of the strongest growth drivers  Further  its restructuring efforts  undertaken over the past few quarters  are likely to prove conductive to upcoming results 
Currently  the company s Automation Solutions segment has been experiencing favorable trends in power and life sciences along with improving MRO spending by oil and gas customers  which is expected to boost growth  For the Commercial   Residential business  the company s focus on domains like human comfort  connected home  food quality  advancing energy efficiency at home and work  is likely to prove conductive for its operations  Going forward  we believe selected investment opportunities along with positive trends in certain business areas offer modest growth opportunities 
The company s accretive acquisitions are also anticipatedto be conducive to its top line  in the to be reported quarter  The company s acquisition of Blending   Transfer Systems business of FMC Technologies  NYSE FTI  will fortify presence in advanced flow measurement and control technologies  The company also acquired Pentair Valves   Controls  Locus Traxx and PakSense which are likely to drive sales 
Despite these positives  prolonged softness in the oil and gas markets is likely to affect both capital spending and operational expenditure of clients  which in turn may hurt Emerson s operations  This apart  currency fluctuations haveremained a headwind over the past few quarters  and mightimpact earnings and revenues in the upcoming release as well 
Other Stocks to Consider
Here are some other companies that you may want to consider  as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter 
Huntington Ingalls Industries  Inc    NYSE HII   has an Earnings ESP of  3 43  and a Zacks Rank  1  You can see 
Deere   Company   NYSE DE   has an Earnings ESP of  3 29  and a Zacks Rank  2 
Acco Brands Corp    NYSE ACCO   has an Earnings ESP of  0 76  and a Zacks Rank  2

   Fed cuts outlook for U S  economy
   Japan s economy shrinks record 4 pct in Q1
   Economy still getting worse  downturn slowing   Zoellick
   EU  China agree to work together against crisis
 By Wanfeng Zhou
 NEW YORK  May 20  Reuters    The U S  financial system is
healing  Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said on Wednesday 
but contractions in Japan s and Mexico s economies showed the
path to a global recovery could be long and tough 
 The U S  Federal Reserve said it saw modest improvements in
the U S  economy last month  but cut its forecast for economic
growth over the next three years 
 World Bank President Robert Zoellick was equally cautious 
telling a meeting of regional central bankers in Finland that
the global situation was still getting worse but  we are likely
to see the rate of decline lessen  
 Geithner said the U S  financial system was  starting to
heal  after a time of severe trauma  thanks to the government s
bailout efforts  and that a program for cleansing toxic assets
from banks will start over the next six weeks 
  We still face a very challenging economic and financial
environment  and we need to be careful to preserve substantial
resources and flexibility to deal with future contingencies  
Geithner told the Senate Banking Committee 
 Despite some modest improvements  the Fed gave a more
pessimistic view of the world s largest economy  projecting a
contraction of 1 3 to 2 0 percent this year and a rise in the
unemployment rate to between 9 2 and 9 6 percent 
 U S  Treasury debt prices rose after minutes from the
latest Fed policy meeting in late April showed officials
discussed buying more securities  including government debt  to
help spur the economy 
  Fed officials judged the financial system to be vulnerable
to further shocks   said John Canavan  analyst at Stone and

 Earlier Wednesday  Japan said its economy  the world s
second largest  contracted by 4 percent in the January to March
quarter from the previous three months and by 15 2 percent from
a year earlier as capital spending sank at the fastest pace on
record and private consumption fell the most since 1997 
 By comparison  the U S economy shrank 1 6 percent in the
first quarter  or 6 1 percent on an annualized basis  while the
euro zone economy contracted 2 5 percent 
 With Japan heavily reliant on exports  economists said a
lasting recovery will depend on how soon the global economy
recovers and demand in the West grows 
  The export plunge is spreading to domestic demand   said
economist Hiroshi Shiraishi at BNP Paribas   As such  the
Japanese economy may return to growth temporarily but it could
suffer a contraction again afterwards  
 Mexico s economy    also very dependent on exports   
suffered a sharp decline in the first three months of this
year  shrinking 5 88 percent from the previous quarter and 8 2
percent from a year earlier 
 Finance Minister Agustin Carstens warned that Mexico  which
ships about 80 percent of its exports to the United States 
could see its economy contract 5 5 percent this year 
 Analysts see the current recession rivaling Mexico s
mid 1990s financial meltdown known as the Tequila Crisis 
 In another sign of the need for cooperation  the European
Union and China patched up differences at a summit  pledging to
create a new global order to combat the financial crisis 
shrinking world trade and climate change 
  We both recognize that it is important for us to work
together  to ride out the storm and make our contribution to an
early world economic recovery   said Chinese Premier Wen
Jiabao 
 Officials in China have grown increasingly confident that
an 8 percent expansion can be achieved this year with the help
of Beijing s stimulus package and said extra measures would be
taken to maintain the momentum of a recovery 
 U S  HOUSING IS KEY
 Wall Street stocks fell on the Fed s outlook and as
financial shares were sold off after recent rises  running
contrary to gains in many Asian and European markets 
 The dollar fell to its lowest mark in nearly five months
against the euro and a basket of currencies as the view that
the worst of the global slump may be over dented its safe haven
appeal 
 Oil firmed above  61 a barrel after data showed U S  crude
stocks fell more than expected in the week to May 15 
 The U S  economy may not emerge from its slump until the
housing market stabilizes  economists say 
 A Reuters poll found the U S  housing market  the source of
the global financial crisis  is edging closer to a bottom but
the timing of a turnaround is highly uncertain 
 The Mortgage Bankers Association said demand by Americans
for mortgages to buy a home fell last week but overall
applications rose  reflecting more interest in refinancing
loans as interest rates drop 
 The collapse of Spain s housing sector  coupled with a
jobless rate of 17 percent  led to a larger than expected
contraction in its economy in the first quarter 
 Worries about the global recession also continue to put
pressure on corporate earnings 
 Deere   Co  the world s largest maker of agricultural
machinery  reported sharply lower quarterly earnings as weaker
crop prices weighed on demand for tractors and harvesters 
Deere also cut its full year earnings forecast again

   Full year forecast implies disappointing Q4
   Shares slip in early trading
  Recasts  adds details on outlook  analyst comment and byline 
updates shares 
 By James B  Kelleher
 CHICAGO  Aug 19  Reuters    Deere   Co reported a
higher than expected third quarter profit as improved
profitability in its core agriculture machinery business helped
to offset weakness in construction and forestry equipment 
 But the company said it expected to barely break even in
current quarter  sending its shares lower in premarket trade 
 The world s largest maker of tractors and harvesters  which
is cutting production in anticipation of lower demand next
year  reported a third quarter profit of  420 million  or 99
cents a share  down from  575 2 million  or  1 32 a share  last
year  Sales fell 24 percent to  5 89 billion 
 Analysts  on average  had expected the company to report a
profit of 56 cents per share on sales of  5 27 billion 
 Analyst Eli Lustgarten of Longbow Research called the
results  a clean beat   although 20 cents of the earnings came
from non operating items  including a lower tax rate 
 The Moline  Illinois based company reiterated its forecast
for a full year net profit of  approximately  1 1 billion  
 Since Deere has already reported earnings of  1 1 billion
for the first nine months of the year  the guidance implied a
break even or possibly even a marginally unprofitable fiscal
fourth quarter 
  They re burying the fourth quarter with these production
cuts   Lustgarten said   And so their guidance is for a
marginally break even quarter  
 Analysts had expected Deere to report a fourth quarter
profit of 33 cents a share  according to Reuters Estimates 
 Deere shares were trading t  44 60 in premarket trading 
down from Tuesday s close of  45 09

149173,370689,DE,3 Construction Stocks To Buy As U S  Building Heats Up,opinion,"After a strong 2017 for the construction industry and most signs pointing to continued growth  it might be a great time to jump on some construction and homebuilding industry stocks 
Three quarters of U S  construction firms plan to increase their payrolls in 2018  according to a new survey from the Associated General Contractors of America  Last year  the construction industry added 210 000 new jobs  which marked a 35  year over year jump  according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics   in the real estate sector  commercial and residential industry and in private construction projects 
 Construction firms appear to be very optimistic about 2018 as they expect demand for all types of construction services to continue to expand   Associated General Contractors of America CEO Stephen E  Sandherr said in a  
 This optimism is likely based on current economic conditions  an increasingly business friendly regulatory environment and expectations the Trump administration will boost infrastructure investments  
With that said  let s take a look at three construction stocks that investors might want to scoop up before the spring time building boom really picks up 
1       Fastenal Company   NASDAQ FAST  
Last week  this industrial and construction supply wholesale giant posted Q4 sales that climbed 14 8  year over year  Fastenal s strong fourth quarter helped its shares climb to a new all time high of  56 73 per share on Wednesday  However  it doesn t seem like the company will have a hard time breaking into a new range as its growth is expected to continue 
Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2018  Fastenal is projected to see its revenues surge 10 63  to hit  1 16 billion  based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates  Earnings are expected to jump by 30 43  in the quarter  Fastenal is currently a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and sports  A  grades for both Growth and Momentum in our Styles Scores system 
On top of all of this  the company has earned six upward earnings estimate revisions against no downgrades for its current quarter  against no downgrades  all within the last 60 days  During this same time period  Fastenal earned a nine to zero ratio for its full year  as it seems analysts are indeed projecting a big year for this construction industry firm 
2        Caterpillar   NYSE CAT   
Shares of this construction industry titan are currently hovering around their all time high as investors anticipate strong fourth quarter results from CAT  which is set to report Q4 earnings Thursday morning before the opening bell 
Caterpillar is expected to see its Q4 EPS skyrocket 113  to hit  1 77  while its sales are projected to pop by 24   based on current Zacks Consensus Estimates  These estimates take into account the massive construction industry gains at the close of 2017 that saw total construction spending hit a record  1 257 trillion in November  according to the Commerce Department  If these estimates are topped or matched which CAT has done in 15 of the last 16 quarters  including the trailing 11 periods shares of the construction icon are likely to fly into a new range 
CAT is currently a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and looks poised to benefit from the 2018 construction industry expansion 
3        Deere   Company   NYSE DE  
Shares of this manufacturing and construction equipment firm have soared 26 93  in the last 12 weeks and currently rest just below their all time high  Deere s recent climb comes after the company posted strong Q4 results in late November  Looking ahead  investors should note that 2018 is projected to be another great year for Deere 
Within the last 60 days  Deere has earned eight upward earnings estimate revisions for its current full year against no downgrades  What s more  the company has topped or matched earnings estimates every quarter for the last four years 
Deere is currently a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and rocks an overall  B  VGM score  supported by  B  grades for Value and Momentum in our Style Scores system  In its upcoming quarter  Deere is projected to see its earnings reach  1 13 per share  which would mark an 85 25  year over year jump  On top of this EPS growth projection  Deere s sales are expected surge over 36  to reach  6 40 billion 
Looking even further down the road  the company is expected to see both its top and bottom line grow by over 22  during its full fiscal 2018 and these might only go up if the U S  construction industry expansion predictions prove true

    Revenues Improve Across All Regions   Markets Revenues improved 35  year over year to  12 9 billion in the quarter  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  11 9 billion  The company witnessed higher sales volume owing to improved end user demand and favorable changes in dealer inventories  End user demand improved across all regions and most end markets  Higher Sales Drive Improved Profits In the reported quarter  cost of sales increased 18  year over year to  8 9 billion  Gross profit soared 97  to  4 billion  Selling  general and administrative  SG A  expenses increased 8  to  1 6 billion  Research and development  R D  expenses rose 11  year over year to  579 million  Adjusted profit before taxes were pegged at  1 7 billion  a substantial improvement from  0 6 billion in the prior year quarter  Higher sales volume  favorable price realization and lower variable manufacturing costs were offset by higher period costs  Variable manufacturing costs were lower in the quarter due to the favorable impact from cost absorption and lower warranty expense  Period costs were higher primarily due to higher short term incentive compensation expense  All Segments Deliver Growth Machinery and Energy   Transportation  ME T  sales surged 37  year over year to  12 2 billion  Sales of Energy   Transportation gained 22   owing to higher sales across all applications  Sales at Resource Industries improved 53  due to higher sales volume for both equipment and aftermarket parts as well as favorable price realization  Construction Industries sales rose 47  driven by favorable impact of changes in dealer inventories as well as higher end user demand for construction equipment  Sales increased across all regions with the North America and Asia Pacific leading the pack  The ME T segment reported an operating profit of  1 09 billion against the operating loss of  1 34 million in the year ago quarter  At the Energy   Transportation segment  operating profit improved 38  to  881 million due to higher sales volume  partially offset by higher period costs  The Resource Industries reported operating profit of  209 million in the quarter versus  711 million loss incurred in the prior year quarter thanks to higher sales volume and favorable price realization  Construction Industries  profit soared 151  to  838 million due to favorable price realization  higher sales volume and variable manufacturing efficiencies  However  unfavorable period costs and higher material costs  primarily for steel somewhat negated these gains  Financial Products  revenues went up 6  to  783 million  Financial Products  profit was  233 million in the quarter up from  149 million in the prior year quarter  The increase can be attributed to higher gains on sales of securities at Insurance Services and an increase in net yield on average earning assets  Financial Position Caterpillar ended 2017 with cash and short term investments of  8 3 billion  up from  7 2 billion at 2016 end  The debt to capital ratio at ME T was 36 7  as of 2017 end  lower than 41  as of 2016 end  and within the company s target range of 30 45   Operating cash flow at ME T was at  5 5 billion in 2017

million  Robust Backlog At the end of 2017  Caterpillar s backlog was at  15 8 billion  up from  15 4 billion at third quarter end  The increase was mainly driven by higher backlog Resource Industries  Backlog at Construction Industries remained flat while the company witnessed a decline in backlog at the Energy   Transportation segment  On a year over year basis  order backlog improved by about  3 7 billion driven by improvement across both Construction and Resource Industries  December Retail Sales Update A day before the earnings release  Caterpillar reported a rise of 34  in global retail

149198,370714,DE,The Weak U S  Dollar Remains A Puzzle,opinion,"While the PowerShares DB US Dollar Bullish  NYSE UUP   an ETF with the two largest weights being the euro and the yen  is now pretty oversold  when talking to a long time friend of mine from Cincinnati  who is a stockbroker and someone like myself  has a strong interest in all things capital market related  I kept thinking how everything about tax reform and the pro growth economic policies of the present Administration has played out  according to Hoyle  so to speak  the weak US dollar remains the puzzle or outlier 
For those of us old enough to remember the earlier days of the Reagan Administration  the dollar started screaming higher in 1983 1985  and ultimately created the Rust Belt   the graveyards of traditional Midwest exporters like Caterpillar  NYSE CAT   Deere   Company  NYSE DE   the steel manufacturers  etc  etc 
It was only the G 6 meeting in late 1985 early 1986 that started to weaken the US dollar eventually culminating in the October 19  87 stock market crash  after the dollar had gotten too weak 
You would think the US dollar would be drifting higher the last few months with tax reform passage  stronger economic growth  and   finally   rising interest rates although with the 10 year Treasury yield back to 2 62  today  that yield is just back at its March  17 high 
The US stock and bond market reactions are so orderly today  relative to the mid 1980 s 
In the March of 1987 the 30 year US Treasury bond last 10 points in a month after crude oil started to rise sharply  and the US stock market was screaming higher  I thought i read the Dow Jones 30  was up 22  from Jan 1  87 though the end of July  87  This led to rising inflation worries  the fear was the return of  70 s style inflation  which was still the last war being fought   and the weaker dollar after 1986 and it culminated in October  1987 
With interest rates still negative in Europe  tax reform in the US  clearly stronger economic growth in the United States although to what degree  3    4    remains unknown  watching the US dollar trade every day like a wet blanket  seems strangely out of synch 
The rough roadmap for currency valuations are dependent upon 
1  Relative monetary policies   the US is clearly tightening US monetary policy and shrinking while Europe is still engaging in QE and negative rates 
2  Relative fiscal policies   the tax reform package just passed is highly likely to stimulate US private sector growth and investment but again the degree remains to be seen 
3  Relative trade policies   is NAFTA threats and the potential for a trade squabbles with China impacting the dollar 
There is more  but readers get the point 
Maybe a big GDP print will move it northeast  quickly ",2018-01-19,Brian Gilmartin,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-us-dollar-is-the-puzzle-today-200281624,200281624
149200,370716,DE, Will Improving End Markets Aid Caterpillar s Q4 Earnings ,opinion,"Caterpillar Inc    NYSE CAT   is slated to report fourth quarter 2017 results on Jan 25 before the opening bell  Notably  the company has outpaced earnings and revenue estimates in all the three quarters of 2017  After suffering a 36  drop in earnings in fiscal 2016 due to weak end user demand in most of the industries it serves  Caterpillar has delivered continuous improvement over the course of 2017  This turnaround can be attributed to a continued improvement in the construction sector  pickup in Resource Industries as well as its disciplined cost control efforts  Consequently  investors are keen to know whether Caterpillar will deliver fourth consecutive quarter of both top and bottom line growth in the to be reported quarter    Given impressive results  Caterpillar s share price has outperformed the in the past year  The shares gained 80 4   ahead of the industry s growth of 78 3   An earnings beat will help the company sustain the price momentum  Looking at the upbeat estimates for the both earnings and revenues for the fourth quarter  it seems likely that the company will deliver improved year over year earnings on both metrics  This is also supported by strong fourth quarter projections for its segments   Machinery  Energy   Transportation which garners a major chunk of revenues and earnings  Notably  performance will be driven by both the Construction and Resource Industries segments  Let s delve deeper and take a look at factors that might influence the fourth quarter results  Segments Poised to Deliver Top Line Growth Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate  the Machinery  Energy   Transportation segment  which contributed approximately 94  of total revenues in third quarter 2017  is expected to log year over year growth of 26  to  11 2 billion in the fourth quarter  We believe the company will witness growth in all its segments   Construction Industries  Resource Industries  Energy   Transportation  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total sales of  12 01 billion for the fourth quarter indicates 25 5  growth from the prior year quarter  Caterpillar  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    The construction sector has been on an uptrend lately as evident from its leading indicators  The U S  Architecture Billings Index  ABI   an economic indicator that provides an approximately nine to 12 month glimpse into the future of non residential construction spending activity  has been at 50 or better recently  signaling robust conditions for the construction industry  Construction sales in Asia Pacific have shown resilience primarily owing to increased infrastructure and residential investment in China Caterpillar s Resource Industries  performance has also picked up lately  Sales are being driven by continued strong demand for aftermarket parts  Further  increased capital investments by mining customers also bode well  Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Resource Industries is also anticipated to witness expansion in the third quarter with 47  projected growth to  2 1 billion 
The Engine   Transportation is gaining on the back of higher sales across all applications  New engines and aftermarket sales for various industrial applications have also increased across the board  Strength in onshore North America oil and gas will drive results  Transportation is expected to grow  as higher rail traffic has propped up demand for rail services  The Zacks Consensus Estimates for the segment s revenues is at  4 5 billion  projecting 16  year over year growth 
Cost Control to Sustain the Bottom LineIn September 2015  Caterpillar set upon significant restructuring and cost reduction initiative  with actions expected through 2018  Once fully implemented  the plan would lower annual operating costs by about  1 5 billion  In fourth quarter 2017  revenue growth along with cost reduction will lead to an improved bottom line as well  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Profit before Taxes for the Machinery  Energy   Transportation segment is pegged at  1 2 billion  a reversal from its year ago loss of  1 5 billion  This will be driven by an impressive 164  rise in the Construction segment s operating profit  Further  the Resource Industries segment will report an operating profit of  194 million in contrast to the operating loss of  711 million reported in fourth quarter 2016  The Energy   Transportation segment is expected to report operating profit of  842 million  a 32  rise from the prior year quarter   Further  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of  1 77 for the fourth quarter reflects an improvement of 113 3  on a year over year basis   Here is what our quantitative model predicts  Caterpillar has the right combination of two main ingredients   a positive  and Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or higher   which shows that it is likely to beat earnings in the to be reported quarter  Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP for Caterpillar is  6 22   This is because the Most Accurate estimate of  1 88 is above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 77  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our     Zacks Rank  Caterpillar carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   which combined with a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of a positive earnings surprise  Other Stocks Worth a Look Here are a few industrial products stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter  Deere   Company   NYSE DE   has an Earnings ESP of  2 65  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see   Deere s shares have surged 59  in the past year   The Earnings ESP for Donaldson Company  Inc    NYSE DCI   is  9 09   It carries a Zacks Rank  2  Shares of Donaldson Company have gone up 25  in a year s time  iRobot Corporation   NASDAQ IRBT   has an Earnings ESP of  20 00  and a Zacks Rank  2  Its shares have gone up 49  in a year s time  The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of All Last year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce  the world s first trillionaires   but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early ",2018-01-21,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-improving-endmarkets-aid-caterpillars-q4-earnings-200282279,200282279
149213,370729,DE,3 Stocks Rising Into Their Reports ,opinion,"Eat your heart out Christmastime  Here at Zacks  our favorite season is Earnings Season and we get four of them each year  It s just about time for the next one  and this more than 8 year long bull market has taught us not to fear companies that are rising into their report 
With that in mind  today we re focused on the screen  The stocks that pass these parameters are strong buys that are approaching or at their 52 week highs 
Below are three stocks that have passed this screen s criteria  They are Strong buys that are outpacing the market  and they are all scheduled to report next month  Make sure to click on the screen above to learn about the parameters and see the full list of names 
NVIDIA Corporation  NASDAQ NVDA    
Earnings estimates for NVIDIA Corporation  NVDA  soared in the double digits following its fiscal third quarter report a couple of months ago  but haven t moved much since then  Fortunately  we are just a little more than a month away from this chip making giant s fiscal fourth quarter numbers  Given this company s penchant for beating quarterly EPS expectations  topping in 19 out of the last 20  and its ongoing innovations  there s an excellent chance that NVDA will be outperforming again when it reports on February 8 leading to another round of rising estimates 
NVIDIA has always been a trailblazer  especially in developing high performance graphics processing units  GPUs  for video games  As if that wasn t cool enough  the company has also become a leader in other intriguing fields like self driving cars and artificial intelligence  With such emerging technologies providing a solid foundation  NVDA soared by more than 85  in 2017  And with this hot start to 2018  the company has advanced another 10  in just the past few days 
In its fiscal third quarter  earnings per share of  1 33 crushed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 94 cents by 41 5   The company has now registered a positive surprise in 10 straight quarters  averaging 33 5  in the past four  Revenues jumped 31 5  to  2 64 billion thanks to growth across all of its platforms  The Zacks Consensus Estimate was only expected  2 36 billion  For example  its GPU business jumped 31  to  2 22 billion  while emerging fields like AI also gained strength 
Following the report  earnings estimates for this fiscal year  ending this month  jumped 16  to  4 19 per share from  3 61  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for next fiscal year  ending January 2019  increased 18 2  to  4 67 per share  which suggests year over year growth of 11 5   And this is where the expectations remain to this day  having not moved in the past 30 days  But that s likely to change when NVDA reports again early next month 
 NVIDIA Corporation Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Deere   Company  NYSE DE    
Take a look at that chart below  It s not easy to find such a good looking chart outside of technology these days  Deere   Company  DE  hasn t missed quarterly earnings expectations in years and its stock has zoomed higher by approximately 54  in the past 12 months  This agriculture and construction equipment company has been impressive for a long time  but it s not resting on its laurels 
Last month  DE closed its more than  5 billion acquisition of Germany based Wirtgen  the world s leading road construction equipment maker  The company is looking to become as much a household name globally as it already is here in the U S A  The move catapults DE into an industry leader in global road construction and is expected to contribute around  3 1 billion in net sales in fiscal 2018 
The next quarterly report drops on February 16 and currently has an Earnings ESP of nearly 16   which can be attributed to a mixture of the acquisition  strong demand and its fantastic record of outperformance  In its fiscal fourth quarter  earnings per share of  1 57 topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7 5   completing a four quarter average surprise of 19 5   For all of fiscal 2017  earnings per share of  6 68 bettered our estimate of  6 51  Revenues also outpaced Zacks expectations for both the quarter and year 
Looking forward  DE expects net sales to be up about 19  year over year in fiscal 2018 with net income at around  2 6 billion  Total equipment sales are expected to increase 38  in the first quarter and 22  in fiscal 2018  In other words  the company expects demand to continue  Given the strong quarter and guidance  analysts raised estimates in the aftermath 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this fiscal year  ending October 2018  has gained 15  in the past two months to  7 95 per share  Most impressively though  earnings are then forecasted to rise another 20  next fiscal year  ending October 2019  to  9 55  which has advanced more than 21  in the past 60 days 
 Deere   Company Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   DXC Technology   
DXC Technology  DXC  ended the first week of 2018 by eclipsing  100 a share on Friday  which means this IT services company has now soared approximately 70  over the past 12 months  Earnings estimates have also been improving for this Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stock  especially since its fiscal second quarter report from early November  Now we are less than a month away from its next release on February 1 
DXC came together from the merger of Computer Sciences Corp  NYSE DXC   with the Enterprise Services Division of Hewlett Packard Enterprise  These days  it is the world s second largest end to end IT services company  But it s really just getting started  The merger opens up tons of possibilities for insurance  healthcare and financial services in spaces like transportation  pharma and technology  among others 
The company is on an epic streak of positive earnings surprises  see graph below   It has amassed an average beat of more than 25  in just the past four quarters  Most recently  it reported earnings per share of  1 93 for its fiscal second quarter  easily eclipsing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 53 by more than 26   Revenues of  6 163 billion was even more impressive as that skyrocketed by nearly 230  year over year  while still beating our expectations of  5 993 billion 
DXC raised its non GAAP EPS outlook for fiscal 2018 to between  7 25 and  7 75  compared to the previous guidance of  6 50 to  7  Revenues are still expected at  24 billion to  24 5 billion  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this fiscal year  ending March 2018  is at  7 51  which marks gains of 10  over the past 3 months and 4  in the past two  More importantly  earnings for next fiscal year  ending March 2019  are expected to soar from the previous year by more than 15  to  8 65 per share  This guidance is up 5 4  in 3 months and 2 6  in two

149215,370731,DE,Caterpillar At All Time High  Spotlight On Industrial Stocks,opinion,Caterpillar Inc    NYSE CAT   touched an all time high of  166 43 on Jan 8  before settling a tad lower at  166 03  but logging a jump of 3  in the day  The rise was triggered by an upgrade from JP Morgan  stating that the company has another solid year ahead in light of the Republican tax legislation  as quoted on a CNBC Com article  Rationale Behind the Upgrade Per the firm  there is significant upside to the stock and expects it to close at  200 in 2018   a prospect of 20  rise from current levels  With the Congress  passing the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act  it will lead to lower tax rates for Caterpillar  which in turn should translate to  higher through cycle free cash flow    Further  per the firm  the global economy has entered into a  10 year upcycle  in commodities   Caterpillar has nine more years to benefit from the cycle   Stellar Price Performance in the Past Year This peak in share price is not an isolated event and the improvement has been gradual for Caterpillar over the past year  A look at the company s price chart reveals that it put up a stellar performance  marching ahead of both the  and S P 500  Shares have notched a gain of 76 5   while the industry registered growth of 74 6  and the S P 500 advanced 18 2   In fact  Caterpillar was the top five performing stocks in Dow Jones industrial average in 2017  The company  which suffered 36  drop in earnings in fiscal 2016 affected by weak end user demand in most of the industries it serves  including construction  oil and gas  mining and rail   has successfully delivered a turnaround in 2017  What Turned the Tables For Caterpillar  Caterpillar s share price has witnessed an uptrend since the victory of President Trump as the company is touted to be one of the biggest beneficiaries from Trump s plans of infrastructure spending  Moreover  thanks to its incessant efforts to cut down costs and the strength in the Asia Pacific region  Caterpillar reported year over year improvement in both top and bottom line in the first quarter of 2017   the first time in 10 quarters  The momentum continued in the next two quarters as well  Better Performance Ahead For the fourth quarter of 2017  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings projects a year over year growth of 108 4  and revenues of 25 0   Consequently  Caterpillar is set to deliver fourth consecutive quarter of both top and bottom line growth  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter for earnings and revenues are pegged at  1 73 billion and  11 97 billion  respectively  Caterpillar has outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters  delivering a positive average earnings surprise of 53 06   Our proven model shows that the company is likely to beat earnings in the next quarter as well  as it has the right combination of two key ingredients   a positive  of 4 82  and a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   A positive ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 and 2018 reflect healthy growth of 88 9  and 20 8   respectively  Estimates for Caterpillar have moved up in the past 30 days  reflecting the optimistic outlook of analysts  The earnings estimate for 2017 has surged 23  while that of 2018 has moved up 16   in the past 90 days  The stock has an estimated long term earnings growth rate of 10 3   Industrial Stocks Well Poised for Growth Commodities have rebounded  boosting demand for heavy mining equipment which bodes well for companies like Caterpillar  Further  construction activity has shown considerable improvement in North America as well as Asia Pacific  including China  The company s stellar run and growth prospects have brought back the spotlight on industrial stocks  Caterpillar s performance instills optimism as it has long been considered as a bellwether of the global manufacturing industry and the world economy owing to the size and scope of operations  The company falls under the  sector  This sector has been outperforming the S P 500 market in recent times  In the past year  the sector has gained around 27 0   above the S P 500 s growth of 18 2   We believe that implementation of Trump administration s growth policies  especially the proposed  1 trillion spending on infrastructure improvement  will be a boon for industrial stocks  Further  manufacturing is likely to get a boost this year from  1 5 trillion tax cut approved by the Republican controlled U S  Congress  The overhaul of the tax code resulted in the slashing of the corporate income tax rate to 21  from 35   Notably  the Industrial Products sector put up 19 6  growth in earnings in the third quarter of 2017 and 22 1  growth in earnings is projected for the fourth quarter of 2017  The sector is expected to deliver double digit growth in all the quarters of 2018  Per our projections  the sector will log growth of 14  in the first quarter of 2018  followed by 13 4   10  and 13 1  in the second  third and fourth quarters  respectively   Read more    Consequently  we suggest you to stay invested in the sector to reap the benefits of healthy prospects ahead  Apart from Caterpillar  which is good investment currently given its Zacks Rank  2 and factors mentioned above  we suggest few other stocks in the sector  To zero in on stocks that are winning currently and have the potential to gain further  we have opted for one of the relatively new investment techniques  by betting on stocks near a 52 week high  The 52 week investment strategy relies on the new investment mantra   buy high and sell higher   Other Stocks That Fit the

months ago  but haven t moved much since then  Fortunately  we are just a little more than a month away from this chip making giant s fiscal fourth quarter numbers  Given this company s penchant for beating quarterly EPS expectations  topping in 19 out of the last 20  and its ongoing innovations  there s an excellent chance that NVDA will be outperforming again when it reports on February 8 leading to another round of rising estimates NVIDIA has always been a trailblazer  especially in developing high performance graphics processing units  GPUs  for video games  As if that wasn t cool enough  the company has also become a leader in other intriguing fields like self driving cars and artificial intelligence  With such emerging technologies providing a solid foundation  NVDA soared by more than 85  in 2017  And with this hot start to 2018  the company has advanced another 10  in just the past few days In its fiscal third quarter  earnings per share of  1 33 crushed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 94 cents by 41 5   The company has now registered a positive surprise in 10 straight quarters  averaging 33 5  in the past four  Revenues jumped 31 5  to  2 64 billion thanks to growth across all of its platforms  The Zacks Consensus Estimate was only expected  2 36 billion  For example  its GPU business jumped 31  to  2 22 billion  while emerging fields like AI also gained strength Following the report  earnings estimates for this fiscal year  ending this month  jumped 16  to  4 19 per share from  3 61  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for next fiscal year  ending January 2019  increased 18 2  to  4 67 per share  which suggests year over year growth of 11 5   And this is where the expectations remain to this day  having not moved in the past 30 days  But that s likely

to contribute around  3 1 billion in net sales in fiscal 2018 The next quarterly report drops on February 16 and currently has an Earnings ESP of nearly 16   which can be attributed to a mixture of the acquisition  strong demand and its fantastic record of outperformance  In its fiscal fourth quarter  earnings per share of  1 57 topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7 5   completing a four quarter average surprise of 19 5   For all of fiscal 2017  earnings per share of  6 68 bettered our estimate of  6 51  Revenues also outpaced Zacks expectations for both the quarter and year Looking forward  DE expects net sales to be up about 19  year over year in fiscal 2018 with net income at around  2 6 billion  Total equipment sales are expected to increase 38  in the first quarter and 22  in fiscal 2018  In other words  the company expects demand to continue  Given the strong quarter and guidance  analysts raised estimates in the aftermath The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this fiscal year  ending October 2018  has gained 15  in the past two months to  7 95 per share  Most impressively though  earnings are then forecasted to rise another 20  next fiscal year  ending October 2019

149222,370738,DE,Caterpillar Forged Ahead In 2017  Can It Sustain The Thrust ,opinion,Caterpillar Inc    NYSE CAT   made a comeback in 2017 driven by strength in the Asia Pacific region and relentless focus on cutting costs  In fact  this is evident from the mining and equipment behemoth s return to top and bottom line growth  Retail sales growth entered the positive trajectory in March following an unprecedented stretch of declines for 51 months and has shown significant improvement ever since  With its end markets   construction  mining and energy showing positive momentum lately  the company is likely to report strong results for the final quarter of 2017 and seems poised for an improved 2018  Stellar Share Performance in the Past Year  After bearing the brunt of negative trends in past few years  Caterpillar s shares surged around 79 1  in the past year  outperforming its  s growth of 76 8  as well as the S P500 s rise of 18 2   In fact  Caterpillar was one of the top five performing stocks in Dow Jones industrial average in 2017  Notably  Caterpillar touched a 52 week high of  169 53 on Jan 11  The company has a market cap of roughly  100 7 billion and average volume of shares traded in the last three months is around 3 86 million  What Stoked the Stellar Performance  Caterpillar started scripting its turnaround story in 2017 with cost cutting efforts in the wake of a weak mining sector  The company reported year over year improvement in the first quarter of 2017 in both top and bottom lines for the first time in 10 quarters  Backlog also improved on a year over year basis for the first time since third quarter 2014  Strong Asia Pacific markets also drove the results  The company continued to report growth in both top and bottom lines in the second and third quarters as well  Another noteworthy improvement in 2017 was Caterpillar s retail sales growth graph returning to positive in March  Since then  retail sales growth has remained positive  averaging 11  till November  Per latest figures  Caterpillar reported a rise of 26  in global retail sales for the three months ended November 2017   its best performance in 2017  Given that the company had suffered a drop in earnings in 2015 and 2016 affected by weak end user demand in most of the industries it served  this turnaround performance was indeed a relief for the investors  Upbeat results  encouraging order rates  encouraging economic indicators and an increasing backlog have fueled the share price  Further  Caterpillar hiked guidance three times in 2017  At its first quarter 2017 conference call  Caterpillar had issued a revenue guidance range of  38  41 billion and earnings guidance of  3 75 per share for 2017  The latest guidance is now at  44 billion for revenues and earnings per share of  6 25  The mid point of the revenues and earnings guidance reflects a year over year growth of 14  and 83  respectively  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 for revenues is at  44 52 billion and for earnings at  6 46  both ahead of the company s guidance  Also  Caterpillar s share price got a much needed boost with the victory of President Trump as the company is touted to be one of the biggest beneficiaries from his plans of infrastructure spending  What Turned the Tide in Favor  In Sep 2015  Caterpillar set upon a major restructuring by retrenching employees and closing or consolidating 30 facilities globally  that would decrease manufacturing square footage by more than 10   With actions expected through 2018  once fully implemented  the plan would aid in lowering annual operating costs by about  1 5 billion  These costs savings helped the behemoth sustain margins in the wake of weak revenues  Moreover  strength in Asia Pacific sales as well as in the Construction sector helped propel revenues   What to Expect from Q4 Results  For fourth quarter 2017  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings projects a year over year growth of 108  on the back of 25  rise in revenues  Consequently  Caterpillar is set to deliver fourth consecutive quarter of both top and bottom line growth  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter for earnings and revenues are pegged at  1 73 billion and  11 97 billion  respectively Caterpillar  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    Caterpillar has outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters  delivering a positive average earnings surprise of 53 06   Our proven model shows that the company is likely to beat earnings in the fourth quarter when it reports results on Jan 25  as it has the right combination of two key ingredients   a positive  of 3 76  and Zacks Rank  2  Buy   A positive ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Better Performance Ahead The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 and 2018 reflect healthy growth of 88 9  and 21 5   respectively  Estimates for Caterpillar have moved up in the past 30 days  reflecting the optimistic outlook of analysts  The earnings estimate for 2017 has surged 23  while that of 2018 has moved north by 16   in the past 90 days  The stock has an estimated long term earnings growth rate of 10 3   Leading indicators of U S  construction signal robust conditions ahead  that bodes well for Caterpillar  In China  the construction industry is improving owing to government spending  Recently  the Resource Industries segment has also shown considerable improvement  There exists key opportunities in the precious metals sector as miners resume projects that were placed in the back burner and expand current operations thanks to the recent rally in metal prices  Strength in onshore North America oil and gas will drive results  Shipments to North America gas compression customers will improve driven largely by demand for reciprocating engines  Transportation is anticipated to grow  as higher rail traffic has propped up demand for rail services  All these factors  along with savings from restricting actions will boost revenues and earnings  We believe that implementation of Trump administration s growth policies  especially the proposed  1 trillion spending on infrastructure improvement  will be a boon for Caterpillar  Further  manufacturing is likely to get a boost this year from  1 5 trillion tax cut approved by the Republican controlled U S  Congress  The overhaul of the tax code resulted in the slashing of the corporate income tax rate to 21  from 35   Caterpillar s Zacks Rank  2  Buy

November from October The construction sector has demonstrated stability through 2017 and witnessed sustainable growth amid various challenges  It goes without saying that President Donald Trump was the biggest factor  Investors were expecting faster growth based on Trump s assurance of significant tax cuts  higher infrastructure spending and lesser regulations The trend is anticipated to continue in 2018  owing to improving economy  modest wage growth  low unemployment levels  positive consumer confidence  a tight supply situation and escalating rent costs  Despite the repeated hikes of the Federal Reserve s interest rates  optimism surrounding the housing market remains largely unaffected U S Economy on the Growth PathThe U S  GDP expanded at 3 2  in the third quarter of 2017   the fastest pace of growth in three years  Notably  it is the first time since 2014 that the U S  economy has witnessed growth of 3  or more for two straight quarters  According to several recent

149285,370801,DE,4 Machinery Stocks Near 52 Week High With More Room To Run,opinion,"Investors are constantly striving to determine which industry or sector holds the most potential for capital gains  After a harrowing last year  the industrial sector seems to be back in favor this year amid a global growth backdrop  It was one of the most adversely impacted sectors last year stemming from weak commodity prices  reduced investment in the energy sector due to lower oil prices  poor economic conditions in some developed and developing nations  and Brexit The scenario has improved with few indicators pointing toward healthy operating conditions in the industry  Per the U S  Census Bureau report  new orders for U S  manufactured machinery increased 6 4  in the first nine months of 2017 led by growth in orders for construction  mining  industrial  material handling and other machineries Industrial production  one of the leading economic indicators for the industrial stocks  rose 0 9  in October  Manufacturing increased 1 3  while mining output fell 1 3   as Hurricane Nate caused a short term decline in oil and gas drilling as well as extraction  Industrial activity rose in October as normal operations resumed after Hurricanes Harvey and Irma hit production in September and October  Further  industrial production has grown 2 9  in the past 12 months  which bodes well for machinery stocks Per the Institute for Supply Management  ISM   its index of national factory activity slipped to a reading of 58 7 in October from 60 8 in September  The reading in September was the highest since May 2004 riven by supply chain disruptions  Though the index has slipped in October  it continues to signal strengthening manufacturing conditions  Notably  a reading above 50 indicates increased factory activity  The manufacturing sector accounts for about 12  of the U S  economy According to the second estimate  U S  GDP expanded at 3 3  in the third quarter of 2017   the fastest pace of growth in three years  Per a report by the Commerce Department  consumer spending advanced 2 3  in 3Q17  Unemployment in the United States is currently at a 17 year low  In October  the United States created 261 000 jobs in October while the unemployment rate declined from 4 2  to 4 1 Solid Sector Positioning  ProjectionsMachinery stocks are broadly grouped under   one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors  Year to date  the industrial products sector  one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors  has clocked a gain of 20 1   outperforming the S P 500 s climb of 16 9  The Industrial Products sector put up an impressive 19 6  growth in earnings in third quarter 2017  Per our latest  report  earnings growth of 21 3  is projected for fourth quarter 2017  It is one the four sectors that is expected to log double digit growth in earnings in the fourth quarter We put our Sectors  all 16 of them  into two groups  the top half  i e   sectors with the best average Zacks Rank  and the bottom half  the sectors with the worst average Zacks Rank   In the last 10 years  using a one week rebalance  the top half beat the bottom half by more than twice as much   To learn more visit     The industrial products sector  with a Zacks Sector Rank  5  remains in the top half What Factors Will Help Sustain Growth The continuous advancements in technologies applied in agriculture and mining industries keep demand strong for farming and mining machinery  Long term demand for agricultural equipment will be buoyed by increased global demand for food 
Further  favorable trends resulting from a growing  more affluent and increasing population along with rising living standards and dietary improvements will provide ample opportunity for long term growth  Healthy growth in demand for packaged foods and beverages across nations  especially in emerging countries  are significantly increasing the use of highly sophisticated food processing and packaging equipment Construction machinery demand will remain strong in the years to come aided by population growth  urbanization  increased energy consumption as well as an expanding middle class  Further  increasing demand for global infrastructure  such as roads  housing  airports  and energy will help sustain growth We believe that implementation of the Trump government s growth policies  especially the proposed  1 trillion spending on infrastructure improvement  will be a boon for industrial machinery stocks Thus we suggest you to stay invested in the sector to reap the benefits of healthy prospects ahead  To zero in on stocks that are winning currently and have the potential to gain further  we have opted for one of the relatively new investment techniques  by betting on stocks near a 52 week high  The 52 week investment strategy relies on the new investment mantra   buy high and sell higher  Why These Stocks Are Good BetsInvesting in stocks near their 52 week high is similar to following the momentum strategy  which is based on the premise that once a trend is established  it is likely to continue  The surge can be attributed to a broad set of factors including impressive sales  robust profitability and bullish earnings prospects  Major developments may also send stocks soaring Meanwhile  stocks that are trading near their 52 week highs carry the risk of declining rapidly as the market might consider them overvalued  But the positives seem to outweigh drawbacks Notably  momentum investors strongly believe in  the trend is your friend   which means stocks that are growing will continue to grow  They make short term choices among stocks that are scaling up and sell them at the first sign of a downtrend  The basic idea is that once a trend is recognized  it is likely to continue and the chances of a reversal are minimal Consequently  picking such stocks might help investors earn higher returns in the short term  However  this is only a speculative strategy and not meant for the faint hearted Stocks That Fit the BillGiven their positive earnings revisions  we believe these four industrial stocks  all of which are near their 52 week highs  will continue moving north for now  The stocks carry a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and have a Momentum Style Score of A or B  You can see  Deere   Company   NYSE DE   manufactures and distributes agriculture and turf  along with construction and forestry equipment worldwide  The company has a Zacks Rank  1 and  of A  The long term expected earnings growth rate for Deere is 8   It has outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters  generating a positive average earnings surprise of 19 5

149287,370803,DE,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Deere  Alamo Group  Luxfer Holdings And Sonoco Products,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   Dec 8  2017   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include Deere   Company   NYSE DE    Alamo Group Inc    NYSE ALG    Luxfer Holdings PLC   NYSE LXFR   and Sonoco Products Company   NYSE SON   Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations   Here are highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog  4 Machinery Stocks Near 52 Week Highs with More Room to RunInvestors are constantly striving to determine which industry or sector holds the most potential for capital gains  After a harrowing last year  the industrial sector seems to be back in favor this year amid a global growth backdrop  It was one of the most adversely impacted sectors last year stemming from weak commodity prices  reduced investment in the energy sector due to lower oil prices  poor economic conditions in some developed and developing nations  and Brexit The scenario has improved with few indicators pointing toward healthy operating conditions in the industry  Per the U S  Census Bureau report  new orders for U S  manufactured machinery increased 6 4  in the first nine months of 2017 led by growth in orders for construction  mining  industrial  material handling and other machineries Industrial production  one of the leading economic indicators for the industrial stocks  rose 0 9  in October  Manufacturing increased 1 3  while mining output fell 1 3   as Hurricane Nate caused a short term decline in oil and gas drilling as well as extraction  Industrial activity rose in October as normal operations resumed after Hurricanes Harvey and Irma hit production in September and October  Further  industrial production has grown 2 9  in the past 12 months  which bodes well for machinery stocks Per the Institute for Supply Management  ISM   its index of national factory activity slipped to a reading of 58 7 in October from 60 8 in September  The reading in September was the highest since May 2004 riven by supply chain disruptions  Though the index has slipped in October  it continues to signal strengthening manufacturing conditions  Notably  a reading above 50 indicates increased factory activity  The manufacturing sector accounts for about 12  of the U S  economy According to the second estimate  U S  GDP expanded at 3 3  in the third quarter of 2017   the fastest pace of growth in three years  Per a report by the Commerce Department  consumer spending advanced 2 3  in 3Q17  Unemployment in the United States is currently at a 17 year low  In October  the United States created 261 000 jobs in October while the unemployment rate declined from 4 2  to 4 1 Solid Sector Positioning  ProjectionsMachinery stocks are broadly grouped under   one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors  Year to date  the industrial products sector  one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors  has clocked a gain of 20 1   outperforming the S P 500 s climb of 16 9  The Industrial Products sector put up an impressive 19 6  growth in earnings in third quarter 2017  Per our latest  report  earnings growth of 21 3  is projected for fourth quarter 2017  It is one the four sectors that is expected to log double digit growth in earnings in the fourth quarter We put our Sectors  all 16 of them  into two groups  the top half  i e   sectors with the best average Zacks Rank  and the bottom half  the sectors with the worst average Zacks Rank   In the last 10 years  using a one week rebalance  the top half beat the bottom half by more than twice as much   To learn more visit     The industrial products sector  with a Zacks Sector Rank  5  remains in the top half What Factors Will Help Sustain Growth The continuous advancements in technologies applied in agriculture and mining industries keep demand strong for farming and mining machinery  Long term demand for agricultural equipment will be buoyed by increased global demand for food Further  favorable trends resulting from a growing  more affluent and increasing population along with rising living standards and dietary improvements will provide ample opportunity for long term growth  Healthy growth in demand for packaged foods and beverages across nations  especially in emerging countries  are significantly increasing the use of highly sophisticated food processing and packaging equipment Construction machinery demand will remain strong in the years to come aided by population growth  urbanization  increased energy consumption as well as an expanding middle class  Further  increasing demand for global infrastructure  such as roads  housing  airports  and energy will help sustain growth We believe that implementation of the Trump government s growth policies  especially the proposed  1 trillion spending on infrastructure improvement  will be a boon for industrial machinery stocks Thus we suggest you to stay invested in the sector to reap the benefits of healthy prospects ahead  To zero in on stocks that are winning currently and have the potential to gain further  we have opted for one of the relatively new investment techniques  by betting on stocks near a 52 week high  The 52 week investment strategy relies on the new investment mantra   buy high and sell higher  Why These Stocks Are Good BetsInvesting in stocks near their 52 week high is similar to following the momentum strategy  which is based on the premise that once a trend is established  it is likely to continue  The surge can be attributed to a broad set of factors including impressive sales  robust profitability and bullish earnings prospects  Major developments may also send stocks soaring Meanwhile  stocks that are trading near their 52 week highs carry the risk of declining rapidly as the market might consider them overvalued  But the positives seem to outweigh drawbacks Notably  momentum investors strongly believe in  the trend is your friend   which means stocks that are growing will continue to grow  They make short term choices among stocks that are scaling up and sell them at the first sign of a downtrend  The basic idea is that once a trend is recognized  it is likely to continue and the chances of a reversal are minimal Consequently  picking such stocks might help investors earn higher returns in the short term  However  this is only a speculative strategy and not meant for the faint hearted Stocks That Fit the BillGiven their positive earnings revisions  we believe these four industrial stocks  all of which are near their 52 week highs  will continue moving north for now  The stocks carry a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and have a Momentum Style Score of A or B  You can see  Deere   Companymanufactures and distributes agriculture

equipment and infrastructure maintenance equipment for governmental and industrial use worldwide  The stock has a Zacks Rank  2 and a Momentum Style Score of A  The company has delivered positive

consumer packaging products in North and South America  Europe  Australia  and Asia  The stock carries a Zacks Rank  2 and has a Momentum Style Score of B  The company has a long term expected

of  55 07 Looking AheadThese stocks have growth potential as evident from their estimate revisions and price appreciation  We anticipate these stocks to yield strong returns in the short term and

149289,370805,DE,ABB To Grow On Robust Demand  Buyouts   Cost Restructuring,opinion,Investors seem to be optimistic about ABB Ltd s   NYSE ABB   recent earnings beat streak  as the company s earnings have trumped estimates in each of the four trailing quarters  We expect this Zacks Rank  2  Buy  company to continue to accelerate its momentum  driven by contribution from its accretive acquisitions  successful restructuring efforts and cost saving initiatives ABB s shares have fared well in recent times as well  reflecting investor confidence  The company s shares have appreciated 24 2  over the past year  outperforming the  s average gain of 16 6   Read on to find out the key growth drivers for ABB right now Growth DriversSteady growth in revenues in the Electrification Products and Robotics   Motion segments has been a key contributor to ABB s momentum  The Robotics and Motion segment is has been enjoying robust demand patterns in robotics and light industry  while the Electrification Products unit is benefiting from positive construction and utility demand  particularly in the AMEA region ABB has earned a solid reputation for winning strategic awards and forging important partnerships  ABB recently teamed up with Hewlett Packard Enterprise to integrate its industry leading digital offering   ABB Ability   with Hewlett Packard s innovative hybrid information technology solutions  The partnership will leverage ABB s expertise in operations technologies   OT   and Hewlett Packard Enterprise s proficiency in IT to come up with joint industry solutions  which will help turn industrial data into insights and automatic action ABB also joined forces with Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd  recently to share knowledge and promote the benefits of collaborative robots  particularly those having dual arm designs We are highly optimistic about ABB s recent  2 6 billion acquisition of GE Industrial Solutions  which will fortify its global foothold in electrification  and expand the company s access to the North American market Further  the company anticipates the recent B R buyout to bridge the gap in machine and factory automation  while also generating tremendous operational synergies  ABB anticipates these acquisitions to help shift its focus to higher growth segments  consequently becoming more competitive  ABB also agreed to acquire the data transmission business of the KEYMILE Group in July  This buyout is expected to expand communication networks business footprint in the industrial  transportation and infrastructure domains The company is highly positive about the impact of its White Collar Productivity savings program  which has garnered significant cost savings over the past few quarters  Moreover  positive investments made by all three major markets of the company  namely utilities  industry and transport   infrastructure  are expected to boost the financials  going forward The consensus analyst community s optimism toward the stock is reflected in its upward earnings estimate revisions  The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current year earnings being revised upward to  1 24 from  1 22 over the past 60 days  and reflects bullish analyst sentiment ABB Ltd Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    Despite these positives  ABB s exposure to oil and gas markets makes it susceptible to current price volatility in the market  posing a severe challenge  We believe lower capital spending for the upstream energy end markets might hurt financials as well  In addition to these  sluggish industrial production and the projected slowdown are weighing on the company s financials  Currently  the industrial slowdown in China is posing another threat to the company s profitability  and might impact its performance in the upcoming quarters Other Stocks to ConsiderSome top ranked stocks in the broader space are Deere   Company   NYSE DE    Briggs   Stratton Corporation   NYSE BGG   and Alamo Group  Inc    NYSE ALG    each sporting a Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy   You can see  Deere   Company generated four outstanding beats over the trailing four quarters  for an impressive average positive surprise of 19 5  Briggs   Stratton has beaten estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters  and generated an average positive surprise of 8 6  during the same period Alamo Group has a decent earnings surprise history for the same time frame  having beaten estimates twice for an average beat of 6 1  Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as the  1 stock to buy according to Zacks research It s not the one you think ,2017-12-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/abb-to-grow-on-robust-demand-buyouts--cost-restructuring-200272849,200272849

149304,370820,DE,Deere  CenturyLink  Mosaic  Sociedad Quimica Y Minera De Chile S A  And Intrepid Potash Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   Dec 4  2017    highlights Deere   Company   NYSE DE   as the Bull of the Day and CenturyLink  Inc    NYSE CTL   as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on the Mosaic Company   NYSE MOS    Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile S A    NYSE SQM   and Intrepid Potash  Inc    NYSE IPI   Here is a synopsis of all five stocks  Last week s tech selloff underscored the fact that some investors are starting to focus on other areas after the sector s years long rally  Luckily  there is plenty of strength in other core areas of the economy  including agriculture and industrials  and investors searching for a great pick in these segments should look no further than Deere   Company Through its John Deere brand  Deere   Company is a leading manufacturer of agricultural  construction  and forestry machinery  The company was founded in 1837 and is one of the most historic American corporations around  but management s commitment to investment and innovation has kept it on the cutting edge through the years Deere   Company has outperformed its industry peers over the past year  and another strong quarter has sent the stock soaring to a new 52 week high  Positive estimate revisions have been pouring in  and DE is currently sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  Latest Earnings ReportDeere reported its fourth quarter fiscal 2017 results on Nov  22  The company posted earnings of  1 57 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 46 and surging about 74  year over year  Total equipment revenues of  7 09 billion were up 26  from the year ago period and ahead of our consensus estimate of  6 91 billion Including financial services  total net sales came in at  8 02 billion  which marked year over year growth of 23   Geographically speaking  Deere witnessed sales growth of 23  in the United States and Canada  while sales in the rest of the world climbed 30   Looking ahead  this international growth should continue to be aided by a recovery in the dairy and livestock markets throughout Europe Segment wise  revenues in the Agriculture   Turf unit were up 22  to  5 44 billion  Operating profit at this segment climbed 57  year over year to reach  584 million  Construction   Forestry sales were up about 37  to  1 66 billion  This unit contributed about  85 million to Deere s total operating profit  an improvement from the  17 million loss reported in the year ago period Perhaps most impressively  Deere reported cash and cash equivalents of  9 33 billion at the end of fiscal 2017  up about 115  from the  4 34 billion held at the end of fiscal 2016  The company will spend about  5 billion in cash to acquire Wirten Group in a deal that is expected to close this month Wirtgen is expected to add about 12  to Deere s sales for fiscal 2018 and about 6  for the fiscal first quarter  After accounting for acquisition costs  Wirtgen is expected to contribute about  75 million in operating profit and  25 million in net income in fiscal 2018  As new competition and changing consumer trends continue to mess with the status quo  the telecommunications industry has been forced to adapt  Investment and consolidation are high  and shifting business models are aplenty  Unfortunately  some legacy names such as CenturyLink  Inc    have struggled to compete CenturyLink operates as a local phone carrier and internet service provider throughout the United States  The company s services are currently available in 22 states  In November  CenturyLink completed its merger with Level 3 Communications  underscoring its attempt to focus on business customers CenturyLink has attempted to shift with the times  but its success has been limited  Management has now missed earnings estimates in four consecutive quarters  and the stock is down about 40  on the year  CenturyLink is currently sporting a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  Latest Earnings ReportCenturyLink reported its third quarter fiscal 2017 results on Nov  8  The company posted adjusted earnings of  0 42 per share  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 45  Net income for the quarter was  92 million  down from the  152 posted in the year ago period  Total revenues of  4 034 billion were down about 8  year over year and below our consensus estimate of  4 061 billion CenturyLink faced challenges in all of its revenue streams  Strategic revenues were down about 7   while Legacy revenues slipped 10   Its Other Services revenues were flat on the year  while Data Integration revenues plummeted 18  making this the company s worst performing unit Unfortunately  the company s financial positioned has simply worsened  Operating margin in the quarter was 12 1   down from 13 5  in the prior year quarter  Adjusted free cash flow in the quarter was  109 million  down from  186 million last year  The company now has just  160 million in cash and cash equivalents  and its debt pile has grown to nearly  25 billion Total access lines at the end of the quarter were down 6 5   while high speed broadband customer count slipped about 3 1  year over year What s worse  Enterprise segment revenues were down 11 2  in the quarter  CenturyLink intends for the Level 3 acquisition to help it establish dominance in the enterprise telecom field  but it is already starting from a weak position on that end Additional Content Fertilizer Industry Gains Stability  3 Stocks to BuyThe fertilizer industry is showing signs of stability of late  taking succor from improved pricing and demand dynamics for certain major crop nutrients and a firming farm economy While still weak agricultural commodity prices remain a roadblock  strong usage in major consumer markets is driving demand for primary crop nutrients  Needless to say  the ever growing world population and the concomitant need to beef up food supply to feed more mouths remains a prime catalyst for fertilizer demand growth The  has outperformed the broader market over the past three months  While the industry has gained roughly 12 1   the S P 500 has returned around 6 3  Let s do a quick health check of the fertilizer industry by delving deeper into certain key factors Potash Market Showing StrengthThe potash market has stabilized this year from the 2016 lows  Potash prices have recovered this year after feeling gravity s pull in 2016  supported by improving demand and tighter supply conditions  Most producers of this major nutrient  including Potash Corp  of Saskatchewan and Agrium witnessed a spike in prices in the third quarter that drove their potash margins Demand for potash also has been strong in key markets  Potash Corp   a major producer of the nutrient  saw healthy demand for potash in the third quarter and expects consistent customer engagement through the balance of 2017  supported by healthy consumption trends with contracts with both China and India in place  The company envisions 2017 to be a record year for potash demand and expects global demand in the band of 62 million to 65 million tons Potash Corp  sees strong consumption in China driven by a shift to more potassium intensive crops like vegetables and fruits  The demand environment also remains healthy in Brazil  another important market  driven by higher crop acreage and application rates  Strong affordability and the need to replenish nutrients are also expected to support fertilizer demand in North America Moreover  the government of India s move to cut the Goods and Services Tax  GST  rate on fertilizers from 12  to 5  is a welcome news for famers in that country  It also augurs well for potash demand in India  one of the world s top buyers of the nutrient According to Agrium  potash market is expected to remain tight through the rest of 2017  As such  higher demand from major consumers coupled with tight supply should further drive up potash prices A Rebound in NitrogenAnother positive is the recent rebound in the nitrogen space  The nitrogen market is seeing improving demand and pricing fundamentals  According to CF Industries  a major producer  the third quarter witnessed a rapid increase in the global price of urea from second quarter  which was driven by considerably lower Chinese exports and strong global demand  especially in India and Brazil   The company expects consistent global nitrogen demand growth moving ahead Moreover  Agrium  in its third quarter call  said that nitrogen prices have witnessed sharp increase  of more than 50   since the lows seen in July  buoyed by low level of Chinese urea production and solid import demand from India  Higher domestic coal prices coupled with increased focus on reducing pollution has led to a reduction in Chinese urea production Agrium also sees positive supply demand fundamentals for nitrogen in the medium term  Continued strong demand and tighter market conditions augur well for nitrogen prices in the fourth quarter Phosphate Market a Mixed BagExcess capacity continues to hurt prices of phosphate as witnessed in the first three quarters of 2017  Phosphate markets are expected to remain oversupplied through this year  with new capacity reportedly coming from Morocco and Saudi Arabia   thereby putting pressure on prices However  demand environment for the nutrient remains favorable  The Mosaic Company  one of the biggest producers of phosphate  noted in its September quarter earnings call that demand remains strong as farmers are looking to replace nutrients from the soil in most of the major regions globally  The company also envisions demand growth to absorb new supply additions A Stabilizing Farm EconomyU S  farm income is expected to tick up this year after three straight years of decline due to low commodity prices  Per the U S  Department of Agriculture s  USDA  recently released November 2017 forecast  net U S  farm income is expected to go up 2 7  to  63 2 billion in 2017 The upturn in profits is likely be driven by higher cash receipts from the sale of crop inventories  The USDA expects cash receipts to go up 2 4  to  365 1 billion in 2017 While the USDA s profit forecast for this year is still a far cry from the record  123 8 billion achieved in 2013  it gives signs of stability in the farm economy and suggests that the sector may have finally hit the bottom  Higher anticipated farm income is expected to positively influence farmers  nutrient purchasing decisions Crop Pricing Remains a ConcernThe prevailing softness in agricultural commodity pricing remains a concern for fertilizer and agricultural chemicals companies  Prices of major crops  such as corn and soybeans  remain at their multi year lows as markets remain awash with grains  An expected bumper corn and soybean harvest is likely to put a cap on crop prices in 2017  The USDA s harvest outlook indicates another bumper year of production  The USDA  in its November report  raised its corn harvest forecast for the 2017 18 crop year  It now sees corn production to be 14 578 billion bushels  up 298 million from its October forecast  on record yield  The USDA also predicts record soybean production of 4 425 billion bushels  This is expected to aggravate the grain glut and restrict crop prices 3 Fertilizer Stocks to Bear FruitDespite a few lingering headwinds  the overall fundamentals for the fertilizer industry are improving on the back of improved demand scenario for nutrients and an upswing in the farm economy  Moreover  the constant need of farmers to nourish their crops  replenish nutrients in the soil following a harvest and boost yields to feed a growing world support the bullish case for fertilizers Below we highlight three fertilizer stocks  armed with a solid

149355,370871,DE,This Bull Won t Die,opinion,"Just a short note for today as I am taking a quick vacation for the  Thanksgiving  holiday 
As I noted this past weekend 

Thanksgiving week is traditionally an extremely  light  trading period where the  inmates are running the asylum   With the market more overbought now than at any other period since 2011  a consolidation or further corrective action is entirely possible 
While some  caution  is advised  it is NOT advisable to act  emotionally  to swings due to the low volume trading that will be occurring 
While the market is extremely overbought  the bullish trends remain intact  Furthermore  the last two months of the year are typically bullish for asset prices  Understanding this  these conditions keep portfolios allocated towards equity risk currently  But we do so with an eye on the risk 

As shown below  the market is clearly overbought as the  slow motion  correction over the last 3 weeks has begun to deteriorate the September  buy  signal  While corrections have been extremely shallow  less than 3    a continued stagnation or deterioration over the next week will likely trigger a short term  sell signal   This would set the stage for a mild correction in the second week of December as liquidations by mutual funds to pay out annual distributions occurs  Such a correction would work off some of the existing overbought condition and set the stage for a year end  Santa Claus  rally 

The bigger concern  as stated over the last two weeks  is when the calendar turns into 2018  There is a risk of a deeper correction as tax selling  concerns over monetary policy and geopolitical stresses potentially take hold  However  that is a story we will deal with over the next couple of weeks as the markets continue to develop 
For now  I am going to return to my seat  put my tray table up and settle back for my flight  I think I hear the sound of the stirring of a margarita glass and I am seriously stuck on the  salted vs non salted  rim question 
THE RETURN OF THE MARKET WITH NO MEMORY  
  by Doug Kass

Welcome to the party  pal    John McLane  Bruce Willis    Die Hard 

The conditioning of investors has been to buy every dip and that won t change swiftly  old habits  nine year old bull markets and  Die Hard s  John McLane won t die easily 
For many  it will be increasingly difficult to navigate a market dominated by the overly popular ETFs and quant  volatility trending and risk parity  strategies that worship at the altar of price momentum  It is also because the  buy the dip  mentality remains indelibly etched on the forehead of most investors and traders that the Pavlovian reaction won t die easily 
Favoring the bulls is the diminished number of publicly held companies outstanding  from more than 7 600 in 2000 to 3 800 in 2017   a 17  reduction in the float of the remaining companies via corporate buybacks  and still abundant liquidity  And on top of this  as previously mentioned  is the market s participants confidence in buying the dips 
Favoring the bears is a stalled and likely ineffective tax reform initiative  an outgrowth of a dysfunctional White House   a mature business cycle  slowing domestic economic and corporate profit growth relative to consensus expectations  and elevated valuations   all among the issues discussed in yesterday s opening missive  And on top of all this is the ever present risk of the Global Short Volatility Bubble that could precipitate a  flash crash  at almost any time 
The markets are likely to be whippy in the near term  subject to year end influences  The expectation or promise of a reduction in capital gains taxes could be another important factor weighing on the markets 
While my short book is sizable  I plan to trade opportunistically around it from both the long and short sides over the balance of the year 
Bottom Line

I don t know 
That s nice 
I really like that
You know what I am going to do 
I am going to leave your words on this blackboard for all my classes to enjoy
Giving you full credit of course  Mr  Spicoli    Mr  Hand   Fast Times at Ridgemont High

On a daily basis  the talking heads parade in the business media with self confident views of markets and economic growth  But the reality is that the only certainty is the lack of certainty  Despite their confidence and protestations  this is not likely a good backdrop to exhibit self  confidence in view 
Too many are confident in view at a time when there are so many political  geopolitical  economic and market outcomes that potentially are adverse 
The above is a blueprint of my strategy and my attempt to game an inconsistent market with no memory from day to day  and one dominated by investment products governed by machines and algorithms relying on price momentum strategies that are agnostic to balance sheets  income statements and private market value 
If it sounds like I am confused and uncertain as to where the market is moving over the short term  I am  Others should be as well given the wide complexities of the factors that contribute to the investment mosaic today 
However  it should be reasonable to think  given the many factors raised in my Diary  that while the nine year old bull market may not die easily  it will die 
I continue to believe that the complexion of the market is changing  and for the worse  The technicals are deteriorating  and so are the Russell 2000 and junk bond Indices  but the machines  algorithms and ETFs run the asylum and a move straight down seems unlikely unless a Black or Orange Swan emerges 
Regardless of my view  it s probably a good time to try to stay out of trouble with larger than average cash positions 
My guess is that the market without memory from day to day will frustrate both bulls and bears with its inconsistencies in the days and weeks ahead 
I plan to remain flexible and opportunistic  placing a greater than normal emphasis in my portfolio on trading versus  investing over the rest of 2017 
I am still very bearish  however  using a three  to nine month time frame in light of my view that there is roughly four times more risk than reward  And I recently have added a number of individual short names into my portfolio   namely General Motors  NYSE GM    CSX  NASDAQ CSX   Union Pacific  NYSE UNP   Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  and Deere  NYSE DE

149372,370888,DE,Favorable Earnings Trend Expected To Continue,opinion,"Note  The following is an excerpt from this week s report  You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods  
Here are the key points      We are still a few weeks away from the start of the Q3 earnings season  but early indicators are pointing to a continuation of the positive earnings trend that we saw in the last three quarterly reporting cycles       Estimates for Q3 have come down since the quarter got underway  but the magnitude of negative revisions nevertheless compares favorably to other recent periods  In other words  Q3 estimates have come down  but the extent of the decline has been modest relative to other recent comparable periods      Total Q3 earnings for the S P 500 index are expected to be up  4 2  from the same period last year on  5 6  higher revenues  This would follow double digit earnings growth in each of the preceding two quarters      The Q3 earnings growth drops to  2 5   from  4 2   when the strong Energy sector growth is excluded from the aggregate picture  Construction  Basic Materials and Conglomerates are the other sectors  in addition to Energy  with double digit earnings growth in Q3      Q3 earnings growth is expected to be in negative territory for 7 of the 16 Zacks sectors  with double digit declines for the Autos and Aerospace sectors      For full year 2017  total earnings for the S P 500 index are expected to be up  8 1  on  5  higher revenues  which would follow  0 7  earnings growth on  2 1  higher revenues in 2016  Index earnings are expected to be up  11  in 2018 and  8 8  in 2019       Energy growth is expected to turn positive for the small cap S P 600 index  with total earnings for the index expected to be up  12 8  from the same period last year on  5 1  higher revenues  This would follow persistent earnings declines for the small cap index   S P 600 earnings growth was negative in 3 of the last 4 quarters      Strong growth from the Finance  Technology and Energy sectors is driving the small cap growth  The Finance sector s role is particularly notable in the small cap index  with Q3 earnings growth dropping to  1 1   from  12 8   on an ex Finance basis  The chart below shows how estimates for Q3 have evolved since the start of the period 

As you can see  the current  4 2  earnings growth estimate has dropped from the  6 3  growth pace expected at the start of the period  This magnitude of decline is about in line with the revisions trend we saw ahead of the start of the Q2 earnings season and a notable improvement over the trend we have been seeing over the last few years Estimates have fallen for 14 of the 16 Zacks sectors  with Energy  and Autos experiencing the most negative revisions  Estimates have gone up for the Technology and Industrial Products sectors  which can be seen in the revisions trend for operators like Caterpillar  NYSE CAT      Deere   Co      NVIDIA    and others We have one earnings report still to go before  officially  closing the books on the Q2 earnings season  but total earnings in the quarter were up  11 6  on  6 1  higher revenues  the second quarter in a row of double digit earnings growth for the S P 500 index  earnings were up  13 5  in Q1   What this means is that the growth pace is steadily decelerating  as you can see in the chart below 

Unlike the year over year growth pace  the dollar amount of total earnings is expected to remain in record territory  as the chart below shows 

Please note that the June quarter tally in the chart above was a new all time quarterly record for the S P 500 index  But the record isn t expected to last much longer  with each of the next two quarterly tallies surpassing the preceding period s record

149404,370920,DE,Earnings Season Isn t Over  3 Stocks That Could Still Beat Estimates,opinion,"Second quarter earnings season is wrapping up  and results have once again proven to be relatively strong across the board  Sure  certain industries are struggling  but the economy appears to be healthy and our major indexes are continuing to hover near all time highs 
With that said  there s obviously been plenty of positive earnings surprises that have led to skyrocketing share prices  But if you re worried that you missed out on a chance to profit from an earnings beat  have no fear earnings season isn t over just yet 
Luckily  we can use the Zacks Earnings ESP to gauge whether a company is poised to beat earnings estimates  Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions 
This is done because  generally speaking  if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release  it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago 
When combining a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better and a positive Earnings ESP  stocks have produced a positive earnings about 70  of the time  Want to target stocks that are more likely to beat estimates before Q2 reporting season is over  Check out these three companies that have yet to report 
1        Walmart Stores  Inc     NYSE WMT   
Walmart has been pumping a ton of cash into revamping its stores and expanding its e commerce business  Therefore  it will likely face tough year over year comparisons this quarter  In fact  the current Zacks Consensus Estimate is calling for earnings of  1 07 per share  which would represent a decline of nearly 0 5  from the year ago quarter 
However  analyst sentiment has been improving recently  and the Most Accurate Estimate currently sits a penny higher giving Walmart a positive Earnings ESP of 0 94   Combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy   this should give investors additional confidence heading into its earnings announcement on Thursday morning 
 
2        Deere   Company    NYSE DE   
Best known for its line of John Deere agricultural equipment  Deere   Company is scheduled to release its fiscal third quarter earnings on Friday morning  The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently calling for earnings of  1 95 per share a nearly 26  increase from the prior year result  Deere   Company has also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of over 70  in each of the trailing four quarters 
Analyst sentiment is strong heading into the report  as we ve seen three positive estimate revisions in just the past seven days  Additionally  the Most Accurate Estimate sits at  1 98 per share  which gives Deere   Company a positive Earnings ESP of 1 54   This fact  along with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and the company s strong earnings surprise history  should have investors more confident about the chances of a beat 
 
3        Best Buy Co   Inc     NYSE BBY   
The retail sector has had a tough earnings season  but Best Buy has proven its ability to fend off competition from the likes of Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   recently  In fact  the company has surpassed consensus estimates by an average of nearly 34  in each of the last four quarters  This quarter  the Zacks Consensus Estimate is calling for earnings of  0 63 per share  which would represent year over year growth of just over 10  
Best Buy is scheduled to announce its earnings results before the market opens on August 29  and heading into the report  the company is sporting a positive Earnings ESP of 1 59   The stock also has an  A  grade for Value in our Style Scores system  and its Zacks Rank  2  Buy  is looking strong as we approach its report date

Research provides analysis on Walmart Stores  Inc   NYSE   NYSE WMT       Deere   Company  NYSE   NYSE DE      and Best Buy Co   Inc   NYSE   NYSE BBY      Here is a synopsis of all three stocks   Chinese stocks have come into favor recently as investors have become more comfortable with the reporting  I remember the skepticism investors had over early Alibaba  NYSE BABA  numbers  Are the books cooked  That skepticism carried over across the entire spectrum of Chinese ADRs  Now that these companies have been around for a few years  that skepticism is starting to fade and investors are more and more open to investing in China One such company is today s Bull of the Day  TAL Education Group  NYSE       TAL Education Group  through its subsidiaries  provides K 12 after school tutoring services in the People s Republic of China  It offers tutoring services to K 12 students covering various academic subjects  including mathematics  physics  chemistry  biology  history  geography  political science  English  and Chinese  The company also provides tutoring services primarily through small classes  including Xueersi Peiyou  Mobby  and Firstleap tutoring services  personalized premium services under Izhikang name  and online courses TAL has been a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  because of the estimate revisions analysts have made on this year and next year s numbers  Two analysts have increased their estimates for the current year while three analysts have done so for next year s numbers  The overall effect has increased our Zacks Consensus Estimate from  1 92 to  2 03 for the current year while pushing up next year s number from  3 00 to  3 44  These numbers represent growth of 56  for the current year  accelerating to 69 18  for next year  It s important to note that these EPS numbers have not been adjusted for yesterday s 6 to 1 stock split Bear When oil prices were low and the US dollar was riding high  Airplane stocks were soaring  Over the last year  the industry has returned 10 6   Lagging well behind the rest of the airline industry  down 33 9  YTD  is today s Bear of the Day  Spirit Airlines  NASDAQ       Spirit Airlines  Inc  provides low fare airline services  As of February 7  2017  it operated approximately 420 daily flights to 59 destinations in the United States  the Caribbean  and Latin America  As of December 31  2016  the company had a fleet of 95 Airbus single aisle aircraft comprising 29 A319s  45 A320ceos  5 A320neos  and 16 A321ceos  It offers tickets through its call centers and airport ticket counters  as well as online through   and through various third parties  including online  traditional travel agents  and electronic global distribution systems   Spirit Airlines is a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  because of multiple earnings estimate revisions to the downside  Over the last thirty days  eight analysts have dropped their EPS estimates for the current year while seven analysts have dropped their estimates for next year  The overall impact has cut down the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year from  4 21 to  3 68  Next year s consensus has plummeted from  4 88 to  4 26  Based on these revisions  the current year EPS is slated to contract 10 82  That s the bad news  the good news is that next year the company should return to EPS growth  with 15 57  year over year numbers projected  Revenue growth this year should come in around 15 86  in the face of the EPS contraction Not enough to convince investors to support the current share price though  After failing to break through the  60 level in May 2017 shares have been in a freefall  Following the most recent earnings report shares have gapped down and sold off under  40  The 50 day moving average looms above as overhead resistance around  48 Additional content Earnings Season Not Over  3 Stocks That Could Still Beat EstimatesSecond quarter earnings season is wrapping up  and results have once again proven to be relatively strong across the board  Sure  certain industries are struggling  but the economy appears to be healthy and our major indexes are continuing to hover near all time highs With that said  there s obviously been plenty of positive earnings surprises that have led to skyrocketing share prices  But if you re worried that you missed out on a chance to profit from an earnings beat  have no fear earnings season isn t over just yet Luckily  we can use the Zacks Earnings ESP to gauge whether a company is poised to beat earnings estimates  Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions This is done because  generally speaking  if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release  it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago When combining a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better and a positive Earnings ESP  stocks have produced a positive earnings about 70  of the time  Want to target stocks that are more likely to beat estimates before Q2 reporting season is over  Check out these three companies that have yet to report 1        Walmart Stores  Inc   NYSE     Walmart has been pumping a ton of cash into revamping its stores and expanding its e commerce business  Therefore  it will likely face tough year over year comparisons this quarter  In fact  the current Zacks Consensus Estimate is calling for earnings of  1 07 per share  which would represent a decline of nearly 0 5  from the year ago quarter However  analyst sentiment has been improving recently  and the Most Accurate Estimate currently sits a penny higher giving Walmart a positive Earnings ESP of 0 94   Combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy   this should give investors additional confidence heading into its earnings announcement on Thursday morning 2        Deere   Company  NYSE     Best known for its line of John Deere agricultural equipment  Deere   Company is scheduled to release its fiscal third quarter earnings on Friday morning  The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently calling for earnings of  1 95 per share a nearly 26  increase from the prior year result  Deere   Company has also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of over 70  in each of the trailing four quarters Analyst sentiment is strong heading into the report  as we ve seen three positive estimate revisions in just the past seven days  Additionally  the Most Accurate Estimate sits at  1 98 per share  which gives Deere   Company a positive Earnings ESP of 1 54   This fact  along with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and the company s strong earnings surprise history  should have investors more confident about the chances of a beat 3        Best Buy Co   Inc   NYSE     The retail sector has had a tough earnings season  but Best Buy has proven its ability to fend off competition from the likes of Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  recently  In fact  the company has surpassed consensus estimates by an average of nearly 34  in each of the last four quarters  This quarter  the Zacks Consensus Estimate is calling for earnings of  0 63 per share  which would represent year over year growth of just over 10  Best Buy is scheduled to announce its earnings results before the market opens on August 29  and heading into the report  the company is sporting a positive Earnings ESP of 1 59   The stock also has an  A  grade for Value in our Style Scores system  and its Zacks Rank  2  Buy  is looking

149478,370994,DE,Start Of The Q2 Earnings Season,opinion,"Note  The following is an excerpt from this week s report  You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods  
Here are the key points      The Q2 earnings season takes the spotlight with quarterly reports from the big banks next week  but companies with fiscal quarters ending in May have been reporting results already and these reports form part of our Q2 tally       Of such companies with fiscal quarters end in May  we have seen results from 23 S P 500 members  This is too small a sample to draw any firm conclusions from  But for whatever it is worth  the growth and proportion of positive surprises for these 23 index members are tracking above what we had seen from the same cohort of companies in other recent periods      Q2 Estimates have come down since the quarter got underway  but the magnitude of negative revisions nevertheless compares favorably to other recent periods      Total Q2 earnings for the S P 500 index are expected to be up  5 7  from the same period last year on  4 6  higher revenues  The Energy  Aerospace  Finance  Technology  Construction and Industrial Products are expected to be big growth drivers in Q2  with the quarterly earnings growth pace dropping to  3 3  on an ex Energy basis       Beyond Q2  total earnings for the S P 500 index are currently expected to grow by  6 3  on  4 5  higher revenues in the September quarter and  9 8  on  5 3  higher revenues in Q4        For full year 2017  total earnings for the index are expected to be up  7 4  on  4 2  higher revenues  which would follow  1 1  earnings growth on  2 1  higher revenues in 2016  Index earnings are expected to be up  11 3  in 2018 and  9 2  in 2019      The Energy  Technology and Finance sectors are the biggest earnings contributors in 2017   2017 earnings growth would be  4 8  on an ex Energy basis Estimates for Q2 came down since the start of the period  as the chart below shows

This trend of negative revisions ahead of the start of each reporting cycles is not new  we have been seeing this play out quarter after quarter for more than 3 years  That said  the revisions trend has been moving in a favorable direction over the last two quarters and that same trend is even more at play in Q2 estimates  What this means is that while estimates for Q2 have come down  they haven t come down as much as would typically be the case by this time in other recent periods Estimates for 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors have come down since the start of the period  with Energy  Consumer Discretionary  Utilities  and Basic Materials suffering the most revisions Estimates for 6 Zacks sectors have gone up since the start of the period  with estimates for the Industrial Products and Transportation sectors going up the most  Positive estimate revisions for American Airlines     United Continental     Deere   Company  NYSE DE     and Caterpillar  NYSE CAT     reflect revision trends for these two sectors  Technology  Aerospace  Business Services  and Construction are the other sectors where Q2 estimates have gone up since the start of the quarter   Expectations for Q2   BeyondThe Q2 earnings season will follow the strong showing in the preceding reporting cycle when growth reached its highest level in more than five years and an above average proportion of companies beat revenue estimates  Importantly  estimates for Q2 didn t fall as much as had historically been the case  as mentioned earlier  The market will be looking for continuation of these favorable trends this earnings season  which has  officially  gotten underway already but wouldn t take the spotlight till next week  when the major banks come out with results  thankfully   Alcoa s report no longer serves that purpose  Of the standout sectors  earnings growth is expected to be the strongest for the Energy  expected to be up  247 7    Aerospace   48 8    Construction   15 7   and Industrial Products   11 8   sectors are expected to have double digit earnings growth in Q2 For Finance and Technology  the two biggest sectors in the index  earnings are expected to be up  5 9  and  10 1   respectively  This would follow double digit growth for both the sectors in the preceding period  Of these two major sectors  the Finance sector remains at risk of coming up short this earnings season for a number of reasons  including the unfavorable interest rate backdrop  the continued deceleration in loan growth and a likely sub par capital markets showing The chart below shows quarterly earnings growth expectations beyond Q2 

Unlike the year over year growth pace  the dollar amount of total earnings are expected to be in record territory in the coming quarters  particularly in the second half of the year  as the chart below shows 

The expected earnings total for Q2 at present is  1 8  below the all time quarterly record level achieved in 2016 Q4  With actual results typically coming in better than pre season expectations  we will likely see the final 2017 Q2 tally to exceed the 2016 Q4 record

149494,371010,DE,5 Industrial Stocks Near 52 Week Highs That Are Must Buys,opinion,The  sector  one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors  is currently enjoying a  of 2  just a pace behind the Auto  Tires and Trucks sector  This can be attributed to the fact that the majority of the 215 industries within this sector has performed well lately and are poised to take the momentum ahead in the coming quarters Some industries in the industrial products sector that are currently well placed in the top 10  of total 265 Zacks categorized industries include  and  industries which are in the top 2    and  industries are among the top 6  while Glass Products is among the top 7  In the past one year  the industrial products sector has clocked a gain of 28 9   outperformed the S P 500 s climb of 20 7   The U S  factory activity seems to have overcome its previous sluggishness driven by steady job creation  a stable dollar and strong overseas demand Economic indicators are indicating a healthy business environment in the industrial sector  For the first quarter of 2017  industrial production   a measure of output at factories  mines and utilities  rose at an annual rate of 1 5    The momentum continues in the second quarter with U S  industrial production logging growth of 1 1  in April compared with March  marking its biggest gain since Feb 2014  Industrial production remained unchanged in May compared with April  A drop in manufacturing output was mitigated by increases in mining and utilities output to keep the index flat in May  Though manufacturing output declined 0 4  in May  it is well within the range of normal monthly volatility  Factory production has gone up 1 4   in the last 12 months  Total industrial production in May was 2 2  above year earlier level Government policies encouraging better trade relations  increase in infrastructural investments  job creation and high consumer end demand will support growth  The Industrial Products sector put up a 28 5  growth in earnings in first quarter 2017 and an 11 7  growth in earnings is projected in second quarter 2017  The Industrial Products sector is one of the three sectors projected to log a double digit growth in the second quarter   Read more   Thus  investing in the industrial space makes perfect sense at this point  However  the question arises   how to make that choice  To zero in on stocks that are winning currently and have the potential to gain further  we have opted one tried and tested technique   picking stocks near their 52 week highs Why These Stocks are Good BetsInvesting in stocks near their 52 week high is similar to following the momentum strategy  which is based on the premise that once a trend is established  it is likely to continue  The surge is driven by a broad set of factors including impressive sales  robust profitability and bullish earnings prospects   Major developments may also send stocks soaring On the flipside  stocks that are trading near their 52 week highs carry the risk of falling fast as the market might consider them overvalued  But the positives seem to outweigh drawbacks Notably  momentum investors strongly believe in  the trend is your friend   which means stocks that are growing will continue to grow  They make short term choices among stocks that are scaling up and sell them at the first sign of a downtrend  The basic idea is that once a trend is recognized  it is likely to continue and the chances of a reversal are minimal Thus  picking such stocks might help investors earn higher returns in the short term  However  this is only a speculative strategy and not meant for the faint hearted Stocks That Fit the BillGiven their strong earnings history  positive earnings revisions and great value metrics  we believe these five industrial stocks  all of which are near their 52 week highs  will continue their uptrend for now  The stocks carry a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and have a  of  A  or  B   You can see  AGCO

149495,371011,DE,4 Agriculture Stocks That Will Help Your Portfolio Grow,opinion,Agriculture is a mammoth industry with stocks covering fertilizers  seeds  agricultural chemicals  farm equipment  food processing  and more  However  the industry tends to be cyclical in nature  It booms when commodity prices are high and the farmer s income is high  But as commodity prices fall  it takes the industry down with it Harvests in the last four years have been near record levels  However  these higher grain inventories pressurized commodity prices  and resulted in lower farm income  Industry demand in most global markets remains at historically low levels as a result of weaker economic conditions  Deteriorating farm economics negatively impacted farmer sentiment  which in turn affected demand for agricultural equipment demand  The companies responded by tuning down production and closely managing inventories However  things are looking up this year with companies delivering better results and improved outlook  In 2017  agricultural exports are projected to rise 3  to  134 billion  U S  agricultural exports are projected to account for 33  of farm sector gross earnings in 2017 We believe the agricultural play stocks are poised to gain in the long term  Given that the global population is expected to soar to 9 5 billion by 2050  the agricultural sector faces a huge challenge to produce enough food as arable land shrinks  To meet the increased demand for food  fiber  and feed  analysts suggest agricultural output will have to double by that year Maximizing crop yields and farm productivity will be vital  Companies that manufacture farm equipment such as tractors  harvesters  and sprayers will assume an increasingly important role  To sum up  farm equipment manufacturers have huge growth potential ahead  and consequently make for great investments Currently the Zacks categorized  is enjoying a  of 11  The favorable rank places the industry in the top 4  of the 250  groups enlisted  In the past one year  the Manufacturing   Farm Equipment industry has clocked a gain of 49 6   outperforming the S P 500 s advance of 17 9  In this context  we focus on four companies

149496,371012,DE,AGCO Or Lincoln Electric  Which Stock Is More Enticing Now ,opinion,"Industrial production  a measure of output at factories  mines and utilities  and one of the leading economic indicators for the industrial stocks  rose at an annual rate of 1 5   in first quarter 2017  The momentum continues in the second quarter with U S  industrial production logging growth of 1 1  in April compared with March  marking its biggest gain since Feb 2014  Industrial production remained unchanged in May compared with April The  sector  one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors  also put up a 28 5  growth in earnings in first quarter 2017 and 11 9  growth in earnings is projected in second quarter 2017  The Industrial Products sector is one of the three sectors projected to log a double digit growth in the second quarter   Read more   Economic indicators are indicating a healthy business environment for the industrial sector  Government policies encouraging better trade relations along with increase in infrastructural investments  job creation and high consumer end demand will support growth going ahead  Trump administration s plan to invest significantly in the country s infrastructure  if implemented  will boost growth of the industrial sector Thus  the industrial products sector is currently enjoying a  of 4  which puts it in the top 25  of the 16 sectors in our coverage  In the past one year  the industrial products sector has clocked a gain of 28 8   ahead of the S P 500 s climb of 17 3   

In this context  we focus on two industrial stocks  AGCO Corp    NYSE AGCO   and Lincoln Electric Holdings  Inc    NASDAQ LECO    AGCO is a leading manufacturer and distributor of agricultural equipment and related replacement parts with a market capitalization of  5 40 billion  Lincoln Electric is a manufacturer and reseller of welding and cutting products with a market capitalization of  6 06 billion 
While both the stocks carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   it will be interesting to see which stock is better positioned in terms of fundamentals  You can see  Other top ranked stocks in the same industry that are worth considering include Deere   Company   NYSE DE   sporting a Zacks Rank  1 and Alamo Group  Inc    NYSE ALG    carrying a Zacks Rank  2 Price PerformanceIn the last year  the Machinery industry has witnessed an increase of 38 8  while the industrial products sector rose 25 1   Both Lincoln Electric and AGCO have outpaced the industry and the sector with a respective 59 4  and 45 4  surge  This round goes to Lincoln Electric without a question ValuationThe EV EBITDA metric is usually used to compare two stocks within the same industry or sector and has an edge over other metrics such as P E because it is not affected by the different capital structures of the two companies Compared with machinery industry s EV EBITDA ratio of 12 42  Lincoln Electric is over priced  with a reading of 16 36  Meanwhile  AGCO is much cheaper with a trailing 12 month EV EBITDA of 10 59  Clearly  AGCO is cheaper in terms of valuation Inventory Turnover RatioIn the last year  the inventory turnover ratio for AGCO and Lincoln Electric has been 3 48  and 5 39   respectively  compared with the machinery industry s level of 3 88  
Lincoln Electric s higher inventory turnover than the industry average means that inventory is sold at a faster rate  suggesting inventory management effectiveness  Further  a high inventory turnover rate means less company resources are tied up in inventory and it is able to manage inventory effectively to generate revenues and avoid wastage  Clearly  Lincoln Electric has scored better on this front 

Return on AssetsReturn on assets  ROA  is one of the key financial ratios for industrial companies as they rely heavily on inventory to create revenues  An above average ROA denotes that the company in question is generating earnings by effectively managing assets AGCO and Lincoln Electric s ROA for the trailing 12 months  TTM  is 2 79  and 11 97   respectively  Lincoln Electric has scored above the industry s level of 4 29  while AGCO falls short  This round belongs to Lincoln Electric Dividend YieldIn the last one year period  AGCO s dividend yield was pegged at 0 82  while Lincoln Electric s is higher at 1 51    Though both have a dividend yield lower than the machinery industry s dividend yield of 1 66   on a comparative basis  Lincoln Electric scores better Debt  to  CapitalBoth Lincoln Electric and AGCO have lower debt to capital ratio of 47 36  and 39 65  respectively compared with the industry average of 68 45   However  AGCO holds an edge here Earnings Performance in the Last QuarterAGCO reported an adjusted loss of  0 02 per share in first quarter 2017  as against earnings of  0 11 per share recorded in first quarter 2016  The loss reported in the quarter was  however  narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of  0 17 Lincoln Electric reported earnings of  0 88 per share in first quarter 2017  up 16  year over year  Earnings also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 79 Earnings Surprise HistoryTaking a look at both the companies surprise history  AGCO has outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the four trailing quarters  with an average positive earnings surprise history of 40 39   Meanwhile  Lincoln Electric has delivered positive earnings surprises in the trailing four quarters  generating an average positive earnings surprise of 4 66  Earnings Estimate Revisions  GrowthOn one hand  earnings estimates for Lincoln Electric have gone up 0 3  for fiscal 2017 and 0 2  for fiscal 2018 in the past 60 days  On the other hand  estimates for AGCO have gone up 0 7  and 1 8  AGCO s fiscal 2017 earnings estimates reflects a year over year growth of 12 06  while the  fiscal 2018 earnings estimate reflects a year over year growth of 23 69   Lincoln Electric s earnings estimates for fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018 depict a projected growth of 11 69  and 9 59   respectively  AGCO has expected earnings per share growth rate of 12 41   much higher than Lincoln Electric s 9 90  AGCO is a clear winner here ConclusionOur comparative analysis shows that Lincoln Electric holds an edge over AGCO when considering price performance  profitability  inventory turnover and dividend yield  However  when considering valuation  leverage  earnings surprise history and earnings growth projections  AGCO seems to be the preferred stock  Since the scales are balanced  both these Zacks Rank  2 stocks would make great additions to your portfolio Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest Strategies

149526,371042,DE,Why Deere   Company  DE  Stock Might Be A Great Pick,opinion,One stock that might be an intriguing choice for investors right now is Deere   Company   NYSE DE    This is because this security in the Manufacturing   Farm Equipment space is seeing solid earnings estimate revision activity  and is in great company from a Zacks Industry Rank perspective This is important because  often times  a rising tide will lift all boats in an industry  as there can be broad trends taking place in a segment that are boosting securities across the board  This is arguably taking place in the Manufacturing   Farm Equipment space as it currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 15 out of more than 250 industries  suggesting it is well positioned from this perspective  especially when compared to other segments out there Meanwhile  Deere   Company is actually looking pretty good on its own too  The firm has seen solid earnings estimate revision activity over the past month  suggesting analysts are becoming a bit more bullish on the firm s prospects in both the short and long term Deere   Company Price and Consensus   In fact  over the past month  current quarter estimates have risen from  1 55 per share to  1 85 per share  while current year estimates have risen from  4 95 per share to  6 31 per share  This has helped DE to earn a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   further underscoring the company s solid position  You can see  So  if you are looking for a decent pick in a strong industry  consider Deere   Company  Not only is its industry currently in the top third  but it is seeing solid estimate revisions as of late  suggesting it could be a very interesting choice for investors seeking a name in this great industry segment Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana Ignited by new referendums and legislation  this industry is expected to blast from an already robust  6 7 billion to  20 2 billion in 2021  Early investors stand to make a killing  but you have to be ready to act and know just where to look ,2017-06-19,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-deere---company-(de)-stock-might-be-a-great-pick-200196006,200196006
149527,371043,DE,Will Earnings Growth Continue In Q2 ,opinion,"Note  The following is an excerpt from this week s  report  You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actuals and estimates for the current and following periods  
Here are the key points      The Q2 earnings season wouldn t take the spotlight till the week of July 10th when the big banks will come out with quarterly reports  But companies with fiscal quarters ending in May have starting reporting already and these reports form part of our Q2 tally       Of such companies with fiscal quarters end in May  we have seen results from 7 S P 500 members  This is too small a sample to draw any firm conclusions from  But for whatever it is worth  the growth and proportion of positive surprises for these 7 index members are tracking above what we had seen from the same cohort of companies in other recent periods      Q2 Estimates have come down since the quarter got underway  but the magnitude of negative revisions nevertheless compares favorably to other recent periods      Total Q2 earnings for the S P 500 index are expected to be up  5 7  from the same period last year on  4 7  higher revenues  The Energy  Aerospace  Finance  Technology  Construction and Industrial Products are expected to be big growth drivers in Q2  with the quarterly earnings growth pace dropping to  3  on an ex Energy basis       The picture that emerged from the Q1 earnings season was one of notable improvement over other recent periods  with growth reaching the highest level in more than 5 years and a bigger proportion of companies beating estimates  particularly revenue estimates      Beyond Q2  total earnings for the S P 500 index are currently expected to grow by  6 4  on  4 7  higher revenues in the September quarter and  10  on  5 3  higher revenues in Q4        For full year 2017  total earnings for the index are expected to be up  7 8  on  4 2  higher revenues  which would follow  1  earnings growth on  2  higher revenues in 2016  Index earnings are expected to be up  11 7  in 2018 and  9 1  in 2019  The Energy  Technology and Finance sectors are the biggest earnings contributors in 2017   2017 earnings growth would be  4 9  on an ex Energy basis 
The Q2 earnings season will follow the strong showing in the preceding reporting cycle when growth reached its highest level in more than five years and an above average proportion of companies beat revenue estimates  The market will be looking for continuation of these favorable trends in the Q2 reporting cycle as well  which has  officially  gotten underway already but wouldn t ramp up through the week of July 10th  when the major banks come out with results  thankfully   Alcoa s report no longer serves that purpose  Estimates for Q2 have come down since the start of the period  as the chart below shows

This trend of negative revisions ahead of the start of each reporting cycles is not new  we have been seeing this play out quarter after quarter for more than 3 years  That the revisions trend has been moving in a favorable direction over the last two quarters and that same trend is even more at play in Q2 estimates  What this means is that while estimates for Q2 have come down  they haven t come down as much as would typically be the case by this time in other recent periods Estimates for 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors have come down since the start of Q2  with Consumer Discretionary and Basic Materials suffering the most revisions  Estimates for the Tech sector remain effectively unchanged  while the same for Transportation  Aerospace  Business Services  Construction  and Industrial Products sectors have gone up  The positive revisions to Deere   Company  NYSE DE     and Caterpillar  NYSE CAT     are a big reason for the Industrial Product sector s improved earnings picture The actual Q1 earnings growth   13 3   turned out to be double the growth pace that was expected at the start of the reporting cycle   6 6    This magnitude of outperformance was unusual and above the quarterly trend of the last few years  We know that actual Q2 growth will be higher relative to what is currently expected  But even if actual Q2 earnings growth turns out to be as high as was expected at the start of the quarter   7 9    it will still be below what was achieved in Q1 In fact  we can project with a reasonable level of confidence that the Q1 earnings growth pace will be the highest for the next few quarters  We should continue to see positive earnings growth in the coming quarters  but the growth pace will likely stay below what we experienced in Q1   The chart below shows quarterly earnings growth expectations beyond Q2 

Unlike the year over year growth pace  the dollar amount of total earnings are expected to be in record territory in the coming quarters  particularly in the second half of the year  as the chart below shows 

The expected earnings total for Q2 at present is about  2  below the all time quarterly record level achieved in 2016 Q4  With actual results typically coming in better than pre season expectations  we will likely see the final 2017 Q2 tally to exceed the 2016 Q4 record

149528,371044,DE,Why Deere   Company  DE  Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,Looking for a stock that might be in a good position to beat earnings at its next report  Consider Deere   Company   NYSE DE    a firm in the Manufacturing   Farm Equipment  which could be a great candidate for another beat This company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  In fact  in these reports  DE has beaten estimates by at least 20  in both cases  suggesting it has a nice short term history of crushing expectations Earnings in FocusTwo quarters ago  DE expected to post 50 cents per share  while it actually produced 61 cents per share  a beat of 22   Meanwhile  for the most recent quarter  the company looked to deliver  1 70 per share  when it actually saw  2 49 per share instead  representing a 46 5  positive surprise Deere   Company Price and EPS Surprise    Thanks in part to this history  recent estimates have been moving higher for Deere   Company  In fact  the  for DE is positive  which is a great sign of a coming beat After all  the Zacks Earnings ESP compares the most accurate estimate to the broad consensus  looking to find stocks that have seen big revisions as of late  suggesting that analysts have recently become more bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This is the case for DE  as the firm currently has a Zacks Earnings ESP of  2 16   so another beat could be around the corner This is particularly true when you consider that DE has a great Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  which can be a harbinger of outperformance and a signal for a strong earnings profile  You can see  When you add this solid Zacks Rank to a positive Earnings ESP   of the time  so it seems pretty likely that DE could see another beat at its next report  especially if recent trends are any guide The Best   Worst of ZacksToday you are invited to download the full  up to the minute list of 220 Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buys  free of charge  From 1988 through 2015 this list has averaged a stellar gain of  25  per year  Plus  you may download 220 Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sells   Even though this list holds many stocks that seem to be solid  it has historically performed 6X worse than the market ,2017-06-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-deere---company-(de)-could-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200197184,200197184
149529,371045,DE,Cocoa Has Friends In An Agriculture Wide Downdraft,opinion,"The fundamentals of cocoa are not changing day to day  but you might think so based on the frenetic trading in the iPath Bloomberg Cocoa Subindex Total Return Exp 24 June 2038  NYSE NIB   Last week  NIB made another plunge toward an all time low in the latest bout of selling that took NIB from  25 29 to as low as  21 70  a 14 2  loss  in just 8 trading days 

The iPath Bloomberg Cocoa SubTR ETN  NIB  has gyrated wildly since February 
While the downtrending 50 day moving average  DMA  is clearly maintaining its grip on trading for NIB  at least NIB has not made a new all time low  Moreover  lows have generally been met with a bout of frantic buying  I still think these technicals suggest a bottom in the making and are part of an extended  albeit wild  consolidation pattern 
The latest plunge convinced me that it is time I try wearing the hat of a short term trader for making money on NIB  I prepared to do a swing trade on NIB on Friday in order to move ahead of the next bout of buying  I was clearly too slow as NIB gapped up and never pulled back to my top buying point of  22 00  The last three days for a bottoming pattern called an  abandoned baby bottom   I consider the bottom confirmed if NIB closes above the high of the first trading day of the pattern  above  23  
Seeing no real news to explain cocoa s sudden plunge in price  I took a step back and reviewed the agricultural complex  First of all  the PowerShares DB Agriculture  NYSE DBA   which includes cocoa  had a particularly rough week along with NIB  Like NIB it plunged on Wednesday and Thursday  For the week  DBA lost 3 5  and closed at a new all time low on Thursday 

The PowerShares DB Agriculture ETF  DBA  has declined sharply since a peak a year ago  This year has delivered a kind of acceleration in the selling 
The list of ag casualties gives NIB some good company  The iPath Bloomberg Coffee Subindex Total Return Exp 24 June 2038  NYSE JO  made an all time low lask week  Close to all time lows are Teucrium Corn ETF  NYSE CORN   iPath Bloomberg Sugar SubTR ETN  NYSE SGG   Teucrium Wheat ETF  NYSE WEAT   and Teucrium Soybean ETF  NYSE SOYB   Livestock stick out as a notable exception  I guess the price of feed is particularly low these days 

In late April the iPath Bloomberg Livestock SubTR ETN  COW  broke out from a consolidation period  While it has pulled back below its 50DMA  this could still be a time to buy into the breakout 
Cotton recently experienced a bearish breakdown  but at least it remains far above its all time low around  23 and its post recession low  set in 2016  around  35 50 

The iPath Bloomberg Cotton SubTR ETN  BAL  was riding high until a  gap and crap  marked a top in mid May  The 200DMA breakdown confirmed the end of the bullish run up 
While BAL is doing its best to join the general ag deflation theme  Deere   Company  NYSE DE  is flashing all green signs  In the last 7 months  DE has experienced 2 bullish breakouts to new all time highs  This trading behavior suggests that ag is fine  at least outside of the publicly traded ETNs and ETFs 
Here is how DE summarized the U S  ag business in its last earnings report  from   

 Following a forecasted about 5  reduction in 2016 cash receipts  we expect 2017 total cash receipts plus government payments to be about  367 billion  This is roughly flat with 2016 as declines in meat animals and food grains cash receipts mostly offset gains in dairy and cotton cash receipts  

Not great  but not awful either 
Based on DE s recent trading record shown below  I think the current dip is buyable  DE is managing with what it calls stabilization 

 On an overall basis  we are seeing modestly higher demand for our products  with the agricultural sector in South America staging a strong recovery  At the same time  our performance reflects the actions we have taken to expand our customer base and operate more efficiently  We re benefitting from the sound execution of our operating plans  the strength of our broad product portfolio and the steps we ve taken to bring down structural cost  As a result of all these factors  we have raised our forecast and are now calling for significantly higher earnings for the full year  


Deere and Company  DE  made an impressive breakout last November when it surpassed 2011 s  marginal  all time high  It broke out again in May  The current pullback is definitely a buyable dip  with a stop either below the 50DMA or on a push through the bottom of the post earnings gap up 
Even with DE s bullish signaling  there is enough carnage in the ag space to make me wonder whether part of cocoa s problems go beyond over supply and also extend to some generalized malaise particularly from aggressive speculators  Time will tell

149545,371061,DE,Favorable Revisions Trend For Q2 Earnings,opinion,"Note  The following is an excerpt from this week s report  You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods  
Here are the key points      It is still a few weeks before we get into the heart of the Q2 earnings season  but early indicators are pointing to a continuation of the positive earnings trends that we saw in the last two quarterly reporting cycles       Q2 Estimates have come down since the quarter got underway  but the magnitude of negative revisions nevertheless compares favorably to other recent periods      Total Q2 earnings for the S P 500 index are expected to be up  5 7  from the same period last year on  4 8  higher revenues  The Energy  Finance  Technology  Construction and Industrial Products are expected to be big growth drivers in Q2  with the quarterly earnings growth pace dropping to  3  on an ex Energy basis       The Q1 earnings season is effectively over now  with results from 496 S P 500 members already out  Total earnings for these companies are up  13 4  from the same period last year on  7  higher revenues  with 72 6  beating EPS estimates and 65 5  beating revenue estimates      The picture that emerged from the Q1 earnings season was one of notable improvement over other recent periods  with growth reaching the highest level in more than 5 years and a bigger proportion of companies beating estimates  particularly revenue estimates      Beyond Q2  total earnings for the S P 500 index are currently expected to grow by  6 4  on  4 9  higher revenues in the September quarter and  9 9  on  5 4  higher revenues in Q4        For full year 2017  total earnings for the index are expected to be up  7 7  on  4 1  higher revenues  which would follow  1  earnings growth on  2  higher revenues in 2016  Index earnings are expected to be up  11 5  in 2018 and  9 3  in 2019   The chart below shows how estimates for Q2 have evolved since the start of the period 

This trend of negative revisions ahead of the start of each reporting cycles is not new  we have been seeing this play out quarter after quarter for more than 3 years  The revisions trend has been moving in a favorable direction over the last two quarters and that same trend is even more at play in the Q2 estimates  What this means is that while estimates for Q2 have come down  they haven t come down as much as would typically be the case by this time in other recent periods Estimates for 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors have come down since the start of Q2  with Consumer Discretionary and Utilities suffering the most revisions  Estimates for the Tech sector remain effectively unchanged  while the Transportation  Aerospace  Business Services  and Industrial Products sectors have gone up  The positive revisions to Deere   Company  NYSE DE     and Caterpillar  NYSE CAT     are a big reason for the Industrial Product sector s improved earnings picture The actual Q1 earnings growth   13 3   turned out to be double the growth pace that was expected at the start of the reporting cycle   6 6    This magnitude of outperformance was unusual and above the quarterly trend of the last few years  But even if actual Q2 earnings growth turns out to be as high as was expected at the start of the quarter   7 9    it will still be below what was achieved in Q1 In fact  we can project with a reasonable level of confidence that the Q1 earnings growth pace will be the highest for the next few quarters  We should continue to see positive earnings growth in the coming quarters  but the growth pace will likely stay below what we experienced in Q1   The chart below shows quarterly earnings growth expectations beyond Q2 

Unlike the year over year growth pace  the dollar amount of total earnings are expected to be in record territory in the coming quarters  particularly in the second half of the year  as the chart below shows 

Q1 Earnings Season ScorecardTotal earnings for the 496 index members that have reported Q1 results are up  13 4  from the same period last year on  7  higher revenues  with 72 6  beating EPS estimates and 65 5  coming ahead of top line expectations  The proportion of companies beating both EPS and revenue estimates is currently 52  
The side by side charts below compare the growth rates and beat ratios for the 496 index members with what we saw from the same companies in other recent periods 

The comparison charts above show that growth as well as positive beats compared favorably with historical periods  The proportion of companies beating revenue estimates was particularly notable  as was the revenue growth pace Please note that the positive Q1 results were broad based and not narrowly concentrated  Sectors that beat revenue estimates at a proportion higher than the average for the S P 500 index  which itself tracked above historical periods  included Autos  90  beat revenue estimates   Conglomerates  83 3    Industrial Products  81 8  beating revenue estimates   Technology  79    Basic Materials  75    Transportation  73 3    Construction  69 2    Utilities  69    Medical  68 5    and Finance  68 1    The Consumer Staples operators appeared to be struggling  with the proportion of Consumer Staples companies beating revenue estimates the lowest of all 16 Zacks sectors

149568,371084,DE,3 Stocks Set For Higher Highs,opinion,"If you re a big believer in the old  Buy Low  Sell High  philosophy  then what are you going to do in a market like this one  Stocks are routinely breaking records in a nearly decade old bull market  In such an environment  it s time to try the newer  Buy High  Sell Higher  philosophy 
Stocks that are making new highs tend to continue moving even higher until something disrupts the trajectory  With no recession in sight and the economy humming along  the overall trend for stocks remains upward  So how do you find the stocks most likely to continue ascending  The best tool is the  screen on Zacks Premium  You ll find a collection of Strong Buy stocks that are making new highs and should continue to do so moving forward 
Below are three stocks that recently made the screen  But make sure to click on the link above to see the parameters of this list  along with more than two dozen stocks that passed the stringent criteria Marvell Technology Group Ltd    
Data is big business these days and it s only getting bigger  The need to store and transmit both wired and wireless data is paramount  and its right up the alley of Marvell Technology Group Ltd   MRVL   The company is a leader in storage  networking and connectivity semiconductor solutions  Shares of MRVL have soared more than 70  over the past year on the increasing need for its services  It has easily outperformed the Semiconductor   Communications industry  which has jumped more than 45  in its own right over the past year  The space is also in the top 41  of the Zacks Industry Rank with the 105th spot out of 256 
Just last week  Marvell announced its fourth straight positive surprise as earnings per share of 20 cents in its fiscal first quarter topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 25   The four quarter average beat is now as high as 86 7   Thanks to growth in the storage  networking and connectivity businesses  revenues jumped 11 5  year over year to  579 2 million  This result also beat the Zacks expectation of  570 million  Revenue is expected between  585 million and  615 million in the fiscal second quarter 
In the past week  six of eight covering analysts raised their expectations of this fiscal year  ending January 2018  there were no downgrades  The Zacks Consensus Estimate has improved 8 4  in that time to 90 cents per share from 83 cents  If we go back over the past 3 months  analysts have boosted their expectations by 32 4   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for next fiscal year  ending January 2019  is expected to grow more than 14  to  1 03 per share  which has advanced 5 1  in the past seven days 
 Marvell Technology Group Ltd  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    
Deere   Company  NYSE DE    
For four and a half years now  Deere   Company  DE  has been releasing positive earnings surprises quarter after quarter and it did so again just two weeks ago  DE is probably the only agriculture equipment company that s also a household name  even if you don t live on a farm or have a huge backyard  The public knows DE from its commercials  distinctive green and yellow products  and for having been mentioned in several country music songs  But while its dependability as an American staple is secure  so too is its reputation in the market after 18 straight quarterly beats 
Most recently  DE reported earnings per share of  2 49 for its fiscal second quarter  marking an approximately 60  improvement over the previous year  It was also 46 5  better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  leading to a four quarter average beat of more than 70   Total sales of  8 29 billion was 5 2  on top of last year due to improved demand for farm and construction equipment  Net sales for equipment operations advanced to  7 26 billion from  7 107 billion  Moving forward  DE raised its equipment sales forecast to 9  for fiscal 2017 from 4  previously 
Earnings estimates have jumped over the past 30 days thanks to the strong report  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this fiscal year  ending October 2017  has soared 29 4  in that time to  6 21 per share as 11 of 12 covering analysts raised their expectations  Our estimate for next fiscal year  ending October 2018  has increased 20 5  in that time to  6 71  which is also 8  better than what s expected this fiscal year  Ten analysts revised higher for next year  There have been no downgrades 
 Deere   Company Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    Caterpillar  NYSE CAT    
Having beaten the Zacks Consensus Earnings Estimate for nine straight quarters  it was surprising that Caterpillar  CAT  had a real problem with sequential sales and revenue growth  It had been over two years since this farm and construction equipment manufacturer had same quarter growth on the top line  But that finally changed when it reported first quarter results in late April  Afterward  practically every analyst covering the stock raised their estimates  as CAT s incessant focus on cost reduction began to pay off 
The company s bottom line was pretty impressive too  Earnings per share of  1 28 doubled the year ago result and smashed through the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 106 5   It was the 13th beat in the last 14 quarters and marked an average beat of 40 3  in the past four  Revenues of  9 8 billion also topped our estimates at  9 3 billion  while also improving 3 8  year over year  Just as importantly  CAT increased its sales guidance for 2017 to between  38 billion and  41 billion  compared to the previous range of  36 billion to  39 billion 
Analysts couldn t wait to raise their expectations on CAT after this report  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this year has climbed 33 7  over the past two months to  4 13 per share  as all 10 covering analysts revised higher  Likewise  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 has climbed 21 7  in that time to  5 15 per share  which is also nearly 25  better than what s expected in 2017 Caterpillar  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars 
Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge

149569,371085,DE,Deere  Hertz Global Holdings And Canada Goose Holdings Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL   June 05  2017   Deere   Co  NYSE        as the Bull of the Day  Hertz Global Holdings  NYSE        as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Canada Goose Holdings Inc   NYSE       

	Here is a synopsis of all three stocks 

   

	A strong management team can guide a company through difficult periods and prepare the business for better times  This is what Deere   Co  s management s team has done  The past several years have been difficult for the agricultural business  but the team made some prudent cost cutting measures and shifted their focus towards other segments within the company  These moves have begun to bear fruit and nowDeere   Co  NYSE        is our Zacks Bull of the Day 
	This Zacks Ranked  1  Strong Buy  company is the one world s foremost producers of agricultural equipment as well as a leading manufacturer of construction  forestry  and commercial and consumer equipment  The company  in addition  provides credit  special technology  and managed health care products and services Recent Earnings
	The company recently announced Q2 17 earnings where they easily beat both the Zacks consensus earnings and revenue estimates  On a year over year basis the company saw gains in net income  62   worldwide net sales  5   worldwide revenues  5   and net sales of equipment operations  2 2  
	Also  due to the strong performance and expected continuation of this trend  management increased FY 17 guidance in several segments  Equipment sales  9   was  4    Agricultural   Turf sales  8   was  3    and Construction   Forestry sales  13   was  7   Management s Take
	According to Samuel R  Allen  chairman and chief executive officer     John Deere reported strong results in the second quarter as market conditions showed signs of further stabilization  We are seeing modestly higher overall demand for our products  with farm machinery sales in South America experiencing a strong recovery  Deere s performance also reflects the sound execution of our operating plans  the strength of a broad product portfolio  and the impact of our actions to develop a more agile cost structure  As a result  we have raised our forecast and are now calling for significantly higher earnings for the full year    
	Mr  Allen went on further to state     Deere is demonstrating a continuing ability to produce impressive results through all phases of the business cycle  This resilience illustrates our success driving improved operating efficiencies and developing a wider range of revenue sources  It also shows the impact of the company s consistent investments in advanced technology  new products and additional markets  These actions are leading to strong performance in 2017  and they reinforce our conviction that Deere is well positioned to deliver significant value to customers and investors over the long term    

  

	An unanticipated issue can cause a turnaround plan to stall or even make the plan virtually impossible to implement  This is what is happening to our Zacks Bear of the Day  Hertz Global Holdings  NYSE         In January HTZ hired their third CEO in less than three years  and now the new CEO is forced to deal with higher costs for new cars combined with a lower resale value of their used cars  This new issue is causing their debt levels to skyrocket  and is pushing back their turnaround table to 2018 at the earliest 
	This Zacks Ranked  5  Strong Sell  company operates car rental business  The company s product and services consists of Hertz Gold Plus Rewards  NeverLost  Carfirmations  Mobile Wi Fi and unique vehicles offered through the Adrenaline  Dream  Green and Prestige Collections  It operates primarily in North America  Europe  Latin America  Asia  Australia  Africa  the Middle East and New Zealand  Hertz Global Holdings  Inc  is based in FL  United States Recent Earnings Results
	In the company s most recent earnings report  HTZ missed the Zacks consensus earnings estimate for the third consecutive quarter  but they did beat the Zacks consensus revenue estimate after missing the previous two quarters  The company reported year over year losses in the following  U S  Rental Car segment  total revenues fell  4   with income from continuing operations before income taxes dropping by 500   On the International Rental Car Segment  total revenues were down  5   and income from continuing operations before income taxes were down 400  

Management s Take
	According to Kathryn Marinello  President and CEO   As previously outlined  we are executing on a turnaround plan that puts our customers at the center of everything we do  Our goal is to strengthen the business to drive predictable  sustainable growth over the long term  While we are mindful of today s headwinds related to used car residual values  our commitment to investing in the business remains steadfast  In particular  we are placing significant emphasis on fleet quality  the customer experience  brand development and systems transformation  These investments are critical to rebuilding our position as a leader in the global rental car market  While our performance doesn t yet reflect our investments and may continue to be uneven  we are seeing signs of progress

149691,371207,DE,Deere Drops On Lawsuit,opinion,"A potentially large agribusiness merger in the United States has been blocked this week as the Obama administration stepped in to prevent Deere   Company  NYSE DE  from buying one of Monsanto s operations 
Deere   Co  is engaged in equipment operations and financial services  The Company operates through three business segments  agriculture and turf  construction and forestry  and financial services  The Company s agriculture and turf segment primarily manufactures and distributes a full line of agriculture and turf equipment and related service parts  Meanwhile  Monsanto Company  NYSE MON   provides agricultural products such as seeds  biotechnology trait products  and herbicides for farmers  The Company operates through two segments  Seeds and Genomics  and Agricultural Productivity  One of Monsanto s subsidiaries produces precision agriculture tools and this is the operation that Deere is eager to merge with  From a recent news release on the John Deere website  Deere mentions that  Competition in precision agriculture is strong and growing in all of these channels as companies around the world continue developing new technologies   When the transaction is finalized  Deere will preserve Precision Planting s independence in order to ensure innovation and speed to market and will invest in additional innovation efforts at Precision Planting to benefit customers  
But on Wednesday  the Justice Department filed a lawsuit in an attempt to halt the deal in its tracks  This deal goes all the way back to November of last year when Deere announced that it wants to buy Monsanto s precision planting equipment line  What this line essentially does is help farmers plant their seeds at twice the speed of the conventional planting system  Both companies were on board with the merger suggesting that it will benefit farmers by accelerating development of solutions that will increase crop yield and productivity  However  the Department of Justice believes otherwise  It argues that the deal will only suppress competition by giving Deere a monopoly of planting equipment in the market  This reasoning is understandable since Deere and Monsanto s precision line together account for roughly 86  of all equipment in the farming sector 
 If this deal were allowed to proceed  Deere would dominate the market for high speed precision planting systems and be able to raise prices and slow innovation at the expense of American farmers who rely on these systems   Acting Assistant Attorney General Renata Hesse of the Antitrust Division said in a statement 
Shares of Deere  DE  fell on Wednesday following the news about the lawsuit  and it declined again on Thursday  Deere   Co   DE  has already said that it plans to contest the legal action by the U S  Department of Justice  which seeks to block the company s acquisition of Precision Planting from Monsanto  MON   In a world of declining commodity prices  crops and other soft commodities are making it more difficult than before for farmers to make a profit  This in turn negatively affects the entire supply chain which is why there has been a lot of talk about agricultural mergers lately  Another acquisition that was announced was by German chemical and pharmaceutical company Bayer  DE BAYGN   as it wants to buy not just the precision planting part of Monsanto  but the entire company  which is valued at roughly  46 billion  Another large agribusiness merger is the  69 billion deal with Dow Chemical  NYSE DOW  and DuPont  NYSE DD   And earlier this week on Tuesday  two large Canadian fertilizer companies  Potash Corp and Agrium  confirmed that they are also weighing the costs and benefits of merging together in yet another example of consolidation in the global agricultural sector  The question now is what kind of regulatory roadblocks can these agriculture businesses expect to face in the future

The Estimize consensus is calling for earnings per share of  1 51 on  6 71 billion in revenue  5 cents higher than Wall Street on the bottom but  20 million lower on the top

What are you expecting for   
Deere   Company is scheduled to report fiscal second quarter earnings tomorrow before the market opens  The company is best known for manufacturing tractors and equipment used in agriculture  construction  and residential sectors  Weak results from competitors such as Caterpillar  NYSE CAT  and AGCO Corporation  NYSE AGCO  earlier this season sets an unfavorable precedent for DE this Friday  In the past 2 years Deere   Co have seen double digit declines on both the top and bottom line 
First quarter earnings featured a 74  decline in earnings with sales dropping 8   as a result of weakness in global markets  In its analyst call  Deere   Co gave guidance that net sales this quarter would decline by an additional 8   However  according to the Estimize consensus data  revenue is expected to fall 10  to  6 71 billion with earnings dropping 27  to  1 51  Given the volatility in this space  it s not surprising the stock is down 7  from a year earlier  Deere should continue to see pressure on earnings and sales as the farm economy shows no signs of recovery 

The biggest problem lately has been a general weakness in demand for farm and construction equipment  The industrials and manufacturing sectors continue to take a beating as the overall economy remains sluggish  For Deere  this has caused earnings and sales to steadily decline  The company s weak 2016 outlook suggest that these issues are expected to persist  Farming equipment sales are forecasted to decline 10  with sales in its construction and forestry unit expected to fall by 5  
Meanwhile persistent currency headwinds will take an additional toll on its results  with the company believing they will reduce equipment sales by 3  in FQ2 2016  Unfortunately  Deere is  for the most part  at the mercy of outside economic factors and until those pieces fall into place  results from the company will remain muted

CEO Comments

John Deere s second quarter performance reflected the continuing impact of the downturn in the global farm economy and further weakness in the construction equipment sector   said Samuel R  Allen  chairman and chief executive officer   In the face of challenging market conditions  Deere s businesses benefited from the sound execution of operating plans  the strength of a broad product portfolio and our success creating a more flexible cost structure 
Although our forecast calls for lower results this year in light of ongoing market pressures  Deere is continuing to perform at a much higher level than in previous downturns   Allen said   Deere s financial condition remains strong and we believe the company is well positioned to capitalize on attractive growth opportunities that will deliver value to our customers and investors in the future  At the same time  we are continuing to focus on ways to streamline our operations and make them more efficient and profitable

With weak and sluggish Grain markets farmers are not in the market to buy new farm equipment  which is forcing John Deere  N DE  to lay off thousands  This is just another sign of a struggling economy  The administration seems more set on applying social programs than rather get to the crux of the issue which is creating jobs  And with these new programs that infuse tax dollars and all the layoffs will not pay the piper 
In the overnight electronic session the March corn is currently trading at 369    which is   of a cent lower  The trading range has been 371 to 369 so far  Ideally I would like to see at least a 10 cent rally in the corn to attract activity in the cash market 
On the ethanol front there were no trades posted in the overnight session  The February contract settled at 1 393 and is currently showing 1 bid   1 383 and 2 offers   1 398 
On the crude oil front the market could not sustain last week s late rally due to comments from Mario Draghi that more stimulus is possible  This woke the market up from a record short position and funds showed that they were on notice  Trilby Lundberg of the Lundberg survey mentioned that we should enjoy gas prices at these levels for now because they are not here to stay forever  I cannot further agree that once this glut dematerializes with rig counts spiraling down and the infrastructure that was put on mothballs will have to go through an extensive and rigorous maintenance operation to get back online  And banks will not be so quick to loan money in this boom or bust industry  In the overnight electronic session the March crude oil is currently trading at 3124 which is 95 points lower  The trading range has been 3274 to 3086  I do not expect to see oil price below  30 a barrel for any sustainable time in the future 
On the natural gas front the February contract sold off the highs in the overnight session as the Blizzard of 2016 has come and gone and supposedly more moderate temperatures are on the horizon  In the overnight electronic session the February contract is currently trading at 2 1114  which is 2   cents lower  The trading range has been 2 165 to 2 102 so far

Falling crop prices have caused demand to drop sharply for Deere s tractors and combines  but the best time to buy high quality dividend stocks is usually during periods of distress  Warren Buffett seems to think so and added to his stake in Deere during the fourth quarter of 2015 
Let s take a closer look at Deere s business as we consider it for our Top 20 Dividend Stocks portfolio Business OverviewDeere was founded in 1837 and has since grown to become one of the largest manufacturers of agricultural and construction equipment in the world  Many of Deere s products retail for several hundred thousand dollars and are mostly sold through its independent dealer networks 
The company s Agriculture and Turf segment accounted for about 75  of Deere s equipment operating profit last fiscal year  Some of its key products include tractors  combines  corn pickers  and mowers 
Deere s Construction and Forestry segment accounted for the remaining 25  of operating profit and includes products such as backhoe loaders  excavators  crawler dozers  and dump trucks 
The company also has a Financial Services segment that lends money to Deere s independent dealers and end customers when they purchase equipment on credit or need a lease 
By geography  close to 60  of Deere s sales are generated in the U S  and Canada Business AnalysisWith a rich operating history dating back more than 175 years ago  Deere is one of the most iconic American companies of all time 
Many of Deere s competitive advantages are rooted in its long standing operations and the conservative culture it has embraced throughout its corporate life 
As a testament to the company s consistency and steady culture  the Roman Catholic Church has had more popes than Deere has had CEOs since it was started in the 19th century 
One of John Deere s infamous quotes has continued to guide the company from one generation to the next 
 I will never put my name on a product that doesn t have in it the best that is in me     John Deere
Deere has relentlessly focused on improving the productivity of its customers by listening closely to their needs and heavily investing in product development 
Deere spends over  1 4 billion annually on research and development and has been named as the number one innovator in the heavy industrial equipment industry by the Patent Board  According to a Bloomberg article  some of Deere s products literally have more lines of software code than a space shuttle 
As a result of Deere s product innovation  the company has developed a pristine reputation for quality and reliability  Customers know they will achieve a lower total cost of ownership by buying their equipment from Deere 
Deere s reputation for quality has made it one of the top 100 brands in the world and allowed it to consistently raise its prices at a low single digit rate virtually every year  including recessions 
Even with U S  agriculture equipment sales expected to fall by 15 20  in 2016  Deere expects to realize 2  pricing gains across its equipment operations this year 
The company s pricing power is built on more than just the quality of Deere s products  In fact  one of Deere s biggest competitive advantages is intangible in nature   the relationships its independent dealers have with their customers 
Deere has amassed the largest network of independent dealers in the U S  agricultural industry  These dealers have developed strong  multi generational relationships with the farmers in their communities 
Many dealers have been passed down from generation to generation and know their customers really well 
Farmers are generally loyal people  too  According to a survey of 2 000 Midwest farmers  about 65  of respondents described themselves as brand loyal  and a whopping 77  of John Deere customers described themselves as brand loyal 
Deere s existing dealer network has a captivated customer base that helps the company maintain number one market share in agricultural machinery and number two market share in construction equipment in North America 
Besides customer relationships  maintaining extensive distribution networks is a critical piece of Deere s value proposition  Most of its heavy equipment costs several hundred thousands of dollars and is used for mission critical  time sensitive tasks such as planting crops  Minimizing unplanned downtime is essential 
Deere has more dealers than its competitors  which allows it to quickly service customers to keep their gear up and running  Service parts have historically accounted for 15 20  of Deere s overall equipment revenue  underscoring the importance of having strategically located and well equipped dealers on call at all times 
Overall  we believe Deere has a strong economic moat  The company has established an excellent reputation for quality  service  and innovation that allows it to consistently raise prices and hold its dominant market share positions 
New entrants would struggle to break the long lasting relationships Deere s dealers have built with brand loyal customers  and substantial capital would need to be invested to develop and manufacture competitive equipment  Smaller rivals also lack the financing arm Deere has that makes it easier for its customers to fund their large equipment purchases Deere s Key RisksDespite Deere s numerous competitive advantages  it has little control over the factors that influence demand for most of its equipment 
With agricultural machinery driving the bulk of Deere s profits  the company is very sensitive to farmer income 
When crop prices are high and yields are good  farmers are much more willing to open their wallets for Deere s big ticket tractors and combines 
However  times are not good right now for farmers 
In fact  farmers have never felt worse about their current situation as measured by The Progressive Farmer Agriculture Confidence Index  which started surveying farmers in 2010 
Demand for crops has continued to gradually increase with the world s population over time  but excess supply has been an issue  The world has experienced bumper crops for several years  which has driven down the prices of many major crops such as grain and corn 
As seen below  net farm income skyrocketed from 2010 through 2013 thanks to strong commodity prices and healthy agricultural exports 
However  after peaking out at  123 3 billion in 2013  U S  net farm income plunged over 50  to hit  56 4 billion in 2015 
Source  Congressional Research Service
While the USDA s Economic Research Service expects U S  net farm income to fall just 3  in 2016  much less than the 27  drop in 2015   the decrease would bring farm income to its lowest level since 2002 
The ups and downs of the agricultural market are to be expected  but some investors can t help but be reminded of the 1980s farm crisis which saw an economic crisis  more severe than any since the Great Depression  
The farm crisis of the 1980s caused Deere to cut its dividend from 32 9 cents per share in 1981 to 12 5 cents in 1983  Annual dividend payments didn t recover back to 33 cents per share until 1990 
Leading up to the crisis  farmers took on substantial amounts of debt to finance their land  crop inputs  and equipment 
Interest rates began to surge leading up to the farm crisis with the prime lending rate tripling to exceed 20  in 1981  an all time high 
At the same time  unfavorable economic environments and geopolitical factors combined to cause crop prices to collapse 
Farmers  debt to income ratios became unsustainable  and many farmers were unable to repay their loans  Just making interest payments was hard enough 
As a result  there were widespread bankruptcies  land values plummeted  and demand for Deere s equipment virtually dried up 
Trying to forecast commodity markets is a fool s errand  but it s important to realize just how unpredictable they can be 
We don t believe there will be another farm crisis today because farmers maintain a lower debt to assets ratio and interest rates are literally a fraction of what they were in the early 1980s 
On a somewhat related note  Deere also faces indirect risks from government policies that materially impact net farm income 
The 2014 Farm Bill is a government subsidy program meant to help farmers during periods of difficult market conditions  The bill is set to pay farmers close to  14 billion in 2016  up over 30  from 2015   which amounts to about 25  of total net farm income 
Without this legislation  which is updated every five years  it s safe to say that Deere would be experiencing even more difficult times 
Monetary policy also impacts Deere  With U S  agricultural exports accounting for around 30  of U S  farm income  the strength of the U S  dollar impacts demand for U S  crops  The export business is currently weak due to the strong dollar and weakening macro outlook in several key foreign countries 
What does all of this mean for Deere s equipment 
Since peaking in 2013  industry sales of large agricultural equipment in America have fallen by more than 60   and the U S  and Canadian agricultural industry is projected to be down another 15 20  in 2016 
Deere has fared better than the overall market  The company s sales have declined by roughly 25  from their all time high  However  last year s sales decline was the company s largest percentage drop since the 1930s 
The company s sales have rarely dropped more than two years in a row  and according to Deere s annual report  its sales have never dropped for more than three straight years 
Deere s markets are cyclical  but they have rarely experienced a prolonged down cycle like they seem to be facing today 
The good news is that farm cycles come and go  Demand for crops should continue rising over time as the world s population continues growing  just as it has in the past  World demand for grain and oilseeds has increased in all but two of the past 40 years while more than doubling over that period 
Unexpected events such as a drought could also suppress industry supply to quickly lift commodity prices again  Importantly  Deere is still generating cash and making its business even stronger for the next upturn 
Investors considering Deere should remain aware of the commodity risk the business faces  However  they might also find some comfort knowing that the worst of the current downturn could be close to over  barring another low probability  high severity farm crisis type of event  Dividend Analysis  DeereWe analyze 25  years of dividend data and 10  years of fundamental data to understand the safety and growth prospects of a dividend  Dividend Safety ScoreOur Safety Score answers the question   Is the current dividend payment safe   We look at factors such as current and historical EPS and FCF payout ratios  debt levels  free cash flow generation  industry cyclicality  ROIC trends  and more  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
Deere scores close to average for dividend safety  One of the factors helping the company s score is its healthy dividend payout ratios  Despite the downturn in agricultural markets  Deere s earnings and free cash flow payout ratios have remained solid at 44  and 21   respectively 
Even if Deere s profits were cut in half  it would still have enough financial strength to continue paying its dividend  Management also targets a 25 35  dividend payout ratio of mid cycle earnings to ensure the company remains reasonably safe during unexpected industry downturns Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Source  Simply Safe Dividends
We also evaluate how a company performed during the last recession to assess the safety of its dividend  Deere s sales fell by 19  during fiscal year 2009  and its reported earnings per share plunged by more than 50   Deere s stock also dropped by almost 60  in 2008 and trailed the S P 500 by over 20   Deere s business is clearly sensitive to the economy and needs to be managed more conservatively than some other types of businesses that are less cyclical Source  Simply Safe Dividends
While Deere s business must always be ready for the ups and downs of its markets  the company s free cash flow generation has been nothing short of excellent  As seen below  Deere has generated free cash flow in each of the last 10 years 
The company has consistently improved the profitability and flexibility of its manufacturing plants to quickly respond to industry downturns as well   Deere s free cash flow increased over the last few years despite the steep drop in demand for its agricultural equipment Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Another factor we look at when it comes to dividend safety is the return on invested capital a company earns  Higher quality  more reliable businesses tend to healthy and stable returns on capital 
Deere has earned good returns in the high single to low double digits throughout most of the last decade  Despite the capital intensity of its operations and the volatility of its end markets  Deere s pricing power and efficient operations have helped it create economic value consistently Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Whenever we analyze a cyclical dividend stock  we pay very close attention to its balance sheet  If a company has taken on too much debt right before demand unexpectedly falls  its dividend could be jeopardized 
Looking at Deere s balance sheet is a bit complicated because of its Financial Services segment  which provides financing to dealers  This segment financed the purchase of half of the new equipment sold by Deere last year  so it s very important to the company s business 
Practically all of Deere s debt is related to its Financial Services segment  The loans are backed up by the company s equipment  If a customer defaulted on their payments  Deere would reclaim its equipment and could presumably resell it somewhat easily given its high quality 
Importantly  Deere has run this segment very conservatively over the years  Despite the tough agriculture markets today  credit losses amounted to about  1 per  1 000 of loans in 2015  highlighting the good credit quality of Deere s end customers 
Financial Services segment financed the purchase of roughly half of the new equipment sold by Deere in 2015  Credit losses amounted to about  1 per  1 000 of loans   good credit quality  While we will keep an eye on this metric going forward  we aren t too concerned about the company s loans because of Deere s long term track record of conservatism Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Deere s dividend has a lot of strengths going for it  The company maintains healthy payout ratios  generates consistent free cash flow  and is conservatively financed  Despite the prolonged downturn in agricultural markets  Deere appears to be reasonably well positioned to keep paying its dividend Dividend Growth ScoreOur Growth Score answers the question   How fast is the dividend likely to grow   It considers many of the same fundamental factors as the Safety Score but places more weight on growth centric metrics like sales and earnings growth and payout ratios  Scores of 50 are average  75 or higher is very good  and 25 or lower is considered weak 
Deere s Dividend Growth Score of 46 suggests that the company s dividend growth potential is close to average  The company s reasonable payout ratios and excellent cash flow generation are being offset by deteriorating near term business trends 
Looking longer term  Deere has increased its dividend for 12 consecutive years and paid uninterrupted dividends since 1988  We are not sure if Deere will eventually qualify to join the dividend aristocrats list  but its dividend growth has certainly been impressive 
The company s quarterly dividend has about quadrupled over the last decade from 16 cents per share in 2005 to 60 cents today 
However  as seen in the table below  Deere s dividend growth rate has decelerated from 15  per year over the last five years to a high single digit rate more recently 
The company has also held its dividend flat at 60 cents per share for eight straight quarters as it deals with the numerous macro headwinds that are reducing its profits Source  Simply Safe Dividends
Deere s dividend growth rate will likely remain low until agriculture fundamentals improve  However  once the macro environment is more favorable  the company s dividend has nice potential to continue growing at a mid  to high single digit rate ValuationDeere trades at a forward price to earnings multiple of 20 2 and has a dividend yield of 2 9   which is somewhat higher than its five year average dividend yield of 2 4  
While the company s earnings multiple doesn t look cheap at first glance  cyclical companies usually look expensive near the bottom of their cycles and cheap near the top 
Deere s earnings have contracted significantly in recent years as the agricultural cycle turned down  Investors are anticipating better profits in future years 
Even despite the macro headwinds faced by Deere  the company has still compounded its diluted earnings per share by 5 8  over the last five years 
While trends could get worse before they get better  we ultimately believe Deere s earnings can continue to compound at a mid  to high single digit rate over the long term  Agriculture demand should continue rising over time  and Deere seems likely to continue dominating the market and steadily repurchasing its shares each year 
Under these assumptions  Deere s stock appears to offer annual total return potential of 9 12  
Management also issued a target for 2018 to generate  50 billion revenue and earn a 12  operating margin  Assuming the company continues repurchasing its shares each year and pays taxes at a 35  rate  Deere s earnings seem likely to exceed  12 per share under management s goals 
If this played out and Deere traded at 13x earnings in 2018  the stock would fetch a price of about  150 per share   nearly double where Deere s stock is trading at today 
Macro weakness makes Deere s 2018 sales goal look increasingly unlikely  but the company s long term earnings power is still strong once the agriculture cycle begins recovering sometime in the future 
Barring a 1980s type of farm crisis  which seems very unlikely in our view  Deere s stock appears to be reasonably priced for long term investors ConclusionDeere is a wonderful business that is sensitive to a number of factors outside of its control  Weak crop prices  the strong dollar  declining farm economics  and sluggish global growth are all hurting demand for the company s large equipment 
However  Deere s economic moat and long term earnings power remain largely intact  Like Warren Buffett  we enjoy buying blue chip dividend stocks when they are on sale and holding onto them indefinitely  Buffett actually increased his stake in Deere during the fourth quarter of 2015  which suggests he sees value in Deere at its current stock price 
Several of the companies we already own in our Top 20 Dividend Stocks portfolio overlap with Deere  but this is a remarkable business that we will certainly keep our eyes on ",2016-04-23,Brian Bollinger,https://www.investing.com/analysis/de:-warren-buffett-is-buying-more-of-this-top-dividend-stock-200126053,200126053

149797,371313,DE,June Jobs Report Critical To Fed Raising Rates,opinion,"Friday  May 20  2016
Stocks are indicated to open modestly in the green today  but the major indexes appear set to end this week in the red  the 4th week in a row of negative closes for the S P 500  Weak earnings  mixed economic data and renewed Fed concerns are all at play in driving this market 
The Fed has always been at the center of this market with its extraordinary monetary policy  but the central bank has taken the limelight all over again following the Wednesday minutes  The minutes showed a relatively a more aggressive interest rate trajectory relative to what the market was pricing  with comments from key Fed officials since the minutes providing further confirmation to that posture  The net result of this development is that markets have started pricing in a June or July rate hike while they were previously considering December as this year s only credible hike  But given the Fed s data dependence  a lot will is weighing on coming economic numbers  particularly the May jobs report that come out June 3rd 
The question now is whether the Fed needs a 200 plus jobs read on June 3rd to be comfortable going for a June rate hike or they will be ok with even something around where last month s supposedly weak jobs reading was  A number of Fed officials have indicated that given how far the labor market has strengthened already  they don t see a 200K as a sustainable level going forward and will consider anything in the 100K to 150K level that keeps the unemployment rate at current levels as evidence of a stable labor market 
With no major top tier economic data on the docket prior to the June 3rd jobs report  the market s current tentative and uncertain mode will likely remain in place in the coming days as well  with Fed speakers dominating market headlines 
On the earnings front  the focus lately has been on weak Retail sector earnings reports  with Foot Locker    NYSE FL    becoming the latest retailer to come up short  This morning s other reports from Campbell Soup  CPM  and Deere   Co     NYSE DE    failed to inspire either  Including all of this morning s reports  we now have Q1 results from 280 S P 500 members or 96  of the index s total membership  Total Q1 earnings are down  6 9  on  1 1  lower revenues  with 70 4  beating EPS estimates and 55 6  beating revenue expectations  This is the 4th quarter in a row of negative earnings growth for the index and the trend is expected to continue in the current period as well  with total earnings for the S P 500 index currently expected to be down  6 1  in the June quarter

149819,371335,DE,How Can an Industry s Leading Company Also Be Its Worst Stock ,opinion,"Briggs and Stratton  NYSE BGG  is the world s largest producer of air cooled engines for outdoor equipment  The company s subsidiary  Briggs and Stratton Power Group  also manufactures Briggs and Stratton branded power equipment such as generators  While investors have been busy paying attention to the company s EPS  they have been ignoring two realities  that Briggs has become significantly less profitable as its stock price has risen  and that the company s management team has failed consistently on several counts 
BGG shares are up 2  so far this year  but we think that the stock has significant downside potential at its current price 
Why is Briggs  Profitability Flatlining 
The first thing you ll notice when looking at Briggs and Stratton is the fact that the company s profits have gone nowhere for over a decade  Brigg s after tax operating profit  NOPAT  has fallen by 1  compounded annually over the past 16 years  This decline has occurred despite the fact that Briggs  revenue has grown by 40  and its invested capital has grown by 271  over this timeframe 
While Briggs  revenue is up 1  on trailing 12 month  TTM  basis  this is not surprising due to the company s acquisition of Allmand Brothers in the second half of 2014 
As a result of this steady increase in investment and decline in profits  Briggs  return on invested capital  ROIC  has fallen from 19  in 1998 to 5  on a TTM basis  Figure 1 plots this decline 
Figure 1  Return on Invested Capital Over Time

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings 
As Briggs  ROIC has declined  it has failed to earn a return on capital above its cost of capital and earned negative economic earnings for each of the past nine years 
What s Behind the Sluggishness 
Briggs has two business segments  Engines  which produces Briggs and Stratton branded small engines  and Products  which produces Briggs and Stratton branded products  which also uses Briggs  engines 
In the six months preceding the most recent quarter  Engines sales were down over 5  over the previous period  while Product sales were up almost 13   Engine sales make up 57  of total sales  with Products making up the remaining 43   All told  on a TTM basis  sales were up less than 1  
So over the short term  poor results can be blamed on struggling sales   over the long term however  sales have grown  So what s behind the long term decline in profits  The answer is slow and steady margin compression  Pretax margins have fallen from 12  in 2004 to 5  on a TTM basis  In an industry where the brand of an engine isn t driving lawnmower or snow blower sales for the majority of consumers  commoditization across manufacturers has taken its toll 
Not to Mention These Disastrous Acquisitions 
In 2011 Briggs  CEO Todd Teske stated that he would embark on an aggressive plan to dramatically improve the size of the company in three to five years by getting into higher margin businesses  Since then  the company has acquired Branco  a Brazilian power equipment manufacturer  for  57 million in 2012  and Allmand Brothers  a towable tower and heater maker  for  62 million in fiscal 2015 
Margins and ROIC  however  have declined since 2012  the year of the Branco acquisition 
Briggs has a history of missteps with acquisitions dating back all the way to 1979  In an effort to stem declining sales in 1979  Briggs wanted to expand internationally  The company acquired a Farymann Diesel GMBH with the promise of earnings growth  product diversification  and so forth  The acquired business was sold just five years later 
What has the company learned over the next 30 years 
To do more of the same  apparently  In 2005  Briggs acquired Simplicity Manufacturing for  227 million  Briggs expected the acquisition to be accretive to earnings per share by  0 45 in fiscal 2005  In the end  Briggs  EPS actually declined for the year from  2 69 in to  2 63 in 2005 
This track record of value destruction can be shown in the company s large amount of accumulated asset write downs over time  Write downs now make up around 17  of BGG s reported net assets  In other words  BGG has written off 17 cents for every dollar on its balance sheet 
Figure 2  Write Downs as a Percent of Invested Capital

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings 
Such large write downs indicate a consistent pattern of management failure 
These Adjustments Are Why BGG Earns Our Very Dangerous Rating
One of the reasons that many are seeing a  turnaround  in Briggs  this year is the company s solid growth in reported net income for 2014  However  this growth is based on the company s artificially depressed 2013 earnings 
In 2013  the company took  19 billion in restructuring charges and  90 billion in write down expenses to lower its net income to a loss of   34 million  This ends up providing great looking growth numbers when considering that Briggs   29 million in net income in 2014 
However  our NOPAT calculation shows that Briggs actually earned  74 million in profit last year after the impact of these restructuring  write down  and other unusual charges are removed  In 2014  we also added back  45 million in non operating expenses to raise Briggs  net income of  28 million to its NOPAT of  66 million  As a result  Briggs  profits actually declined last year to a tune of 11   which looks worse than the company s sudden return to profitability 
Briggs also has  196 million in accumulated asset write downs  17  of net assets  as noted earlier  and  195 million in accumulated other comprehensive income  17  of net assets  that we add to the company s invested capital 
Finally you should also be aware of Briggs   388 million in total debt  42  of market cap   which includes  49 million in off balance sheet debt from operating leases  13  of debt   and the company s  226 million in owed pension obligations  24  of BGG s market value  
Weak Competitor in a Tough Industry
Briggs and Stratton competes with other companies making small power engines and outdoor equipment such as the venerable Deere   Co   NYSE DE   Generac Holdings  NYSE GNRC   and Toro  NYSE TTC   Figure 3 plots Briggs against this competition in terms of ROIC and price to economic book value  PEBV  
Figure 3  Competition
Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings 
Despite the commoditized nature of this industry  it s really unclear why Briggs has been unable to achieve similar margins to its competitors  who also produce engines and power equipment  This looks like another sign of Briggs  poor management 
Valuation Ignores Current State of the Business
Despite the company s flatlining profits and ineffective management  shares of BGG are trading at a significant growth premium  To justify its current valuation of  20 share  Briggs and Stratton would need to grow NOPAT  
We think 10  annual growth for almost the next two decades is optimistic for a company that has not grown profits at all over the course of 16 years  If Briggs can grow profits by a still optimistic 6  compounded annually for the next 18 years    a 36  downside from current levels 
Dividend and Buyback is a Poor Use of Capital
Briggs has used  60 million of the  100 million that has been authorized for its share buyback plan  We think that this strategy might be keeping the company s inflated share prices afloat   all while destroying shareholder value at these inflated prices  In addition  the company s dividend has declined in recent years  Some investors may just be sticking around for these regular payouts  but we thing that both the dividend and the buyback are poor uses of capital for Briggs and its management  which has a lot of catching up to do relative to its competition as seen in Figure 3 above 
These Catalysts Make BGG Far Too Dangerous
Another cut to the dividend   which has been cut in half since 2007   is not unlikely going forward  which would send shares lower despite being a solid management decision  Cash flow is even weaker now than it was in 2007  and debt is just as high  so the dividend or the buyback could certainly be reduced in the near future 
As noted in management s recent conference call  Briggs expects that its OEM  Original Equipment Manufacturer  customers will start their seasonal production at a later period this year  as inventories of residential lawn and garden equipment are higher than expected  This will result in lower demand in the second half of this year  These higher inventories also indicate sluggish demand in the outdoor power equipment industry overall 
Home sales   and prices fell around the country  If these slow sales continue  less people will be buying new outdoor power equipment using Briggs engines to use at their new homes 
Follow the Insiders  Lead
In the past six months  insiders have bought no shares and sold 186 598 shares  equal to 15  of insider s total holdings  Given the facts above  you might want to follow this example 
Short Interest
Short interest stands at 10 million shares  or over 23  of float  Shorting remains a slightly risky proposition

Monsanto No Longer Targeting Syngenta Acquisition
In spring of this year  Monsanto Company  NYSE MON  submitted an unsolicited bid of  45 billion for the seed and chemical company  Syngenta  NYSE SYT   Robert Fraley  Chief Technology Officer for Monsanto  visited with a number of farm advocacy groups in an effort to ensure that the merger would provide increased innovation to further aid farmers in their attempts to feed the world

For the second straight year  U S  farm income is expected to decrease due to suppressed crop prices and decreased livestock prices  For the 2015 crop  farmers were less likely to have forward sold back in 2013 when 2015 future prices were relatively high  Farm income for 2015 is expected to be  58 3 billion  down from  91 1 billion in 2014  and down 21  from the 15 year average 
Rural bankers are also aware of the expected decline in farm income  Farm Credit reports from the Federal Reserve in Chicago  Kansas City  and St  Louis conveyed a further weakening of the farm credit condition in their respective districts  Non real estate loan demand has steadily increased over the past six quarters  while loan repayment rates have slightly declined  This widening gap has forced banks to begin increasing their lending and collateral requirements on operating loans  although on average  farmer s current debt to assets ratios are still at 40 year lows 
John Deere Reports Slumping Profits
John Deere  NYSE DE  reported a 40  decline in profits following their fiscal close in July  2015  The decline in 2014 farm income forced farmers to cut costs from their 2015 operations  and for most farmers  the first area cut was farm equipment and machinery upgrades  Farmers are likely to continue to put off equipment and machinery upgrades again for the next crop year  Deere is also battling the large volume of used equipment in the marketplace due to the aggressive trade in program implemented in the mid 1990s 
Farmland Values
Farmland value reports showed mixed results in August  The Federal Reserve Banks of Chicago  Kansas City  and St  Louis released their second quarter 2015 Farmland Credit reports this month  The reports suggested that farmland values in the northern Corn Belt declined 1  during the second quarter  while the eastern and western Corn Belt reported increases of less than 1  
The regional disparity in farmland values is primarily due to the difference in crop dependencies across the two regions  Farmers in the northern Corn Belt  parts of Illinois  Iowa  and Minnesota rely most heavily on corn and soybeans  The larger ranching presence in the eastern and western Corn Belt provided a diversification of income for farmers and supported farmland values in those areas as crop prices declined 
Annual farmland values declined by an average of 3 3  across the entire Corn Belt due to corn and soybean prices falling 21  and 33  respectively  over the period  The outlook for the third quarter of 2015 is stable  according to bankers 
Crop Progress
Crop conditions and growth progress throughout August were average to above average as warm humid weather provided excellent growing conditions for both corn and soybeans  August is a crucial month for soybean development when pods are set and begin to fill  Timely rains that were not over bearing provided much of the Corn Belt with ample precipitation  supplying corn and soybeans with enough moisture for proper grain filling 
A number of crop tours were performed in August and crop scouts canvassed the Corn Belt picking ears of corn and counting soybean pods to get an idea of the health of the localized crop  Those surveying the eastern Corn Belt  areas of Illinois  Indiana  and Ohio  raised concern over the corn crop in the region  which showed signs of significant nitrogen leachage due to the heavy rainfall early in the growing season  Despite the lackluster corn  soybeans in the eastern corn belt appeared better than expected which will make up for the poor soybean crop expected in the southwestern Corn Belt  The corn crop improved as scouts moved further west  with areas of Iowa and Minnesota sampling at well over 200 bushels per acre 
Farmers were less confident about their crop s potential than the crop tours reported  Farmers in western Minnesota explained that walking through fields they have seen a significant amount of corn tip back  Corn tip back is kernel abortion near the top 1 to 1 5 inches of the cob caused by weather related stress  disease or lack of crop nutrients in the soil  Farmers in central Illinois and northern Iowa have noticed an increase in soybean northern leaf blight  a disease often caused by hail ripping the leaves  leaving them vulnerable to disease and infection 
Grain Prices
September corn prices decreased 1 89  in August and closed at  3 63 per bushel  Prices traded sideways early in the month as reports of old crop corn sales cancellations were offset by less than ideal weather conditions  Immediately prior to the release of the August World Agriculture Supply and Demand Estimates  WASDE   corn prices increased nearly 5  as analyst predicted that the USDA would decrease the 2015 16 production estimate due to several negative reports about corn in the eastern Corn Belt  After the release of the WASDE on August 12th  prices fell over 5  to their lowest level in two months due to an increase in estimated corn production by 2 76  more than pre report expectations 
The September soybean contract decreased 5 68  in price throughout August to close at  8 97 per bushel  Similar to corn  soybean prices ramped up as analysts predicted a decrease in the USDA 2015 16 production estimate  Instead  the USDA increased the 2015 16 soybean production estimate by 5 3  over pre report expectations  Soybean prices fell 6 4   their lowest point since October 2014  The U S  dollar has also been a significant headwind for U S  soybeans on the global market 
September wheat prices decreased 3 02  throughout July to close at  4 82 per bushel  Wheat prices experienced gains in early September due to positive export and sales data  Those gains were lost as wheat prices traded alongside corn and soybeans following the WASDE report  Wheat prices traded sideways until the end of the month when positive harvesting data about the spring wheat crop pushed prices down further 
Outlook
Crop development is nearly complete as August comes to a close  Soybean harvest will begin in the main growing areas within the next few weeks and farmers will be hoping for warm dry weather to help finish the crop and dry it down to help decrease drying costs  The corn crop is on pace to harvest in early to mid October 
The only obstacles facing either corn or soybeans at this point are heavy persistent rainfall or a hard frost  Farmers experienced the persistent rain last year with some not being able to finish their harvest until December  The rain prevents farmers from accessing their fields and also cuts into their profit by increasing drying costs  A hard frost can hurt yields and damage the crop  making it unsuitable for delivery at local buyers ",2015-09-01,T.

149821,371337,DE,Machinery Market Ripe For Consolidation,opinion,"Farmer pocketbooks take a hit when they collectively harvest record yields and the ripple effect eventually lands on the equipment manufacturing floor and dealer lots  USDA projects net farm income in 2015 to be the lowest since 2006  with a drop of nearly 53  from the record high in 2013 
With a decline in manufacturing  more employee layoffs and surplus inventory on dealer lots  equipment companies are working in stride with the current environment  Rabobank analysts foresee equipment sales to be down through 2016 with stabilization likely in 2017  at the earliest  Although this economy is challenging  it presents opportunities for some in the machinery industry 
Since the 1980s  global consolidation has resulted in a market of only a handful of competitors  The six major players based on 2014 revenue are  Deere   Company  N DE    CNH Industrial NV  N CNHI   AGCO Corporation  N AGCO   Kubota Corp  OTC KUBTY   Claas  and Mahindra   Mahindra Ltd   NS MAHM   Deere   Co  and CNH Industrial have similar total revenue  however  Deere   Co  s  agriculture equipment sector is 40  larger 
Excluding market leader Deere  Rabobank analysts predict a merger is likely among the five other largest original equipment manufacturers in order to challenge Deere s rank 
Farmers are more mindful of the changes in the marketplace after John Deere announced plans to acquire Climate Corporation s Precision Planting and data sharing across platforms and Monosem  the European market leader in precision planters 
The environment continues to be ripe for additional acquisitions  Rabobank analysts predict two scenarios to play out in the next 12 to 24 months in North America  
 Acquisitions of smaller specialty harvesting and implement manufacturers by the top five players  These manufacturers typically have an annual turnover of less than  1 5 billion  
 Horizontal mergers and acquisitions into adjacent markets will be less correlated with crop prices  such as grain storage and treatment  feed processing  chemical blending  animal storage  and protein production systems and milking equipment 
Only time will tell if the merger and acquisition scenarios materialize  In the meantime  Rabobank predicts tractor and combine sales will fall by 25  in 2015  10  in 2016 and 2 5  in 2017  with expected positive growth of 5  in 2018 
Consolidation isn t the only hot button trend in the machinery industry  Equipment  precision and technology companies are forming partnerships to better serve farmers by providing more products and services 
As shown in this chart  machinery companies aren t the only ones in the buying and partnering mode  Companies such as Ag Leader  Raven Industries Inc  O RAVN   Trimble Navigation Limited  O TRMB  and Topcon Corp  T 7732  continue to expand their portfolios and work with major machinery companies to offer their products and services in cabs across the country 
With the likelihood of future acquisitions and partnerships  don t be surprised if machinery colors blend in the years ahead ",2015-12-14,T. Marc Schober,https://www.investing.com/analysis/machinery-market-ripe-for-consolidation-375805,375805
149843,371359,DE,Earnings  5 Stocks To Watch,opinion,"Monday  Palo Alto Networks  NYSE PANW 
Network security company Palo Alto Networks  PANW  is set to report earnings on Monday after the market closes  Contributing analysts on Estimize are expecting Palo Alto Networks to top the Wall Street EPS consensus by a penny per share on the bottom line and slightly over  4 million  2 4   in revenue 

Over the past 2 years Palo Alto has consistently reported in line or a 1 cent above the EPS consensus from the Street  6 of the previous 8 reports have been 1 cent better  and 2 came in line 
Coincidentally the 2 periods in which Palo Alto failed to maintain its quarter of quarter sequential earnings growth were both in its 4th fiscal quarter of the year  On Monday the Estimize community expects Palo Alto to shake of its 1 quarter stretch of flat earnings and get back to increasing profits by 1 cent per share  
Tuesday  Hewlett Packard Company  NYSE HPQ 
Last quarter HP announced that it will be dividing itself into two separate companies in one of the biggest tech breakups all time  One of the two companies will be dedicated to enterprise technology including servers and data storage equipment  the other will focus on selling printers and personal computers 
The split up is expected to be wrapped up by October of 2015 and the optimistic hope that by narrowing the two sides  focus they may be able reinvigorate expansion after a long period of stagnation  
In the past couple of years HP has struggled with earnings  only reporting an advancement in the 3 most recent quarters while going up against soft comparable quarters caused by drops in 2013  Again this quarter the Estimize community expects earnings per share that are higher than last year s results  but lower than the same quarter EPS reported in 2012 
Tuesday  Tiffany   Co  NYSE TIF 
Jewelry retailer Tiffany has put up 2 impressive earnings beats in a row now and contributing analysts on Estimize are expecting another 5 cent beat on Tuesday   

Last quarter worldwide net sales were up 7  and same store sales increased by 3  which the company cited as due to strength in the Americas and Asia Pacific regions  Same store sales in the Americas were up 9  last period which helped the company insulate itself from the strong US dollar which hindered profits from international sales at other retailers due to the high cost of repatriating currency 
This quarter the Estimize community is looking for Tiffany s to report 14  year over year earnings growth and 7  sales growth  This compares to 16  yoy earnings growth last quarter and consistent revenue revenue growth of 7

CTrip is a mainland China focused online travel company which serves the world s most populous nation s emerging middle class  Over the past 4 quarters the company s  revenues have increased between of 35  and 37  each quarter on a year over year basis 
Profits have been up and down as the company has spent aggressively on advertising  Last quarter CTrip set aside  77 million for sales and marketing 

Although costs are higher and earnings have slid in the past 2 quarters  reservation volume was up 64  compared to the same quarter of last year  signaling healthy growth  On Tuesday the Estimize community is looking for continued sales growth of 35  while earnings drop 40  year over year  but still beat the Street s view by 2 cents per share 
Wednesday  Deere   Company  NYSE DE 
The morning before Thanksgiving the John Deere tractor company will announce its quarterly earnings  So far this quarter  the industrials have been doing great increasing earnings by an average of 12 5   However  Deere is not expected to follow suit by crushing last year s numbers   

Deere   Company has surpassed the Estimize consensus in each of the previous 5 quarters and often by large margins  On Wednesday the Estimize community is setting the bar 9 cents higher than Wall Street is  If recent memory serves as an accurate guide  Deere shouldn t have a problem beating those estimates 
The Estimize community is forecasting earnings of  1 68 per share which would represent a 20  decline compared to the company s fourth fiscal quarter of last year  Over the past 2 quarters earnings have decreased 4  and 9  respectively and Estimize contributors expect the rate of decline to accelerate on Wednesday  Shares of Deere are down about 5  on the year ",2014-11-24,Estimize,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings:-5-stocks-to-watch-233573,233573

 severe given that the market is coming off a bubble   And  likely to last through at least 2016 based on the farm economy  the recent equipment buying binge  and historical analysis   De Maria continued   The downturn will play out over time  While we view Deere as a high quality global industrial  we maintain our bearish view on farm equipment and still see further downside  

De Maria has a 50  overall success rate recommending stocks with an average return of  2 1  per recommendation Separately on November 26th  analyst of Janney maintained a Neutral rating with a price target of  85  Connors noted  

 With negativity on the  agricultural  cycle rampant  it s tempting to take the other side of the trade and go long a quality company like Deere  but the company s initial guidance for FY2015 confirms the adage that the Street always plays catch up in quantifying the impact of cyclical swings on earnings  and it appears this process has not yet fully played out   Connors continued   With EPS likely to trough over the next 12 24 months  we believe that a compelling entry point lies on the horizon  but that in the near term the stock is likely to remain range bound in the seasonally slow winter months  

Connors has successfully rated 13 stocks with an average return of  14 6  per recommendation Separately  on November 27th  analyst  of Barclay s maintained an Overweight rating for Deere and lowered his price target to  93 from  94  Kaplowitz noted 

 Our View is that DE s initial FY15 outlook sets a realistic expectation for the company s earnings power amidst a steep cyclical correction in global  agriculture    He continued   It s too soon to say FY15 will mark the bottom  but we do agree with DE that the probability of similar declines repeating in FY16 is decreasing  We think the multiple on DE s stock should continue to rise modestly over time

149866,371382,DE, Canada s Climate Warms To Corn As Grain Belt Shifts North,opinion,The snow is piled waist deep outside the Southern Manitoba Convention Centre as more than 400 farmers gather to consider the once unthinkable  growing corn on the Canadian prairie  At one end of the packed auditorium last month in Morris  home of the Red River Wild hockey club  an Ohio farmer brought in by Dupont Fabros Technology Inc   DFT  is making a presentation with a slide that reads  Ear Count 101   At the other end  Deere   Company  NYSE DE  is showing off tractors and other equipment from a booth while Daryl Gross explains planters and corn dryers to curious men wearing seed caps   This is here to stay   said Gross  who sells CNH Global NV tractors for Southeastern Farm Equipment Ltd  in nearby Steinbach  His customers are increasingly devoting acreage to corn   There are a lot of guys who are experimenting with it and looking at it   he said  Corn is the most common grain in the U S   with its production historically concentrated in a Midwestern region stretching from the Ohio River valley to Nebraska and trailing off in northern Minnesota  It had been ungrowable in the fertile farmland of Canada s breadbasket  That is changing as a warming climate  along with the development of faster maturing seed varieties  turns the table on food cultivation  The Corn Belt is being pushed north of what was imaginable a generation ago  Canadian Season Growing seasons on the Canadian prairie have lengthened about two weeks in the past half century  The mean annual temperature is likely to climb by as much as 3 degrees Celsius  5 degrees Fahrenheit  in the region by 2050  according to Canadian researchers  In Canada  that means amber waves of wheat are giving way to green fields of corn  Farmers sowed a record 405 000 acres of corn in Manitoba  Saskatchewan and Alberta last year  double the amount two years earlier and almost eight times what it was 20 years ago  That compares with an estimated 95 4 million acres sown in the U S  last year  The prospect of a Canadian Corn Belt has helped push farmland nationwide up 36 percent from 2007 to 2012  to C 1 926   1 757  an acre  U S  farmland prices rose 22 percent in the same period  to  2 650 an acre  Monsanto  DuPont It has also drawn the attention of agribusinesses  Monsanto Company  NYSE MON  and DuPont have boosted staff and invested more than  100 million in the region  hosting corn clinics like the one in Morris  a town of 1 800 about 40 kilometers  25 miles  north of the U S  line  as well as research and development of seed varieties that can thrive in a shorter growing season   This is one of the few areas of the world where we are not growing corn and soybeans and have the opportunity to do that   said Greg Stokke  western Canada business director for DuPont Pioneer  the company s seed division   We can adapt to the region  and after that the economics become attractive for the farmers   West Des Moines  Iowa based Pioneer has more than doubled its staff in western Canada since 2008 and Pioneer and Monsanto have increased technical support for farmers trying new products  Higher prices for the grain make it attractive to grow  even with the lower yields associated with shorter seasons  said Dennis Todey  an agricultural engineering professor at South Dakota State University in Brookings and the state s climatologist   Planting Option   We re getting more moisture out west  our seasons are getting longer  and that makes corn a more viable planting option   he said  While the companies say they can increase acreage even under current conditions  warming  boosts what they re doing   Expansion may be aided in the shortrun by the formation of an El Nino  a period warming of the Pacific Ocean  which the United Nations  World Meteorological Organization said today may be imminent  Such events  which occur every two to seven years  tend to make winters in western Canada warmer  potentially aiding the growing season  The shift in climate  and crops  comes with risk  In 2012  the worst drought in the U S  Corn Belt since at least the 1950s seared the crops of southern farmers  some of whom are shifting to more drought resistant plants on the assumption that drier days were here to stay   Brutal Winter   We ve just had a brutal winter  which leads some people to say   Warmer summers  bring it on    Danny Blair  a professor of geography at the University of Winnipeg  said in an interview   But there s give and take in climate change  and in the end it may be more take than what it gives us   Global warming will increase the frequency of drought and erratic rainfall  he said  Insects and pests that don t survive Canadian winters will have a better chance in the future  giving northern farmers some of the same problems their U S  counterparts face  with less production to soften their losses   The less you do to mitigate climate change  the more unpredictable it will be   Blair said   We need to be talking more about mitigation  along with adaptation   Even with the shift in growing areas  climate change will cut global corn yields by about 1 percent a decade compared with what they otherwise would be  according to study released March 31 by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  Improved technology and farming practices can mitigate those losses  the panel said  Snow Drifts When Andrew Knowles began growing corn near St  Andrews  Manitoba  about 20 miles north of Winnipeg  in 2008  everyone thought he was stupid  he said   Now they come for advice   he said  Standing in snow that by mid March had drifted more than a meter  slightly more than 3 feet  deep  Knowles said he has until the end of May to get his crop in  Some years  he s had to harvest corn on snow covered ground  putting the wet grain through driers to make it sellable  Still  short season varieties  a little more heat  and lower land costs give him enough profit to compete with farmers further south in the U S   where crops are larger and farming is more expensive   In Illinois  what s your cash rent for an acre   300  Mine is  25   said Knowles  who said he can still make money with yields one third the U S  average and prices less than half what they are now  Know how learned from his experiments and visits with farmers from the Dakotas help  he said  So does Mother Nature  Hot Summers  The climate is changing in ways that benefit me  I think  because we re having hotter summers   he said   For the corn  it s just perfect  Heat and humidity  I like the hot summers   Monsanto estimates that acreage devoted to corn in western provinces could increase 20 fold by 2025  That would help Canada become self sufficient in corn  said Dan Wright  Monsanto s chief for corn expansion  Corn purchases from the U S  fell to  113 7 million in 2013  less than one quarter the level of five years ago  according to U S  data  Once the nation supplies its own dairy farms  pig barns  feedlots and ethanol plants  it can export  with production expanding from its beachhead in Manitoba s Red River valley into Saskatchewan and Alberta  where corn growing remains largely nonexistent  he said  Tractors  Bins Along with the crop comes a need for tractors  planters and grain bins  The Morris roadshow is one of five that DuPont Pioneer held across Canada s prairie provinces this year  the second year it s offered the seminars  Monsanto is also traversing the region  and both companies have boosted research into shorter season varieties  Still  the bet holds risk  Bumper crops in in the U S   the world s biggest grower  have throttled prices  and Canadian emergence only creates more competition  World production in 2013 outpaced demand for the third straight year  and prices have tumbled 40 percent from its all time high in 2012  Another record harvest is expected this year  Should Canada s would be corn growers or cold seasons not cooperate  investors will be left with empty silos and farmers with vanished profits   Climate change is tricky  because you can have unpredictability from year to year   he said   You have to sustain adoption rates through bad years   Meanwhile  the tendency toward weather extremes can work against the idea of climate change  making farmers skeptical  he said  This past winter was Winnipeg s coldest since 1979   King Corn   You hear about climate change and you wonder  but you also hear that maybe we re in a 70 year cycle  and it could get colder   said Lorne Loeppky   I m not a believer in it   Loeppky  who is nicknamed  King Corn   has been growing the crop in the region for almost 20 years Corn remains riskier than traditional crops because even shorter season varieties still take longer to grow than the standbys of oats and barley  said Herm Martens  who has farmed in the Morris area for almost 50 years  After trying corn in the late 1990s  he abandoned it about a half decade ago   It was a beautiful crop to grow  but the yield just wasn t there   he said   It may get there  but it s still going to take awhile   Farmer Resistance And simple resistance to new crops in a well established region may also slow adoption  said Susan Barmanovich  a fifth generation farmer in La Salle  Manitoba  who grows wheat to feed her free range chickens   I ve never raised

149868,371384,DE,A Dirt Cheap Global Fertilizer Producer,opinion,"According to the United Nations  the world needs to produce 60  more food by 2050 to avoid mass unrest 
At that point  the global population is expected to reach a whopping nine billion people  More mouths to feed  combined with the higher caloric intake of increasingly wealthy societies  will dramatically increase food demand 
Yet  as I wrote last week  the investing herd has stampeded out of agribusinesses 
The Market Vectors Agribusiness ETF  NYSE MOO   which was a crowd favorite in 2011  has experienced significant outflows totaling  2 8 billion year to date 
This ETF holds phosphate and potash producers such as Mosaic  NYSE MOS  and Potash Corp  of Saskatchewan  NYSE POT   in addition to farming machinery manufacturers such as Deere   Co   NYSE DE  and Kubota Corp   TOKYO 6326  
I ve scoured the full list of holdings for hidden value  and there was one company in particular that caught my eye 
Scandinavian Value
That company is Norway based Yara International ASA  OSLO YAR   the world s largest producer of ammonia  nitrate  and complex fertilizer  Yara has sales in more than 150 countries and helps crop producers provide food for a growing global population 
With low debt levels and the equivalent of  1 billion in cash  Yara s balance sheet is pristine  That  combined with strong earnings  translates to a very low enterprise value to EBITDA ratio of 7 8x  Yara also has an attractive price to sales  P S  ratio of 1 0x 
By comparison  Syngenta AG  NYSE SYT   the company with the largest weighting in MOO  has an EV EBITDA ratio of 13 0x and a P S ratio of 2 2x  These metrics should give you an idea of the tremendous opportunity that Yara shares represent 
Yara also produces ample free cash flow  FCF  to cover its dividend payments  In the latest 12 month period  the firm generated nearly  2 billion in FCF with a respectable FCF margin  FCF as a percent of sales  of 8 8  
Yara s valuation is all the more surprising because the company is well positioned for growth  In Latin America  its crop nutrition solutions are helping improve crop yields and quality  For instance  Brazil   which has become an agricultural powerhouse   is Yara s biggest market 
Yara s primary share class trades on the Oslo Stock Exchange with a market capitalization of  13 6 billion  85 8 billion NOK   Additionally  there are American depositary receipts  ADRs  trading under the ticker YARIY that give U S  investors an easy way to invest 
Now  foreign withholding taxes on dividend payments are an additional factor to consider with ADRs  Luckily  it s not a huge concern with Yara  Net of taxes  YARIY still has a solid dividend yield of 2 5   based on 2014 s annual distribution  
As you ve noticed over the past few weeks  I ve identified compelling value in shares of a Japanese brewer and now a Norwegian fertilizer producer  That s because  while there are still some cheap stocks in the United States  the deep value opportunities tend to be overseas 
We d be smart to expand our horizons  and these two ADRs are great ways to start 
Safe  and high yield  investing

149869,371385,DE,Will Commodity Slump Weigh On Agribusiness ,opinion,"Agricultural commodities performed impressively in the first four months of 2014 helped by a weaker dollar  adverse weather and greater demand  However  the space snapped the trend soon to reflect a benign weather outlook and accelerated crop plantation that exceeded demand  If this was not enough  the six year high U S  dollar against the yen put pressure on commodity prices  Sluggish global demand thanks to rough global recovery has also been playing a crucial role in pulling down agricultural commodity prices  Some crops including corn  soybeans and wheat are expected  by market participants  to leave the year with huge inventories  This trend has also been replicated in agribusiness companies such as  manufacturers of seeds and fertilizers  chemicals and farm machinery firms   The sector thrives on demand for food and the resultant price trends  read     A notable company in this space is Monsanto Company  NYSE MON   which sells seeds to farmers  Another company  Deere   Company  NYSE DE   is a renowned manufacturer of agricultural equipment  Now that most of the agro based product prices are going downhill due to soft demand  we expect these companies to suffer in the coming weeks from a declining pricing power Food Price Trends Per USDA s forecast  as of August 25   consumer price inflation for 2015 will likely decline to the 2 3  range from an expected 2 5 3 5  for this year  Meat prices that have shot up this year will likely return to normal levels next year  USDA estimates that meat price inflation will hover around 3 4  range next year  down from the 5 6  range likely to be noticed this year  read     The fresh fruit price index is likely to register another steep decline in the 2 5 3 5  range from 5 6  this year  per USDA  Corn and soybean prices slid to 4 year lows  Wheat is also hovering around the same lows  All these should mar farmers  interest in further planting and using products that enhance yields such as fertilizers and machinery    This trend gives an ominous signal to the broader agribusiness ETFs in the market  These funds have plunged in recent trading  and could face more trouble if the broad based commodity weakness continues  However  investors should note that the agricultural space is somewhat volatile and depends largely on weather conditions  Any adverse weather condition might open up an opportunity to buy the agribusiness ETFs  Below  we have discussed some of the available products in detail 
Market Vectors Agribusiness ETF  NYSE MOO 
This fund provides exposure to the global agribusiness industry by tracking the Market Vectors Global Agribusiness Index  It is a pretty popular choice in the space with AUM of over  1 66 billion  The ETF charges 55 bps in annual fees  read       In total  the fund holds 56 securities in its basket  Of these firms  the stock under consideration   Monsanto   takes the first place  making up roughly 8 16  of total assets  In terms of country allocation  U S   49 1    Canada  10 6   and Switzerland  7 7   occupy the top spots  The fund has lost 2  in the year to date time frame 
PowerShares Global Agriculture Fund  NASDAQ PAGG 
This product provides global exposure to companies engaged in agriculture and farming related activities  It follows the Nasdaq OMX Global Agriculture Index and has  69 4 million in AUM while trades in paltry volumes  PAGG charges 76 bps in fees per year    Holding 43 securities  the fund is concentrated on the top three firms   Archer Daniels Midland  NYSE ADM   Potash Corporation  NYSE POT  and Monsanto  NYSE MON    with 8  share each  U S  firms dominate the fund s return with 40  of assets  followed by Canada  12   and Malaysia  9    The product is tilted toward large caps at about 80  of assets while mid and small caps take the remaining portion in the basket  The ETF has added just 0 9  in the year to date time frame  
MSCI Global Agriculture Producers ETF  NYSE VEGI 
This global ETF looks to track the MSCI ACWI Select Agriculture Producers Investable Market Index and invests about  45 7 million of assets  In its 122 stock portfolio  the in focus Monsanto takes the top spot with 15 26  allocation  Sector wise  materials take the top position with 50 44  share followed by food and beverages  21 7    Country wise  the U S  accounts for about half of the portfolio while Canada  11 1   and Switzerland  7 8   occupy the next positions  The ETF charges about 39 bps in fees a year and has a dividend yield of 2 05   The fund has lost about 0 6  in the year to date time frame Bottom Line Though the agribusiness space is presently going through a rough patch  having hardly witnessed gains in the year to date frame  long term drivers seem to be in place mainly due to the ballooning global population  As soon as the global economy revives  be it China or the Euro zone  we believe that the demand profile will pick up  read    ",2014-10-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/will-commodity-slump-weigh-on-agribusiness-227688,227688

149892,371408,DE,Deere  Earnings Growrh Expected To Continue At 10 ,opinion,Before analyzing a company for investment  it s important to have a perspective on how well the business has performed  Because at the end of the day  if you are an investor  you are buying the business  The FAST Graphs  presented with this article will focus first on the business behind the stock  The orange line on

services and is committed to the success of customers whose work is linked to the land   those who cultivate  harvest  transform  enrich and build upon the land to meet the world s dramatically increasing need for food  fuel  shelter and infrastructure This article will reveal the business prospects of Deere   Co through the lens of FAST Graphs   fundamentals analyzer software tool  Therefore  it is offered as the first step before a more comprehensive research effort  Our objective is to provide companies that have excellent historical records and appear reasonably priced based on past  present and future data and expectations  A quick glance at the graph itself and the orange earnings justified valuation line will tell the readers volumes about how well the company has historically been managed and performed as an operating business  Simply put  the reader should ask whether this example is worthy of a greater investment of their time and effort based on the data as presented and organized  The FAST Graphs  unique advantage is the graphical articulation of the price value proposition  Earnings Determine Market Price  The following earnings and price correlated F A S T  Graphs  clearly illustrates the importance of earnings  The Earnings Growth Rate Line or True Worth  Line  orange line with white triangles  is correlated with the historical stock price line  On graph after graph the lines will move in tandem  If the stock price strays away from the earnings line  over or under   inevitably it will come back to earnings  Earnings   Price Correlated Fundamentals at a GlanceA quick glance at the historical earnings and price correlated FAST Graphs  on Deere   Co shows a picture of undervaluation based upon the historical earnings growth rate of 13

the value corridor of the five orange lines   based on future growth  Deere   Co  Historical Earnings  Price  Dividends and Normal P E Since 2005Performance Table Deere   CoThe associated performance results with the earnings and price correlated graph  validates the principles regarding the two components of total return  capital appreciation and dividend income  Dividends are included in the total return calculation and are assumed paid  but not reinvested  When presented separately like this  the additional rate of return a dividend paying stock produces for shareholders becomes undeniably evident  In addition to the 11 3  Annualized ROR  w o Div   green circle   long term shareholders of Deere   Co  assuming an initial investment of  10 000  would have received an additional  2 565 91 in total dividends paid  blue highlighting  that increased their Annualized ROR  w o Div  from 11 3  to a Total Annualized ROR plus Dividends Paid of 12 6  versus 4 7  in the S P 500 The following graph plots the historical P E ratio  the dark blue line  in conjunction with 10 year Treasury note interest  Notice that the current price earnings ratio on this quality company is as normal as it has been since 2005 A further indication of valuation can be seen by examining a company s current P S ratio relative to its historical P S ratio  The current P S ratio for Deere   Co is  96 which is historically normal  Looking to the FutureExtensive research has provided a preponderance of conclusive evidence that future long term returns are a function of two critical determinants 1  The rate of change  growth rate  of the company s earnings2  The price or valuation you pay to buy those earningsForecasting future earnings growth  bought at sound valuations  is the key to safe  sound and profitable performance The Estimated Earnings and Return Calculator Tool is a simple yet powerful resource that empowers the user to calculate and run various investing scenarios that generate precise rate of return potentialities  Thinking the investment through to its logical conclusion is an important component towards making sound and prudent commonsense investing decisions The consensus of 22 leading analysts reporting to Capital IQ forecast Deere   Co s long term earnings growth at 10   Deere   Co has high long term debt at 75  of capital  Deere   Co is currently trading at a P E of 11 1  which is below the value corridor  defined by the five orange lines  of a maximum P E of 18  If the earnings materialize as forecast  based upon forecasted earnings growth of 10

Earnings Yield EstimatesDiscounted Future Cash Flows  All companies derive their value from the future cash flows  earnings  they are capable of generating for their stakeholders over time  Therefore  because Earnings Determine Market Price in the long run  we expect the future earnings of a company to justify the price we pay Since all investments potentially compete with all other investments  it is useful to compare investing in any prospective company to that of a comparable investment in low risk Treasury bonds  Comparing an investment in Deere   Co to an equal investment in 10 year Treasury bonds illustrates that Deere   Co s expected earnings would be 8 8  purple circle  times that of the 10 year T bond interest  see EYE chart below   This is the essence of the importance of proper valuation as a critical investing component Summary   ConclusionsThis report presented essential  fundamentals at a glance  illustrating the past and present valuation based on earnings achievements as reported  Future forecasts for earnings growth are based on the consensus of leading analysts  Although with just a quick glance you can know a lot about the company  it s imperative

149893,371409,DE,Goldilocks Is Back  An Economy That Is Neither Too Hot Or Cold,opinion,This past Monday  the S P was down over 5  at its low from the FOMC meeting a few days earlier  7  from its high  The bond market was in the ditch with a couple of black eyes  gold was breaking long term trends  and even municipal bonds were getting beaten up  Emerging markets  You didn t want to admit that you knew them  Nothing was sacred The headlines were filled with dark lamentations about triple digit losses  Chinese credit  heavy redemptions and the general lack of safe alternatives  And let s not forget the number of burned investors and media mavens who rushed forward to scold Mr  Bernanke and the FOMC for their communications skills  The gist of it  of course  was that the Fed should not be communicating tightening of monetary policy  not ever  Don t even hint at it  unless of course you want to send us a confidential transmission ahead of everyone else Some predictable things ensued  some of which I had written about myself  Fed governors fanned out over the following days to reassure the masses  Bond traders moralized and shouted over the proceedings  And then some good housing news hit  and durable goods were okay  and GDP was revised downward for the first quarter to 1 8   Goldilocks entered the house  The last day of June is often weak and Friday was no exception  or the market might have rallied one more day back to breakeven on the month There were some less predictable events too  in particular the sight of bonds being dumped  Treasury bonds haven t been so unpopular since the Long Term Capital meltdown nearly fifteen years ago  farther back than many traders can go  Much of the damage was erroneously imputed to fear of higher rates  but the full effect of that was later  and mostly on the retail side  Much of the damage came from trading strategies that use Treasuries in one form or another  and some fear of higher rates rapidly translated into a lot of trades unwinding in a fashion that was both painful and hurried  Bond deals that would have sailed through the wickets six weeks ago were either amended or canceled Yet the market is likely to rally right into earnings season  so long as the jobs report doesn t throw a wheel  Next week brings the ever reliable first of the month rally  not to mention the usual rally that leads into the 4th of July holiday  Recent regional surveys suggest that the national ISM manufacturing number can recover past 50 on Monday  Housing news last week helped the market forget its troubles  and monthly auto sales on Tuesday could add additional balm  All we need is a jobs number similar to the last two months   even better  one that follows another ADP disappointment   and the  Goldilocks  paradigm of an economy neither too hot nor too cold will be ascendant Earnings season could very well be another story  but even if year over year comparisons turn up anemic  the market is usually able to keep going anyway through at least the third week of July  After that it may get dicey and often does  but next week and the week after could see stock indices add another percent or three  so long as there isn t any serious trouble from abroad One overseas problem that is likely to ease for now is the string of scare stories about credit in China  It seems quite apparent that the central bank was determined to punish excess lending in the shadow sector this time and deliberately allowed a scramble for the quarter end cash necessary to the balance sheets  Whether or not the lenders have to be cowed again next quarter remains to be seen  but next week at least conditions are likely to ease considerably  if for no other reason than the cash is less needed than before Another boost could come from automakers curtailing their summer shutdown  or even doing without it altogether  That s likely to put a glow on jobless claims data and help out the next round of manufacturing surveys  A lot can happen over the next few weeks to throw things off  especially in the sphere of policy  but if the upcoming economic releases are anything like last week  you ll start hearing some bombastic pronouncements about the second half recovery  That s likely to be a sucker s bet  but similar disappointments in the past have never stopped the Street from trying A reminder to our readers that Thursday  the 4th of July  is a US holiday and all markets and banks will be closed  Enjoy the break  especially those lucky enough to make it a four day weekend The Economic BeatThe week was a study in contrasts  I had thought that the report of the week would be the personal income and spending report  In retrospect  it may have been the headline from the Case Shiller housing report that reported existing home sale prices being up 12 1  over the previous year  It came shortly before a positive surprise in new home sales  and shortly after the positive surprise in durable goods It s probably safe to say that some of the increase in Case Shiller pricing represents a mix shift  as the FHFA  federal mortgages  index  which excludes home prices that sold last year for over  750 000  and less in most regions   rose only 7 4   Both results are well above the long term average Housing news was good across the board  really  with new home sales up to a  still low  476K annual rate and pending home sales rising more than forecast to their highest rate since 2006  It seems fairly evident that the uptick in mortgage rates is panicking some buyers off of the sidelines  so I would look for more strength next month That makes it a good time for my usual safe driving warnings  One is that mortgage credit is still quite difficult to come by  and while it may ease up a bit this summer  the credit and currency markets have gotten sloppy enough that one can feel reasonably certain some sort of credit event driven fright is likely over the next twelve months In the second place  the housing market is about 2 4  of GDP  The actual dollar effect  with multiplier and confidence effects thrown in  is still well below the level of the paeans being written about it by Wall Street  It is also a market still very dependent on cash investors and government financing  over 90  of mortgages   Naturally one hopes that this will heal over time  but it isn t going to be a straight line and any hiccup in credit markets will set it back for a period The Richmond Fed survey punctuated a decent string of positive manufacturing surprises that included New York  though new orders fell   Philadelphia  Dallas  and durable goods  The end of the week changed direction  with the Kansas City and Chicago surveys dropping well below expectations  the former a minus 5   Chicago is usually thought of as being auto based  but Caterpillar  CAT  is based in Illinois and though it s only speculation on my part  it may be that recent weakness in Cat and Deere  DE  was a drag on the two neighboring regions  the Kansas City region is tilted towards agriculture   In light of automaker plans to forego summer shutdowns next month  both the national and Chicago ISM readings might benefit The GDP revision for the first quarter took the market by surprise  falling from 2 4  all the way to 1 8   but it was far enough back in the rear view mirror that the rally was not only able to continue  but gain strength from the inference that the Fed would not  in fact  be able to begin tapering soon  More ominous to me was the trailing four quarter rate in nominal GDP falling to 3 3  through the first quarter after averaging 4  for several years  I suppose the bright side is that another quarter like the first one is going to make it difficult to taper much The GDP revision was consistent with the Chicago Fed national activity survey  which fell again and brought the 3 month moving average to   0 43   This chart is a bit scary when one looks at the divergence between the S P 500 and national activity It s especially worrisome when you look at the last time the current pattern developed  Perhaps the auto sector can turn the July reading around Consumer sentiment rose to new multi year highs in the University of Michigan and Bloomberg surveys  though the former had a decline in current conditions  These things tend to peak just before bad times  though a high reading doesn t guarantee a bad ending Next week is the first week of July  and it ll be a big one as usual  what with both ISM surveys and the two payroll reports  It s also good news  bad news for Street denizens  as the Thursday holiday tempts a four day weekend  but that would mean being out of the office for the jobs report  The buy side should be at the beach in droves  with the sell side and traders a little less lucky  Even so  look for Manhattan to empty out early The lineup is June ISM manufacturing and May construction spending on Monday  factory orders and auto sales on Tuesday  ADP payrolls and ISM services on Wednesday  and jobs on Friday  The ECB announcement is on Thursday  when all US markets  offices and banks are closed ,2013-06-30,Kevin

149894,371410,DE,How To Play The Strong Dollar,opinion,If there is a better chart for measuring the trade weighted dollar  or the dollar against the world s major currencies either on a normalized  or a trade weighted basis  shoot me an e mail  and I will give you a shout out with the chart The above chart is the PowerShares DB U S  Dollar Index Bullish Fund  UUP   and ETF which is a combination of the euro and yen  but it is one of the few trading proxies I see for the greenback  The euro is about 55  of the ETF  while the yen is 15   Technically there are 6 currencies that the UUP tracks or holds  but the euro and yen 70  of the total The dollars strength that has been discussed of late still looks pretty tame on the chart  since the downtrend line that starts with the 2008 peak near  27 00 is still intact My first real job on a trading desk  back in 1990  was when the yen was trading at 220 to the dollar  and the Midwest was still working off the crushing strength that saw the dollar soar after Reaganomics  and the explosive growth in the US economy saw massive capital flows into the dollar There are a lot of different factors that effect a nation s currency levels 1   Relative monetary policies   not an issue today since most of the globe s major developed economy s central banks have easy money policies 2   Relative fiscal policies   again  most countries like the EU  and the USA have reduced budget deficits and are following more austere policies  so for the most part nations are leaning the same way 3   Relative interest rates   the dollar might be strengthening based on the preception that thed Fed might be raising rates first  thus  real  interest rates might be higher in the US over longer periods of time 4   Relative capital flows 5   Relative Income and product levels 6   Perception   I believe the perception today is that the US is first and the festest to generate real economic growth The US dollar could be strengthening due to the fact that the US economy is still  1 in the world in terms of size  and is again  growing the fastest when ranked by GDP growth  The perception and the reality now that the S P 500 is trading at an all time high  and US interest rates have started to rise  is that the US economy will start to be the real engine of growth for the world s various economies  and that that growth phase is starting to become real If you were to ask me which of the above factors are most critical to the currency moves  it would be  3 or interest rate differentials  driven by real  in flation adjusted  rates of return The UUP is one way to play the strong dollar  Another way to play currency is to figure out which sectors are major importers or exporters and adjust accordingly It is pretty clear the yen will likely trade weaker over the next 6 to 12 months  The euro might actually strengthen as that part of the globe moves to growth from stagnation We are simply broaching the topic for readers  There are many  many reasons currencies appreciate and depreciate We think the dollar continues higher  as the US economy recovers the fastest  The dollar s extended strength becomes a threat to major exporters  which is what happened to Caterpillar  CAT   Deere  DE   and the steel companies  turning the Midwest manufacturing belt to the  Rust Belt  in the mid 1980 s It will take prolonged strengthening to really impair US growth in this cycle ,2013-07-07,Brian Gilmartin,https://www.investing.com/analysis/how-to-play-the-strong-dollar-174287,174287

150056,371572,DE,Deere   Co  Fundamental Analysis,opinion,Before analyzing a company for investment  it s important to have a perspective on how well the business has performed  Because at the end of the day  if you are an investor  you are buying the business  The FAST Graphs  presented with this article will focus first on the business behind the stock  The orange line on the graph plots earnings per share since 2005  A quick glance vividly reveals the historical operating record of the company This article will reveal the business prospects of Deere   Co   DE  through the lens of FAST Graphs  Earnings Determine Market Price  The following earnings and price correlated FAST Graphs  clearly illustrates the importance of earnings  The Earnings Growth Rate Line or True Worth  Line  orange line with white triangles  is correlated with the historical stock price line  On graph after graph the lines will move in tandem  If the stock price strays away from the earnings line  over or under   inevitably it will come back to earnings  Earnings And Price Correlated Fundamentals At A GlanceA quick glance at the historical earnings and price correlated FAST Graphs  on Deere   Co  shows a picture of undervaluation based upon the historical earnings growth rate of 12 9  and a current P E of 10 9  Analysts are forecasting the earnings growth to continue at about 10   and when you look at the forecasting graph below  the stock appears undervalued  it s outside of the value corridor of the five orange lines    based on future growth  Historical Earnings  Price  Dividends and Normal P E Since 2005Performance TableThe associated performance results with the earnings and price correlated graph  validates the principles regarding the two components of total return  capital appreciation and dividend income  Dividends are included in the total return calculation and are assumed paid  but not reinvested  When presented separately like this  the additional rate of return a dividend paying stock produces for shareholders becomes undeniably evident  In addition to the 11 1  capital appreciation  green circle   long term shareholders of Deere   Co   assuming an initial investment of  1 000  would have received an additional  240 45 in dividends  blue highlighting  that increased their total return from 11 1  to 12 5  per annum versus 3 9  in the S P 500 The following graph plots the historical P E ratio  the dark blue line  in conjunction with 10 year Treasury note interest  Notice that the current price earnings ratio on this quality company is as normal as it has been since 2005 A further indication of valuation can be seen by examining a company s current P S ratio relative to its historical P S ratio  The current P S ratio for Deere   Co  is  92 which is historically normal  Looking To The FutureExtensive research has provided a preponderance of conclusive evidence that future long term returns are a function of two critical determinants 1  The rate of change  growth rate  of the company s earnings2  The price or valuation you pay to buy those earningsForecasting future earnings growth  bought at sound valuations  is the key to safe  sound and profitable performance The Estimated Earnings and Return Calculator Tool is a simple yet powerful resource that empowers the user to calculate and run various investing scenarios that generate precise rate of return potentialities  Thinking the investment through to its logical conclusion is an important component towards making sound and prudent commonsense investing decisions The consensus of 22 leading analysts reporting to Capital IQ forecast Deere   Co s long term earnings growth at 10   orange circle   Deere   Co  has high long term debt at 79  of capital  red circle   Deere   Co  is currently trading at a P E of 10 9  which is below the value corridor  defined by the five orange lines  of a maximum P E of 18  If the earnings materialize as forecast  based upon forecasted earnings growth of 10   Deere   Co  s share price would  197 10 at the end of 2018  brown circle on EYE Chart   which would represent a 16 5  annual rate of total return which includes dividends paid  yellow highlighting  Earnings Yield EstimatesDiscounted Future Cash Flows  All companies derive their value from the future cash flows  earnings  they are capable of generating for their stakeholders over time  Therefore  because Earnings Determine Market Price in the long run  we expect the future earnings of a company to justify the price we pay Since all investments potentially compete with all other investments  it is useful to compare investing in any prospective company to that of a comparable investment in low risk Treasury bonds  Comparing an investment in Deere   Co to an equal investment in 10 year Treasury bonds illustrates that Deere   Co s expected earnings would be 8 4  purple circle  times that of the 10 year T bond interest  see EYE chart below   This is the essence of the importance of proper valuation as a critical investing component Summary And ConclusionsThis report presented essential  fundamentals at a glance  illustrating the past and present valuation based on earnings achievements as reported  Future forecasts for earnings growth are based on the consensus of leading analysts  Although with just a quick glance you can know a lot

150140,371656,DE,Battle Of The Tractors  Deere Vs  Caterpillar,opinion,Many eyes are focusing on the price action in Deere   DE   After it broke above 83 75  resistance since February  the stock looks ready to keep traveling higher  Currently attempting to move higher out of a bull flag it has resistance at 87 and 88 before free air to move higher and the Measured Move would take it to 90  With support from a bullish and rising Relative Strength Index  RSI  and a Deere  DEMoving Average Convergence Divergence indicator  MACD  that is crossing to positive it is truly a great trade set up  But if you move a little earth  digging below the surface  there might be a better play in beaten up Caterpillar   CAT   The ratio chart below of Caterpillar to Deere carries a lot of information  There are two trendlines that help define the bullish and bearish picture over the last 3 years  with the pertinent information today in the green support line and red resistance line in the bearish phase for the ratio  Also note the marked areas on the RSI at the top  when it has moved into technically overbought or oversold areas  coinciding with the ratio at the trend line or vastly extended  Finally the MACD signal crosses at the bottom have been the trigger when all three line up Caterpillar vs Deere  CAT vs DEAnd the ratio is signaling a trade trigger right now with the RSI bottomed  the MACD crossing up and the ratio on support  The moves off of the bottom have averaged over 20   and a 20  move would just coincide with a touch of the resistance trend  That is a 20  move in Caterpillar relative to Deere  Think of what that means If Deere does not move at all then it equates to a move to near 102  But since Deere looks poised to move higher towards 90 the Caterpillar move would rise to over 105  There is nothing wrong with driving a Deere higher to 90  but the better opportunity may be found in Caterpillar Disclosure  The information in this blog post represents my own opinions and does not contain a recommendation for any particular security or investment  I or my affiliates may hold positions or other interests in securities mentioned in the Blog  please see my  page for my full disclaimer ,2012-10-31,Gregory W.
