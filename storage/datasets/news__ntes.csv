NetEase  NASDAQ NTES   which publishes the PES franchise in China  confirmed on Wednesday it will remove Ozil from all three existing titles  including the flagship PES 2020 Mobile

111696,333211,NTES,Tencent Music s Universal Music Deal Could Hurt Alibaba and NetEase,news,"Tencent Holdings  OTC TCEHY  recently led a consortium of companies  including Tencent Music Entertainment  NYSE TME   in acquiring a 10  stake of Vivendi s  OTC VIVHY  Universal Music Group for  3 4 billion 
Before the deal closes in the first half of 2020  Tencent Music is expected to enter a second deal to acquire a minority stake in UMG s Chinese business  Furthermore  the deal gives the consortium the option of buying an additional stake of up to 10  in UMG by Jan  15  2021 

Tencent Music is already the top online streaming company in China  but these deals will improve its access to UMG s lineup of artists  which includes Taylor Swift  Lady Gaga  and The Beatles  It will also likely lower Tencent Music s licensing fees for UMG songs  and bolster its sub licensing business  which licenses its tracks to other Chinese streaming music platforms  This deal clearly benefits Tencent Music  but it could also hurt NetEase  NASDAQ NTES  Cloud Music  Alibaba s  NYSE BABA  AliMusic  and other rivals in several ways 
The 800 pound gorilla just gained weight
Tencent Music owns the three most popular music streaming apps in China    QQ Music  Kugou  and Kuwo  These three apps control about three quarters of China s music streaming market  while the rest of the market is fragmented among smaller players 
NetEase and Alibaba are two of the market s more resilient underdogs  To challenge Tencent Music  the two companies pooled parts of their streaming libraries in 2018  Alibaba also acquired a  700 million stake in NetEase Cloud Music last year 
However  Tencent Music s clout still helped it secure more exclusive deals with the three largest record labels in the world  Access Industries  Warner Music  Sony Music Entertainment  and Vivendi s Universal Music Group  Those deals caused NetEase  Alibaba  and other companies to file complaints with China s antitrust regulators  which subsequently forced all Chinese streaming platforms to share their licensing rights with their rivals via sub licensing deals 
Tencent Music complied and licensed its songs to rival platforms  but a Bloomberg report last year claimed that TME s sub licenses could be  twice as expensive  as direct licenses from record labels  That practice sparked an antitrust probe of Tencent Music last year and forced it to cut its sub licensing fees 

Some investors believed that the probe could derail Tencent s Tencent s talks with UMG  which started last summer  However  the deal was still approved    and will likely allow Tencent Music to license songs at lower royalties from UMG  then sub license them back to rivals like NetEase and Alibaba at current rates for higher profits  To add insult to injury  Tencent Music will also reap profits from NetEase and Alibaba s direct licensing payments to UMG 
What does this mean for Alibaba and NetEase 
Tencent s UMG deal won t threaten Alibaba or NetEase s core businesses  since neither company relies heavily on streaming music revenue  Alibaba generates most of its revenue from its core commerce business  while NetEase makes most of its money from video games 
However  the deal makes it harder for both companies to gain ground in China s streaming music market  Alibaba operates AliMusic as part of its digital media and entertainment unit  which has been an unprofitable money pit ever since its IPO in 2014  NetEase opened up Cloud Music to nearly a dozen external investors since 2013  but it still maintains a majority stake in the unit  NetEase doesn t disclose if the unit is profitable  but recently warned that it mostly relies on non exclusive deals  and that the  competition in China for exclusive or non exclusive licenses to distribute music content is fierce  
Moreover  maintaining a streaming music platform contradicts NetEase s strategy of streamlining its business with the divestments of its online comics unit and its e commerce platform Kaola  as well as the spin off of its Youdao education unit over the past year  This suggests that NetEase will prioritize the growth of its core gaming business over its music streaming business in the future 
The key takeaways
Tencent Music s investors should expect the UMG deal to stabilize the company s gross margins  which were weighed down by lower sub licensing fees in recent quarters  It should also reinforce its position as China s streaming music leader 
However  the deal will make it tougher for Alibaba  NetEase  and other smaller rival Chinese stocks to keep pace with Tencent Music  These smaller players probably can t count on China s antitrust regulators to throttle Tencent Music s growth  or prevent the company from making additional investments in other big record labels in the future ",2020-01-07,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pevil,2053928

111739,333254,NTES, Homeland Dream   Chinese gaming giants unveil titles that play up patriotic values,news,"By Pei Li and Brenda Goh
SHANGHAI  Reuters    Chinese gaming companies  including giants Tencent and NetEase  NASDAQ NTES   unveiled new titles at an industry meet that show off socialist values and patriotic themes amid stricter state censorship and a push to back Communist Party propaganda 
The games  introduced at China s largest gaming convention that ended on Monday  point to the industry s rapidly changing landscape after state suspension of fresh approvals last year against a backdrop of growing criticism of addiction among younger players and violent content 
Titles showcased at China Digital Entertainment Expo and Conference  known as ChinaJoy  ranged from ones that promoted domestic culture to others that recounted the country s history  such as Shengqu Games   Codename  South China Sea   which allows users to run a coastal town set in the Ming Dynasty 
Tencent said it was collaborating with state newspaper People s Daily to roll out a new game   Homeland Dream   and with the propaganda department of the Communist Party s Guangdong arm on a title called  Story of my Home  
Players of  Homeland Dream   for example  will be tasked to develop a city that will need to execute policies like poverty alleviation and tax reduction  which are key goals of Beijing 
 This year is the 70th anniversary of the founding of new China  to that end Tencent has done much pre planning and made investments to the theme of  me and my motherland      to create products reflective of the current era   Steven Ma  Tencent s senior vice president  said on the sidelines of the conference 
SEEKING RECOVERY
Tencent s push to show off its red credentials comes as it was hit particularly hard by last year s lengthy freeze in approvals in the world s largest gaming market 
It was forced to pull a popular Texas Hold Em poker video game and then waited in vain for over a year for approval to earn money on global blockbuster  PlayerUnknown s Battlegrounds   PUBG  even after giving it a socialist makeover 
Tencent later pulled PUBG and shifted users to a similar  more patriotic version 
Shares of the world s top gaming firm tumbled more than 40 percent in 2018  but have recovered slightly since then 
The company s new titles mark its  desire to survive and is a very rational business choice   said Fang Kecheng  assistant professor in the School of Journalism and Communication at the Chinese University of Hong Kong 
 These themes sometimes can perform well on the market  so it doesn t totally conflict with business interest  
Tencent s main rival  NetEase  also said it was making more efforts to promote Chinese traditional culture and values in its titles such as  Ink  Mountains and Mystery   an adventure game with monster characters from traditional Chinese mythology 
Under President Xi Jinping  China has pushed to cleanse online content  from video streaming to games  to meet strict rules banning material that goes against Communist Party values 
Gaming companies  need to seriously consider social effects     and always steer in the right direction in politics  value  content theme  and quality  and never provide platforms and channels for wrong views and low taste   Guo Yiqiang  the head of the publishing bureau under China s Communist Party Propaganda Department  said at ChinaJoy ",2019-08-05,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/homeland-dream-chinese-gaming-giants-unveil-titles-that-play-up-patriotic-values-1945408,1945408

111888,333403,NTES,3 Top Ranked Dividend Stocks  A Smarter Way To Boost Your Retirement Income   January 31  2020,opinion,"Strange but true  seniors fear death less than running out of money in retirement 
And retirees have good reason to be worried about making their assets last  People are living longer  so that money has to cover a longer period  Making matters worse  income generated using tried   and   true retirement planning approaches may not cover expenses these days  That means seniors must dip into principal to meet living expenses 
In today s economic environment  traditional income investments are not working 
For example  10 year Treasury bonds in the late 1990s offered a yield of around 6 50   which translated to an income source you could count on  However  today s yield is much lower   currently under 2  and probably not a viable return option to fund typical retirements 
That means if you had  1 million in 10 year Treasuries  the difference in yield between 1999 and today is more than  1 million 
Today s retirees are getting hit hard by reduced bond yields   and the Social Security picture isn t too rosy either  Right now and for the near future  Social Security benefits are still being paid  but it has been estimated that the Social Security funds will be depleted as soon as 2035 
So what can retirees do  You could dramatically reduce your expenses  and go out on a limb hoping your Social Security benefits don t diminish  On the other hand  you could opt for an alternative investment that gives a steady  higher rate income stream to supplant lessening bond yields 
Invest in Dividend Stocks
Dividend paying stocks from low risk  high quality companies are a smart way to generate steady and reliable attractive income streams to replace current low risk  low yielding Treasury and bond options 
For example  AT T  NYSE T  and Coca Cola  NYSE KO  are income stocks with attractive dividend yields of 3  or better  Look for stocks like this that have paid steady  increasing dividends for years  or decades   and have not cut their dividends even during recessions 
A rule of thumb for finding solid income producing stocks is to seek those that average 3  dividend yield  and positive yearly dividend growth  These stocks can help combat inflation by boosting dividends over time 
Here are three dividend paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio 
Brinker International  EAT  is currently shelling out a dividend of  0 38 per share  with a dividend yield of 3 48   This compares to the Retail   Restaurants industry s yield of 0  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 77   In terms of dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  1 52 is flat compared to last year 
Marathon Petroleum  MPC  is paying out a dividend of 0 53 per share at the moment  with a dividend yield of 3 9  compared to the Oil and Gas   Refining and Marketing industry s yield of 2 71  and the S P 500 s yield  Taking a look at the company s dividend growth  its current annualized dividend of  2 12 is up 15 22  from last year 
Currently paying a dividend of 7 59 per share  NetEase  NASDAQ NTES  has a dividend yield of 5 05   This is compared to the Internet   Software and Services industry s yield of 0  and the S P 500 s current yield  Looking at dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  16 55 is up 824 58  from last year 
But aren t stocks generally more risky than bonds 
It is true that stocks  as an asset class  carry more risk than bonds  but high quality dividend stocks not only have the ability to produce income growth over time but more importantly  can also reduce your overall portfolio volatility relative to the broader stock market 
An upside to adding dividend stocks to your retirement portfolio  they can help lessen the effects of inflation  since many dividend paying companies  especially blue chip stocks  generally increase their dividends over time 
Thinking about dividend focused mutual funds or ETFs  Watch out for fees 
If you re interested in investing in dividends  but are thinking about mutual funds or ETFs rather than stocks  beware of fees  Mutual funds and specialized ETFs may carry high fees  which could lower the overall gains you earn from dividends  undercutting your dividend income strategy  Be sure to look for funds with low fees if you decide on this approach 
Bottom Line
Whether you select high quality  low fee funds or stocks  seeking the steady income of dividend paying equities can potentially offer you a path to a better and more stress free retirement 
Generating income is just one aspect of planning for a comfortable retirement

list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  NetEase  Inc    NASDAQ NTES    New Oriental Education   Technology Group Inc    NYSE EDU   and JinkoSolar Holding Co   Ltd    NYSE JKS   Here are highlights from Wednesday s Analyst Blog  3 Chinese ADRs to Gain from a Likely Trade DealA trade agreement between the United States and China is still uncertain despite encouraging comments from officials of both nations  However  the recent enthusiasm of the two nations in reaching a deal made investors somewhat optimistic lately There has been a decent progress on the trade deal front in the past few weeks  Particularly  comments by President Donald Trump and economic advisor Larry Kudlow earlier this week hinted at a potential trade deal Let us  thus  take a look at some U S  listed Chinese stocks that will benefit the most if the a deal materializes Rising Optimism on U S  China Trade RelationshipThe U S  China trade war has rattled the financial markets for 19 months  as industries reliant on trade suffered because of the high tariffs that the two countries imposed on each other s imports  However  there has been some relief since October 2019 after the two countries agreed on a phase one deal Two major developments emerged out of the October trade talks  First  Trump decided not to proceed with an escalation in tariffs on about  250 billion worth of Chinese goods from the incumbent 25  to 30  beginning Oct 15  Second  a 15  tariff imposition on about  156 billion of Chinese products  known as List 4B  from Dec 15 was also kept on hold While speaking at the Economic Club of New York on Nov 12  Trump blamed previous U S  leaders who negotiated trade deals with China with scope for manipulation  However  the president repeated that a  significant phase one trade deal  with the China could be reached Addressing the issue of cancelling punitive tariffs  Trump said   China would like to get somewhat of a rollback  not a complete rollback  because they know I won t do it Frankly  they want to make a deal a lot more than I do    Trump s comments aptly point toward the trade war s adverse effect on China  China s factory activity shrank for the sixth straight month in October  as the Purchasing Managers  Index for manufacturing came in at 49 3  A reading below 50 indicates contraction Later on the same day  Kudlow said in an interview that there is a possibility of tariffs to be adjusted  but there would be no adjustment until a final deal is reached  Kudlow s comments were in response to China s demand for the existing tariffs to be removed as part of the phase one trade deal He said that the two countries had made progress on issues such as intellectual property theft  financial services  currency stability  commodities and agriculture  Kudlow added that there could be some issues as part of a second phase agreement with China Also  the agreement  which was anticipated to be signed at the APEC Summit in November  has been deferred to December Our ChoicesWe have  therefore  shortlisted three U S  listed Chinese stocks that have outperformed the Zacks S P 500 composite so far this year and are well positioned to do even better if a final deal between the two

111972,333487,NTES,3 Chinese ADRs To Gain From A Likely Trade Deal ,opinion,A trade agreement between the United States and China is still uncertain despite encouraging comments from officials of both nations  However  the recent enthusiasm of the two nations in reaching a deal made investors somewhat optimistic lately There has been a decent progress on the trade deal front in the past few weeks  Particularly  comments by President Donald Trump and economic advisor Larry Kudlow earlier this week hinted at a potential trade deal Let us  thus  take a look at some U S  listed Chinese stocks that will benefit the most if the a deal materializes Rising Optimism on U S  China Trade RelationshipThe U S  China trade war has rattled the financial markets for 19 months  as industries reliant on trade suffered because of the high tariffs that the two countries imposed on each other s imports  However  there has been some relief since October 2019 after the two countries agreed on a phase one deal Two major developments emerged out of the October trade talks  First  Trump decided not to proceed with an escalation in tariffs on about  250 billion worth of Chinese goods from the incumbent 25  to 30  beginning Oct 15  Second  a 15  tariff imposition on about  156 billion of Chinese products  known as List 4B  from Dec 15 was also kept on hold While speaking at the Economic Club of New York on Nov 12  Trump blamed previous U S  leaders who negotiated trade deals with China with scope for manipulation  However  the president repeated that a  significant phase one trade deal  with the China could be reached Addressing the issue of cancelling punitive tariffs  Trump said   China would like to get somewhat of a rollback  not a complete rollback  because they know I won t do it Frankly  they want to make a deal a lot more than I do    Trump s comments aptly point toward the trade war s adverse effect on China  China s factory activity shrank for the sixth straight month in October  as the Purchasing Managers  Index for manufacturing came in at 49 3  A reading below 50 indicates contraction Later on the same day  Kudlow said in an interview that there is a possibility of tariffs to be adjusted  but there would be no adjustment until a final deal is reached  Kudlow s comments were in response to China s demand for the existing tariffs to be removed as part of the phase one trade deal He said that the two countries had made progress on issues such as intellectual property theft  financial services  currency stability  commodities and agriculture  Kudlow added that there could be some issues as part of a second phase agreement with China Also  the agreement  which was anticipated to be signed at the APEC Summit in November  has been deferred to December Our ChoicesWe have  therefore  shortlisted three U S  listed Chinese stocks that have outperformed the Zacks S P 500 composite so far this year and are well positioned to do even better if a final deal between the two countries is reached  After all  business growth of these companies will accelerate if the trade barriers are removed These three stocks carry a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy

111990,333505,NTES,Here s Why Momentum Investors Will Love NetEase  NTES ,opinion,"Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock s recent trend in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will be essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   With this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving that way  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  this can be very tough to define  There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance  The Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at NetEase  NASDAQ NTES   which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A  We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score  like price change and earnings estimate revisions 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  NetEase currently has a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
In order to see if NTES is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this internet technology company holds up 
A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short term price activity  as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For NTES  shares are up 6 41  over the past week while the Zacks Internet   Software and Services industry is down 0 71  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 3 49  compares favorably with the industry s 0 45  performance as well 
Considering longer term price metrics  like performance over the last three months or year  can be advantageous as well  Over the past quarter  shares of NetEase have risen 25 76   and are up 41 8  in the last year  On the other hand  the S P 500 has only moved 0 14  and 15 51   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to NTES s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  NTES is currently averaging 814 082 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things  including estimate revisions and a stock s price movement  Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank  and a nice path here can be promising  We have recently been noticing this with NTES 
Over the past two months  4 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost NTES s consensus estimate  increasing from  10 85 to  11 12 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  4 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Given these factors  it shouldn t be surprising that NTES is a  1  Strong Buy  stock and boasts a Momentum Score of A  If you re looking for a fresh pick that s set to soar in the near term  make sure to keep NetEase on your short list ",2019-10-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/heres-why-momentum-investors-will-love-netease-ntes-200478335,200478335

company s guided range of  540 million to  580 million  Notably  the figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  560 million and decreased 12  year over year  However  the figure increased 3  from the previous quarter This can be attributed to sluggish demand environment  which impacted the company s end market performance  especially in the industrial  consumer and  communications and data center markets Following the release of fiscal fourth quarter results  the stock has plunged 7 7   This can be attributed to weak outlook for fiscal first quarter 2020 revenues and earnings owing to uncertainties in demand environment Coming to price performance  shares of Maxim have gained 17 7  on a year to date basis  underperforming the  s rally of 34  End Market in DetailIndustrial  The

market yielded 25  of the company s revenues during the fiscal fourth quarter  Further  revenues were up 2  on a year over year basis  This can primarily be attributed to accelerating revenues from driver assistance content  Strong adoption rate of Maxim s battery management system products for electric vehicles also contributed to the results However  slowdown in the global auto production impacted the company s infotainment and auto body electronics businesses during the reported quarter Consumer  Maxim generated 25  of revenues from this market  Revenues in this market went down 7  year over year  owing to sluggishness in the smartphone market  This impact was partially mitigated by improved performance of the company s wearables and peripheral businesses Communications and Data Center  Revenues from this market accounted for 17  of the total revenues  declining 23  from the year ago quarter  This was on account of weak performance of building block products during the reported quarter  Further  sluggish demand for Maxim s 100G laser driver products affected the segment s revenues Computing  This market accounted for 4  of the total revenues during the quarter under

headwind for consumer market  Revenues from Samsung  KS 005930  are anticipated to be down 50  year over year owing to lower content and unit shipments  However  Maxim remains optimistic about its

    Deal RationaleThis transaction will represent further consolidation in China s e commerce sector NetEase Kaola  which is considered to be the biggest Chinese shopping site  has always been an archrival of Alibaba s Tmall Global  According to iiMedia Research Group s research report  NetEase Kaola held a 27 5  market share in cross border e commerce in 2018  while Tmall Global accounted for 25  Therefore  the said acquisition will definitely reduce competition for Alibaba  making it the biggest shopping site in China Notably  the online retail market of China is witnessing a boom on account of increasing penetration of internet and mobile use  Per a report from Forrester  the country s online retail market is anticipated to reach  1 8 trillion by 2022  Further  sales in this market are expected to witness a CAGR of 8 5  between 2018 and 2022 Further  an eMarketer s report shows that China is anticipated to contribute 56  to global online retail sales in 2019  Moreover  China s contribution is expected to cross 63  by 2022 Therefore  we believe  with the latest acquisition  Alibaba will be able to drive the top line and profit generation in the future In the recently reported quarter  its core commerce segment   which comprises marketplaces operating in retail and wholesale commerce in China  and international commerce   performed well  The segment s revenues in the quarter totaled RMB99 5 billion  US 14 5 billion   reflecting an increase of 44  on a year over year basis Bottom LineThe e commerce sector continues to grow  driven by rapid proliferation of smartphones and internet on a global basis  Notably  these two factors are strengthening online retail shopping  in turn bolstering the adoption rate of online payment solutions and driving e commerce growth Additionally  emerging markets like China  India and most importantly Latin American economies are witnessing rapid adoption of e commerce technology Markedly  Alibaba is now the principal e commerce retailer in China on a scale with Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN    dominating 58  of the total e commerce market in the country  according to eMarketer Alibaba s annual active consumers on retail marketplaces reached 674 million  which marked a 20 million increase from the 12 month period ended in the March quarter  Also  mobile MAUs on China retail marketplaces reached 755 million in June 2019  reflecting a 34 million increase from March 2019 However  Amazon has been trying hard to expand exposure in China s online retail space with different strategic moves  Expanding seller base  distribution strength  strategic acquisitions and partnerships are helping it expand e commerce share in China This February  it was reported that Amazon had plans to merge the China business with Kaola  If this deal materializes  Amazon would definitely strengthen its market position in China Nevertheless  Alibaba s e commerce business has significant growth opportunities  driven by robust product portfolio  strengthening IoT capabilities and key offerings  Given the growing position of the business in China and aggressive international expansion strategies  we believe that e commerce will be one of its major growth drivers in the long run Zacks Rank   Stocks to ConsiderCurrently  Alibaba carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Some better ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Stamps com Inc    NASDAQ STMP   and eBay Inc    NASDAQ EBAY    each carrying a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  Long term earnings growth for Stamps com and eBay is currently projected at 15  and 9 4   respectively The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of All    Last year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce   the world s first trillionaires    but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early ",2019-08-18,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/alibaba-to-expand-ecommerce-presence-with-kaola-acquisition-200456333,200456333
112026,333541,NTES,NTES Or VG  Which Is The Better Value Stock Right Now ,opinion,"Investors interested in stocks from the Internet   Software and Services sector have probably already heard of NetEase  NASDAQ NTES  and Vonage Holdings  VG   But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now  Let s take a closer look 
Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities  but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank  The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions  while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits

Value investors analyze a variety of traditional  tried and true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels

112027,333542,NTES,Surging Earnings Estimates Signal Upside For NetEase  NTES  Stock,opinion,"NetEase  NASDAQ NTES  appears an attractive pick given a noticeable improvement in the company s earnings outlook  The stock has been a strong performer lately  and the momentum might continue with analysts still raising their earnings estimates for the company 
Analysts  growing optimism on the earnings prospects of this internet technology company is driving estimates higher  which should get reflected in its stock price  After all  empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements  This insight is at the core of our stock rating tool    the Zacks Rank 
The five grade Zacks Rank system  which ranges from a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record of outperformance  with Zacks  1 Ranked stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 2008

Current Quarter Estimate Revisions

Over the last 30 days  two estimates have moved higher for NetEase compared to no negative revisions  As a result  the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased 15 84

112028,333543,NTES,Alibaba Buys NetEase Unit For  2 Billion,opinion,"Alibaba s   NYSE BABA   relationship with NetEase   NASDAQ NTES   continues to strengthen as the two companies are now in a mutually beneficial deal  That deal will see Alibaba taking over Netease s online luxury retail platform  Kaola for  2 billion in cash 
Alibaba and founder Jack Ma s Yunfeng will infuse an additional  700 million into NetEase Cloud Music s latest funding round for a minority stake in the company 
Under Alibaba  Kaola will operate independently  but its CEO Zhang Lei will be replaced by Tmall Import and Export general manager Alvin Liu 
The deal has been rumored for months but was apparently delayed because of a disagreement of terms 
Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   China was also apparently in the running 
Good for Netease
With the Chinese government easing restrictions on the sector  constituent companies can now apply for approval of online games and also charge users for newly launched titles  Since this is NetEase s core business  this is where it needs to focus  Disposing off non core assets will make this possible 
Moreover  Kaola was a fast growing business that needed significant and continued investment  It wasn t making any operating profit  So disposing of the business allows NetEase to cut losses 
Third  the cash generated will allow the company to strengthen its portfolio of games and help it compete better with rival and market leader Tencent in the gaming segment 
The music business  which raised  600 million in November when Baidu   NASDAQ BIDU    General Atlantic and Boyu Capital became stakeholders  is getting another cash infusion  despite the fact that Alibaba owns a competing platform in Xiami  This should help it compete with market leader Tencent Music Entertainment Group  TME   Government pressure recently forced the two companies to relicense more than 99  of their music catalogs  TME is currently under antitrust investigation over its music licensing agreements 
Good for Alibaba
The country s largest online retail platform is making a larger push into cross border trade  which has always been a focus area for management  This market is expected to grow very rapidly to touch 12 7 trillion yuan  or close to  1 8 trillion by 2020  The acquisition takes Alibaba s 25  share of this market and pushes it up to 52 7   according to iiMedia Research  Research firm Analysys estimates the combined share at closer to 60   Whatever be the case  it is a leading market share and helps it compete with emerging rivals like Tencent backed Pinduoduo 
Second  it strengthens Alibaba s position in luxury retail  which according to Jane Hali   Associates  is a huge market in China  The research firm estimates that Chinese consumers make up more than 45  of global luxury sales  and were responsible for the 4 6  growth in sales this year  particularly in things like high end accessories  apparel and beauty 
Third  Kaola has a larger presence in smaller cities  which allows Alibaba to expand geographically and tap the next growth phase  which will have to include these cities 
Alibaba hasn t had the best of relationships with some of the top brands and these companies have complained regularly about counterfeits on its platform  To a certain extent  it s hard to track exactly when this happens  but brands have held that Alibaba hasn t been as vigilant as it could be  The fact that Kaola has direct working relationships with 9 000 brands from 80 countries including Gucci  Shisheido and Burberry  could improve its own relationships 
There could also be things to learn here  Tmall and Kaola don t operate in exactly the same way  i e   Tmall allows brands to manage their own stores on the platform  while Kaola has direct selling relationships with them 
Alibaba has the significant resources to continue investing in Kaola the way that it s required and the way that it was probably harder for NetEase to do  
Conclusion
Both are Chinese companies and could therefore have been caught in the crosshairs of the trade war  But this is unlikely to happen  as they largely take foreign brands to China and therefore help leading brands to sell in the country 
Alibaba in particular has traditionally been on very good terms with the Chinese government  so the government generally protects its interests  That s why both Alibaba with its Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  and NetEase with its  2 Rank  Buy  are worth your money today  You can also check out the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank stocks here

112071,333586,NTES,In Pursuit Of An Earnings Beat  Play These Top 5 Stocks,opinion,"Investors specifically look for stocks that have the ability to beat market expectations before an earnings season  This is because investors always try to place themselves ahead of time and look to bet on stocks that are high quality in nature 
Why Is a Positive Earnings Surprise So Important 
Historically  stocks of companies with solid quarterly earnings  on a nominal basis  fall if they miss or merely meet market expectations  After all  a 20  earnings rise  though apparently looks good  doesn t tell you if earnings growth has been exhibiting a decelerating trend 
Also  seasonal fluctuations come into play at times  If a company s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 strong  it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline  In such cases  growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company 
On the other hand  after much brainstorming and analysis of companies  financials and initiatives  Wall Street analysts project earnings of companies  They in fact club their insights and a company s guidance when arriving at an earnings estimate 
Thus  outperforming that estimate is almost equivalent to beating the company s own as well as market s expectations  And if the margin of earnings surprise is big  it typically drives the stock right after the release  Thus  more than anything else  an earnings surprise can push a stock higher 
How to Find Stocks That Can Beat 
Now  finding stocks that have the potential to beat on the bottom line is not an easy job  One way to do this is to look at the earnings surprise history of the company 
An impressive track in this regard generally acts as a catalyst  sending the stock higher  It indicates the company s ability to surpass estimates  And investors usually believe that the company will apply the same secret formula to beat earning in its next release as well 
The Winning Strategy
In order to shortlist stocks that are likely to come up with an earnings surprise  we chose the following as our primary screening parameters 
Last EPS Surprise greater than or equal to 10   Stocks delivering positive surprise in the last quarter tend to surprise again 
Average EPS Surprise in the last four quarters greater than 20   We lifted the bar for outperformance slightly higher by setting the average earnings surprise for the last four quarters at 20  
Average EPS Surprise in the last two quarters greater than 20   This points to a more consistent surprise history and makes the case for another surprise even stronger 
In addition  we place a few other criteria that push up the chance of a positive surprise 
Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Only companies with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  rating can get through 
 greater than zero  A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of  1  2 or 3 for an earnings beat to happen  as per our proven model 
In order to zero in on those that have long term growth potential and high trading liquidity we have added the following parameters too 
Next 3 5 Years Estimated EPS Growth  Per Year  greater than 10   Solid expected earnings growth exhibits the stock s long term growth prospects 
Average 20 day Volume greater than 100 000  High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity 
A few other criteria have narrowed down the universe from over 7 700 stocks to eight 
Here are five out of the eight stocks 
Willscot Corporation   NASDAQ WSC    This specialty rental services company provides modular space and portable storage solutions primarily in North America  The stock carries a Zacks Rank  2  You can see  
Square Inc    NYSE SQ    The company offers financial and marketing services  The stock belongs to a top ranked Zacks industry  top 33   and carries a Zacks Rank  2

This Week  Is It Time To Be Contrarian 
So far  volatility has ticked up this week  and the stocks that had been performing best all year  e g  momentum  technology  growth  FANG  are underperforming this week  thereby leaving some investors wondering if it s time to get contrarian 


Considering momentum and FANG type stocks have been performing so well since last November s election  and considering a new pundit comes out every day claiming the market is overvalued  and considering we ve entered the final month of the year where talk of profit taking and rebalancing is increasingly discussed  and considering some value stocks are arguably getting to  too cheap   many investors are wondering  Is it finally time to be contrarian 
Regarding contrarian ideas  Eric Parnell offers some interesting perspective in this article    Eric explains  the upside investment opportunity that I see for the coming year is not trading against Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   but instead taking the opposite side of the Amazon trade   As an opportunistic value investor  Eric focuses some of his time and attention on areas of market inefficiencies created by the Amazon narrative 
Our Trading Models 
Our trading models  highlighted in the table below  use a combination of momentum  non contrarian  and  dip buying   contrarian  strategies  and unlike long term investing  our models have the luxury of using  risk controls  to exit trades that are moving against us  instead of buying something  cheap  and then watching it get much cheaper over the following months and years as many  value trapped  long term investors often struggle to avoid 

Aside from the risk controls  e g  stops and macro factors  that help us avoid long term value traps  our models also have the luxury of using complementary momentum and  dip buying  strategies thereby minimizing the risks of being trapped in one style when the other is out performing for an extended period of time  i e  growth and momentum have been beating the pants off value and dividend investments so far this year  as shown in the following table  

Trading Model Performance 
Per reader feedback  we ve recently started including a table summarizing the performance results for our trading models  The table  below  shows actual client results after commissions and fees  I watch this every day  and now readers can see it as well   We ll share additional information  including test data  with those interested in investing  For our weekly updates  we use only real time results 

And not surprisingly  our momentum models  e g  Felix and Athena  have been doing very well in recent months  while our contrarian  dip buying  strategies  i e  Holmes  and somewhat Road Runner  have been somewhat lagging  However  very importantly  our  Blended  approach has been performing well  outperforming the market as measured by the S P 500  via SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   
For reference  the results in the table above include all of the positions  10 for Road Runner and Athena  16 for Holmes  and 20 for Felix   not just the specific stock examples we discuss in the Stock Exchange every week  and sorry Oscar  you have too many individual stocks and trades to be part of this approach   We ve included six months of data since that is the shortest real time record we have  All of the models are expected to perform well over longer time periods  Holmes  for example  has returned over 20  in the last eighteen months 
Also very importantly  our models  especially our  Blended  approach  tend to have a low correlation with the overall stock market  which can be extremely valuable for diversification and risk management purposes  especially if you suspect the great momentum rally we ve been experiencing might soon come to an end  but if you re still not sure about going completely  contrarian  
Interestingly  Dr  Steenbarger offers some very interesting perspective on the concept of co trading in   which he describes as  among other things 

 Co trading features true collaboration  That means the sharing of ideas and resources  as well as coordinated work on personal and professional development   The members of co trading teams  however  are independent traders  

In some sense  our Stock Exchange  characters   e g  Felix  Holmes  Road Runner  et al  are co trading  as a team  on a weekly basis  However  more aptly  we hope this weekly Stock Exchange series is helpful to your development as an independent trader 
Expert Picks From The Models 
This week s Stock Exchange is being edited by  aka Mark Hines   Blue Harbinger is a source for independent investment ideas 
Road Runner  This week I like NetEase Inc  NASDAQ NTES   Are you familiar with this company 
Blue Harbinger  NetEase is a Chinese technology company  and it trades as an ADR on the NASDAQ  NetEase provides online media  games  and e commerce  Why do you like this stock  Road Runner 
RR  As you know  I like to buy stocks that are at the bottom of a rising channel  And based on the following chart  you can see why I like NetEase 

BH  Interesting pick  My first reaction is one of skepticism because this stock is still up more than 50  this year  even after the sell off shown in your chart   and it s up about 650  in the last 5 years  Considering many investors are afraid the momentum growth trade is about to slow  aren t you at all afraid that you are  chasing returns  
Road Runner  I am a trading model  not a person  so no I am not afraid  I have been designed specifically to avoid the type of emotional trading you are describing 
BH  Aside from my initial skepticism  I do see that this company s revenue is growing dramatically in recent years  and it is profitable  Here is a look at the FastGraph 

RR  That information is interesting  but my typical holding period is about 4 weeks  I ll be in and out of this stock before the company s fundamental story plays out 
BH  Suit yourself Road Runner  Your strategy has been working  Personally  I d rather do a lot more research before investing in a stock like this  but that s why I am an investor and you are a trader  How about you  Holmes what have you got this week 
Holmes  I have no picks this week  And when I don t see anything  I don t force anything  How about you  Athena what do you like this week 
Athena  I bought Envision Healthcare on Monday 11 27 
BH  Envision offers healthcare plans to companies  Why do you like it  Athena 
Athena  As you know  I am a momentum trader  and my typical holding period is about 1 month  Based on the following chart  Envision has a lot of upside price potential 

BH  Honestly  I don t know enough about this company to have a strong opinion  I don t know if I m impressed or disturbed that you and the other models can pick stocks so quickly  and then own them for only a few weeks at a time  Here is some fundamental data  in the following FastGraph  for you to consider  Athena 

Athena  Thanks for that information  but I m a trader  not an investor  and Envision looks attractive right now 
BH  Well  at the very least I can say I am impressed with your performance in recent months  as shown in the earlier performance table  How about you  Felix what have you got this week 
Felix  This week I am sharing my ranking of the top stocks in the Russell 1000  My top 20 are included in the following table  And as you know  I am a momentum trader  but I typically hold my positions for about 66 weeks which is much longer than the other models  I exit when my price target is hit  and I use stops and macro considerations to control risks 

BH  Thanks for sharing that info  Felix  I noticed you ve ranked Square  NYSE SQ  in your top 20  That stock has been on fire this year  and it s been extremely volatile this week  I actually placed an options trade on Square earlier this week 
Felix  What was your thesis for that trade  Blue Harbinger  We re not on opposite sides of this trade  are we 
BH  Well  first of all  if you don t know  Square helps small businesses accept electronic payments through easy to use  low cost hardware and software  i e  they have a mobile phone credit card reader   The company s revenues have been growing like wildfire  and they have a more room to run based on the size of the total addressable market  And to make things more interesting  and volatile   Square recently shared news that it was going to be facilitating Bitcoin payments  We wrote all about Bitcoin in  about a month ago 
Felix  Thanks for that background  but why d you place the trade 
BH  I m not giving away all the details on   but it was to generate income  the premium income available for selling puts was very high   We re both bullish  to differing extents  on Square  but our timeline and objectives are different  My position expires in a couple weeks  you typically hold for around 66 weeks 
Felix  Interesting  Thanks  How about you  Oscar what have you got this week 
Oscar  This week I m sharing my top ranked ETFs among  high volume  ETFs  The following table includes my top 20 

BH  The US Oil Fund ETF  United States Oil  NYSE USO   stands out to me because we were discussing the oil market dynamics in last week s Stock Exchange  It makes some sense to me that you d rank it highly  You are into momentum trades  correct Oscar 
Oscar  Correct  And I typically hold for about 6 weeks at a time before I rotate into a new sector  Also  I use stops to manage risks  so if the momentum trade stops working  I ll be out of my position long before most long term investors 
Conclusion 
Many trading strategies work great  until they don t  This is why we prefer to use a blended approach in combining several of our trading models to minimize the impacts of a shift in market leadership  For example  momentum has been leading the market higher this year  as shown in our earlier charts   but based on market performance so far this week  some investors fear the momentum trade may finally be slowing down  and it could be time to take a more contrarian approach  Our blended approach has a lower correlation with the market  yet continues to deliver strong returns  We ll be sticking to our strategy  constantly gathering more data  and watching closely as the year comes to an end  to see if so too does the powerful growth momentum trade finally slow 
Background On The Stock Exchange 
Each week  Felix and Oscar host a poker game for some of their friends  Since they are all traders  they love to discuss their best current ideas before the game starts  They like to call this their  Stock Exchange    Check out  for more background   Their methods are excellent  as you know if you have been following the series  Since the time frames and risk profiles differ  so do the stock ideas  You get to be a fly on the wall from my report  I am usually the only human present and the only one using any fundamental analysis 
The result  Several expert ideas each week from traders  and a brief comment on the fundamentals from the human investor  The models are named to make it easy to remember their trading personalities

112108,333623,NTES,Is Alibaba  BABA  The Cheapest Chinese Internet Stock Right Now ,opinion,"In the world of Chinese ADRs  no company attracts more investor attention than Alibaba   NYSE BABA    The e commerce behemoth is not only one of the largest publicly traded tech companies in the world  but also a popular method for gauging the health of China s economy and investing in the growth of its consumer marketplace 
Alibaba is clearly a dominant force in the global retail sector  as well as an interesting growth play in industries like financial services  smart vehicles  artificial intelligence  and digital media  And considering the company s expansion opportunities and rising popularity among investors  it makes sense that BABA has been among the hottest stocks in the world over the past year  having gained about 80  over this timeframe 
Alibaba has worked to prove that it deserves this type of momentum by delivering solid earnings and revenue results  This trend is expected to continue  with our latest consensus estimates calling for the company to see EPS growth of 49  and net sales growth of 65  in the current fiscal year 
Nevertheless  Alibaba still feels like a speculative stock  BABA is currently trading with a Forward P E ratio of 28 8  coming in well above the broader market average and slightly higher than the 24 8 average of its wholesale retail peers 
But considering how unique Alibaba is  this might not paint a complete picture  After all  investors interested in this stock are likely placing a certain premium on the continued potential of the Chinese internet and consumer markets  which are still growing at rates not seen in many comparable economies 
With that said  a quick glance at Alibaba s historical Forward P E reveals a much more interesting story about the stock s valuation 
This  peer group  includes four other major Chinese internet stocks  JD com   NASDAQ JD    Baidu   NASDAQ BIDU    Tencent   OTC TCEHY    and NetEase   NASDAQ NTES    None of these companies are structured exactly like Alibaba  but they all compete in various markets and help show how investors value China s internet industry in a more general sense 
There are few key trends to notice here  First of all  BABA is currently trading with its lowest in valuation in terms of forward earnings in over a year  While the stock might still be  expensive  compared to the broader market  investors have likely never been able to purchase it at this cheap of a level 
The second thing we notice is that Alibaba has traditionally traded at a premium compared to its Chinese internet peers  However  over the past month or so  the average Forward P E of this group has risen while BABA s has slumped and now for the first time in at least a year  Alibaba is trading at a discount to the rest of this group 
However  Alibaba is actually not the cheapest stock in this set  In fact  BIDU s current P E is slightly lower  and NTES is trading at a significant discount  Here s how Alibaba s valuation compares to that of online gaming giant NetEase 
As we can see  BABA has traditionally traded at a premium to NTES  and although that gap has narrowed slightly over the past few months  the difference in valuation is certainly still noticeable 
Of course  Alibaba bulls will be quick to point out the reasons for this premium  For one  the company gives investors more diversified exposure to the Chinese economy than NetEase  which is focused on specific markets like gaming and digital content  It is also possible that Alibaba has more exciting growth potential because of its investments in new revenue sources 
BABA is currently sporting a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   as well as an  A  grade for Growth in our Style Scores system  The company is clearly set to see massive earnings and revenue growth this year  but recent analyst activity has been mixed  Within the past 60 days  we have seen five positive revisions and four negative revisions to Alibaba s full year earnings estimates 
Alibaba will likely maintain its lightning fast expansion for the next few years at the very least  but mixed analyst sentiment can cause short term headwinds for the stock  Still  the company looks like a solid option for long term investments in China

112109,333624,NTES,These Chinese Internet Stocks Are  Cheaper  Than Alibaba  BABA ,opinion,"Chinese ADRs are extremely popular investment options for U S  investors  with no company attracting more attention than Alibaba   NYSE BABA    The e commerce behemoth is  of course  one of the largest publicly traded tech companies in the word  but the popularity of the stock also comes from its use as method to gauge the health of China s economy and invest in its consumer marketplace 
Alibaba is a dominant force in global retail and an exciting growth pick in industries like financial services  smart vehicles  artificial intelligence  and digital media  Considering the company s expansion opportunities and rising popularity among investors  it makes sense that the stock has soared a remarkable 57  over the past year making it one of Wall Street s hottest options 
But this strong momentum has also stretched Alibaba s valuation  adding some of the risk that typically comes alongside high growth investing  The stock is trading with a Forward P E of about 25  which is a noticeable premium to the broader market average  What s worse  BABA s P S of 12 8 and P B of 6 6 are in runaway territory 
To traditional value investors  these ratios make BABA look like an expensive stock one that the market is overvaluing compared to the company s actual earnings  revenue  and book value 
In contrast  these investors consider  cheap  stocks to be those that offer better bang for their buck in terms of these financial metrics  After all  buying a stock makes one a partial owner of that company  so investors are inherently interested in these measureable fundamentals 
There are plenty of investors willing to pay a premium for the unique exposure that Alibaba offers  but there are a few traditionally  cheaper  options that compete with the company in certain markets  Here s a closer look at two of those stocks 
Baidu  Inc     NASDAQ BIDU   
Baidu is also of China s largest internet companies  owning a more than 75  share of the country s search engine market  Here s a look at its forward 12 month earnings multiple versus that of Alibaba over the past year 
BIDU and BABA have traded with a similar earnings multiple for the better part of a year  but we can see that Baidu is offering a slight discount compared to Alibaba right now  Alibaba bulls would argue that the company deserves its premium  but Baidu is working to break into new growth markets as well 
For instance  Baidu is reportedly in the process of recruiting investors for its wholly owned finance unit  Baidu Financial Services Group  This unit operates Baidu Wallet  a digital wealth management platform and online credit service  An expansion of this unit would be a direct blow to Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial  which operates the Alipay mobile payments service and offers wealth management and insurance products 
Alipay is frequently cited as one of Alibaba s key growth opportunities  so the fact that investors can get exposure to a comparable catalyst at a lower valuation might pique the interest of those concerned about maximizing value 
NetEase  Inc     NASDAQ NTES   
NetEase is smaller company with a tighter focus on gaming and digital content  and as we can see  the stock has consistently traded at a significant discount to Alibaba recently 
Alibaba clearly presents a more diversified exposure to the Chinese economy than NetEase  but there is likely another reason that investors would be willing to pay more BABA right now  analyst sentiment 
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NetEase s full year EPS estimates has shed  2 32 within the past 90 days  with 100  agreement to the downside among revising analysts  Overall  analysts now expect the company to witness EPS growth of just 1 2  this year  This negative revision activity has earned NTES a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  
Bottom Line
Each individual investor has their preferred strategies for valuing stocks  and the Chinese internet space is one that sees a number of these theories take precedent  Alibaba s valuation might be stretched right now  but those that believe in the company s growth initiatives will say that premium is justified  Either way  investors should note that there is more to the story than the P E ratio

112145,333660,NTES,NetEase  Capitalize On China s Fast Growing Games Market,opinion,"Summary

NetEase  NASDAQ NTES  is one of China s largest diversified online gaming companies with strong fundamentals  but has recently suffered a correction due to missing Wall Street s lofty second quarter earnings expectations 
Given that the Chinese gaming market continues to exhibit strong growth prospects going forward  NetEase would likely continue to be a major beneficiary of this trend 
After its  15  correction  valuations have become attractive at 20x FY2016 P E  especially when compared to its direct competitor Tencent  We think this provides a good entry point to gain exposure to the rapidly growing Chinese gaming market 

Q2 missed expectations  but fundamentals remain intact
NetEase  NTES  is one of China s top online gaming companies  with a focus on producing massively online role playing games  MMORPG   Its game titles include  Overwatch  and  Diablo III  which are collaborations with Blizzard  NASDAQ ATVI   and original titles such as  Fantasy Westward Journey II  and the new  Onmyoji  
The company did recently report weaker than expected Q2FY2017earnings  with earnings per share coming in at RMB 22 41 lower than consensus estimates of RMB 25 65  according to Reuters  As a result  shares were punished  falling approximately 15  since its earnings release on 9th August 
However  investors should remember that although the bottom line missed expectations  it was still 8 7  higher than the same figure last year  And revenues came in at RMB 13 4 billion  which did not miss estimates of RMB 12 8 billion  and was 49 4  higher than the same period last year 

The main reason why earnings did not grow as fast as expected was due to NetEase s promotional spending on their e commerce business  Yanxuan   which grew volumes at the expense of e commerce margins  compressed from 34  to 11    However  we think that such initial promotional spending to drive up volumes is justifiable  as the company pushes hard to capture market share in the fast growing e commerce space in China 
Regardless  the company s financial health and cash generative abilities remain solid  generating a 31 5  return on invested capital  6 2  free cash flow yield and holding a net cash position as of FY2016 
Beneficiary of Chinese games market expansion
In terms of future growth  the main driver for NetEase would have to be the general expansion of the Chinese mobile games market  According to Newzoo s report  China s overall games market has grown steadily from  13 8 billion in 2013 to  27 5 billion in 2017  and would likely continue its upward trajectory towards  33 7 billion in 2020   giving a compounded annual growth rate of 13 6   2013 2020   And considering thatNetEase  together with Tencent  OTC TCEHY   holds dominant positions within the mobile games segment   80  market share combined   sales at NetEase should see continued growth as China s rapidly urbanized population turns to online games for entertainment 

Attractive valuations after correction

After its  15  correction from early August  valuations have corrected to attractive levels  Consensus estimates now project NetEase s FY2017 earnings per share to be at RMB 107 12  which gives the company an earnings growth rate of 21 9   in constant currency terms   Based on such growth prospects  current valuations of 20x FY2016 P E isn t demanding  especially when compared to Tencent s current valuation of 67 5x FY2016 P E

112178,333693,NTES,The Week Ahead  Is The Bond Market Sending Stocks A Message ,opinion,"After the news heavy calendar last week  there are few market moving economic reports in the week ahead  It is also the quiet period for the Fed  How will the punditry fill those empty minutes 
Last week s trading revived a question that many find puzzling  I expect pundits to be asking 
How can bonds and stocks both be so strong 
Last Week
Last week the economic news was mixed  but the market showed strength anyway 
Theme Recap
In my last WTWA I took note of the big economic calendar and short week  My conclusion was that we might finally see some volatility  Wrong  The news was close enough to expectations that the reactions were modest  Since there was little volatility  it never became the theme for the week 
The Story in One Chart
I always start my personal review of the week by looking at this great chart of the S P 500  via Jill Mislinski  The gain for the week  achieved entirely on Thursday and Friday  was almost 1  and another new all time high 

Doug has a special knack for pulling together all the relevant information  His charts save more than a thousand words  Read the entire post for several more charts providing long term perspective  including the size and frequency of drawdowns 
Personal Note
I am considering some changes in WTWA  Instead of launching  new Coke  without proper testing  I would like reader suggestions  I have outlined the ideas   and I welcome comments and suggestions 
The News
Each week I break down events into good and bad  Often there is an  ugly  and on rare occasion something very positive  My working definition of  good  has two components  The news must be market friendly and better than expectations  I avoid using my personal preferences in evaluating news   and you should  too 
The economic news last week was mixed  but the market reaction was positive  
The Good
Personal income and spending both increased 0 4   positive but in line with expectations 
Household deleveraging has been  historic   Since this news is contrary to most of what you hear  it is important to read the excellent  from BlackRock 

To be balanced  we must also note the increasing leverage of corporations  BlackRock notes that this reflects the low cost of loans versus equity  More of the lending locked in for a long period 

Any assessment of debt and leverage must include government  It is a concern  and on my writing agenda 
Consumer confidence declined slightly  but remained at a high level   117 9  Here is the analysis from the  
Consumer confidence decreased slightly in May  following a moderate decline in April   said Lynn Franco  Director of Economic Indicators at The Conference Board   However  consumers  assessment of present day conditions held steady  suggesting little change in overall economic conditions  Looking ahead  consumers were somewhat less upbeat than in April  but overall remain optimistic that the economy will continue expanding into the summer months 


ISM manufacturing beat expectations with a solid 54 9 reading  The Chicago PMI    notched its highest reading in 2   years 
ADP private employment showed a gain of 253K  Regular readers know that I regard this as an alternative source on the jobs situation  neither better nor worse than the BLS 
The Bad
Pending home sales declined for a second straight month      Once again  low inventory was blamed  Steven Hansen    has an interesting take  comparing historical household formation and replacement needs  to new supply 


He writes as follows 

Based on the data in the above graph  since the beginning of the Great Recession there were almost a half million more new homes constructed than households formed  Up until the 21st century  there was good correlation between household formation and homes constructed 


However  historically  are needed each year to replace those lost to fires  rot  other causes  or simply torn down to make way for new construction  Based on just replacements needs  3 million new houses were needed since the beginning of the Great Recession instead of the half million above household formation actually constructed  The green line in the above graph is the combined need for new housing  year over year gain of households plus the replacement housing  


The bottom line is that the NEED for new construction is outpacing the supply  It seems the price for new and existing housing is above the price many buyers are willing  or can afford  to pay  It seems that there is a shortfall also of buildable land near many metros where people want to live 

Corporate profits may have peaked    
Legislative chaos from the Trump budget   has five negatives  including a 60  chance of an October government shutdown and reduced chances for tax reform  Stan is an experienced Washington insider  so we should pay attention  I strongly agree with the need for some compromise  That said  it seems overly pessimistic to me 
Auto sales declined slightly to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 16 6 million and may have peaked  This means that companies will be competing for market share  Everyone will be watching to see if this is a peak or a plateau 
Initial jobless claims rose by 13K from an upwardly adjusted prior week  The widely followed four week moving average also increased by 2500  Some observers are poised to see any increase in this level as a sign of danger   has a key chart  which adjusts the results for the size of the labor force  It is great work  and something to keep in mind 


Construction spending dropped 1 4   the largest decline in a year    
Employment situation disappointed in both the nonfarm payroll report and the household survey  The headline net job gains of 138K significantly missed expectations  The prior two month reports were revised lower by 66K  The household survey was weak  None of my regular sources showed any enthusiasm about the employment picture   summarizes the general reaction to this report 

The headline jobs number was below expectations  and there were combined downward revisions to the previous two months  Is this slowdown in hiring a short term issue  part of the normal business cycle  or due to a Trump Slump  My view is this slowdown in hiring is mostly part of the normal business cycle  my expectation was job growth would slow further this year  
There was still some good news   especially with the unemployment rate falling to 4 3   lowest since 2001   and U 6 falling to 8 4   lowest since 2007   But overall this was a disappointing report 


The Ugly
The opioid epidemic  Ohio is suing five drug companies for contributing to that state s epidemic     Some companies cannot find enough workers who can pass drug screening    
And at the low end of those trying to make a buck out of the   addict brokers  find people whom they can induce to travel to a rehab facility  They qualify them for short term insurance  and then abandon them after it runs out     
The Silver Bullet
I occasionally give the Silver Bullet award to someone who takes up an unpopular or thankless cause  doing the real work to demonstrate the facts  This week s award goes to  of HORAN Capital Advisors for his timely refutation of the latest  scary chart   It is so easy to create these bogus parallels  If you want page views or retweets  this is the ticket  Here is the chart making the rounds 



And here is what you get if you use percentage changes  since the absolute price levels are not similar 


The Week Ahead
We would all like to know the direction of the market in advance  Good luck with that  Second best is planning what to look for and how to react  That is the purpose of considering possible themes for the week ahead  You can make your own predictions in the comments 
The Calendar
After the big reports last week  it is a light calendar 
The  A  List
ISM services  M   Continued strength expected 
JOLTS  T   Little understood report helps identify tight labor markets  A Yellen favorite 
Initial jobless claims  Th   Continues at near record levels 

The  B  List
Factory orders  M   Noisy April data  but eyes remain on recent industrial weakness 
Wholesale inventories  F   More April data  subject to varying interpretations 
Crude inventories  W   Recently showing only modest impact on oil prices  and even less on stock prices 
FedSpeak is on hold for the quiet period in front of next week s FOMC meeting  Those craving a  Fed fix  will have to rely on the pundits   most of whom claim to know more than Fed members anyway 
Next Week s Theme
In a light week for data with no FedSpeak  That won t stop punditry speculation about next week s meeting  of course  And there is the constant possibility of a market moving tweet  In this absence of this stimulus  what might be the theme for next week  There is already bemused head shaking about Friday s trading  If the employment news was weak  causing a rally in bonds  why did stocks move higher 
I expect pundits to be asking 
Is there a bond market message for stocks 

The divergence is simple 
Some believe that the bond market is  smarter   This suggests that stocks do not reflect economic weakness 
Others feel that the markets are somewhat disconnected  with many stocks reasonably valued in a low growth environment 
A few believe that bond yields reflect irrational recession fears or a distorted view of future Fed policy 

Most market participants seem to subscribe to the first of these three choices 
As usual  I ll have more in my Final Thought

Final Thoughts
Week after week we see focus on a specific issue when the underlying question is one of valuation  Let me take a slightly different approach to this question  Suppose that you anticipated ten percent inflation next year  What rate of return would you expect from your bank  from bonds  or from stocks  When inflation was that high  interest rates were even higher and stock PE s were low  In a world of low inflation  why is it surprising that people are willing to accept lower anticipated returns 
The anticipated inflation rate of market participants can be determined from the constant maturity 10 year note yield  and TIPS  Here is the result 

With this in mind  let us revisit the  mystery   Many analysts focus on inflows and outflows  risk on and risk off  Trump trade or not  This simple  simplistic   interpretation presents stocks and bonds as an alternative 
While it is true that each asset class is always part of a relative comparison  the overall valuation in any asset reflects inflation expectations  Moreover  the long term relationship between stocks and bonds is positive  Viewed in this way  we should not be surprised by Friday s trading  or by similar reactions 
Those who consider inflation expectations as part of the valuation question will have more accurate results ",2017-06-04,Jeff Miller,https://www.investing.com/analysis/weighing-the-week-ahead:-is-the-bond-market-sending-a-message-for-stocks-200193001,200193001
112179,333694,NTES,How To Invest In The  Asian Century ,opinion,"The 19th century belonged to the United Kingdom  the 20th century to the United States  Many market experts and analysts now speculate that the 21st century will be remembered as the  Asian Century   dominated by rising superpowers such as Indonesia  India and China 
It s those last two countries  India and China home to nearly 40 percent of the world s population that I want to focus on  Both emerging markets offer attractive investment opportunities  especially for growth investors who seek to derisk from American equities 
Look at how dramatically the two have expanded in the last half century 
As recently as 1970  neither country controlled a significant share of world gross domestic product  GDP   As of June of this year  however  China represents more than 15 percent of world GDP  India more than 3 percent  This has displaced Russia and Spain  itself the world s wealthiest economy in the 16th century 
And the expansion is expected to continue  Back in February  I shared with you research from PricewaterhouseCoopers  PwC   which predicts that by 2050  China and India will become the world s number one and number two largest economies based on purchasing power parity  PPP  
 PPP  if you re unfamiliar  is a theory that states that exchange rates between two nations are equal when price levels of a fixed basket of goods and services are the same  

Also note Indonesia  which is expected to replace Japan as the fourth largest economy by midcentury 
A Surge in Middle Class Spenders What should excite investors the most is the growing size of the middle class in China and India  More middle class consumers means more spending on goods and services and more investing 
Remember  China s middle class is already larger than that found here in the U S  according to Credit Suisse  In October 2015  the investment bank reported that  for the first time  the size of China s middle class had exceeded that of America s middle class  109 million to 92 million  As incomes rise  so too does demand for durables  luxury goods  vehicles  air travel  energy and more 

Living standards have risen dramatically in China  According to Dr  Ira Kalish  a specialist in global economic issues for Deloitte  hourly wages for manufacturing jobs in China are now higher than those found in Latin American countries except for Chile  They re even nearing wages found in lower income European countries such as Greece and Portugal 
Looking ahead to 2030  China is expected to have a mind boggling 1 billion people more than three times the current U S  population enjoying a middle class lifestyle filled with middle class things  from cars to designer clothes to electronics and appliances 
India  meanwhile  will have an estimated 475 million people among its middle class ranks  The South Asian country is currently the fastest growing G20 economy  with Morgan Stanley analysts estimating year over year growth to hit 7 9 percent in December  Driving this growth is a steady increase in wages and pensions  which will support consumption of goods and services 
Demographic trends in India make the country look especially favorable  As I ve shared with you before  India has a young population with an average age of 29   The average age in China  by comparison  is around 37  while Japan s is 48   By 2020  more than 64 percent of Indians will be under the age of 35  For many years to come  therefore  India will have a much larger group of working age individuals than any other country on earth 
In fact  India s total population could now be larger than China s  according to new estimates  Yi Fuxian  a researcher at the University of Wisconsin Madison  believes China s population is much smaller than official statistics  owing to years of slower population growth under the one child policy  Yi insists that about 90 million fewer people reside in China than previously thought  meaning its 2017 population could be closer to 1 29 billion people  That would narrowly make India  home to 1 31 billion people  the world s most populous country 
Investing in 40 Percent of Humanity So how can investors take advantage of this rapid growth in spending power 
One of the best ways  I believe  is with our  which invests in securities in the authorized China securities markets  Hong Kong  Shenzhen and Shanghai  as well as the surrounding countries  including India

112180,333695,NTES,Chinese Internet Stocks On Fire ,opinion,"Have you ever made money with Chinese Internet stocks  I have  but I ve lost a few times too 
Understanding what works on the web in the US  and who the winners will be  is tough enough  In China  it s a whole other eggroll 
But if you can pick one or two leaders and study their sales and earnings trends over several quarters  you can begin to understand the different players and business models and make some sound investment choicesto gain access to the largest middle class on the planet 
That s what I did with Alibaba   NYSE BABA   this year and it has turned into a big winner for my  portfolio 
I wish I had been more diligent and studied a couple of other companies as well  Like the big competitor to Baidu   NASDAQ BIDU   who has crushed them in both growth and stock appreciation in the past few years 
Or the Chinese equivalent of Twitter   Snapchat that competes with  microblogging  platform Weibo   NASDAQ WB   
I talk about all these companies in the video attached to this article  And I also explain why Weibo  which is over 45  owned by Sina  another media search social platform  rocketed 20  higher in May and is on the move again 
Why Alibaba is a Long Term Buy
And I give many details about why BABA s growth is real and sustainable  It is rightly called the  Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  of China  and will find few competitors  with its closest being the  61 billion online shopping portal JD com   NASDAQ JD   
The secret lies in something that founder and CEO Jack Ma revealed in his tour of the US last month  And his seat at the table this week for the US China Business Leaders Summit at the US Department of Commerce wasn t just a token gesture  Ma co chaired the inaugural event alongside Blackstone  NYSE BX  CEO Stephen Schwarzman 
Be sure to watch my video to learn about that secret as well as see some great analysis tools on Zacks com to compare all these companies  including the gaming platform NetEase   NASDAQ NTES   which is growing revenues 35  this year to  7 7 billion

112181,333696,NTES,2 China Tech Giants Join The  300b Club  Who s Next ,opinion,"In May 2017  Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd  NYSE BABA  and Tencent Holdings Ltd ADR  OTC TCEHY  exceeded  300 billion in market capitalization for the first time  placing these two Chinese tech companies in an elite group that  as of June 2017  only counts nine other companies globally among its members  While this growth is exciting  it also begs the question  having reached such an enormous size  how much room is left for Alibaba  NYSE BABA  and Tencent to grow 

One way to evaluate this question is to study the growth patterns of similar internet technology companies that have already hit the  300 billion mark  For example  Google  first joined the group in May 2013 while Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  and Facebook  did the same in November 2015  These companies may provide insight into how Alibaba and Tencent might perform going forward 
According to data from Bloomberg  hitting this valuation did not interrupt the growth of Google  NASDAQ GOOGL   Amazon or Facebook  NASDAQ FB   Figure 2 explains this by showing the paths to  300 billion in market cap for internet technology companies  The graph shows the months leading up to each company reaching  300 billion  represented by negative numbers  and those directly afterward  represented by positive numbers   After reaching  300 billion in market cap  Google  Amazon  and Facebook continued to grow steadily  Google even went on to increase its market cap to  534 billion over the next three years  and by June 30  2017  it more than doubled to  635 3 billion 
Additionally  Figure 3 shows how each company s sales continued to grow after achieving  300 billion in market cap  ranging from 33  sales growth by Amazon to 76  sales growth by Google  Share prices have similarly continued to rise as the value of Google  Amazon  and Facebook s stock prices increased by 102 8   51 0   and 38 8  respectively from when they first reached  300 billion to June 30  2017 

We believe that if China s internet giants continue to follow a similar model as that of their US predecessors  there is potential for future growth  When taking China s market and demographics into account  we believe that future could look even brighter 
China s E Commerce market size surpassed the US in 2014 and  by 2016  had reached a total market size of  749 billion  As measured by the CSI Overseas China Internet Index  the sector has rallied more than 40  year to date  Also  Alibaba and Tencent have the advantage of operating in a Chinese internet environment that is still developing  Today  only about half of China s 1 3 billion citizens have access to the internet as opposed to 88 5  of the US population  This means that  as China continues to develop and modernize  China s internet penetration may also continue to grow and represent a significant market opportunity 
Surveying the globe for the next internet technology company with the right characteristics to join the  300B club  we believe that there could be a number of viable candidates in the China internet sector  For example  NetEase Inc  NASDAQ NTES  is a Chinese internet conglomerate that is lesser known in the United States but is the second largest video game company in China  second only to Tencent  and was the seventh largest video game company in the world by revenue in 2016  While its market cap of  39 5 billion is about 9 times smaller than that of Alibaba and Tencent  NetEase s net revenue rose 68  year over year in 2016  and it reached  5 7 billion in total sales in May 2017  only about 4 times less than the two Chinese tech leaders 
We also cannot forget to mention China s well established search engine and online services provider  Baidu Inc  NASDAQ BIDU   which some refer to as the  Google of China   Baidu is currently China s most popular search engine and is the fourth most visited site in the world  It has begun positioning itself as a global leader in artificial intelligence  AI   having amassed a 1 700 person research team and spent about  3 billion on R D over the past two and a half years  It boasts an even bigger market cap than NetEase at  62 2 billion and had an annual revenue of  10 2 billion in 2016 
Maybe more of a long shot contender for joining the  300B club is Momo Inc  NASDAQ MOMO   a rising Chinese internet company which operates a popular social networking and live streaming app  We include Momo on the list of contenders because of its rapid growth  Although it went public less than three years ago  it already reached a market cap of  7 3 billion as of June 2017 and has 85 2 million monthly active users as of March 2017  So far  Momo has seen net revenues increase by 421  year over year 

The KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF  KWEB  is an exchange traded fund offering holistic exposure to these trends and opportunities within China s internet sector  KWEB holds Alibaba  Tencent  NetEase  Baidu  Momo  and 28 other Chinese internet stocks  We believe this basket approach to the China internet sector can take advantage of the growth potential of smaller companies like Momo while also minimizing volatility through holding larger companies like Alibaba and Tencent  This approach aims to provide maximum potential for growth while attempting to limit volatility  Figure 4 highlights how  over the past year  KWEB has delivered strong returns with less volatility than any single one of its holdings 
Reaching  300 billion in market capitalization is a huge achievement for any company  As firms like Google  Amazon  and Facebook have demonstrated  hitting this milestone does not mean that there is no more room for growth for Alibaba and Tencent  With that said  small to mid cap internet companies in China often provide strong potential for growth but with corresponding volatility  We believe KWEB strikes an appropriate balance between large and small to mid cap companies while allowing investors to potentially benefit from the growth of the China internet sector as a whole ",2017-07-20,KraneShares,https://www.investing.com/analysis/two-china-tech-giants-join-the-$300b-club.-who’s-next-200202273,200202273

 has had a good year so far  After Pok mon Go s super success  its latest games  Pok mon Sun and Moon have become the  fastest selling games  ever in the Americas  This bodes well especially as we approach the holiday season  Plus  fans across the globe can now enjoy Nintendo games inspired theme areas at four Universal Studios locations  Meanwhile  Activision Blizzard   NASDAQ ATVI   chalked out an impressive package for CEO Bobby Kotick  which could reportedly make him one of the  highest paid CEOs  in the U S Recap of the Developments1  In a press release a couple of days back   said that Pok mon Sun and Pok mon Moon for Nintendo 3DS   already the most pre ordered games ever for the company  have now become the  fastest selling games  in the Americas with over 3 7 million units sold in less than a fortnight The earlier record was held by Pok mon X and Pok mon Y games  which released in 2013  The Pok mon Go craze has definitely given these new 3DS game a little more boost  These games carry a score of 87  on Metacritic  At its last earnings release  for the six months ended Sep 30  2016   management noted that the enthusiasm surrounding Pok mon Go also helped sales of its 3DS console The Pok mon franchise has been a monster hit for Nintendo  Per Nintendo  sales of Pok mon related software topped the 280 million units mark as of May 2016  globally  since it was launched alongside Pok mon Red and Pok mon Blue games in 1996 In fact  Nintendo s Mario and Pok mon are widely recognized as the most successful video game franchises in the world This year has been a pretty good one for the company with shares surging over 75 5  year to date compared with the Zacks Toys Games Hobby Products Industry gain of 9 01   Going ahead  we believe the launch of new games like Super Mario Maker for 3DS and Super Mario Run for iOS should help it continue the momentum  Also  there are a lot of expectations from the recently revamped NES as well as the upcoming launch of the Switch console  At present  Nintendo carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  2    NASDAQ CMCSA   agreement signed way back in May 2015  Per the agreement  Universal Studios and Parks  a unit of Comcast s NBC Universal  will come up with Nintendo games inspired theme areas at four locations including one at Universal Studios in Osaka  Japan  The expansion will bring the much loved characters like Mario and Zelda  along with the action and adventures of Nintendo games to life with a little extra touch of ingenuity  Meanwhile  reportedly  Electronic Arts   NASDAQ EA    at the Credit Suisse  SIX CSGN  2016 Annual Technology Conference  hinted that it will be bringing a big game title for Nintendo s Switch  set to release in Mar 2017 3  Activision Blizzard has dished out an impressive  package for its CEO Bobby Kotick  Though it includes a reduction in base pay to  1 8 million from  2 4 million from Jan 2017  his performance related bonus will now be 200  of his base pay if he achieves  certain  targets  As per media reports  the figure will top  56 million  which will catapult Kotick into the league of the highest paid CEOs in the U S  Activision has been doing very good in the past two years under Kotick  He  in fact  has been at the helm for 25 years now  In the past two years  Activision has been taking giant strides  which has well reflected in its share price  Shares of Activision have registered impressive return of 65 7  over the past two years compared with the Zacks Toys Games Hobby Products Industry gain of 49 8  Apart from a full fledged video game publishing business  the company has been exploring newer avenues like e sports and movies  In 2015  it announced the acquisition of Ireland based King Digital Entertainment  which has made it a big player in the mobile games space where so far the company had limited presence  After the King Digital buyout  there is heightened speculation that Activision will now make  smaller  bolt on  acquisitions as per media reports   At present  Activision carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Computer and Technology Sector Price IndexPerformanceThe following table shows the price movement of the major video game companies over both the past five trading days as well as the last six months              Over the last five trading sessions  Activision was down 7 32  while Zynga Inc   NASDAQ ZNGA   was up 2 50  Over the last six month period  NetEase   NASDAQ NTES   surged the most  23 65    Recently  NetEase reported solid third quarter 2016 results  The increasing popularity of mobile based games and the strength of PC games  licensed   self developed  continue to keep investors interested in the stock  Moreover  higher mobile advertising revenues were an added incentive  NetEase has announced a new  1 billion buyback program for its ADRs over a one year time frame  The development comes close on the heels of NetEase launching its first VR game  Twilight Pioneers on Google s VR platform  Daydream Glu Mobile   NASDAQ GLUU   was down 8 47  over the same time frame due to the underperformance of most of its releases  Its weak third quarter results were somehow overshadowed by the

This lets one easily choose ideal metrics   Screens are effective because they sift out bad stocks and only keep the cream of the crop in   It isn t always easy to create an effective screen   Our have helped with this  bringing profits to many investors over time   Our predefined criteria are chosen carefully to capture special kinds of companies 
Today  we ve dug up three cheap growth stocks using one of our premium screens known as  EPS Growth  Revisions    Positive Surprises    Some of the metrics of this screen requires a stock to have an average trading volume of at least 100 000 shares over the last 20 days  a positive EPS surprise last quarter  and positive EPS growth last year   In addition to using the metrics on this great screen  I ve added an additional metric which I feel is appropriate for finding cheaper stocks  
I screened for stocks with a PEG under one   This will allow us to find companies that may be undervalued relative to their expected earnings growth over the next three to five years   Let s see what our modified premium screen has found for us today 
Silicon Motion   NASDAQ SIMO  
Silicon Motion focuses on making and marketing universally compatible and low power semiconductor solutions for the multimedia consumer electronics market   They develop NAND flash controller ICs for solid state storage drives and also make specialty RF ICs for mobile devices   SIMO has earned a  B  for growth  and it also has a PEG of 0 92   A PEG under 1 may suggest that there is value present  
Silicon has traits which are desirable for any growth candidate   For starters  the corporation has consistently posted high gross margin levels   Over the last few years  gross margin has been in a range close to 50    The company s net margin of 18 29  is impressive  and net income grew by over 36  last year   Sales grew by about 25  last year  and 2016 is forecasted to see even more growth  with revenues projected to increase by 45 61  
Analysts have unanimously raised their estimates upwards for the current quarter  current year  and next year over the last two months   Two analysts revised estimates in the last 60 days  and this has brought the current quarter EPS consensus up from  0 60 to  0 74   Our current year consensus estimate has also seen notable improvements over the last two months  going from  2 31 to  2 77   SIMO has beaten our EPS consensus estimate in three of the last four quarters  and it has a strong chance of topping our estimate when it releases its next quarterly earnings in late October Revenue  TTM

112309,333824,NTES,Twitter Tumbles As Thursday Night NFL Numbers Underwhelm,opinion,"Twitter Inc    NYSE TWTR   fell nearly 4  yesterday as many analysts said that viewership for Thursday s NFL game  live streamed on the network  was  disappointing  
Twitter live streamed the first NFL match between New York Jets versus Buffalo Bills that had an average viewership of 243K  Viewership peaked at over 2 1 million for three seconds on Twitter  Moreover  average users spent 22 minutes on the platform  In contrast the CBS and NFL network had a combined average viewership of 15 4 million  Also  the TV broadcast had an audience of 16 4 million at the peak 
Twitter definitely lagged way behind as far as the numbers are concerned  Further  per media reports  Twitter is expected to generate  2 to  4 million in revenues from the Jets Bills games  which is of course unlikely to  move the needle  for Twitter  
However  we believe that the Jets Bills games viewership has a little more significance   Live streaming  especially sports is a lucrative opportunity  Though NFL is a onetime deal with only 10 games  it marks Twitter s foray into sports live streaming  Through the deal  the company aims to bring in more users  especially millennials  At the same time  it also intends to help marketers reach the younger demographic through its Amplify program  The company has collaborated with the likes of Anheuser Busch InBev  Nestl   Sony Pictures  and Verizon for ad packages for NFL games 
If Twitter manages to gain decent viewership for the remainder of the games  anlaysts observe that it is likely that NFL and Twitter will join forces again in the future  Anlayts further add that the increase in viewership  will also bode well for other extremely popular NHL  NBA and MLB games that Twitter will be live streaming in the near future  These deals are Twitter s way of attracting more users and advertisers to its platform  Twitter just has 313 million users whereas the world s largest social media service Facebook Inc    NASDAQ FB   boasts 1 7 billion users  Even the photo sharing app  Instagram has half a billion users 
Twitter is making some changes to its platform to make it more user friendly  Recently  the company announced that has it has now changed the way it counts 140 characters by doing away with calculating media attachments and  names in the count  enabling users to express more in tweets 
We have to add that focusing on  live  and changes to its platform  though heading the right direction  haven t had a favorable impact on its financial performance yet  This isn t a good sign because investors are losing patience  Twitter has been in trouble for long now  Shares have tanked over 34  in the past one year and are trading way below its IPO price of  25 94  
In fact  Twitter s elusive turnaround has many questioning the standalone status of the company  Buyout rumors have been plenty this year  Under such circumstances  we believe that Twitter has to make its live streaming deals work or else it might have to put up a sale signboard soon as is widely expected 
At present  Twitter is a Zacks Ran k 3 Hold  stock  Better ranked stocks in the tech space include NetEase Inc   NASDAQ NTES   and NetApp  Inc    NASDAQ NTAP    Both sport a Zacks Rank 1  Strong Buy  You can see  TWITTER INC Price

112338,333853,NTES,Videogame Stock Roundup  GameStop s Q2  Sony s New PS4   More,opinion,"Yesterday  video game retailer  GameStop Corp   NYSE GME   reported second quarter fiscal 2016 results wherein revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a mile due to weak sales of new gaming software and hardware  sending the stock price down 8  in aftermarket trading  Further  media reports stated Sony Corp    NYSE SNE   plans to release a new  slimmer version of its base model PlayStation 4 console next month  in addition to the new high end model it announced earlier 
A Recap of the Developments
1  GameStop  adjusted earnings per share of 27 cents in the quarter that beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny  but declined 12 9  year over year GameStop s revenues fell 7 4  year over year to  1 631 8 million and also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 722 million  The second quarter results were hurt by a sharp decline in comparable store sales  comps   which were primarily affected by a fall in video games and hardware sales  Management reiterated its fiscal 2016 earnings guidance

112378,333893,NTES,Facebook  FB  Wins Lawsuit Against Belgium s Regulator,opinion,"Facebook  Inc    NASDAQ FB   just won a big lawsuit against Belgium s data protection authority  In 2015  the Belgian Privacy Commission had sued Facebook to prevent it from tracking information of non users who visit Facebook s public pages 
Back then a lower court had sided with the regulatory body and directed Facebook to stop tracking non users activities or cough up a hefty fine of  250K every day 
Expectedly  Facebook appealed against the ruling  The company also maintained that Irish Data Protection Commissioner had sole authority over it  Facebook s European headquarters are located in Ireland 
However  Facebook temporarily discontinued the use of Datr cookies that are  placed on users  browsers when they visit a Facebook com site or click a Facebook  Like  button on other websites  allowing it to track the online activities of that browser  
Yesterday  in a big victory for Facebook  the regulatory body s claim was rejected by the Brussels Appeals Court citing that  Belgian courts don t have international jurisdiction over Facebook Ireland  where the data concerning Europe is processed  
Facebook welcomed the ruling and said  we are pleased with the court s decision and look forward to bringing all our services back online for people in Belgium  
However  the Belgian privacy watchdog said that it was mulling filing a final appeal with the Court of Cassation  Notably  Cassation courts can t deliver new judgments but have the authority to trash earlier rulings 
As Facebook hosts a huge amount of personal data  it has been under constant scrutiny from privacy groups and federal agencies  This huge database is its primary asset for attracting advertisers  As a result  the company has been criticized for allegedly selling this personal data to advertisers in order to boost its top line 
Although the company has denied any wrongdoing  we believe that increasing scrutiny by regulators of its data handling practices remains a major concern  going forward  Recently  the company ran into trouble with Brazilian law enforcement agencies involving its messaging service WhatsApp and in Germany over antitrust concerns

112417,333932,NTES,China Stocks In Focus As MSCI Considers Inclusion,opinion,Several Chinese stocks listed on the U S  stock exchanges are in focus  as Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS  Capital International  MSCI  decides whether to list mainland Chinese shares on several of its global indices  If it does happen  it will definitely be good news for the Chinese economy  which had a torrid run this year  This is because more money will flow into its sagging economy  eventually putting a ceiling to market volatility and fulfilling its need for foreign investments  Inclusion by MSCI will fuel demand for Chinese companies Is China Ready for Prime Time China is a huge part of the global economy  but still a large part of its stock market isn t represented in most of the global indices  Is MSCI  the largest indexing firm in the world  trying to put that right by considering whether to include mainland China stocks on their global indices  This is in spite of the fact that regulatory countdown has pushed local traders away  China s so called A shares or mainland China stocks had tanked to less than one third of their value in the country s two major markets   Shanghai and Shenzhen   in May from its peak level in Jun 2015 Analysts round the world are debating whether mainland China shares are ready for prime time or not  In this context  Chinese authorities did address specific concerns of the MSCI  which more or less represent the concerns of the global investing community at large Too many trading halts in the Chinese stock market during the beginning of the year created havoc among foreign investors who had to deal with redemption requests  However  authorities had set a maximum period of stock halts at three months  Questions regarding foreign investors owning Chinese shares have been cleared  Chinese authorities confirmed that they do own such shares even though they are held by local asset managers  Authorities also added that foreign investors will be able to invest adequately depending on the size of the firm and can get their money out without much fuss Including China A shares would be a Game ChangerThe world s second largest economy is in desperate need for foreign investments  In order to tame market volatility  institutionalize the onshore market and broaden the investor base  such investments have become essential  With the inclusion  hundreds of billions of U S  dollars are expected to flow into Chinese stocks An inclusion of just 5  of A shares will attract around  17 billion from funds tracking the MSCI Emerging Markets Index alone  as per HSBC Holdings  LON HSBA  plc   NYSE HSBC   estimates  Moreover  it is anticipated that the inclusion will result in an inflow of an extra  20 billion to  30 billion in Chinese stocks over the next year MSCI also said that Chinese stocks  index weighting could increase to 20  in the future provided Beijing allows foreign investors more access to its markets  Additional capital inflows will be able to offset capital outflows from its citizens What Lies Ahead The MSCI China A Index  which tracks A shares  plummeted almost 46  over the past 12 months after MSCI decided not to include Chinese A shares last June  However  this time around  MSCI is likely to welcome A shares  Given the advantages of being listed and the steps taken by the Chinese authorities  MSCI is expected to take a gradual approach in listing all mainland Chinese shares The MSCI China A index has 420 stocks with a market capitalization of  800 billion  MSCI has already mentioned that the initial inclusion of China A shares in the Emerging Markets index will be limited to 1 1  of the weight of the index  This proportion will gradually increase with the passage of time  A 1 1  weightage accounts for almost  16 billion that foreign investors need to acquire mostly within the next few months  Also to be noted is the fact that China A shares with a full weight will be about 15  of the Emerging Market index Chinese Stocks Draw AttentionChinese stocks had a horrible start to this year  But  if MSCI considers it fit to include China mainland shares in several of its indices then billions of dollars will undoubtedly be pumped into Chinese shares  resulting in a bull run  This means we will expect heavy trading volume in major Chinese stocks listed on the U S  stock exchanges  including NetEase  Inc    NASDAQ NTES    Ctrip com International Ltd    NASDAQ CTRP    JD com  Inc    NASDAQ JD   and 58 com Inc    NYSE WUBA    While NetEase boasts a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   Ctrip com International  JD com and 58 com carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  On the other hand  other Chinese behemoths listed on the U S  stock exchange like Alibaba Group Holding Limited   NYSE BABA   and Baidu  Inc    NASDAQ BIDU   don t share the same fate as the above mentioned companies  While Alibaba Group has a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   Baidu  Inc   China s answer to Alphabet Inc    NASDAQ GOOGL    has a Zacks Rank  4

112456,333971,NTES,Oracle To Appeal Against Jury s Verdict Favoring Google,opinion,"In a landmark ruling  a 10 member jury has found no copyright violations of Oracle Corp  s   NYSE ORCL   Java APIs by Alphabet   NASDAQ GOOGL   while developing its Android system 
Oracle sought  9 3 billion as compensation from Alphabet for unauthorized usage of Java APIs in its Android operating system  As per media reports  Oracle s damage expert James Malackowski had claimed  8 8 billion as compensation for profits made by Google in addition to  475 million in damages  A booming smartphone market especially for Android run devices in the last few years is a contributing factor to the mammoth compensation demanded by Oracle  
The dispute has been going on for the past six years now  Oracle had first sued Alphabet  then Google  It claimed thatGoogle in order to take a leading position in the mobile market was scrambling to launch its operating system and therefore used Java unauthorized as it was a well known script with a lot of programmers then  However  Google denied such allegations and maintained that the usage of Java APIs was protected under the  fair use  clause  which permits copying under limited circumstances  
Java was developed in the early 1990s by Sun Microsystems  which was taken over by Oracle in 2010 
In May 2012  Alphabet had initially gained an edge as the Northern District of California Judge William Asylup ruled that APIs are not copyrightable  However  next year  a U S  Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed the district court s ruling  thereby bringing some relief for Oracle But at the same time  it gave Alphabet a breather in the form of the  fair use  defense clause  which permits copying under limited circumstances   In Oct 2014  Alphabet filed a petition in Supreme Court but SCOTUS turned it down and redirected it to a district court  
The ruling was welcomed by Silicon Valley as they apprehended that a decision in Oracle s favour could prove detrimental to innovation since programmers use open source APIs across various interfaces for developing codes  Analysts observe that if Oracle had won  it would have been a very puzzling situation for developers as to which APIs can be accessed and which are off limits  Further  they added that it would have marred  software cooperation  and made the process expensive  the eventual burden of which would fall on consumers 
In an email  Google said  Today s verdict that Android makes fair use of Java APIs represents a win for the Android ecosystem  for the Java programming community  and for software developers who rely on open and free programming languages to build innovative consumer products   
However  Oracle is not willing to accept this decision  The company is planning to appeal against the verdict  Oracle general counsel Dorian Daley was quoted saying  Oracle brought this lawsuit to put a stop to Google s illegal behavior  We believe there are numerous grounds for appeal

112462,333977,NTES,Twitter s  TWTR  32M Passwords Leaked And Now Up For Sale,opinion,"As per a LeakedSource report  there are some 32 million Twitter   NYSE TWTR   passwords that have been compromised with and available for sale on the dark web  LeakedSource is a search engine for stolen data and currently has over 1 8 billion leaked records  which are accessible for a fee   
LeakedSource named the source as Tessa88 exploit im  who provided it with the Twitter data 
The report also adds that Twitter s systems weren t likely compromised but the data including passwords was hacked over a period of time by malware affected browsers that saved and sent back the information to the hackers  This is because Twitter doesn t store passwords in plain text but Chrome and Firefox do so  This indicates that the passwords were stolen directly from consumers 
The onslaught was particularly severe in Russia with nearly 7 4 million accounts being hacked  Moreover  LeakedSource  also said that the breach was no hoax as  out of 15 users we asked  all 15 verified their passwords   LeakedSource now has transferred the huge cache of data to its database but will let affected users remove the information for free 
A Twitter spokesperson later clarified that Twitter systems haven t been breached and that it has notified its millions of affected users 
Earlier  social media services like MySpace  LinkedIn   NYSE LNKD   and Tumblr also faced a similar situation where sensitive information of their users was put up for sale  Reportedly LinkedIn had about 117 million accounts hacked in May this year  Recently  many high profile Twitter accounts like that of Katy Perry and Facebook s   NASDAQ FB   CEO Mark Zuckerberg have been hacked  Even Twitter s NFL account was hacked to spread false rumors about the death of NFL commissioner Roger Goodell 
With the growing importance of digital activity  data theft has become a major concern  Users have been repeatedly warned to keep different passwords for multiple accounts so that hacking one account  for e g  a social media account  doesn t put other important ones  like bank accounts  at risk  Moreover  the usage of a password manager like 1Password  and KeePass is recommended

112497,334012,NTES,NTES Makes New Highs,opinion,"NetEase Inc  O NTES  made new highs just above  180 in recent weeks 

 NTES  NetEase Inc 
The stock has experienced a considerable trending move higher since late September  when it was trading between  110 and  120 a share  The  180 level remains as resistance on the daily time frame  with  170 being the first support zone to watch for  The bulls have defended this price level well  though it remains to be seen how much longer they can do so 
Below  170 there is support just above  160  around the  162 price level  Below that there is support at the breakout level around  150  The bulls are still in control on the daily time frame  as  DMI remains above  DMI  but the ADX indicator is no longer rising  so we can expect to see some sideways trading action now as the bulls and bears battle it out 
On the weekly chart  RSI is positive and well above the 60 level  so the bulls are exerting their might for now  There was a pullback in RSI this past week as the bears applied selling pressure once  NTES breached the  180 level and wasn t able to maintain it 
 NTES is a great example to cite in illustrating that the stock market can truly baffle even the most seasoned of traders  In less than twelve weeks   NTES appreciated in value what it had taken years to do before  It should be entertaining to watch as the year comes to a close and the new year approaches ",2015-12-14,Syncubate,https://www.investing.com/analysis/$ntes-makes-new-highs-375730,375730
112498,334013,NTES,1 Chart Depicts Economic Recovery As 100  Fiction,opinion,"Anything I ve ever done that ultimately was worthwhile    initially scared me to death 
Betty Bender

They say a picture is worth a thousand words and this chart is probably worth a lot more  It illustrates how the BLS has been lying through its teeth over the past seven years  Then again anyone with a grain of common sense could figure out that the retarded methodology the BLS employs is bound to create the illusion that all is well  They purposely discount individuals that have stopped looking for work in coming up with their unemployment numbers  Hence  the 5  figure is not an accurate reflection of the landscape  The chart below provides a more realistic view of the unemployed in the U S and in some areas we believe that the numbers could be more than 30  

Another problem that is hardly addressed is that over 6 6 million Americans work part time jobs  but are desperately seeking full time jobs  This figure is significantly higher than the 4 5 million individuals who were working part time before the Great Recession began  A new phrase has been coined for this group of workers  Involuntary Part  Time Workers  
The final blow  real wages have been declining for quite some time now   22 41 today has the same purchasing power an hourly salary of  4 03 cents hand in 1973  Median Income continues to drop  the middle class has been decimated since the financial crisis of 2008  and this trend is going to continue for the foreseeable future 
Game plan Central bankers clearly understand the true nature of this so called economic recovery  and that is why they will continue to inflate this asset bubble  and they will continue to do this till the masses revolt  The BOJ fired the latest shot in the  devalue or Die  currency war games that are rippling across the Globe and other central bankers are likely to take the same path as for now resistance is futile  The masses are too tired to revolt  they are overworked and underpaid  and so it will be a long winter before there is any hope of spring  The suggested strategy  therefore  is not to listen to the naysayers who predict gloom and doom at very twist and turn  but to use strong market pullbacks corrections to open new positions in companies that are growing or in blue chips  For example  NetEase Inc  O NTES   Costco Wholesale Corporation  O COST   Raytheon Company  N RTN   McDonald s Corporation  N MCD   etc  are stocks that will perform well over the long run 
Finally  it makes sense to deploy money into gold bullion as we have been stating for some time  The downside is limited from here  but we would hold back from jumping into gold stocks until gold has confirmed that a bottom is in place  The minimum requirement for this would be a monthly close above  1200 ",2016-02-10,Sol Palha,https://www.investing.com/analysis/one-chart-depicts-economic-recovery-100-fiction-383930,383930

 When torrential water tosses boulders  it is because of its momentum  when the strike of a hawk breaks the body of its prey  it is because of timing  Thus  the momentum of one skilled in war is overwhelming  and his attack precisely timed     Sun Tzu   The Art of War 
Our emotions are often experienced in waves of varying momentum  when we re excited  we may lavish in our successes  whereas when we re demoralized  we may feel like throwing in the towel and calling it quits altogether 
These waves of momentum are evident in stock prices over various time frames  In this case study  we ll take a look at NetEase Inc   NASDAQ NTES  and Yahoo  Inc   NASDAQ YHOO  and compare the recent run up in both stocks on the daily versus three hour charts  paying  particular attention to the shifts in underlying bullish versus bearish sentiment by assessing price action

Both NTES and YHOO have seen a significant rise in their stock prices since the middle of October  The bulls remain in control of both markets on the daily time unit  as  DMI remains above  DMI What distinguishes both stocks is the ADX line is beginning to trend lower for YHOO  which may be indicative of a pause in the rising trend  This is further validated by the fact that YHOO closed below its 21 day moving average today for the first time since 10 21  finishing at  50 28 
NTES is still holding above its 21 DMA  though it has now closed below both its 5 DMA and 9 DMA for the first time since its trending move higher picked up the pace in mid November  as noted by the rising ADX line starting from that point 
Three Hour Chart Comparison 
YHOO has evidently stalled out at the  52 level  having been unable to overcome this price point despite the last two weeks of flirting with it 
On Monday  the bears dragged YHOO down to the  50 level and the bulls have not reclaimed the previous highs   DMI is beginning to rise and has held above  DMI for several days now  this is the first such occurrence since mid October  so bearish conviction is mounting 
NTES bulls were humbled by the  107 level twice last week and have yet to reclaim it this week  The ADX line is declining  so a range trade may be in order for now  with the  100 level being critical for sustaining bullish momentum ",2014-12-04,Syncubate,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-importance-of-momentum-and-timing-in-trading-234614,234614
112535,334050,NTES,2 Stocks Worthwhile Trading,opinion,"Trading is a never ending learning experience and it s supposed to be fun 
 When you have a purpose for every action  every action has a result  
  Greg Plitt  Fitness Model   Motivational Speaker  1977 2015
It s enjoyable when you recognize that it s a game of odds  and if you are purposeful in how you approach the stock market  you will seek out high probability trade set ups that are in your favor before you take on any position 
Do we make mistakes in trading  Of course we do   we all do  The point is to learn from those missteps and apply the lessons acquired to future opportunities as they arise in the market 
Identify your trading style and perfect it  Only you can determine what level of risk you re comfortable with taking on in any given trade  what types of set ups you have a preference for  and what your profit targets may be 
So with the idea of purposeful trading in mind  let s take a look at two stocks we ve highlighted on the blog before  CF Industries    NYSE CF  and Netease   NASDAQ NTES  

CF Industries Holdings Inc  and  Netease Inc 
Both CF and NTES have been riding high  as  DMI is above  DMI on the daily time frame for both stocks  indicative of bullish strength  In the case of CF  the bulls really took control at the end of December  whereas with NTES  the bulls resurfaced in the beginning of January 
Both stocks are also trading near their 1 618 Fibonacci extension targets  keeping in mind that this is a rough estimate of breakout price potential over previous resistance levels  we can see that CF is currently trading at its 1 618 Fibonacci level of about  302  while NTES flirted with its 1 618 Fibonacci level around  114 on 1 20 15 when it hit a high of  113 41 
Of the two stocks  CF is displaying more weakness in my opinion because it has achieved new closing highs above  300 in recent days  yet we are seeing negative divergence in the RSI signal as it has recorded a lower peak then it had during the stock s initial breach of the  300 level on 1 12 15 and 1 13 15 
Additionally  CF s 5 DMA just crossed below the stock s 9 DMA as of the close yesterday  The 5 DMA is at  296 25 whereas the 9 DMA is at  296 67  This is significant in that this is the first such occurrence since 12 19 14 in which the shorter term moving average closed below the intermediate term moving average  if this continues  caution is warranted for the bulls 
Considering CF traded as low as  286 last week a support level I suggested to look out for on any pullback  and as high as  306 40 this week  another round of selling pressure by the bears is not out of the question 
NTES is also ripe for a retrace to its 5 DMA  given that it has had an uninterrupted run higher for the past twelve trading sessions  However  the 5 DMA is still above the 9 DMA for NTES  and this speaks to the underlying bullish momentum in the stock  so sell offs in the near term may be brief ",2015-01-22,Syncubate,https://www.investing.com/analysis/2-stocks-worthwhile-trading-239327,239327
112536,334051,NTES,Zen And The Art Of Chinese Economic Re Balancing,opinion,"The latest news out of China is   Notwithstanding the numerical value of the GDP growth target  one of the key elements of Chinese economic policy is to re balance the source of growth from credit driven infrastructure and export oriented growth to the Chinese consumer  My latest progress report on China shows that the country is both re balancing and not re balancing  Read that sentence again  Yes  you read it right  It is and isn t re balancing  Let me explain  Last week   reported that the re balancing process is progressing well 
Domestic consumption surpassed investment to become the strongest driving force of the Chinese economy in 2014  indicating a new growth model has already started forming as the country enters a  new normal  development era  the National Bureau of Statistics said on Thursday  Total consumption accounted for 51 2 percent of gross domestic product growth last year  compared with 48 6 percent from investment  Net exports accounted for just 0 2 percent of the GDP growth  said the NBS report  Xie Hongguang  the NBS deputy director  said   It means that the consumption driven growth model has started taking shape  and the economic structure has started improving   According to the official data  in 2013 final consumption contributed half of the nation s GDP growth and 54 4 percent was from investment  while net exports dragged down GDP by 4 4 percent 
But then  how much can we trust official Chinese statistics 
Does the market believe China is re balancing 
On the other hand  equity based market indicators are telling a different story  I track the progress of two Chinese ETF pairs that measure the relative performance of Chinese consumer stocks relative to a mainly financial stock basket  The long side on the first part of the pair  Golden Dragon Halter USX China Fund  NYSE PGJ   is heavily weighted in Chinese technology names with heavy exposure to Chinese consumption  e g  NetEase Inc  NASDAQ NTES   Baidu Inc  NASDAQ BIDU    The long side on the second part of the pair is Global X China Consumer ETF  NYSE CHIQ   which is weighted towards direct consumer plays like Great Wall Motor  OTC GWLLY  and Vipshop  NYSE VIPS   The short side on these baskets are predominantly Chinese finance and bank stocks  which represents the old model of credit driven infrastructure growth  The chart below shows how these pairs have performed in the last three years  When the lines are rising  consumer stocks are outperforming  which is an indication that re balancing is progressing well  When the line is falling  re balancing is suffering a setback  As the chart shows  both pairs have been in a downtrend for about a year  This is an indication that the market believes that  despite all the rhetoric  Beijing has gone back to the same old same old model of credit driven infrastructure growth 
An immature manufacturing base
How can we reconcile Chinese government statistics about rising household consumption and the underperformance of Chinese stocks that are sensitive to the consumer  The most obvious explanation is that China makes up its economic releases  There is also an alternative view  which suggests that both government statistics and market based indicators are correct  Consider this report from  about Chinese tourists going to Japan to buy high tech toilet seats 
 World class toilet seats are not what Chinese manufacturers aspire to make   the nationalistic Global Times  on Thursday  The Communist Party paper was reacting to reports that China s tourists were eagerly snapping up Japanese goods  especially electronic personal hygiene accessories  during the just completed Lunar New Year holiday  Lunar New Year sales in China  according to the Ministry of Commerce  That figure seems to overstate domestic spending during the period  but in any event purchases by the country s tourists abroad evidently increased by a higher percentage  A shift in spending patterns suggests Chinese made goods are losing favor with China s increasingly demanding consumers 
The real reason for the Chinese consumer to be buying abroad is the perceived quality of foreign made goods  emphasis added  
Why would the Chinese go all the way to Japan to purchase something they could get at home  There appear to be two reasons  First  it was reported that the Chinese goods were cheaper in Japan than in China  But price was not the primary consideration  Second  I think the Chinese believed that Japanese retailers  unlike their Chinese counterparts  would carry only high standard items  China s people  who can often afford the best  are demanding better goods  As the influential Beijing Youth Daily noted   Chinese enterprises are focused more on producing low priced products  but they missed the point that more and more Chinese consumers are starting to care more about quality  rather than price   Despite years of experience  Chinese manufacturing is not moving up the quality chain as fast as expected  As a result   overseas trips are turning into regular shopping trips for household items  the South China Morning Post reports 
There have been far too many scandals over the quality of domestic products in China 
Many of China s producers are apparently unable to bridge the quality perception gap  Take an item that top Chinese leaders have repeatedly promised to improve  milk powder  Last month  there were violent protests in Hong Kong as local people there tried to stop  parallel traders  who were emptying shelves of milk and other items  The busy traders often make multiple trips a day to carry goods into Mainland China  Sometimes parents themselves make the trip  Why is foreign milk powder so valuable in China  Chinese powder is often poisonous and sometimes lethal  About 300 000 Chinese children suffered kidney damage in 2008 because local producers were adding melamine  an industrial chemical  to milk  At least six infants died  Since then  there have been isolated scandals involving milk and many incidents involving other adulterated foods 
In summary  this is the story of how China is re balancing and not re balancing its economy  Consumption is re balancing  but it may not necessarily be to the benefit of domestic suppliers  Chinese manufacturers need to start to develop the right corporate culture and learn to move up the value chain to focus on quality instead of just price  Until that happens  much of the benefits of re balancing growth towards the Chinese household sector is likely to accrue to foreign firms ",2015-03-04,Cam Hui,https://www.investing.com/analysis/zen-and-the-art-of-chinese-economic-re-balancing-243935,243935
112537,334052,NTES,Can t Knock The Hustle  NTES Analysis,opinion,"Let s take a look at NASDAQ NTES  NetEase Inc   and analyze its price action via the monthly and weekly charts 

NTES closed above  140 on the weekly time frame in early May  and has since been bound in a trading range between  140 and  150  In the past sixteen weeks  NTES has closed green thirteen times and has only had three weeks in which the bears dominated over the bulls and closed the stock below its opening price 
The monthly chart shows a rising trend since the beginning of the year  as NTES has now advanced well above the  100    110 range it struggled with breaking out of at the time 
The RSI signal is beginning to decline on the weekly chart  and this could be reflective of some approaching price action weakness in the intermediate term  A close below the  140 support level on the weekly would likely portend a further decline towards the congestion zone highlighted on the chart between  125    130 
If the bulls can close NTES above  150 on the weekly chart and follow through with strength in the subsequent week s price action  then they may have a chance to further advance the stock  At this point though  I would imagine that a pullback is more likely in order to digest the significant gains that have been made over the past four months ",2015-07-06,Syncubate,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can't-knock-the-hustle:-$ntes-analysis-257294,257294
112538,334053,NTES,Global Fund Managers Watch Alibaba s Earnings,opinion,"On Wednesday  August 12  Alibaba  NYSE BABA     one of China s premier internet companies    will report its quarterly earnings  They will command more attention than one might suspect by global fund managers  
After learning that MSCI refused to include China s mainland A shares in its global indices in June  many observers thought the issue was over   Yes  there was a general sense that the A shares would be included  and perhaps before next June s formal review  However  with the strong direct and indirect intervention to arrest the slide in share prices  this does not seem likely anytime soon  
Yet the issue is far from over   In a few months  MSCI will make some changes in the composition of its China indices  It will add more than a dozen technology Chinese companies to the  ARCA EEM  Index  These will not be the A shares  but American Depository Receipts  ADRs   
This is important  At present  MSCI s China indices are heavily biased toward state owned enterprises  especially the financial  energy and telecom sectors  This is going to change  The only new economy stock in the current index is Tencent  OTC TCEHY   a gaming company that also owns WeChat  It is also has the highest weighting currently at 10 8   
The November s adjustment is the first of a two stage process   The 15 largest Chinese companies listed in the US will be added to the MSCI EM equity index  The November move will include the first eight  Alibaba  NYSE BABA   Baidu  NASDAQ BIDU   Jd Com  NASDAQ JD   NetEase  NASDAQ NTES   Ctrip com  NASDAQ CTRP   58 Com Inc Adr  NYSE WUBA   Vipshop  NYSE VIPS  and Qihoo 360  NYSE QIHU   Next May will see the inclusion of the another seven companies  
It is not clear how funds will be driven by MSCI s decision  Some expect as much as  10 bln of ETF and index money will flow into the shares that will be included  There may be a multiple of this that shadows the MSCI Index  This could potentially be a significant amount relative to the market cap of these ADRs  Hence the two stage process  
Alibaba s ADR was launched last September among much fanfare  The stock lost nearly a quarter of its value this year  It just announced its largest acquisition  excluding the purchase of Yahoo  NASDAQ YHOO  s stake  valued at  7 1 bln  in 2012  It spent roughly  4 6 bln  CNY28 3 bln  for a 19 9  stake in Suning Commerce  SZ 002024   which gives it a stake in a network of electronic brick and mortar stores  Half of this payment will be used by Suning for a stake in Alibaba  solidifying the inter company linkage  Alibaba reportedly paid a 10  premium over the end of July price of Suning  
Some fund managers may chose not to buy an individual Chinese tech company  and this is not a recommendation to purchase any shares   We simply note that some fund managers may instead opt to buy an ETF that tracks Chinese technology companies  There are three main ones in this space   NYSE CQQQ   Guggenheim s China technology ETF that trades on the NYSE      NASDAQ QQQC   Global X s China technology ETF  and  NASDAQ KWEB   KraneShares ETF  which excludes hardware companies to focus entirely on China s software and service providers  ",2015-08-11,Marc Chandler,https://www.investing.com/analysis/global-fund-managers-watch-alibaba's-earnings-261296,261296
