188538,410054,NEM,Gold s Rally Is Driving a Rush to One of Metal s Final Frontiers,news," Bloomberg     Step aside Canada  Australia and South Africa  West Africa is fast becoming the hottest ticket in gold mining 
Producers and prospectors are pouring money into the region as prices rally and the industry at the southern tip of the continent keeps shrinking  While gold miners face a dearth of new discoveries globally  large parts of West Africa have barely been explored  The deposits tend to be shallow    meaning easy access    and relatively low cost 
At least two new projects started up this year and a further two are scheduled for 2020  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd  is also expanding and modernizing its Obuasi mine in Ghana and Canada s Iamgold Corp  is considering a new operation in Senegal  In July  Resolute Mining Ltd  agreed to buy another West Africa focused producer 
At the center of the action are the Birimian belts  tracts of ancient  gold rich volcanic rock that stretch from the fringes of the Sahara to the Atlantic coast  While West Africa has a long tradition of gold mining    Ghana was known as the Gold Coast under British colonial rule    the vastness of the region and political insecurity in some areas mean its riches remain mostly untapped

 West Africa is brimming with potential   said Kelvin Dushnisky  the chief executive officer of the world s No  3 gold producer AngloGold   Our Obuasi mine is a spectacular orebody that will be a significant production engine for Ghana and AngloGold for many years to come  
Both of AngloGold s  JO ANGJ  larger rivals  Barrick Gold Corp  NYSE GOLD  and Newmont Goldcorp Corp   NYSE NEM   also have mines in the region  and Newmont recently completed an expansion project in Ghana

Investment  especially in exploration  slowed across the industry after gold prices came off the highs seen in 2011 and 2012  and most producers were focused on cutting debt and lowering costs rather than new spending 
Now  with gold back around  1 500 and ounce  there s more money to go around 
Most of West Africa s gold deposits have yet to be found and mined  according to Oumar Toguyeni  Iamgold s vice president for the region 
 If you are looking for gold in West Africa  you go to the Birimian belt   Toguyeni said by phone from Mali   The potential is still there as the region remains under explored  It s the easier deposits that were found  
To be sure  West Africa also has its challenges  as a surge of attacks by al Qaeda and Islamic State linked insurgents threatens to curb exploration and mining 
Terrorist Threats
Terrorist threats from Mali to Burkina Faso have spread to border areas with Ghana and Ivory Coast as Islamist militants seek to extend their influence  In January  the body of an executive of Vancouver based Progress Minerals Inc  was found with bullet wounds after being kidnapped from an exploration site in the northeast of Burkina Faso 
There are also more conventional challenges  A lack of skilled workers and basic infrastructure such as electricity supplies and roads makes mines more expensive to build  Toguyeni said

Still  once projects are up and running  there s good money to be made  Gold Fields Ltd  produces at a cost of about  950 an ounce at its Tarkwa mine in Ghana  said CEO Nick Holland 
Once the waste rock is stripped away   there is quite a lot of meat on the bone to go for   he said   If you can manage costs and be efficient  open pits  it s great business  
Several smaller companies are exploring for gold in West Africa  aiming to either develop their own mines or find a buyer once a discovery is made  said Cora Gold Ltd  CEO Jon Forster 
Cora is exploring a deposit in Mali and believes it can get investor support for a mine  said Forster  a veteran geologist who has worked in West Africa for about 25 years 
 It s one of the world s great gold provinces  he said   This gives investors the confidence that you can take a project from exploration stage to mining

With an all share deal  Kirkland will take advantage of a record stock price to acquire the company  which operates the Detour Lake mine in northeastern Ontario  The agreement values Detour at C 27 50 a share  a 24  premium to the closing price on Friday 
There s been constant speculation about gold mining acquisitions after huge deals rocked the industry in the last year   Newmont Mining  Corp  NYSE NEM   s acquisition of Goldcorp Inc  and Barrick Gold Corp  s takeover of  Randgold Resources   LON RRS  Ltd  The two combinations created companies that dwarf the rest of the industry and mean that smaller miners feel the need to consolidate if they re going to stay relevant to shareholders 
 The addition of Detour Lake provides an opportunity to add a third cornerstone asset that is located in our backyard   Tony Makuch  chief executive officer of Kirkland  said in a statement 
Detour shareholstateders will receive 0 4343 share of Kirkland  according to the statement  After the deal is completed  existing Kirkland shareholders will own 73  of the new company  with Detour owners holding the rest 
Kirkland s stock price has surged in the past three years  climbing more than 800   as profits soared  That s put the company in a strong position to expand 
The Detour Lake gold mine is expected to produce for more than 20 years and can generate 600 000 ounces a year  It s about the same size as Kirkland s biggest project  the Fosterville mine in Australia 
Detour shares have almost doubled this year  helped by a rally in gold prices  Paulson   Co  led an overthrow of the board in 2018 after a bitter proxy battle  in which he called for the company to put itself up for sale 
The new entity would have gold production of about 1 5 million ounces in 2019 and free cash flow of  700 million  Kirkland said

Earlier Monday  the U S  s biggest gold miner Newmont Goldcorp  NYSE NEM  said it would buy back  1 billion worth of stock  an indirect way of saying that there are better ways to create value than to invest in expanding production at current prices 
However  supply considerations were of secondary importance on a day when the U S  administration was acting in concert to revive the threat of tariffs against China  Trump first waved the big stick by re imposing tariffs on imports of steel and aluminium from Brazil and Argentina in retaliation for alleged currency dumping  before Ross told Fox Business that Trump would  certainly  levy further tariffs on Chinese imports  as scheduled  if China doesn t offer more concessions on trade by the deadline of Dec  15 
Trump also repeated in vaguer terms  before leaving for a NATO summit in London  that he wanted further concessions  He noted that the situation in Hong Kong was complicating trade talks  a nod to the angry Chinese reaction to the U S  enacting the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy bill last week

Barrick s shares rose 2 1  to C24 47 in Toronto 
The Toronto based company is in the process of integrating operations following a flurry of activity over the past few quarters  from the acquisition of  Randgold Resources   LON RRS  late last year to a joint venture in Nevada with the world s biggest gold producer  Newmont Goldcorp  to the buyout of Tanzania focused unit Acacia Mining Plc  L ACAA  
Chief Executive Mark Bristow  who led Randgold before taking over leadership of the combined company  said in Barrick s earnings statement that Acacia s operations had not been managed by previous Barrick management

188583,410099,NEM,Newmont Bondholder Revolt May Put Barrick on Hook for Debt,news," Bloomberg     Barrick Gold Corp  could find itself partially liable for  600 million in additional debt if some  Newmont Mining  Corp  NYSE NEM   bondholders have their way 
The creditors are trying to block an amendment Newmont is seeking for a large tranche of notes associated with its operations in Nevada  according to people with knowledge of the matter  The change would prevent liability for those bonds from shifting to Barrick after the companies  recently announced joint venture in the state is completed 
A majority of holders of Newmont s  600 million of bonds due 2035 have organized and submitted their rejection to the proposed change  the people said  asking not to be identified as the discussions are private  The JV with Barrick is not contingent upon Newmont bondholders agreeing to the amendment  Newmont said in a statement last week  But if bondholders succeed  the JV would likely be the new guarantor of the securities  according to CreditSights analysts  putting Barrick on the hook to assume some of the liability 
The 2035 bonds are guaranteed by Newmont USA Ltd   which includes the three Nevada gold mines set to become part of the JV with Barrick  Those assets accounted for about 88 percent of the guarantor s proven and probable reserves within North America at the end of last year  and the proposed JV would constitute a sale of  all or substantially all  of the guarantor s assets in Nevada  per the bond prospectus 
That would make the JV liable for the 2035 notes  which isn t necessarily what Barrick signed up for when announcing the deal last month  It s not clear whether Barrick asked for the changes 
The relationship between Newmont and Barrick  the world s two largest gold miners  has been fraught for years  Merger talks between the two companies have failed in the past  as have attempts to increase cooperation in Nevada  The joint venture agreement was only reached after Barrick launched  and agreed to withdraw  a hostile bid for Newmont 
Consent Fee
Newmont is required to bring its assets into the joint venture free and clear of any third party debt  and Barrick is not planning to guarantee any Newmont obligations  nor is the joint venture  a spokeswoman for Barrick said   Barrick expects that Newmont will address any joint venture related issues that it may have with its creditors in a manner that would accommodate the completion of the joint venture arrangements within the time frame contemplated by the parties  
Newmont couldn t immediately be reached for comment 
Newmont has offered holders  1 per every  1 000 to accept the changes  and consents are due by 5 p m  New York time Wednesday  The company informed holders of the offer through a statement issued on April 4 at 4 05 p m   giving them less than a week to respond 
 The guarantor language in the merger covenant is worth more than 10 basis points in our view and we believe bondholders should push for a higher consent fee   CreditSights analysts Wen Li and Will Benedict said in an April 7 report 
The expiration date comes on the same day that Credit Roundtable  a bondholder industry advocacy group  gathers for its semiannual meeting in Washington  The meeting started at 8 30 a m  and Newmont had come up in conversation within minutes  according to David Knutson  co leader of the group 
 Bottom line    this consent was launched in a way that obscured the potential impact to certain bondholders   Knutson said 
Last month Newmont was forced to promise shareholders the largest dividend in 32 years to woo support for its  10 billion merger with Goldcorp Inc 
Major equity investors  including Paulson   Co  and VanEck  had argued that the price tag did not reflect the value of Newmont s joint venture with Barrick  which was negotiated after the Goldcorp deal was struck  The dividend could induce Newmont shareholders to vote for the Goldcorp deal on April 11 by rewarding them in advance for  4 7 billion in synergies that Barrick expects the JV will create

Mining companies and analysts at the Lithium Supply and Markets Conference in Santiago this week said they couldn t help but notice the half empty rooms at the sessions    and the lack of investors and fund managers among attendants  The picture was remarkably different from last year s event  when prices for the mineral used in rechargeable batteries were at historic highs  This year prices have fallen 17  
 A lot of the risk capital that had gone into the lithium sector is now running into cannabis   said Tobias Tretter  managing director at Zurich based fund manager Commodity Capital AG  The lithium market  absolutely needs more investment  not just from car manufacturers or chemical companies but also from institutional investors and fund managers  
Lithium miners need billions of dollars in investments in order to expand production and to keep up with demand that s expected to rise at double digit rates in coming years  according to conference participants including Anthony Tse  chief executive officer of Perth  Australia based producer Galaxy Resources Ltd 
While the market is slightly oversupplied at the moment  it is expected to remain tight  with demand set to reach 1 million tons per year by 2025  from about 325 000 tons last year  according to BloombergNEF 
New Capacity
About  9 billion has to be invested across the lithium mining sector in order to add the 600 000 tons of new capacity needed to match demand in coming years  Tse said  The company operates the Mt  Cattlin mine in Australia and is developing a project in Canada and another in Argentina 
 Unless we start seeing meaningful slots of capital and checks being written for the sector  I see it very hard how you can get the amount of supply needed to meet demand   Tse said during a presentation at the conference   You can build all the EV factories that you want  but if you don t have any of the raw material  you can t feed that chain  
The recent mega deals between gold producers Barrick Gold Corp  and  Randgold Resources   LON RRS  Ltd   and  Newmont Mining  Corp  NYSE NEM   and Goldcorp Inc  brought hope that investors would return in greater numbers to mining stocks  But that money hasn t made it into the lithium mining space  attendants at the conference said 
 Firmly Parked 
 The capital is firmly parked on the cannabis sector   Chris Berry  an analyst at House Mountain Partners  said on the sidelines of the gathering   As this speculative cannabis view matures  the hope is that that capital will come back to mining    but I don t see a lot of money coming into the space for now  
Quebec City based Nemaska Lithium Inc  successfully raised C 1 1 billion   824 million  for its Whabouchi project in Canada last year  But in February the company announced it would need an additional C 375 million to complete construction of the mine  saying it was evaluating several options  Shares plunged as much as 51  following the announcement as investors saw it as a case in point for the lithium industry s struggles to build new mines and supply the market 
 A lot of the speculative money has moved to cannabis and crypto currencies   said Wanda Cutler  Nemaska s head of investor relations   People have made very attractive returns there on their investments and I hope to see that money redeployed back into junior mining  We re in a bit of a pause right now  but I do think interest will come back    it s just hard to predict when  
The situation is slightly better in Australia  said Argosy Minerals Ltd  Managing Director Jerko Zuvela  The company  which has a lithium project in Argentina  raised  9 million two months ago 
 It s not as easy as it used to be   he said on the sidelines of the conference in Santiago   Maybe it s not the medium term investors you would like  but as long as you can keep the lights on you re developing your project and getting closer to the day when you re getting into production

188607,410123,NEM,Barrick CEO Brushes Aside Newmont Rebuff  Says He ll Make Offer,news," Bloomberg     Barrick Gold Corp  plans to proceed with a formal takeover offer for  Newmont Mining  Corp  NYSE NEM    undeterred by Monday s rejection by the target company s board 
Newmont s board unanimously rejected Barrick s  17 8 billion unsolicited proposal  saying it would not be better than Newmont s previously announced takeover of Goldcorp Inc  Instead  Newmont submitted a joint venture proposal to Barrick that would encompass the two companies  Nevada operations 
Barrick is  definitely not  going to withdraw the hostile bid  Chief Executive Officer Mark Bristow said in a telephone interview  Barrick will take its offer to Newmont shareholders  and at same time will try to advance talks about the Nevada joint venture  according to Bristow   Time is of the essence   adding that Barrick plans top speak to Newmont  ASAP   he said 
Omar Jabara  a spokesman for Newmont  said by email that  we look forward to hearing back from Barrick on our letter and joint venture proposal  
Newmont had raised serious doubts about Toronto based Barrick s full merger proposal    a hostile all share no premium bid    from the day it was made public Feb  25  Newmont said its previously announced agreement to take over Goldcorp offered better benefits  and Goldberg called Barrick s takeover offer  desperate  and  bizarre  
 We can deliver the value from the Goldcorp transaction and we can work with Barrick to deliver the value from the synergy potential in Nevada   Tom Palmer  who will succeed Gary Goldberg as the next Newmont chief executive officer  said on an investor call 
 Relevant Metrics 
 The combination with Goldcorp is significantly more accretive to Newmont s shareholders on all relevant metrics compared to Barrick s proposal  even when factoring in Barrick s own synergy estimates   Goldberg said in the statement 
Barrick has no intention of raising its offer  a person familiar with the matter said last week 
The top end of the gold industry has been in a state of transformation    in September  industry leader Barrick agreed to buy  Randgold Resources   LON RRS  Ltd  for  5 4 billion  Three months later  Newmont announced its plan to purchase for  10 billion  which would leapfrog it into the leading gold producer spot 
Barrick said that a joint venture between the company and Newmont in Nevada wouldn t accomplish the benefits that come with combining the two biggest gold producers 
 Better Job 
 Barrick s experience with Newmont as a joint venture partner suggests that is not a transaction that would maximize value for either party   Barrick said in its updated presentation on its website   As a result  negotiations with Newmont over the years have not been fruitful and do not give us confidence that a suitable JV or similar transaction can be implemented  
Under its agreement with Goldcorp  Newmont is barred from engaging with Barrick on its takeover bid after the board has determined that it s not a  superior proposal   Newmont said in its statement 
 Getting Both 
Asked if Newmont would consider a higher bid by Barrick for a full merger  Goldberg said in a phone interview Monday after the conference call that Newmont prefers to push forward with both the Goldcorp deal and a possible Barrick JV in Nevada instead 
 We believe getting both is the best for our shareholders   he said 
Bristow said in a statement Monday afternoon that Newmont s proposal  reinforced the frustration Barrick has experienced in its efforts to unlock the value in the two companies  assets in Nevada  
 Newmont s latest proposal is essentially based on the stale and convoluted process that foundered previously   Bristow said   As usual  it comes with unrealistic preconditions including swapping the chairmanship and the leadership of the JV  Experience has shown us that JVs only work well when the majority owner is also the operator  
Newmont shares rose 2 percent to  34 49 at 3 59 p m  in New York  while Barrick gained 1 9 percent to  12 55 
 Poor Record 
 Since previous merger discussions terminated in 2014  Newmont has significantly outperformed Barrick on almost every metric   Goldberg said in a letter Monday to Bristow and Barrick Executive Chairman John Thornton   Our management team has a consistent  long standing track record of delivering superior execution   he wrote   In contrast  Barrick s underperformance highlights its ineffective operating model  poor record on delivering stockholder returns  and significant jurisdictional risk  
 Mark has never run a global portfolio   Goldberg said in a Feb  25 interview  referring to Barrick CEO Mark Bristow  who until Jan  1 ran Africa focused Randgold   In fact  I d say none of his team have run a global portfolio like what we have in place  
On the same day  Bristow said his team could do a better job running his rival 
 I have spent a lot of time in Nevada  and I have no doubt that I can do a better job than Newmont   Bristow said in an interview with Bloomberg Television ",2019-03-04,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/barrick-ceo-brushes-aside-newmont-rebuff-says-hell-make-offer-1797309,1797309

188614,410130,NEM,VanEck Shares Paulson s Concerns on Newmont Goldcorp Merger,news," Bloomberg     Paulson   Co  isn t the only  Newmont Mining  Corp  NYSE NEM   shareholder that s expressing concerns over the terms of the gold miner s  10 billion purchase of Goldcorp Inc 
 I think Paulson has a valid point   said Joe Foster  a portfolio manager at VanEck    one of the biggest Newmont shareholders  When the deal was inked  investors were unaware of the  outrageous payouts  that would be given to Goldcorp executives after the merger  he said 
On top of that  it s unfair that Goldcorp shareholders should benefit from a joint venture between Newmont and Barrick Gold Corp  in Nevada  given that was negotiated after the Goldcorp Newmont terms were set  he said 
Mounting investor concerns sent Goldcorp shares tumbling as much as percent in New York  while Newmont pared losses and rose as much as 1 4 percent 
On Thursday  Paulson said it won t support Newmont s proposed merger with Goldcorp unless the terms are changed  Paulson said a 23 percent reduction in the value of the transaction would help ease his concerns because under the current deal  Goldcorp shareholders are effectively receiving the benefits of the recently announced joint venture for free 
 Aggressive  Analysis
 I think Paulson s analysis might be aggressive  but I think directionally they have the right idea   Foster said in a telephone interview Friday   I don t think shareholders should support the lavish lifestyles of the Goldcorp executives for one thing  And secondly  Goldcorp shareholders are not entitled to the JV synergies because it was not part of the deal  
Shareholders including VanEck had previously blasted the increase in Goldcorp Chairman Ian Telfer s retirement allowance to roughly  12 million from  4 5 million if the company completes its merger with Newmont  Initially  the plan was for Telfer to join Newmont s board as deputy chairman  But earlier this month  Goldcorp announced he wouldn t accept the new job 
British Columbia Investment Management Corp   which holds 3 85 million shares in Goldcorp and a small stake in Newmont  said Friday it would vote against the merger partly because of the payment that would go to Telfer   This is inconsistent with the governance principle of pay for performance and sets a troubling precedent in the capital markets   BCI said in a statement 
 We just received the letter and are evaluating it   Omar Jabara  a Newmont spokesman  said Thursday by email  referring to Paulson s concerns  Newmont didn t respond to requests for comment Friday  The miner has previously said a merger with Goldcorp would create more than  4 4 billion in value  The combined company would be the world s largest gold miner  with sustainable production of 6 million to 7 million ounces a year 
Foster said he has not yet decided whether he will vote for the deal  VanEck held 5 9 percent of Newmont shares and about 6 2 percent of Goldcorp shares outstanding at the end of 2018  according to data compiled by Bloomberg  At Thursday s closing prices  that Newmont stake would is valued at  1 08 billion versus  596 4 million for the Goldcorp stake 
Newmont investors who held shares as of the Feb  20 record date will be allowed to vote on the merger on April 11  according to Newmont s proxy materials  A spokesman for Paulson said the hedge fund acquired 14 2 million shares this year but declined to comment on whether they were purchased before or after the record date 
April 4 Vote
Goldcorp shareholders are scheduled to vote on the deal April 4  Paulson sold its entire position in Goldcorp in 2019 for the reasons explained in the statement  the spokesman said  According to data compiled by Bloomberg  Paulson held about 800 000 shares of Goldcorp at the end of 2018 
Greenwood Village  Colorado based Newmont s offer was made just months after Goldcorp shares hit their lowest level since 2002 
The tie up was also harshly criticized by Barrick during a hostile bid for Newmont in the past month  which has since been withdrawn in favor of the joint venture between the two companies  Barrick CEO Mark Bristow said he didn t believe the Newmont Goldcorp combination created any value and called Goldcorp s assets  less than attractive  
Under the current terms  Newmont would create more value by not merging  once the joint venture with Barrick is created  Paulson said  It also flagged  remarkably  divergent fourth quarter results for both Newmont and Goldcorp  announced after the merger  The premium is  unjustified  given Vancouver based Goldcorp s poor performance  the hedge fund said 
 I m not going to prescribe what the company should or shouldn t do   Foster said   I m sure Newmont is looking at all the options and I m sure Newmont wants to do what s fair for shareholders  ",2019-03-22,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/vaneck-shares-paulsons-concerns-on-newmontgoldcorp-merger-1815775,1815775

188622,410138,NEM,Global M A slides in first quarter as Brexit weighs on Europe,news,By Pamela Barbaglia and Liana B  Baker LONDON NEW YORK  Reuters    Global mergers and acquisitions  M A  sank 17 percent in the first quarter of 2019  as concerns about an economic slowdown and fears of a no deal Brexit in Europe spooked chief executives and corporate boardrooms from pursuing big tie ups  While dealmakers expected a slowdown after 2018 emerged as the third strongest year on record for M A around the world  some worrying signs emerged  including a major drop in cross border activity   Cross border M A fell 45 percent in the first quarter of the year  as companies focused mainly on building scale on their home turf  Activity in Europe plunged 67 percent  according to Refinitiv data  and dragged down global M A volumes to  927 billion   Many companies feel there is a lot at stake given all the uncertainty surrounding Brexit and the trade tensions between the U S  and China   said Dirk Albersmeier  co head of EMEA M A at JPMorgan Chase   Co  NYSE JPM   While megadeals in the United States  such as Bristol Myers Squibb  NYSE BMY  Co s  74 billion deal to buy  Celgene Corp   NASDAQ CELG   were a bright spot lifting global activity  Europe saw the average deal size shrinking well below the  5 billion mark  Britain lost its ranking as the world s third biggest M A market to Saudi Arabia  with activity down 62 percent to  40 million while German M A tanked 76 percent to  17 million  The region could remain anemic for deals for some time  investment bankers said  with the exception of some companies having to merge to build national champions  such as German lenders  Deutsche Bank   DE DBKGn  and Commerzbank  DE CBKG   British companies planning their post Brexit survival could also turn to deals to better withstand a possible downturn  said Philip Noblet  head of UK investment banking at Jefferies    The amount of pressure on these companies will accelerate in the coming months and for some the choice will be between domestic consolidation and restructuring   Noblet said  Currency volatility in Britain has so far deterred overseas buyers from bidding for global champions trading in London  but that could change after Brexit  Noblet added  While global stock markets rose in the first quarter  central banks appeared to be bracing for decelerating growth  Earlier this month  the U S  Federal Reserve abandoned projections for any interest rate hikes this year amid signs of an economic slowdown    The macro economic outlook is murky   said Wilhelm Schulz  chairman of  Citigroup   NYSE C  Inc s EMEA M A   It s not just because of Brexit or trade tensions  The main reason why people are sitting on the sidelines is the slowdown in global growth   U S  OFF TO A STRONG START In contrast to Europe  the United States  which is the largest M A market  got off to its strongest start since 2000  with  489 52 billion dollars in announced deals  up 9 4

industry  which was the busiest sector with  181 billion in value  shows no signs of slowing down  said Sullivan   Cromwell LLP M A lawyer Krishna Veeraraghavan   Between competition for new drugs  improving technology  the aging of the global population  a number of factors will continue to drive M A in the healthcare sector  whether it s biotech or insurance providers   Veeraraghavan said

 Newmont Mining   NYSE NEM  is one of the largest miners  They acquire  develop and explore for gold  silver and copper   Operations and assets are in the United States  Australia  Peru  Ghana and Suriname 
Proven and probable gold reserves as of February 2018 were 68 5 million ounces  worth  85 6 billion at the current price of bullion  which also works out to over  160 of reserves per share 
Newmont Mining traded as high as  81 90 in 1987  only weeks before the Crash of  87 and traded as high as  72 42 when bullion hit a peak over  1900 per oz  in 2011  We believe those levels will again be achievable if our long term forecast of  3000 to  3500 per oz  bullion proves correct  
While this might not seem a very big deal for investors buying shares at current levels  Newmont Mining is capable of paying huge dividends and indeed  actively pursued a higher dividend policy when bullion was racing towards the 2011 peak 
Newmont is huge  their aggregate land amount to approximately 23 000 square miles  which would rank as the 119th largest country in the world  not all that far from the entirety of Ireland  The shares have been in a modest uptrend since the mid September 2018 low of  29 32 
Based entirely on our long term forecast for bullion  Newmont Mining represents a very fair value for those who need to position themselves in the gold sector

188691,410207,NEM,Economic Nationalism Is Back in Indonesia as Election Approaches,news," Bloomberg     Nothing sells like economic nationalism in Indonesia s election season 
Facing a challenge from a self proclaimed nationalist  President Joko Widodo has used speeches after his nomination for April s vote to tout his success in wresting control of the nation s prized natural resources from foreign companies 
Now the campaign in the lead up to the April 2019 poll is expected to develop into a battle built around economic nationalism  While it may risk a retreat by foreign investors from Southeast Asia s biggest economy  it s still likely to be a vote winner  according to analysts 
Widodo  known as Jokowi  has carried forward the resource nationalism championed by his predecessor Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono by taking steps to take back assets managed by multinationals such as Freeport McMoRan Inc    Total  SA  PA TOTF  and  Chevron  Corp   NYSE CVX  His government recently ordered all oil producers to sell their crude to state refiner PT Pertamina as it sought to cut imports 
Jokowi is pitted against Prabowo Subianto  a former general and the chief of the opposition Gerindra party  in a rematch of the 2014 elections  As Jokowi struggles to meet his 7 percent growth target and defend the rupiah that has slumped to the lowest level since the Asian financial crisis in 1997 98  he s likely to raise the pitch of nationalist rhetoric 
 We maintain our sovereignty  we guard our natural resources   the president said   We want to use that as much as possible for the prosperity of the Indonesian people  
Economic Independence
Resource nationalism  might be deemed unfriendly for investors  but looking at the consistency in the past years  the trend will likely remain in years to come   said Komaidi Notonegoro  executive director of Jakarta based ReforMiner Institute   There has also been a shift in our investment paradigm from pro market to economic independence  
The pull of protectionism has characterized Jokowi s tenure since 2014  when he became the country s second directly elected president  Indonesia  rich in natural resources from tin to nickel and copper to natural gas  is keen to keep more of that wealth for the benefit of its 265 million people by restricting exports 
Click here to read more about Indonesia s protectionist push
After filing his nomination for re election on Aug  10  Jokowi told his supporters he had protected the national interest by securing control of Grasberg copper and gold mine operated by Freeport and Rokan oil and gas field from Chevron  While Grasberg is the world s second largest copper mine  Rokan is Indonesia s largest oil block 
Subianto and his running mate Sandiaga Uno have echoed similar nationalist sentiments  The duo have pledged to preserve Indonesia s wealth for its people and not allow other nations to exploit it 
 Indonesia s wealth is for the people of Indonesia  not for other nations    we do not want to be a minion of other nations  become a lackey and slave to other nations   Subianto said last month 
Still  the government insisted the takeover of oil and gas fields was not nationalism   If the foreign companies made better offers  we would give the blocks to them   Djoko Siswanto  the director general of oil and gas at the energy ministry  said   This has nothing to do with nationalization  This is all about the economics  
Rising foreign direct investment since Jokowi became president indicates that investors consider the world s fourth most populous country as too big a market to ignore  Annual foreign investment jumped 13 percent in three years to  32 2 billion in 2017  official data show 
 Nationalist rhetoric is definitely a  vote getter  in Indonesia where foreign investment is viewed by most people as either a bad thing or  at least  a necessary evil that must be strictly controlled   said Bill Sullivan  a lawyer specializing in mining at Christian Teo   Partners in Jakarta   I expect a repeat of the 2014 presidential election when every political party and politician sought to stake out the most extreme resource nationalist position possible  
BHP  Newmont
Indonesia banned metal ore exports in 2014 to encourage smelter construction  arguing that too much wealth was shifting to refineries overseas  The move led to mine closures and a global surge in nickel prices   Newmont Mining  Corp  NYSE NEM   and BHP Billiton  LON BLT  Ltd  both pulled out of Indonesia in 2016 by selling their mining assets to local players  The ban has since been relaxed to allow some exports 
Investors are bracing for the takeover of more oil and gas assets  where current contracts are due to end in the next few years and will cost the government very little to acquire  Notonegoro said   It s different in the mining sector because when a contract expires  the government has to pay some compensation to take over the mining asset  like in Freeport case   he said 
Below is the list of energy assets with contracts due to expire beyond 2021 
The nationalistic drive has led to state owned companies dominating the resources sector  PT Indonesia Asahan Aluminium is in the final stages of taking a majority stake at Grasberg valued at about  3 85 billion  while Pertamina took over Mahakam and Rokan oil blocks from Total and Chevron respectively 
Yet allowing state owned companies to dominate the energy or mining industry will  based on their past track record  encourage corruption  inefficiency and political interference  said Sullivan from Christian Teo   Partners  That will reduce the competitiveness and make  world class western energy or mining companies reluctant to invest in Indonesia  ",2018-09-16,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/economic-nationalism-is-back-in-indonesia-as-election-approaches-1612068,1612068
188693,410209,NEM,Barrick to Buy Randgold to Bolster Assets and African Expertise,news," Bloomberg     Barrick Gold Corp  agreed to buy Africa focused rival  Randgold Resources   LON RRS  Ltd   addressing concerns about the Toronto based miner s production outlook and sharpening its focus on higher quality assets 
The creation of a gold mining company with a combined market value of about  18 billion helps Barrick to boost output at a time when its stock has been punished for the producer s stagnant pipeline  The company s shares have about halved from a February 2017 peak  with the miner outpacing the decline in bullion  Barrick will also exploit synergies in Africa  while tapping Randgold s operating expertise on the continent 
 Randgold has a proven ability to operate successfully in some of the most challenging environments in the world   Barrick Executive Chairman John Thornton said on a conference call   The combined company will have five of the world s top 10 tier one gold assets  
Under the all share deal Barrick shareholders will own about two thirds of the new entity and Randgold investors the remainder  the two companies said in a statement on Monday 
Randgold Dividend
Barrick shares were up about 4 percent in premarket trading  Randgold shareholders will receive a dividend of  2 a share for the 2018 financial year  The company s shares gained 5 9 percent to 5 212 pence as of 11 12 a m  in London trading 
 We see this as a positive for Randgold shares today as it changes the narrative around the group   James Bell  an analyst at RBC Capital Markets  said in a note  citing African risks and slowing production momentum   We see the news as overall positive for the group due to the higher quality nature of the assets in Barrick  
Randgold has slipped about 30 percent this year as it faced labor challenges in the Ivory Coast  a tax dispute in Mali and the prospect of a tougher mining code in the Democratic Republic of Congo  Barrick s majority owned Acacia Mining Plc has been stuck in limbo after Tanzania imposed a ban on exports of mineral concentrates in 2017 and slapped a  190 billion tax bill on the London listed company 
 There are synergies  very clear synergies in Africa particularly because we can operate the entire portfolio that will be double in size with exactly the same structures   Bristow said on a conference call   And as we progress collectively to find a solution that really delivers better value and more transparency in Tanzania  we will unlock many synergies  
Strategic Approaches
The takeover won t be well received by Barrick shareholders as it would add further exposure to geopolitical risks in Africa  Stephen Walker  a Royal Bank of Canada analyst  said in a note published before details of the deal were announced  That could open the way for  Newmont Mining  Corp  NYSE NEM    the biggest gold miner by market value  to make an offer for Barrick  Walker said  Newmont didn t immediately respond to an emailed request for comment outside usual office hours 
The Terms 

Each Randgold shareholder will receive  6 1280 new Barrick shares for each Randgold share

188694,410210,NEM,Canada s Barrick Gold to buy Randgold for  6 5 billion in all stock deal,news,"By Zandi Shabalala  Justin George Varghese and Clara Denina  LONDON  Reuters    Canada s Barrick Gold Corp has agreed to buy  Randgold Resources   LON RRS  Ltd in an all stock deal valuing the Africa focused miner at  6 5 billion  to create the world s largest gold producer in an industry under investor pressure to put capital to good use  The new Barrick company  which will be listed in New York and Toronto  will own five of the world s 10 lowest cost gold mines and have market value of  19 4 billion based on Monday trading  That would make it the world s biggest gold miner by market capitalization  overtaking  Newmont Mining  Corp  NYSE NEM   according to Reuters calculations  The deal marks the biggest transaction in years in the gold mining industry  where companies have come under fire from investors for poorly managing capital  forcing them to focus on costs while dampening enthusiasm for acquisitions  Randgold closed up 6 percent  making it the biggest gainer in London s wider mining index and valuing it at 4 93 billion pounds   6 5 billion   Shares of Barrick  the world s second largest gold producer  were up 6 3 percent in afternoon trade in Toronto   Randgold has the agility and swift footedness of a younger and smaller company  much like Barrick in its early years  while Barrick has the infrastructure and global reach of a large corporate company   Barrick Chairman John Thornton said in a conference call  Randgold s long term boss Mark Bristow will become the chief executive and president of the merged company  taking chief financial officer Graham Shuttleworth with him and Barrick s Thornton  an ex Goldman Sachs banker  will be executive chairman  Bristow  a 59 year old trained geologist  has been at the helm of Randgold since its inception in 1995 and is known for his straight talking  hands on approach to running the company  The deal brings to together two executives with different leadership styles and backgrounds  Two thirds of the directors of the board of the new Barrick will be nominated by Barrick and one third by Randgold   What the deal delivers Randgold shareholders   is more options in terms of growth and development  whereas before they only had one growth option of scale in Massawa   said Investec analyst Hunter Hillcoat  referring to the miner s gold project in Senegal   POOR HAND   The deal value  at 48 5 pound a share  matched Randgold s market capitalization as of Friday s close  This lack of a premium for Randgold shareholders prompted scepticism from some analysts who were also concerned that Randgold s agility could be bogged down by the mammoth Barrick   UK shareholders are arguably being dealt a poor hand with the merger   said Russ Mould  investment director at AJ Bell   What Bristow has got to prove now is that bigger is better and the Randgold culture is the one that will perhaps prevail   The current spot gold price is not helping the sector  having lost out on traditional safe haven flows to the dollar  pushing it 10 percent lower this year   Both Barrick and Randgold have lost a third of their market capitalizations over the past year before Monday s gains   We don t see a reason to change Randgold s approach    If we can t deliver something that is bigger and better  then we wouldn t do it   Bristow said on a call with analysts   Bristow added on another call that the new company would be open to weighing options for its Nevada and Australia assets  and said there had expressions of interest on the latter  The new company will have the sector s highest adjusted earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and appreciation and EBITDA margin of nearly 50 percent based on 2017 numbers  and the lowest total cash cost position among its peers  the companies said  Under the terms of the deal  each Randgold shareholder will receive 6 1280 new Barrick shares for each share of the African rival  the companies said  Talks on the deal  which is still subject to regulatory and shareholder approvals and scheduled to close in the first quarter of 2019  started more than three years ago with advisors taken in July  a person familiar with the talks told Reuters   In 2017  Barrick and Randgold combined produced 6 64 million ounces while the next largest gold miner  Newmont  churned out 5 27 million ounces  The two companies said they were aligned on their strategy with Chinese investors after Barrick said it would make a bigger push to attract investors in China  Randgold  which mines also in Mali  Ivory Coast and the Republic of Congo  where it has been faced with regulatory risk  a factor that Barrick s Africa unit Acacia Mining has to deal with in Tanzania

188696,410212,NEM,Barrick Randgold Deal Is Putting the Shine Back on Gold Miners,news," Bloomberg     Call it the shot heard  round the gold industry 
As more than 1 100 gold mining executives  metals analysts and investors made their annual retreat to the mountains of Colorado  all anyone seemed to want to talk about was the deal that was announced just hours earlier  Mark Bristow  the outspoken chief executive officer of  Randgold Resources   LON RRS  Ltd  who helped arrange the merger with Barrick Gold Corp   didn t seem surprised 
 I have been agitating for this industry to rearrange itself   Bristow said in an interview at the Denver Gold Forum in Colorado Springs   Everyone just wants to keep their own little space  and that s the challenge  
The days of keeping one s own space may now be numbered as the Barrick Randgold merger became the hottest topic of conversation at the conference  one of the biggest annual gatherings in the gold world  Bullion prices have been stuck in the doldrums all year and investors have punished mining equities with an exodus  The sector had lost its shine  but the new deal is being welcomed for its jolt of excitement  and at least some hoped  as a harbinger of the things to come 
 The industry needs more consolidation   David Harquail  CEO of Franco Nevada Corp   said in an interview during the conference   We ve got way too many companies  We ve been shrinking in terms of value  so we should be shrinking in terms of number of companies proportionate to the value  This might be a good example of what other companies should be considering  
Out of Favor
The proposed merger for Toronto based Barrick and Randgold  the gold industry s biggest deal in three years  comes as shares of bullion producers had this month fallen to the cheapest relative to the metal since 2016  The sector is so out of favor that Vanguard Group has said it will change the name of its precious metals fund and reduce the portion of its holdings within the sector  Barrick and Randgold rallied after the deal was announced 
 Frankly  the biggest problem we have now is that large institutional shareholders don t want to invest in an industry that has  for many years  lost money   said Hugo Dryland  an executive vice chairman and the global head of mining and metals at Rothschild Inc   There s been too little M A  too little movement on the inefficiencies in the industry  
With Bristow set to become CEO at a combined Barrick Rangold  he ll fill a  vacuum of putting someone with a great tech background at the top of the business   Dryland said  speaking from beneath a shady awning on a sun drenched patio that was buzzing with mining executives and investors  Chatter about the deal  which was announced overnight before the conference started on Monday  could be overheard in hallways and outdoor spaces all day 
John Thornton  who as Barrick s executive chairman put together the company s offer to buy the Africa focused rival  said the transaction was years in the making  He spoke alongside Bristow at the  Everest  cottage at the Colorado Springs Broadmoor resort  where the industry conference is being held  The cottage had been transformed into something of a makeshift war room  It was the first interview for both men since the deal was announced 
Barrick s Munk
Peter Munk  Barrick s company s recently deceased founder  had been part of the discussions that eventually led to the deal  Thornton said 
 Peter and I discussed this deal one hundred times during the whole evolution    Thornton  64  said   We had a meeting in the minds  
The deal is also reviving speculation Barrick may return to the negotiating table with  Newmont Mining  Corp  NYSE NEM   for a new tie up after talks between the two collapsed in 2014 over differences on issues including the leadership of the combined company 
Thornton and Bristow declined to comment on Newmont specifically  but stressed that their merger doesn t preclude other partnerships or even mergers as long as they make sense  A spokesman for Newmont  Omar Jabara  declined to comment 
Thornton noted that during his tenure at Barrick  he s spoken to every major gold mining company in the world about deals that might make sense  including mergers and other transactions  of consequence   he said  His only  red line  was that he wouldn t pay a premium 
 Big Premiums 
 The gold mining industry is littered with the reverse  which is big premiums that destroy shareholder value   Thornton said 
If approved  the merger would also add Randgold copper assets to the greater portfolio  A spinoff of those assets isn t in the cards  Bristow said  and for now the company will not be creating a discrete copper business  something Thornton recently raised as a possibility 
 It s not going to create a copper business  it s going to have those copper assets embedded in the regional management teams   Bristow said   We ve got enough copper expertise and we will manage them  
The merger was preceded by nine months of intensive talks and a visit by the entire Barrick board to Kibali  a Randgold site in northeastern Congo  the executives said 
 I believe in the strategic merits of this deal and think that the new Barrick has the potential to become the industry leader in profitability and value   said Marcelo Kim  a partner at Paulson   Co  who s attending the Colorado conference   This will all come down to execution and if there s one team that brings the credibility to do it  it is the Randgold team   he said by email ",2018-09-25,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/barrickrandgold-deal-is-putting-the-shine-back-on-gold-miners-1622697,1622697

188731,410247,NEM,Displaced by mining  Peru villagers spurn shiny new town,news,"By Mitra Taj NUEVA FUERABAMBA  Peru  Reuters    This remote town in Peru s southern Andes was supposed to serve as a model for how companies can help communities uprooted by mining  Named Nueva Fuerabamba  it was built to house around 1 600 people who gave up their village and farmland to make room for a massive  open pit copper mine  The new hamlet boasts paved streets and tidy houses with electricity and indoor plumbing  once luxuries to the indigenous Quechua speaking people who now call this place home  The mine s operator  MMG Ltd  the Melbourne based unit of state owned China Minmetals Corp  threw in jobs and enough cash so that some villagers no longer work  But the high profile deal has not brought the harmony sought by villagers or MMG  a testament to the difficulty in averting mining disputes in this mineral rich nation  Resource battles are common in Latin America  but tensions are particularly high in Peru  the world s No  2 producer of copper  zinc and silver  Peasant farmers have revolted against an industry that many see as damaging their land and livelihoods while denying them a fair share of the wealth  Peru is home to 167 social conflicts  most related to mining  according to the national ombudsman s office  whose mission includes defusing hostilities  Nueva Fuerabamba was the centerpiece of one of the most generous mining settlements ever negotiated in Peru  But three years after moving in  many transplants are struggling amid their suburban style conveniences  Reuters interviews with two dozen residents showed  Many miss their old lives growing potatoes and raising livestock  Some have squandered their cash settlements  Idleness and isolation have dulled the spirits of a people whose ancestors were feared cattle rustlers   It is like we are trapped in a jail  in a cage where little animals are kept   said Cipriano Lima  43  a former farmer  Meanwhile  the mine  known as Las Bambas  has remained a magnet for discontent  Clashes between demonstrators and authorities in 2015 and 2016 left four area men dead  Nueva Fuerabamba residents have blocked copper transport roads to press for more financial help from MMG  The company acknowledged the transition has been difficult for some villagers  but said most have benefited from improved housing  healthcare and education   Nueva Fuerabamba has experienced significant positive change   Troy Hey  MMG s executive general manager of stakeholder relations  said in an email to Reuters  MMG said it spent  hundreds of millions  on the relocation effort  Mining is the driver of Peru s economy  which has averaged 5 5 percent annual growth over the past decade  Still  pitched conflicts have derailed billions of dollars worth of investment in recent years  including projects by  Newmont Mining  Corp  NYSE NEM  and Southern Copper Corp  To defuse opposition  President Pablo Kuczynski has vowed to boost social services in rural highland areas  where nearly half of residents live in poverty  But moving from conflict to cooperation is not easy after centuries of mistrust  Relocations are particularly fraught  according to Camilo Leon  a mining resettlement specialist at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru  Subsistence farmers have struggled to adapt to the loss of their traditions and the  very urban  very organized  layout of planned towns  Leon said   It is generally a shock for rural communities   Leon said  At least six proposed mines have required relocations in Peru in the past decade  Leon said  Later this month  Peru will tender a  2 billion copper project  Michiquillay  which would require moving yet another village   EVERYTHING IS MONEY  MMG inherited the Nueva Fuerabamba project when it bought Las Bambas from Switzerland s  Glencore   LON GLEN  Plc in 2014 for  7 billion  Under terms of a deal struck in 2009 and reviewed by Reuters  villagers voted to trade their existing homes and farmland for houses in a new community  Heads of each household  about 500 in all  were promised mining jobs  University scholarships would be given to their children  Residents were to receive new land for farming and grazing  albeit in a parcel four hours away by car  Cash was an added sweetener  Villagers say each household got 400 000 soles   120 000   which amounts to a lifetime s earnings for a minimum wage worker in Peru  MMG declined to confirm the payments  saying its agreements are confidential  Built into a hillside 15 miles from the Las Bambas mine  Nueva Fuerabamba was the product of extensive community input  MMG said  Amenities include a hospital  soccer fields and a cement bull ring for festivals  But some residents say the deal has not been the windfall they hoped  Their new two and three story houses  made of drywall  are drafty and appear flimsy compared to their old thatched roof adobe cottages heated by wood fired stoves  some said  Many no longer plant crops or tend livestock because their replacement plots are too far away  Jobs provided by MMG mostly involve maintaining the town because most residents lack the skills to work in a modern mine  Many villagers spent their settlements unwisely  said community president Alfonso Vargas   Some invested in businesses but others did not  They went drinking   he said  Now basics like water  food and fuel   once wrested from the land   must be paid for   Everything is money   Margot Portilla  20  said as she cooked rice on a gas stove in her sister in law s bright yellow home   Before we could make a fire for cooking with cow dung  Now we have to buy gas   GHOST TOWN Some residents said they have benefited from the move  The new town is cleaner than the old village  said Betsabe Mendoza  25  She invested her settlement in a metalworking business in a bigger town  Portilla  the young mom  says her younger sisters are getting a better education than she did  Still  the streets of Nueva Fuerabamba were virtually deserted on a recent weekday  Vargas  the community leader  said many residents have returned to the countryside or sought work elsewhere  Alcoholism  fueled by idle time and settlement money  is on the rise  he said  Some villagers have committed suicide  Over the 12 months through July  four residents killed themselves by taking farming chemicals  according to the provincial district attorney s office  It could not provide data on suicides in the old village of Fuerabamba  MMG  citing an  independent  study done prior to the relocation  said the community previously suffered from high rates of domestic violence  alcoholism  illiteracy and poverty  While the company considers the new town a success  it acknowledged the transition has not been easy for all   Connection to land  livelihood restoration and simple adaptation to new living conditions remain a challenge   MMG said  Nueva Fuerabamba residents continue pressuring the company for additional assistance  Demands include more jobs and deeds to their houses  which have yet to be delivered because of bureaucratic delays  said Godofredo Huamani  the community s lawyer  MMG said it stays apace of community needs through town hall meetings and has representatives on hand to field complaints  While villagers fret about the future  many cling to the past  Flora Huamani  39  a mother of four girls  recalled how women used to get together to weave wool from their own sheep into the embroidered black dresses they wear   Those were our traditions   said Huamani from a bench in her walled front yard   Now our tradition is meeting after meeting after meeting  to discuss the community s problems

188785,410301,NEM,5 Gold Mining Stocks Set To Keep Winning Streak Alive In 2020 ,opinion,2019 has been quite an eventful year for gold with the major highlight being the yellow metal crossing the threshold limit of  1 500 an ounce  at levels last seen in 2013  Uncertainty in the U S China trade front  geopolitical concerns between the United States and the Middle East  the Brexit mayhem and concerns over the global economic outlook have compelled investors to seek safe haven investment options like gold Further  three rate cuts by the Fed this year has been favoring the rally  Notably  lower the interest rates  lesser will be the opportunity cost of holding non yielding bullion  making gold an attractive option for investors holding other currencies  A sluggish manufacturing sector also drove the gold prices So far this year  gold prices globally have gained about 15   a striking contrast to the prior year decline of 2   Gold seems set for its strongest annual increase since 2010  wherein it had reported growth of 29 5  Newmont Mining Corporation s acquisition of rival Goldcorp for  10 billion to form Newmont Goldcorp Corporation   NYSE NEM   hogged the headlines in the industry this year  This follows the  5 4 billion merger between Barrick Gold Corporation and Randgold Resources  LON RRS  Limited last year  The trend of consolidation in the industry seems to have revived after a lull over the past few years when the companies were forced to cut debt levels and slash capital expenditure thanks to lower gold prices  Given that gold production is anticipated to drop eventually owing to scarcity of new discoveries and depleting existing resources  miners prefer to build up reserves through acquisitions rather than digging for new ones that are inherently risky and capital intensive Major markets India and China  that roughly account for around 50  of consumer gold demand  continue to sustain demand for gold  The expanding middle class in China and India  and broader economic growth  will have a significant impact on gold demand  Use of gold across energy  healthcare and technology is on the rise  Moreover  the yellow metal has long been considered as a safe haven investment in times of financial or political uncertainty  Emerging market central banks are turning their attention to gold after years of exposure to the U S  dollar  and as a natural currency hedge against other reserve currencies  So  there will be an eventual demand supply imbalance that is likely to drive gold prices  which bodes well for the industry Industry Rides on Gold Prices Rising gold prices bode well for the  industry  which has to contend with escalating production costs including the cost of electricity  wages  water and materials  The industry has outperformed both the S P 500 Index and the Basic Material sector in a year s time  While the stocks in the industry have collectively gained 41 0   the S P 500 and the Basic Material Sector have rallied 27 1  and 23 6   respectively  The group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates bright prospects in the near term  The Zacks Mining  Gold Industry  which is a 33 stock group within the broader Zacks  Sector  currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank  55  which places it at the top 22  of 256 Zacks industries  Our research shows that the

188786,410302,NEM,The Metals Continue To Meander,opinion,"When the metals are in a bear market  metals enthusiasts are frustrated   And  even when the metals are in a bull market  metals enthusiast become frustrated   This is what I have been seeing of late  as the metals are consolidating for their next bullish run 
But  if you trade metals  you know that they actually spend much of their time consolidating   The reason is that their moves are so strong and powerful  they complete quite quickly  while spending the great majority of their time within a consolidation   And that is what I think we are seeing now 
Yet  I don t think we will see the bigger fireworks until 2020  and it may not even be until the 2nd quarter 
5 Wave Rally
Before we are able to confirm a major break out and the potential of a major third wave taking hold  we still need to see another 5 wave rally complete  And  neither of the metals have broken out to suggest even that the initial 5 wave rally is taking shape   While many of the mining stocks we track have clearly begun that rally  such as Newmont Goldcorp  NYSE NEM  and SPDR Gold Shares  NYSE GLD   they have not convinced market participants that their rallies have begun   But I think that is simply a matter of time 
Therefore  we still need to see this smaller degree 5 wave rally completed before we are able to set up the major 1st and 2nd wave for the rally I expect to see in 2020 
So  while the metals take their time before breaking out  I want to take a moment to address a question I get all the time  and that is the  bearish  perspective many derive from the  Commitment of Traders  report   The common argument suggests that as long as the commercial traders are shorting gold heavily  then gold cannot rally   Yet  history suggests otherwise 
If you look at the attached chart for the last 20 years  you will see that during the parabolic rally of 2010 2011 in gold  the commercial traders were heavily short gold   In fact  you can see that during that entire period of time  commercial shorts remained at 200 000 or greater   Yet  that was during a period of time where gold rallied  800   For those counting in percentage terms  that means gold rallied 70   during a time when commercial traders were heavily short gold  
Just as technicals have to be read differently during bull versus bear markets  so does the COT   During bear markets  when the technicals reach an overbought level  it often suggests the market will begin a selling phase   However  in a bull market  when the technicals are overbought  rather than suggesting selling will result  the technicals often embed during the strong advance of a bull market   The same will often happen with the COT   So  applying a linear expectation to the COT data will not often result in the appropriate trading result 
In the near term  GLD  NYSE GLD  must break out strongly through the 139 70 resistance region and silver must break out through the 17 60 region   A break out in GLD should be pointing it up toward the 143 45 region for wave 1 of v of  3   whereas a break out in silver will likely point us to a minimum target of 18 50 for wave  1  of wave  iii     But  as you can see  we will then need one more consolidation in a 2nd wave before the fireworks really begin in 2020   This suggests that the middle of 2020 will likely present us with a potentially powerful rally in the metals market should this set up trigger 
In GDX  NYSE GDX   we still need to take out the micro pivot noted on the 8 minute chart to suggest we have begun the rally for wave  i  of iii of  3  of 3  which is targeting the 30 region before it sees its wave  ii  pullback 
Lastly  and most interestingly  the GDXJ may still be within its wave  iv  of wave i  as shown in the attached chart   I don t think the alternative count has a high probability at this time since this pullback seems to be corrective in nature  But  a break down below 37 25 would suggest otherwise  In fact  at this point in time  if the market has begun its next major rally phase based upon the primary count  I would not expect to break below 37 25 at any point in time  even in the wave ii   But  admittedly  this is not the cleanest or most reliable count  as I don t trust diagonals 






For now  it seems we still will need to have a bit more patience  even if the markets do break out to complete their respective 5 wave structures off the recent lows   We will still likely need another multi week  and maybe as long as multi month  2nd wave pullback before the fireworks are seen   That is the set up for which I am being patient when it comes to trading this market with leverage   Until then  I have no reason to turn overly aggressive   And  most importantly  until then  I suggest we all maintain a modicum of patience

188799,410315,NEM,Gold Mining Stocks  Near Term Prospects Shine Bright,opinion,The Zacks  industry primarily comprises big and small companies that are engaged in gold extraction from mines of widely varying types and scale  Notably  gold mining is a long and complex process  Significant exploration and development to evaluate the size of the deposit followed by assessment of ways to extract and process the ore efficiently  safely and responsibly precedes actual mining  On average  it takes between 10 20 years for a gold mine to produce material that can be refined The mining  processing  development and mineral exploration activities are subject to several laws governing prospecting  development  production  taxes  labor standards and environmental regulation in various jurisdictions in which these companies operate Let us take a look at the three major themes in the industry So far this year  gold prices have gained 15 5  and surpassing the  1 500 an ounce threshold for the first time in six years  Uncertainty over the U S  China trade war  geopolitical tensions and concerns over the global economy have fueled investor apprehensions  which in turn is driving the demand for gold  Further  three rate cuts by the Fed this year has been favoring the rally  Notably  lower the interest rates  lesser will be the opportunity cost of holding non yielding bullion  making gold an attractive option for investors holding other currencies  Rising gold prices bode well for the Mining   Gold industry  which has to contend with escalating production costs including the cost of electricity  wages  water and materials  The  5 4 billion merger between Barrick Gold Corporation and Randgold Resources  LON RRS  Limited last year followed by Newmont Mining  NYSE NEM  Corporation s acquisition of rival Goldcorp for  10 billion to form Newmont Goldcorp Corporation  NEM   has revived the trend of consolidation in the industry  Mining deals had lost momentum in recent years with companies forced to cut debt levels and slash capital expenditure thanks to lower gold prices  Given that gold production is anticipated to drop eventually owing to scarcity of new discoveries and depleting existing resources  miners prefer to build up reserves through acquisitions rather than digging for new ones that are inherently risky and capital intensive  Major markets India and China  that roughly account for around 50  of consumer gold demand  will sustain demand for gold  The expanding middle class in China and India  and broader economic growth  will have a significant impact on gold demand  Use of gold across energy  healthcare and technology is on the rise  Moreover  the yellow metal has long been considered as a safe haven investment in times of financial or political uncertainty  Emerging market central banks are turning their attention to gold after years of exposure to the U S  dollar  and as a natural currency hedge against other reserve currencies  So  there will be an eventual demand supply imbalance that is likely to drive gold prices  which bodes well for the industry over the long haul  Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates bright prospects in the near term  The Zacks Mining  Gold Industry  which is a 32 stock group within the broader Zacks

industry  Meanwhile  demand will remain strong driven by India and China  The technology sector is also driving demand for the yellow metal  Lower mined gold supply  higher demand and geopolitical

188800,410316,NEM,Supercharge Your Gold Position With Precious Metal Royalty Companies,opinion,"Gold closed down as much as 1 21 percent Friday on a blowout jobs report that seemed to alleviate investor fears of an impending economic slowdown  The U S  added as many as 266 000 jobs in November  beating expectations of 180 000  while the unemployment rate ticked down to a 50 year low of 3 5 percent 

The yellow metal remains on sound footing  though  and over the next 12 to 24 months  I see its price advancing further on strong fundamentals  Mean reversion  in particular  is the theme I believe investors should be focused on in 2020 and beyond 

This was the message shared by Bloomberg Intelligence commodity strategist Mike McGlone in a note to investors last week 

The chart below illustrates the 10 year rate of change for gold  the S P 500 and U S  trade weighted dollar  In other words  it shows you how much each asset class has changed from a decade earlier 

As McGlone points out  both the stock market and U S  dollar have recently increased at their fastest pace since the beginning of the millennium  whereas gold s rate of change has slumped after hitting its all time high of  1 900 an ounce in 2011  The law of mean reversion suggests a rerating could occur in the early 2020s 







 The unsustainability of these trends in the third decade is a primary support factor for the dollar price of gold   McGlone writes 

 Unless the greenback and U S  stocks are embarking on a new higher plateau   he adds   dollar denominated gold is poised to take the all time new highs baton  

Here s another way to look at it  The left chart below shows the stock market priced in ounces of gold  while the right chart shows the market priced in gold miners  as measured by the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index  Both bullion and miners are currently below their mean  indicating they re undervalued relative to the market  For mean reversion to take place  either gold will need to soar to new all time highs or beyond  or stocks must tumble  In both cases  holding gold  I believe  is rational and prudent 






Royalty of the Precious Metal Industry

There are other ways to get exposure to gold than coins and bars  of course  One of the best ways to  supercharge  your gold position  I believe  is with precious metal royalty and streaming companies  Think Franco Nevada  Wheaton Precious Metals  Royal Gold and others 

Take a look below  The world s largest royalty and streaming company with a market cap of  25 billion  Franco Nevada has outperformed gold bullion and gold equities in both bull markets and bear markets  Investors who like gold do so because they understand that the yellow metal can limit losses in their equity position and reduce volatility  Adding a royalty company such as Franco Nevada to the mix can be like injecting nitro into your souped up sports car      






This is because while they enjoy a lot of the upside potential when gold prices are rising  royalty companies share very little of the downside potential with producers and explorers when the metal is in decline  Royalty companies are better insulated from bear markets because they have a diversity of high quality active mines in their portfolio 
What s more  they re not the ones spending money to develop a project  They simply put up the capital  and in exchange they enjoy either a royalty on whatever the miner produces or rights to a stream of metal supply at a fixed  lower than average cost 
It s a win win for the miner and royalty company  a win win win if you also include the investor 
To give you an idea of just how profitable royalty companies can be  look at the chart below  courtesy of Katusa Research  What you see is each company s net income  or profit  per employee  Some of the world s most recognizable names are highly profitable  generating around half a million dollars or more per employee after expenses  And then there s Franco Nevada  which makes approximately  3 5 million per employee  or seven times Facebook s net income  It s in a league all its own 







And it s not alone  If Royal Gold were in the S P 500  it would rank second in revenue per employee at  18 4 million  following only Host Hotels   Resorts  NYSE HST   which generated an incredible  30 2 million per employee in fiscal year 2018 

It doesn t hurt that  as of August 2019  Royal Gold had only 23 employees  Compare that to the workforce of major metal producers such as Barrick  NYSE GOLD   18 400 employees   Newmont Goldcorp  NYSE NEM   39 600  and BHP Billiton  NYSE BHP   62 500  
I often recommend the 10 Percent Golden Rule  with 5 percent in physical gold and the other 5 percent in gold equities  But to supercharge your portfolio  I would strongly consider royalty and streaming companies

188811,410327,NEM,Impala prepares hedge fund to bet on commodity rebound,news,"By Lawrence Delevingne
NEW YORK  Reuters    Impala Asset Management is forming a new hedge fund to bet on rising commodities prices  according to a letter sent to clients and seen by Reuters on Thursday 
Impala  a  2 billion stock focused hedge fund manager based in New Canaan  Connecticut  plans to launch the Impala Resource Fund on August 1 with no more than  125 million  according to the note  which was sent out to clients on Wednesday 
Impala leader Bob Bishop expects that there will be an 18 month to 36 month  cyclical commodity rally  and believes the  timing of this opportunity is very soon  according to the note 
The launch comes amid a punishing rout in commodity prices because of slowing growth in China  The price of U S  crude oil has lost more than half its value  copper is down about 30 percent and natgas has dropped by 60 percent over the past two years 
The average hedge fund with an energy biased strategy rose by just 0 4 percent in the five months through May  after losing 1 percent in 2015  according to figures compiled by Chicago based Hedge Fund Research 
The Impala fund will invest in commodities directly and the stocks of mining  energy and industrial companies who benefit from higher commodity prices  according to a person familiar with the fund who was not permitted to speak publicly 
Copper  iron ore  zinc and lumber were all favored by Impala now  the person added 
The fund will be  substantially net long   according to the letter  meaning it will carry additional risk by not using substantial market hedges

188818,410334,NEM,GATA s Powell  Attacks On Gold Silver Are Losing Their Impact,opinion,"By Mike Gleason  

Mike Gleason  It is my privilege now to welcome in Chris Powell  Secretary Treasurer at the Gold Anti Trust Action Committee  also known as GATA  Chris is a long time journalist and hard money advocate  and through his tireless efforts at GATA  he is working to expose the manipulation of the gold and silver markets  Through GATA s work over the years  some important revelations have come to light which quite honestly should concern everyone 

It s great to have him back on with us  Chris  thanks for the time again today  and welcome 
Chris Powell  Oh  thanks as always for your interest  Mike 

Mike Gleason  Well  Chris  we think some people owe you and GATA an apology  You have been making the case for manipulation of gold and silver prices since GATA was formed in 1999  but lots of people dismissed everything you had to say  We now have incontrovertible proof of multiple banks and multiple traders running a decade long scheme to  spoof  prices 

There are guilty pleas and piles of evidence exposing a scheme which involved thousands of bogus trades  We know senior people were training more junior employees on how to rig prices  The Department of Justice is going to prosecute using RICO laws because attorneys there can see this is organized crime  But somehow  it doesn t look like the apologies will be coming anytime soon 

The same people who openly mocked the idea of p rice rigging a year or two ago now want us to believe that this sort of cheating is really just par for the course in any market  Bankers will be bankers   we should just expect they will occasionally cheat a little  They want everyone to know these markets are free and fair for the most part  At this point  I think it s safe to assume that no amount of evidence could persuade them otherwise 

Why do you think people still refuse to acknowledge just how crooked these markets are  Wouldn t most of these manipulation skeptics be better off if the markets were actually free and fair 

Chris Powell  Well  many people in the markets  Mike  and many people in the mainstream financial news media are dependent on ignoring this stuff  If people begin to realize that the markets are so heavily rigged  they re not going to participate in them as much  and certainly  they re not going to pay as much attention to the traditional market analysis that we re provided with people trying to compare chart patterns and drawing lines and waves and everything like that 

Well  if we re really just looking at holograms because people behind the scenes are rigging the markets  people  they re going to lose faith in a lot of businesses and a lot of analysts  And I certainly understand why people are very reluctant to acknowledge this stuff  If they acknowledge it  they re basically admitting that everything they ve been telling people for years has been a lie or at least erroneous 

But we re  of course  enjoying the Justice Department s description of the  JP Morgan Chase   NYSE JPM  metals desk as a criminal organization  and we re enjoying all the indictments of the traders at these big investment banks  But we re the first to admit that we ve been going after bigger game for a long time 

As reprehensible as this market rigging by the investment banks is  we ve been concentrating on the market rigging by governments and central banks  and I think the indictments we ve had so far are probably just a distant reflection of the rigging by the governments and central banks  I think that some of this rigging that has resulted in indictments and convictions is possibly front running of government trades that have been undertaken by the investment banks fronting for central banks and governments 

But it s not the big stuff we re after  We re after exposing the interventions of governments and central banks  particularly in the gold and silver markets  But with all this repo stuff going on  there s no telling if there s any end to their rigging 
Mike Gleason  Taking a step back here for people that may be somewhat new to this issue of this idea of manipulation of the gold and silver markets  give us a brief synopsis of why it is that you believe governments would have an incentive to rig gold and silver prices  suppress the prices  Talk about that if you would 

Chris Powell  Well  gold and silver are traditionally currencies  They re the oldest currencies on the planet  and they compete with government currencies  They also have a powerful impact on the valuation of government currencies  on the price of government bonds  on interest rates  on the price of all other financial assets since financial assets all compete against each other for public investment 

Now  governments for many years have had an interest  and admitted their interest  in controlling the prices of the monetary metals  That s what the gold standard was about  It was governments setting the gold price  Now  back when the government had a gold standard  gold was far more independent in its pricing because the public could pretty much control the gold price by deciding how much it thought government currencies were worth 

That was really before the surreptitious intervention in the markets came about  We ve collected a lot of admissions by central bankers and government officials  things in government archives  memoirs written by central bankers  documents that are on the internet sites of governments showing that the gold price suppression is longstanding Western central bank policy  That s all compiled in our documentation archive at the GATA internet site 

This is policy  This is not a conspiracy theory  We have admissions from various central bankers  Probably the best known one is Alan Greenspan who testified to Congress in 1998 that the purpose of gold leasing by central banks was to keep the gold price down when it was rising  The archives are full of this stuff  and we seldom get challenged on it because it s just so overwhelming 

Mike Gleason  Alan Greenspan is an interesting case study  I don t know that you d call him a whistle blower necessarily  but he s getting advanced in his years  and he s starting to reveal some of the secrets of the central banks  There s a guy who seemed to be somewhat of an advocate for gold before he became the Fed chairman  and then now  after he s been removed from that role or taken a step back from that role and nearing retirement now  it seems like he s sort of back to being a somewhat of an advocate for gold  It s kind of an interesting telltale  Too bad he couldn t have had any of those convictions while he was actually in power 
 mining companies that have long been a disappointment to us when it comes to this effort to reform these markets  When prices are rigged artificially lower  it hurts their bottom line  but with one or two exceptions  the miners have had almost nothing to say on the subject 

Now that banks have been caught running this scheme  we wonder if the miners will finally take some action  They have to be among the biggest victims of these crimes  What do you think  Are they going to step up now and demand some serious reforms  Are you seeing any movement there  Because I know we ve talked with you in the past about this  and you ve always expressed a lot of disappointment about the lack of an uproar among the mining executive community  Any change there 

Chris Powell  I ve not seen any substantial reaction from the gold and silver miners to the convictions and indictments of the investment bank people for spoofing the monetary metals markets  And I understand it  Mike  The problem is the mining companies are afraid  They re afraid of their governments  They re afraid of their banks 
Mining is very probably the most capital intensive industry in the world  It takes hundreds of millions of dollars  sometimes billions of dollars  to discover and put a mine into production  And in doing that  mining companies are totally at the mercy of governments for first  their mining patents  then their environmental regulations and their royalty requirements to governments 
And since the industry is so capital intensive  most mining companies are very dependent on the very biggest banks  And the very biggest banks  of course  are very directly government agents in the markets  Most of them are primary dealers and U S  treasury securities and have very intimate relations with the U S  government  which certainly does not want the monetary metals prices rising uncontrollably and displacing government currencies in the financial system 

The mining companies are terribly vulnerable to governments  They re terribly vulnerable to the investment banks  which are central bank agents  And I understand why they do not want to support GATA  and they don t want to endorse our complaints about the rigging of the markets  because they just figure the governments and their own bankers will come down on them and impair their business  But I would still suggest to them  do you want to die on your feet  or do you want to die on your knees  Because this industry is in a very strange position right now 

I think the objective of central banking and governments is to keep the monetary metals prices at pretty much subsistence level  They don t want the monetary metals miners to go out of business  They need a supply constantly coming into the market  but they don t want the price to be so attractive that people start investing in monetary metals as international reserve currencies and moving out of government currencies  The governments have got the miners at subsistence levels  and I don t think they are very eagerly going to let the miners become substantially profitable in an attractive industry for investment  at least not until the government and central bank rigging is exposed 

Mike Gleason  Well stated there  and certainly  you ve got to really commend a guy like Keith Neumeyer  First Majestic Silver  I know there s maybe one or two others who are kind of sticking their neck out there  You just sort of laid out a very good case as to why a lot of these guys don t do that 

They have a lot to lose  They re beholden to the banks that that loan them money for their projects and  of course  the government who approves their environmental cases and so forth  It s kind of an interesting and difficult situation 

Chris Powell  Neumeyer has been very courageous  and he has put himself at risk  Eric Sprott is another  There are not too many like them  There s a few others  but there s not too many like them 
Mike Gleason  Agreed  Has GATA ever been called to testify  to provide any evidence in any of these criminal cases that are underway  Do you have a sense of whether prosecutors are on the right track 

Chris Powell  We ve provided information to some of the lawyers involved in the class action lawsuits against the investment banks for rigging the monetary metals markets  I don t think we ve had any contact with prosecutors though 

All the documentation we have amassed and publicized is out in the open on the documentation page of our internet site  That s accessible to everybody  I don t know if prosecutors have ever looked at it  I know that the Russian government has been aware of GATA s work since at least 2004 because a Russian central banker in 2004 gave a speech to the London Bullion Market association meeting in Moscow that summer  and the only words of English he spoke were  Gold Anti Trust Action Committee   which was pretty interesting to us because to the best of our knowledge  we d never had any contact with anybody in Russia 

But it turned out the bank of Russia was watching us very closely  We know from the WikiLeaks cables from the U S  Embassy in Beijing to the State Department in Washington that the Chinese government is very aware of gold price suppression by Western central banks because it s often been written about in the government controlled news organizations in China 
And the U S  Embassy in Beijing translated a bunch of those reports and cabled them back to the State Department in Washington  And then when WikiLeaks got a hold of them some years ago  it was revealed that China knows all about the Western gold price suppression scheme and has reported it and complained about it in government publications in China 
The Chinese government knows all about gold price suppression by the Western central banks  and the U S  government knows that China knows all about it because of the WikiLeaks cables of the translations that came from Beijing to the State Department  So  we know that gold price suppression is widely understood on an official basis around the world 

Mike Gleason  Well  as we begin to wrap up here  Chris  summarize the state of the state  if you will  with respect to the likelihood of the metals market manipulation coming to an end one day or at least the progress that s being made on that front  Where are we here  and what are the prospects of finally achieving these free and fair markets that we all want so badly  And are you feeling any better about the possibility of seeing that one day now compared to  say  where you felt two to three years ago 

Chris Powell  Well  I have to admit being surprised that they ve been able to pull it off for at least the 20 years that GATA s been in business  It s been very obvious to us what s been going on  I think we ve had the dispositive documentation in hand for at least 17 or 18 of our 20 years 

I am a little more encouraged over the last five or six months or so because there s an obvious firmness  I think  to the gold and silver markets now  The interventional smash downs of the monetary metals prices are not having the effect they used to have  The central banks used to be able to knock down the gold price by 20  30  40  50 dollars for months at a time 

And they haven t been able to do that lately  I think it s because the central banking cartel has split up on the gold front  We know a whole bunch of central banks have been buying gold lately  The central banks have switched in the last several years from net sellers to net buyers  There s  I think  a lot of circumstantial evidence that China and Russia particularly are buying gold heavily in London 

So  I m encouraged  I suspect we may be in a situation similar to the last months of the London Gold Pool back in 1967 and 1968  similar insofar as back then  the central bank gold cartel was dividing  There was division among the participants in the London Gold Pool 

France wasn t playing along anymore  France started exchanging dollars for gold  and ordinary investment houses began to realize that the gold reserves at the participating banks were being run down and probably could not hold out much longer  I think we re very likely in a similar situation now because central banks are now net buyers instead of net sellers  and they re not telling us everything they re buying 

I m sure China has bought far more than it s reporting  I m hopeful about going on living for a few more years  but I can t guarantee that anybody of my age is going to see the end of gold price suppression  I suspect we will have a day  perhaps not too distant  when the central banks have an international currency revaluation and revalue gold substantially upwards to re liquify themselves after the redistribution of gold reserves around the world  And I think they may begin another half century of gold price control at a much more sustainable level  a much higher price 
Mike Gleason  You do have to be encouraged  just focusing on one thing that you said there  about how they are not getting the result that they used to be able to get when it comes to dragging down the price that they once did  So  they may be losing a little bit of control  and obviously  the whole game is sort of held up by confidence 

Maybe you ve got nations that are going to start to scramble if they do see the end of fiat or the beginning of the end  that maybe there s a mad dash into physical gold  and at that point  all bets are off  Maybe they won t worry about colluding anymore and just fend for themselves 

Chris Powell  There s so much central bank clamor now for devaluation of all the currencies  and there s so much resentment of the weaponization of the dollar  All this is practically screaming for gold and silver  so I am hopeful  Mike 

Mike Gleason  Well  excellent stuff  Chris  We ll leave it there  We certainly appreciate the time and your insights as always  Now  before we let you go though  please tell our listeners how they can get more information and learn more and follow GATA  and then also how they can get involved and maybe even donate to GATA so your organization can continue to fight this important fight

188819,410335,NEM,Newmont Goldcorp  NEM  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"The market expects Newmont Goldcorp  NEM  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on November 5  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This gold and copper miner is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 41 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  24 2  
Revenues are expected to be  3 04 billion  up 76 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 14 33  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Newmont 
For Newmont  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 41  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Newmont will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Newmont would post earnings of  0 23 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 12  delivering a surprise of  47 83  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Newmont doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/newmont-goldcorp-nem-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200479590,200479590

What s Next for Newmont 
While Newmont has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately

Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Newmont was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

It currently includes 45 component stocks  which are weighted in proportion to their market capitalizations  This list is dominated by the world s largest gold miners  and their collective importance to this industry cannot be overstated  Every quarter I dive into the latest operating and financial results from GDX s top 34 companies  That s simply an arbitrary number that fits neatly into the tables below  but a commanding sample 

As of this week these elite gold miners accounted for fully 94 1  of GDX s total weighting  Last quarter they combined to mine 292 0 metric tons of gold  That was 33 3  of the aggregate world total in Q3 19 according to the World Gold Council  which publishes comprehensive global gold supply and demand data quarterly  So for anyone deploying capital in gold or its miners  stocks  watching GDX miners is essential 
The major gold miners dominating GDX s ranks are scattered around the world  21 of the top 34 mainly trade in US stock markets  5 in Australia  6 in Canada  1 in China  and 1 in the United Kingdom  GDX s geopolitical diversity is excellent for investors  but makes it more difficult to analyze and compare the larger gold miners  results  Financial reporting requirements vary considerably from country to country 
In Australia  South Africa  and the UK  companies report in half year increments instead of quarterly  The big gold miners often publish quarterly updates  but their data is limited  In cases where half year data is all that was made available  I split it in half for a Q3 approximation  While Canada has quarterly reporting  the deadlines are looser than in the States  Some Canadian gold miners drag their feet in getting results out 

While it is challenging bringing all the quarterly data together for the diverse GDX top 34 gold miners  analyzing it in the aggregate is essential to see how they are doing  So each quarter I wade through all available operational and financial reports and dump the data into a big spreadsheet for analysis  The highlights make it into these tables  Blank fields mean a company hadn t reported that data as of this Wednesday 

The first couple columns of these tables show each GDX component s symbol and weighting within this ETF as of this week  While most of these stocks trade on US exchanges  some symbols are listings from companies  primary foreign stock exchanges  That s followed by each gold miner s Q3 19 production in ounces  which is mostly in pure gold terms  That excludes byproduct metals often present in gold ore 
Those are usually silver and base metals like copper  which are valuable  They are sold to offset some of the considerable expenses of gold mining  lowering per ounce costs and thus raising overall profitability  In cases where companies didn t separate out gold but lumped all production into gold equivalent ounces  those GEOs are included instead  Then production s absolute year over year change from Q3 18 is shown 
Next comes gold miners  most important fundamental data for investors  cash costs and all in sustaining costs per ounce mined  The latter directly drive profitability which ultimately determines stock prices  These key costs are also followed by YoY changes  Last but not least the annual changes are shown in operating cash flows generated  hard GAAP earnings  revenues  and cash on hand with a couple exceptions 
Percentage changes aren t relevant or meaningful if data shifted from positive to negative or vice versa  or if derived from two negative numbers  So in those cases I included raw underlying data rather than weird or misleading percentage changes  Companies with symbols highlighted in light blue have newly climbed into the elite ranks of GDX s top 34 over this past year  This entire dataset together is quite valuable 




It offers a fantastic high level read on how the major gold miners are faring fundamentally as an industry  The world s larger gold miners certainly thrived in Q3 with much higher gold prices  but they continued to struggle with declining production and rising costs  Still their fundamentals are the best they ve been in years with better gold levels  portending big future gains as gold s bull continues marching higher on balance 




The major gold miners  claim to fame is their stock prices amplify rising gold prices  usually by 2x to 3x  They are essentially a leveraged play on gold  so the only great time to own this sector is when gold is rallying and likely to continue  Gold surged 4 4  higher in Q3 19 after its first  to new bull market highs in 3 0 years in late June  GDX s relative performance was poor  with a mere 4 5  gain in Q3 
That s because gold s strong 32 4  upleg   in this secular bull  peaked in early September  The gold futures speculators who dominate gold s price action were effectively all in longs and all out shorts  their   And as goes gold  so go the gold stocks  So as gold started correcting into late September  GDX  NYSE GDX  was dragged down with it  That cycle timing masked major gains 

Q3 to date by early September as gold crested  GDX had soared 21 1  higher to gold s 10 2   That was normal 2 1x leverage  GDX s entire upleg peaking in early September enjoyed massive 76 2  gains over 11 8 months   That made for better 2 4x upside leverage to gold s 32 4  run  and shows why traders are willing to put up with this sector s considerable risks  When gold rallies  wealth multiplies fast in gold stocks 
Gold s average price last quarter near  1474 was up a stupendous 21 7  year over year from Q3 18 s average   Q3 19 also had the highest prevailing prices of gold s 3 9 year old secular bull by far  trouncing Q3 16 s  1334 and Q1 18 s  1329  So the major gold miners couldn t ask for a better environment to put some big numbers on the fundamentals scoreboard   They re in real trouble if they couldn t thrive in Q3 19 
Before we dig in  the year over year comparisons require some big adjustments  This past year saw epic gold stock mega mergers  In January 2019 the world s second largest gold miner Barrick Gold finished acquiring Randgold  LON RRS  in a  6 5b deal  That briefly made it the biggest gold miner  But arch rival  Newmont Mining   NYSE NEM  wasn t ready to surrender the pole position  so it spent  10 0b buying Goldcorp consummating in April 

Back in mid February I wrote an entire essay  and why they are bad for this sector  That didn t fix these miners  inexorably declining production  just masked it for the first four quarters after the mergers  And the new combined companies have such colossal market capitalizations that their huge inertia retards their upside potential  Their GDX domination weighs on this entire sector 

Together the new NEM and GOLD command fully 21 9  of GDX s capital  as much as the bottom 27 GDX components combined   So when NEM and GOLD underperform because of their own issues  this whole sector lags  If these mega mergers aren t adjusted for  they materially distort comparisons from Q3 18 to Q3 19  So I combined these two sets of companies in Q3 18 as if they had already merged 
Another problem is lazy Canadian managements who don t respect their shareholders  Both Wheaton Precious Metals and Detour Gold were waiting until the last possible day legally to report their Q3 results  45 days after quarter end  That happened to be after this essay s data cutoff of Wednesday evening  So WPM and DGC numbers are excluded from Q3 18 s results to keep year over year comparisons righteous 
In this modern era of fully automated real time accounting systems  there are no excuses for delaying quarterly results and making shareholders wait  Those numbers should be released as soon as possible  when they are fresher  Delaying them only makes traders wonder what those companies are trying to hide  I m more wary of deploying capital in companies that continually drag their feet on crucial reporting 

Production is the lifeblood of gold mining  and the only thing the major gold miners can control  While they are at the mercy of prevailing gold prices  they can grow their outputs through diligent planning and hard work  In Q3 19 these top 34 GDX gold miners without those couple Canadian stragglers produced 9 388k ounces of gold  That was actually down 1 5  YoY from Q3 18 s total  proving an outsized decline 
The major gold miners have long been struggling with relentlessly shrinking production  The world has been scoured for gold for centuries  with the low hanging fruit long since picked  The scale of the major gold miners necessitates they look for large economically viable gold deposits  But those are getting both ever harder to discover and increasingly expensive to develop  So the majors are failing to replace depletion 
According to the World Gold Council s comprehensive data  Q3 19 saw world gold mined drift 0 6  lower YoY  The majors  production shrinkage was 2 5x worse  despite them controlling most of the capital that is available in this sector to bring new mines online   That 0 6  overall retreat was the worst performance in Q3 global gold output in at least 9 years  buttressing peak gold theories  The majors are bearing the brunt 
Investors prize production growth above everything else  so the gold miners growing their outputs are usually the best performers in stock price terms  That s another reason why the majors  stocks almost always well underperform their smaller mid tier peers still able to grow their production  Provocatively the whole decline in the GDX  NYSE GDX  top 34 s production overwhelmingly comes from those mega merged gold miners 

Together the new monster Newmont and Barrick saw their gold production plunge a miserable 9 1  YoY from Q3 18 to Q3 19   Without them  the rest of these GDX top 34 excluding WPM and DGC saw their total gold output surge 6 8  higher YoY  Despite squandering  16 5b of shareholder wealth to combine into behemoths  the mega merged NEM and GOLD are deadweight dragging down this entire sector s gains 

That s the main reason GDX s brother GDXJ mid tier gold miners  ETF is so superior to GDX  It excludes the biggest majors struggling with rapid depletion  enabling larger gains during gold uplegs  Next week I m going to extend this Q3 19 fundamental analysis to the top 34 GDXJ miners like usual  They are likely to see much better collective results than the GDX  NYSE GDX  majors  Smaller miners  growth outpaces depletion easier 

With the GDX top 34 majors  overall production slipping 1 5  YoY thanks to NEM and GOLD  the mining costs crucial for driving profitability should ve risen proportionally  Gold mining costs are largely fixed quarter after quarter  with production generally requiring the same levels of infrastructure  equipment  and employees  These big fixed costs are largely determined during mine planning stages  and don t change much 
That s when engineers and geologists decide which gold bearing ores to mine  how to dig to them  and how to recover their gold  The ongoing mining costs are spread across quarterly production  making gold output and unit costs usually inversely proportional  The richer the gold ores fed through fixed capacity mills  the more gold produced  The more gold mined  the more ounces to bear those big fixed costs 
So lower gold output generally leads to higher unit costs  pinching profits  Thus majors  earnings potential is doubly compromised when their gold production shrinks  They have less gold to sell  lowering profits  And that gold comes at higher costs  cutting earnings even more  The drag Newmont and Barrick are exerting on this sector with such massive production declines is enormous  That s reflected in the majors  costs 
There are two major ways to measure gold mining costs  classic cash costs per ounce and the superior all in sustaining costs per ounce  Both are useful metrics  Cash costs are the acid test of gold miner survivability in lower gold price environments  revealing the worst case gold levels necessary to keep the mines running  All in sustaining costs show where gold needs to trade to maintain current mining tempos indefinitely 
Cash costs naturally encompass all cash expenses necessary to produce each ounce of gold  including all direct production costs  mine level administration  smelting  refining  transport  regulatory  royalty  and tax expenses  In Q3 19 these top 34 GDX component gold miners that reported cash costs averaged  679 per ounce  That was a new high out of the 14 quarters I ve run this research thread now  since Q2 16 
Those cash costs were up a sharp 7 6  YoY  far worse than inversely proportional to lower production  Barrick Gold was one of the culprits as its cash costs soared 21 0  from Q3 18  since Randgold  LON RRS  which it bought was a high cost producer  South Africa s Harmony Gold also saw cash costs surge to a crazy  1027 per ounce  The once world leading South African gold mines are deteriorating with each passing year 
But despite gold majors  higher cash costs  that  679 per ounce average was still far below Q3 19 s great average gold price of  1474  So the gold miners  including the higher cost ones  are certainly facing no existential threats  That sharp 21 7  YoY gain in average gold prices gives the major gold miners lots of breathing room on the cost front  They can also mine lower grade ores that previously weren t profitable enough 
Way more important than cash costs are the far superior all in sustaining costs  They were introduced by the World Gold Council in June 2013 to give investors a much better understanding of what it really costs to maintain gold mines as ongoing concerns  AISCs include all direct cash costs  but then add on everything else that is necessary to maintain and replenish operations at current gold production levels 
These additional expenses include exploration for new gold to mine to replace depleting deposits  mine development and construction expenses  remediation  and mine reclamation  They also include the corporate level administration expenses necessary to oversee gold mines  All in sustaining costs are the most important gold mining cost metric by far for investors  revealing gold miners  true operating profitability 
These GDX top 34 gold miners reported average AISCs of  910 in Q3 19  That was up 3 7  YoY  and also the highest average AISC read seen in those 14 quarters of doing this deep fundamental research  Barrick Gold again led the way  with its AISCs soaring 25 4  YoY thanks to its ill advised mega merger  But AISCs generally rose across all these majors  which averaged hefty 8 0  YoY gains on that front 

That s certainly not a problem given the high prevailing gold prices though  Compared to that huge 21 7  average gold price gain in Q3 19  3 7  higher all in sustaining costs are minor  And  910 per ounce isn t much higher than the previous 4 quarters   889 average among the GDX top 34  As long as gold price appreciation far outpaces rising production costs  the gold miners  great profits leverage to gold remains intact 
The contrast between Q2 19 and Q3 19 on this sector s potential earnings is vast  Gold only averaged  1309 in Q2  which implied major gold miner profit margins of  414 per ounce at that quarter s average AISCs of  895  The very next quarter after in Q3  that  1474 average gold price coupled with that  910 average AISC yielded  564 in implied profits  That s up a staggering 36 2  sequentially quarter on quarter 

That amplifies the average gold price s 12 6  QoQ gain by 2 9x  which is excellent profits leverage  In year over year terms  the major gold miners  implied profits growth was even more amazing  Q3 18 saw average gold prices of just  1211  while the GDX top 34 s AISCs averaged  877  That left room for just  334 per ounce of earnings  In Q3 19  that exploded 68 9  higher YoY   Talk about epic profits growth 
Such huge gains are fantastic absolutely  but also relatively  Overall US corporate earnings have actually been shrinking  making gold miners look all the more impressive  In Q3 19  the 500 elite companies of the flagship US S P 500 stock index saw their overall profits decline about 2 5   So investors ought to seek out any earnings growth  and the numbers the major gold miners are putting up are phenomenal 

In wading through the GDX majors  quarterlies this past week  another serious problem became evident  Hedging   Investors and speculators buy gold stocks because they want to leverage gold s gains  But some gold miners  particularly the Australian ones  are substantial to heavy hedgers  They have sold big fractions of their future gold outputs  and most of those hedges are way underwater after Q3 s big gold surge 
While Aussie gold miner reporting is limited for Q3s since it is done on half years  Saracen Mineral Holdings did publish its ugly hedge book  SAR produced 96 3k ounces of gold in Q3 19  but 80 0k of that was delivered to close out hedges at an average price of A 1863 per ounce  That translates into US 1278  13  below Q3 s US 1474 average gold price   That robbed SAR shareholders of almost all their due gains 
SAR s hedgebook continues out for the coming 12 quarters  with the next 4 committing 51 0k ounces at A 1866  47 0k at A 1859  48 5k at A 1809  and 45 0k ounces at A 1827  That means SAR will have to sell about half its production at US 1280  US 1275  US 1240  and US 1253 over the next 4 quarters  That is assuming Q3 19 s average exchange rates persist  Hedging locks in big losses during gold bull uplegs 
So with gold powering higher again after that several year hiatus  it is more important than ever to look into the hedgebooks of any gold miner you are interested in  Hedging sells away gold s future upside potential  and is incredibly irresponsible  Gold miner shareholders own these stocks because they want to ride gold s bull higher  Managements that choose to materially hedge destroy that  avoid them like the plague 

As you d expect with Q3 19 s far higher prevailing gold prices  the hard GAAP accounting results of the GDX majors were impressive  Their total revenues without those Canadian stragglers soared 31 8  YoY to  12 2b last quarter   That is even still outsized considering average gold s 21 7  YoY gains and the GDX top 34 s 1 5  total production decline  Those mega mergers help explain that sales outperformance 
When Barrick and Newmont gobbled up 2 large peers  it made room for 2 new gold miners to rise into the GDX top 34 ranks  These gold majors  operating cash flow generation in Q3 19 was massive  soaring an incredible 56 7  YoY to  4 7b  The more capital their operations spin off  the more they can spend on expanding existing mines and building or buying new ones  Strong OCFs are crucial for future growth potential 

The major gold miners wasted no time in spending that cash windfall too  funding operational upgrades  Their collective total cash hoard declined 5 6  YoY to  10 8b without WPM and DGC  Interestingly much of that came in NEM and GOLD  where total cash fell 7 7  YoY  The rest of the GDX top 34 saw a more modest 3 7  decline in their treasuries  Last quarter s greatest financial results came on the bottom line 
The GDX top 34 gold majors  total GAAP profits in Q3 19 weighed in at an astounding  5 3b  which was radically higher than Q3 18 s  566m loss   That s certainly an epic sector turnaround  But this comparison is muddy  as bottom line earnings also include unusual charges and gains in addition to normal operating profitability  We can adjust for the biggest of these to get a clearer picture of how the majors are faring 
Q3 18 s low average gold prices led to several major impairment charges  writing down the carrying value of mines on companies  books  Newmont  Barrick  and Yamana Gold wrote off  366m   431m  and  89m in last year s comparable quarter  Add those back in  and the GDX top 34 gold miners earned a lot closer to  320m in Q3 18  Q3 19 swung to the other extreme  with monster one time gains shunted into profits 
In this just finished reporting quarter  NEM and GOLD reported mind boggling  2366m and  1852m gains on revaluing gold mines for a joint venture in Nevada they are doing   GOLD had an additional  872m gain on reversing an impairment charge  Yamana had a  273m gain for selling a mine  while Centerra Gold wrote off  231m due to problems getting sufficient water at one of its gold mines  Those are big numbers 

Net all that out  and the GDX top 34 s GAAP earnings in Q3 19 were closer to  170m  That implies their actual operating profitability somehow plunged about 47  YoY last quarter   That is shockingly bad  but oversimplified  Once again the real problem is Newmont and Barrick  with their colossal mega merger net income distortions  Excluding them alone  the rest of the GDX top 34 s profits were  689m in Q3 19 
That was up massively from their  54m loss in Q3 18  The moral of this story   These new monster gold miners resulting from those mega mergers are really retarding the rest of this sector  Their production is rapidly shrinking  their costs are rising  and they are really damaging their shareholders  potential returns  They would be far better served owning smaller mid tier gold miners actually able to grow their outputs 

GDX contains plenty of great gold miners  but its overall upside potential is greatly impaired by the largest major gold miners that dominate it  They continue to struggle to grow their production  so smart investors seek out smaller mid tier and junior gold miners with superior fundamentals  While some are included in GDX  their relatively low weightings greatly dilute their potential gains  A simple example illustrates this 
NEM is GDX s largest component with a massive 11 1  weighting  In Q3 its gold production fell 8 1  YoY  pushing AISCs 6 5  higher to  987 per ounce  Meanwhile GDX s 34th largest component Torex Gold is just 0 7  of that ETF  But in Q3 its gold output soared 36 1  YoY  driving its AISCs 30 2  lower to  675 per ounce  Naturally TXG s stock price radically outperformed NEM s during gold stocks  latest upleg 

Between mid August 2018 to early September 2019  TXG rocketed 171 6  higher   But in roughly this same span  NEM was a total dog rallying a mere 38 4  at best  Imagine how much mightier GDX s big 76 2  upleg would ve been had ailing mega miners like Newmont not been weighing it down  Both investors and speculators alike can do far better picking superior individual gold stocks than settling for GDX 
To multiply your capital in the markets  you have to trade like a contrarian  That means buying low when few others are willing  so you can later sell high when few others can  In the first half of 2019 well before gold stocks soared higher  we recommended buying many fundamentally superior gold and silver miners in our popular  and  newsletters  We later realized big gains including 109 7   105 8   and 103 0  
To profitably trade high potential gold stocks  you need to stay informed about the broader market cycles that drive gold  Our newsletters are a great way  easy to read and affordable  They draw on my vast experience  knowledge  wisdom  and ongoing research to explain what s going on in the markets  why  and how to trade them with specific stocks   and take advantage of our 20  off sale   Get onboard now so you can mirror our coming trades for gold s next upleg after this correction largely passes 
The bottom line is gold majors generally did report outstanding results in Q3 on much higher prevailing gold prices  Revenues and operating cash flow generation soared  but earnings were distorted by many large one off items  Overall the major gold miners  implied profitability based on the average gold price and their average all in sustaining costs blasted higher  which portends far better fundamentals going forward 

But GDX continues to be weighed down by the largest gold miners  which are still seeing rapid production declines even after their insanely expensive mega mergers  That leaves smaller mid tier gold miners with superior fundamentals far more attractive for future upside potential  As gold s breaking out secular bull continues powering higher on balance in coming years  the mid tiers will enjoy the lion s share of the gains ",2019-11-17,Adam Hamilton,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold-miners-q3-19-fundamentals-200485827,200485827

188874,410390,NEM,Newmont Goldcorp  Assessing The Outlook For This Gold Stock,opinion,"Goldhas proven an extremely popular investment over time  Investors are drawn to its  safe haven  status  meaning it tends to outperform equities in harsher economic times  and during other times of market volatility  This can be accomplished via investing directly in gold  either physically or through an exchange traded fund like the GLD  NYSE GLD  
It can also be accomplished by investing directly in gold stocks  which tend to see outsized moves in their earnings based upon metal prices  This can create opportunities for bold investors that are willing to stomach some volatility to grab an undervalued mining company when things aren t going to plan 
This dynamic works both ways and in times of strong gold price performance  such as what we are seeing now  gold companies tend to overshoot to the upside as well  That s where we find Newmont Goldcorp Corp  NYSE NEM  as it has rallied enormously in the past three months or so  and as a result  we find it to be quite overvalued 
In this article  we ll take a look at Newmont Goldcorp s recent financial results  its prospects for future growth  and its total return outlook 
Recent Financial Results
Newmont Goldcorp is the product of a very recent merger between  Newmont Mining   NYSE NEM  and Goldcorp  The mega merger in the mining industry created a behemoth with a  33 billion market capitalization that generates about  10 billion in annual revenue  The combined company can trace its lineage back to 1916 and has been publicly traded since 1940  Newmont Goldcorp is now the world s largest gold producer by reserve value  market value  and production 
Newmont Goldcorp reported second quarter earnings on July 25th  2019  and results showed strong growth thanks to the merger  Revenue came to  2 26 billion  a 36  increase compared to last year s Q2 when the companies were still independent  Gold product rose to 1 59 million ounces   a gain of 37  year over year   and all in sustaining costs were  1 016 per ounce  which is quite high 
Goldcorp s production costs negatively impacted Q2 s production costs  but it provided a sizable increase to the number of ounces mined as well  Newmont Goldcorp is attempting to mitigate some of this increase in costs with a cost savings program  Even so  the company s all in sustaining cost number was very close to last year s Q2 
Average realized price for gold was  1 317 in Q2  an increase of  25 per ounce over the comparable period last year  Copper prices fell substantially to  2 48 per pound  while silver average realized price was  14 20 per ounce  Given recent price action in silver and gold  we d expect Q3 s average realized prices to be much better than they were in Q2 
Newmont Goldcorp ended the quarter with  1 8 billion in cash on hand after returning  590 million to shareholders  resulting in a leverage ratio of 1 5X net debt to pro forma adjusted EBITDA following the merger  The company noted it also paid down  1 25 billion of legacy Goldcorp debt at the time of transaction close 
In total  adjusted net income came to  0 12 per diluted share  which was less than half of what the company earned in last year s Q2  However  because of the merger  results aren t necessarily directly comparable  There are significant transaction and integration costs built into Q2 s number  as well as non merger items such as fair value changes  gains on asset sales  and reclamation and remediation charges on legacy sites 
Growth Prospects
Newmont Goldcorp s earnings per share have been predictably volatile over time as the company grapples with constantly shifting production costs  as well as unpredictable metal prices  Of course  this isn t unique to Newmont Goldcorp by any means  but it is still very much a large component of the company s outlook 
We forecast 5  annual earnings per share growth following the closing of the merger  much of which depends upon metals pricing  Obviously  Newmont Goldcorp has little control over the prices it sells its metals for  but it does have control over other factors that we see driving earnings growth 
The company has significant development projects in its pipeline  which should drive better volumes over time  The volume benefit of the merger produced a huge boost in volumes in Q2  which we will certainly see in the next three quarters as well 




The merger is seeing the combined company struggle with costs  but over time  we expect that to mitigate somewhat  Indeed its  Full Potential  program has already achieved in excess of  2 billion in improvements since it was introduced in 2013  which is part of the company s focus on long term value creation 
Source  Investor presentation  page 21
That should help with growth as production costs should fall gradually over time  but the company is also targeting six to seven million ounces of production over the long term  This is counter to some other miners which try to pull as much metal from they ground as they can over a short time frame  Newmont Goldcorp is building for sustainability  and we think that is an attractive trait for a miner 
While results will certainly be lumpy over time  we see Newmont Goldcorp as having one of the more favorable outlooks among the miners  We like its focus on long term sustainability  its focus on cost savings  and its enormous size and scale following the merger
Total Returns
Unfortunately  this is already priced into the stock  Newmont Goldcorp trades for 31 times this year s earnings estimate of  1 30  which is 147  of our fair value estimate of 21 times earnings 
Given the 1 4  dividend yield  our estimate of 5  earnings per share growth  and a  7  headwind from the valuation  Newmont Goldcorp stock is projected to deliver negative total annual returns in the coming years  The recent rally in the stock has made it untenably expensive  and we suggest that investors interested in owning the stock wait for a sizable pullback before initiating a position 
Final Thoughts
Newmont Goldcorp has a bright future in the mining industry following its mega merger earlier this year  The company s fundamentals are strong  but the share price has risen too high based upon the company s earnings  The current upcycle for metal prices has sent Newmont Goldcorp s valuation to an unsustainable level  and therefore investors should avoid the stock on valuation concerns ",2019-09-01,Modest Money,https://www.investing.com/analysis/newmont-goldcorp-assessing-the-outlook-for-this-gold-stock-200460631,200460631
188875,410391,NEM,Safe Haven Gold  Time To Take Profit Or Add To Your Portfolio ,opinion,"Investing in gold is a pure bet on the economy  The precious metal hit a six year high this month as central banks globally eased their monetary policy to deal with the slowdown in growth triggered by the U S  China trade war 
The events of the past six months have supported a bull run in gold  which is considered a safe haven asset during times of economic turbulence  The U S  and China trade dispute escalated  the European economy slowed  Brexit became ever messier and tension in the Middle East flared up after the attacks on the largest oil producing nation  Saudi Arabia 





These macro setbacks raised the possibility of a recession and forced the U S  Federal Reserve to start cutting interest rates  On Sept  18  the Fed acted again and lowered the borrowing cost by another quarter of a percentage point  to a range of 1 75  to 2  
Encouraged by these signals  gold bulls moved their cash to gold and silver miners  sparking a rally in mining stocks  BlackRock s iShares MSCI Global Gold Miners  NASDAQ RING   has returned almost 14  in August  more than any other unleveraged stock fund in the U S   data compiled by Bloomberg show 





Gold at a Record High 
Going forward  however  the big question for investors in gold assets is whether this rally has legs  or we are at the peak of this bullish trend  According to a recent note by Citigroup s analysts  the outlook for gold is quite healthy as they see a possibility of prices rallying to a record above  2 000 an ounce in the next two years That rally  according to analysts including Aakash Doshi will be supported by drivers such as the rising risk of a global recession and the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will reduce U S  interest rates to zero  We expect spot gold prices to trade stronger for longer  possibly breaching  2 000 an ounce and posting new cyclical highs at some point in the next year or two   they said  If that level was reached  it would exceed the record of  1 921 17 set in 2011 But the risks to this bullish scenario are equally strong  Both U S  and China are back at the negotiation table in October and the markets are returning to normal on hopes of a resolution to their dispute On the economic front  the U S  economy is still showing signs of strength  helped by robust consumer spending  and strong job creation  That was the main reason why the Fed failed to signal that more cuts were coming  FOMC officials are divided over whether more cuts will be needed  with some of them thinking Wednesday s change was itself a cut too far 
Gold Stocks to Buy
In this highly uncertain economic environment  it s probably not a bad idea to keep some exposure to gold in your portfolio  If the gold rally is sustained and prices continue to climb higher  gold miners who have taken steps to cut costs and capital expenditures over the past few years stand to benefit the most  making them an attractive alternative in any long term portfolio 
In this group  we like Newmont Goldcorp  NYSE NEM   now the world s largest gold miner  and the Canadian producer Barrick Gold  NYSE GOLD   These are among the producers who learned a hard lesson during the metal s last bull surge 





Prices in the spot market reached a record  1 921 17 in 2011  but the rally collapsed quickly as historically low interest rates and quantitative easing by central banks fueled gains in the equity market and economic growth accelerated  By the end of 2015  prices had tumbled about 45  
Now that bullion is back in favor  many miners are playing it safe by going for organic growth and optimizing existing assets  They ve gone through sustained cost cutting  debt reduction and boosts in productivity after the last slump to lure back investors 
The shares of Newmont  at  39 30  are up about 14  this year  while Barrick Gold had surged 38  to  18 17 
Bottom Line
Investing in gold linked stocks  such as BlackRock s Gold Miners ETF  NYSE GDX  or top gold miners  is a risky proposition due to many opposing dynamics that could push the precious metal in either direction  That being said  gold s haven status is intact and it can provide a great hedge when other assets are plunging  In the current uncertain economic environment  the precious metal offers a prudent way to diversify your risk and add some safety to your portfolio ",2019-09-20,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/safehaven-gold-time-to-take-profit-or-add-to-your-portfolio-200466431,200466431
188878,410394,NEM,Pierre Lassonde Says Gold Could Hit  25 000 In 30 Years,opinion,"This year marked the 30th anniversary of the Denver Gold Forum  DGF   the world s most prestigious precious metal equities investment conference  The invitation only event  held last week  was attended by an incredible seven eighths of the world s publicly traded gold and silver companies by production  as well as leading metals and mining executives  money managers  analysts and investors 
Much has changed in the precious metals and mining industry in the past 30 years  as we were all reminded by my longtime friend and mentor Pierre Lassonde  Pierre  as many of you know  is the legendary co founder  along with Seymour Schulich  of Franco Nevada  the first publicly traded gold royalty company  What you may not know is that Pierre is also one of Canada s most gracious philanthropists and currently serves as the chairman of the Canada Council for the Arts Board of Directors 
According to Pierre  annual global gold demand has exploded in the years since the first DGF was held  Demand grew more than fivefold  from a value of  32 billion in 1989 to  177 billion in 2018 

Today s central banks are net buyers of gold as they seek to diversify away from the U S  dollar  But 30 years ago  they were net sellers  In 1989  banks collectively unwound as much as 432 tonnes from their reserves  Compare that to last year  when they ended up buying some 651 5 tonnes  the largest such purchase since the Nixon administration  with Russia and China leading the way 





Speaking of China  Pierre pointed out to us that we ve seen a significant shift in gold demand over the past 30 years  from west to east  as incomes in China and India or  Chindia  have risen  In 1989  Chindia s combined share of global demand for the precious metal was only about 10 percent  Fast forward to today  and it s 53 percent 

 Don t forget the Golden Rule   Pierre said   He who has the gold makes the rules  
The Gold Price In 2049 Will Be 
One of the highlights of Pierre s presentation was his forecast for the price of gold in the next 30 years  After analyzing gold s historical compound annual growth rate  CAGR  over the past 50 years  ever since President Nixon formally took the U S  off the gold standard  Pierre says he sees an average price target of  12 500 an ounce by 2049  And under the  right  conditions  it could go as high as  25 000 





 I think gold is in a good place   Pierre told Kitco News  Daniela Cambone on the sidelines of the DGF   The financial demand is being driven by negative interest rates  Should the U S  Treasury 30 year bond yield ever  ever go negative  like in Germany and France  God bless  we re looking at  5 000 gold  
ESG Investing Goes Mainstream
One of my own observations of how the DGF has changed over the last 30 years is the way in which mining companies pitch their stock to investors  Before  they would jump right into financials  production costs  mining feasibility and the like  Today  however  they begin by discussing topics such as sustainability and environmental impact 

ESG investing stands for environmental  social and governance  This set of criteria has grown in importance among  socially conscious  investors over the past decade  as you can see in the chart below  In the U S  alone  assets under management  AUM  in ESG oriented funds and ETFs have more than doubled from approximately  40 billion in 2013 to  90 billion in 2019  according to Morningstar data  In Europe  where institutional investors and money managers must now comply with certain ESG standards  the figure s likely even higher 




Gold s  Green Credentials  May Be Understated  RBC
The good news is that gold and gold mining look very attractive from an ESG perspective  Gold s  green credentials   in fact  may be understated  according to a recent report by the Royal Bank of Canada  RBC   For one  owning physical gold in coins  bars or jewelry has absolutely no environmental impact and actually increases a portfolio s ESG rating 

As for gold mining  the process gives off significantly less greenhouse gasses  GHG  on a per dollar basis relative to some other mined products  including aluminum  steel  coal and zinc  What this means is that gold has a much smaller  carbon footprint  than what some people might think 





Many mining companies are also working to meet some investors  changing attitudes   IAMGold   TSX IMG   for instance  is investing heavily in solar infrastructure  and its mine in Burkina Faso is the world s largest hybrid solar thermal plant  according to RBC  Newmont Goldcorp  NYSE NEM  is moving forward with its  Smart Mine Initiative   which uses optimizer software to maximize ore recovery and minimize waste  And Torex Gold  TSX TXG  has developed what it calls the  Muckahi Mining System   which alleges to limit surface disruption and reduce the use of fossil fuels underground

188905,410421,NEM,Newmont Goldcorp  NEM  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  Should You Buy ,opinion,"The market expects Newmont Goldcorp  NEM  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 25  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This gold and copper miner is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 24 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  7 7  
Revenues are expected to be  2 26 billion  up 36 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 10 9  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Newmont 
For Newmont  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 84  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination indicates that Newmont will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Newmont would post earnings of  0 26 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 33  delivering a surprise of  26 92  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss

1  Newmont Goldcorp  June Gains  15  
Newmont Goldcorp  NYSE NEM   the new gold giant created after the merger of Newmont Mining and Goldcorp was completed in April  is the world s largest gold producer by market value  output and reserves  Shares  which have gained around 19  over the past month  closed at  38 05 last night after hitting a fresh 52 week high of  38 72 

The company ended the first quarter of 2019 with roughly  3 5 billion of cash in hand  while net debt declined to  800 million from roughly  1 billion in the year ago quarter  as it successfully streamlined business operations within the newly merged entity 
We anticipate the positive trend in Newmont Goldcorp to continue thanks to its world class portfolio of assets anchored in favorable gold mining regions in North America  South America and Australia 
The corporation is well placed to benefit from the recent spike in prices of the yellow metal  It expects attributable gold production of 5 2 million ounces in 2019 and the all in sustaining costs of producing the precious metal to be  935 per ounce for 2019 

2  Barrick Gold  June Gains  29  
Shares of Toronto based Barrick Gold  NYSE GOLD  the world s No  2 gold miner  have been on a tear lately  rising 34  over the past month  The stock hit a 52 week high of  16 44 yesterday before ending at  15 95

In addition  the recent merger with Randgold Resources completed in September 2018 has put it in control of half of the world s top 10 gold mines  Taking all this into consideration  Barrick Gold remains a good bet going forward as rising gold prices and ongoing cost cutting efforts are likely to boost the bottom line in the quarters ahead

188926,410442,NEM,Newmont  NEM  Hits 52 Week High  Can The Run Continue ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Newmont Mining  NEM   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 12 4  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  38 91 in the previous session  Newmont Mining has gained 11 9  since the start of the year compared to the 15  move for the Zacks Basic Materials sector and the 30 3  return for the Zacks Mining   Gold industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on April 25  2019  Newmont reported EPS of  0 33 versus consensus estimate of  0 26 while it missed the consensus revenue estimate by 2 29  
For the current fiscal year  Newmont is expected to post earnings of  1 41 per share on  9 52 billion in revenues  This represents a 4 44  change in EPS on a 31 31  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  1 73 per share on  11 45 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 22 23  and 20 25   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Newmont may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Newmont has a Value Score of C  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are B and B  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 27 4X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 10 7X versus its peer group s average of 9 3X  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Newmont currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Newmont passes the test  Thus  it seems as though Newmont shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term 
How Does Newmont Stack Up to the Competition 
Shares of Newmont have been soaring  and the company still appears to be a decent choice  but what about the rest of the industry  Some of its industry peers are also impressive  including Kinross Gold  KGC   Golden Star Resources  GSS   and Gold Fields  GFI   all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least  2 and a VGM Score of at least B  making them well rounded choices 
The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 32  of all the industries we have in our universe  so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for Newmont  even beyond its own solid fundamental situation ",2019-07-03,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/newmont-nem-hits-52week-high-can-the-run-continue-200437094,200437094
188927,410443,NEM,Why Newmont  NEM  Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider Newmont Goldcorp  NEM   This company  which is in the Zacks Mining   Gold industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
When looking at the last two reports  this gold and copper miner has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates  The company has topped estimates by 50 42   on average  in the last two quarters 
For the most recent quarter  Newmont was expected to post earnings of  0 26 per share  but it reported  0 33 per share instead  representing a surprise of 26 92   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  0 23 per share  while it actually produced  0 40 per share  a surprise of 73 91  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Newmont lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Newmont has an Earnings ESP of  1 45  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on July 25  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-07-08,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-newmont-nem-could-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200438160,200438160

188967,410483,NEM,Why The Earnings Surprise Streak Could Continue For Newmont  NEM ,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering Newmont Mining  NEM   which belongs to the Zacks Mining   Gold industry 
This gold and copper miner has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 61 96  
For the most recent quarter  Newmont was expected to post earnings of  0 23 per share  but it reported  0 40 per share instead  representing a surprise of 73 91   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  0 22 per share  while it actually produced  0 33 per share  a surprise of 50  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Newmont  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Newmont has an Earnings ESP of  11 14  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on April 25  2019 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-04-02,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-the-earnings-surprise-streak-could-continue-for-newmont-nem-200403629,200403629

188972,410488,NEM,What s The Second Best Performing Asset Since 1999 ,opinion,"Last week the world got its first look ever at a black hole  one of those cosmic bodies so supermassive and powerful that not even light can escape its pull  These things literally destroy all matter that comes within their reach  making them the trash compactors of the universe 
Some of you reading this right now can probably point to a few investments you made over the years that had more in common with black holes than you would care to admit 
Gold  I m happy to say  is not among those investments  despite all the negative press it sometimes gets  The evidence keeps rolling in that the yellow metal has historically been a wise investment  Because it has a negative correlation with the market  gold has helped investors diversify their portfolios and improve their risk adjusted returns  Back in January  I shared several charts showing how the price of gold has beaten the market over several time periods  including the 21st century  so far  
Take a look at the chart below  using data released last week by JPMorgan  NYSE JPM   For the 20 year period ended December 31  2018  gold as an asset class had the second best annualized returns at 7 7 percent  Only REITs  real estate investment trusts  did better at nearly 10 percent 
The S P 500  by comparison  returned only 5 6 percent on an annualized basis  but that s after it underwent two huge pullbacks that greatly impacted performance  Bonds which include Treasuries  government agency bonds  corporate bonds and more came in next at 4 5 percent  Not bad  considering the asset class has lower overall volatility and risk than equities 
In last place is the  average investor  with a lackluster 1 9 percent 
Everyday Investors Have Lagged The Market By A Wide Margin
Surprised  You shouldn t be  Quantitative analysis of investor behavior  conducted by research firm DALBUR  has shown time and again that everyday retail investors regularly lag the market  in good times and in bad  by an alarmingly wide margin  Last year they lost approximately 9 42 percent  or more than twice as much as the S P did 
This is due mainly to bad timing  Instead of taking a buy and hold approach and riding out short term volatility  many investors tend to sell at the absolute worst time  And that s often after missing the rally and buying at the peak 
I shouldn t have to tell you that this strategy  if it can be called that  is like a  black hole  for your money 
Don t get me wrong  Trading can be fun and sometimes very profitable  But it s not investing  If you insist on trading  I believe it s still crucial to maintain a sizeable allocation in high quality stocks and bonds  exercise discipline and allow your investment to compound over time 
Ray Dalio Remains A True Believer In Gold
Someone who follows the Golden Rule  with his own and other people s money  is Ray Dalio  the billionaire founder of the world s largest and most successful hedge fund firm  Bridgewater Associates  Last year the firm s flagship Pure Alpha strategy delivered an incredible 14 6 percent gain  compared to  average  investors  return of negative 9 42 percent  remember   This was not only Bridgewater s best performance for the year since 2011  but it also helped keep Dalio atop the list of the most profitable hedge fund managers 
If you drill down into Bridgewater s SEC filing for the fourth quarter of 2018  you ll find that Dalio holds significant positions in gold across all tiers in the industry  These positions include physical gold  via SPDR Gold Shares  NYSE GLD  and the iShares Gold Trust   senior gold miners  Barrick Gold  Newmont Mining  Goldcorp  etc    junior gold miners  Yamana Gold  B2Gold  New Gold  etc   and gold royalty and streaming companies  Franco Nevada  Wheaton Precious Metals and Royal Gold  
As many of you know  I like to get access to the precious metal market with royalty companies  Back in January  Paradigm Capital showed that this small group of companies crushed all other tiers in the gold mining industry  delivering an unbelievable 16 percent in compound annual growth from 2004 to 2018  That s Ray Dalio caliber performance 
Dalio Sounds Off On Capitalism
While on I m the topic of Dalio  the multibillionaire recently had some choice words to say about capitalism  In a lengthy post on LinkedIn  NYSE LNKD   which you can read here  Dalio shared his belief that it is no longer working as it should for most Americans  As such  he argues  capitalism must be  reformed  
In one of the more eye opening segments of his essay  Dalio says that political divisiveness and the widening  opportunity gap  in the U S  is creating what he sees as eerie similarities between now and the late 1930s  
Disparity in wealth  especially when accompanied by disparity in values  leads to increasing conflict and  in the government  that manifests itself in the form of populism of the left and populism of the right and often in revolutions of one sort or another  For that reason  I am worried what the next economic downturn will be like  especially as central banks have limited ability to reverse it and we have so much political polarity and populism   This definitely isn t cheerful bedtime reading  I m not asking you to agree with Dalio here he doth protest too much  methinks but if his thoughts resonate at all with you  I believe it s even more reason to make sure you re invested in gold 
Central Banks Continue To Gobble Up Gold
On a final note  the price of gold crossed above  1 300 an ounce again last week following news that China increased its gold holdings in March for the fourth straight month  The People s Bank of China raised reserves to 60 62 million ounces  or 1 885 tonnes  as trade tensions between the U S  and the Asian giant continue to drag on  This puts it on course to overtake Russia and Kazakhstan  the top buyers of the yellow metal in 2018 
China wasn t alone  however  Global central banks bought a net 51 tonnes of gold in February  the largest monthly increase since October 2018  according to a recent report by the World Gold Council  WGC    Central banks  gold holdings have grown by 90 tonnes in the first two months of the year  compared with 56 tonnes in the same period in 2018  and the highest level of growth since 2008    writes the WGC s Krishan Gopaul   This shows that collectively  central banks mostly from the emerging markets continue to accumulate gold at a healthy pace

188973,410489,NEM,Earnings Preview  Newmont Mining  NEM  Q1 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Newmont Mining  NEM  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 25  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This gold and copper miner is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 26 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  25 7  
Revenues are expected to be  1 85 billion  up 1 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 10 81  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts

Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Newmont 
For Newmont  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Newmont will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Newmont would post earnings of  0 23 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 40  delivering a surprise of  73 91  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Newmont doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-newmont-mining-nem-q1-earnings-expected-to-decline-200408322,200408322

 JAKARTA  July 21  Reuters    Indonesia Stock Exchange wants
several foreign owned natural resources firms and state owned
enterprises to list  in a bid to lift market capitalisation and
liquidity and woo investors  the exchange head said on Tuesday 
 Ito Warsito  who took over as president director earlier
this month  said he would encourage U S  mining giants Freeport
McMoRan Copper   Gold Inc  and Newmont Mining Corp to list their
Indonesian units  which he estimated would be worth billions of
dollars 
  Our objective is to increase market capitalisation  from
1 500 trillion to 3 000 trillion rupiah   299 billion    with 
the listing of the companies that exploit natural resources in
Indonesia   and the  listing of state owned companies   Warsito
told Reuters in an interview 
  Of course it depends on government support for that because
 the exchange  cannot push or make regulation that they have to
list  It is the government who has the power  
 Indonesia has some of the world s largest deposits of gold 
nickel  tin  coal and copper  but foreign involvement in the
natural resources sector has become a sensitive political issue 
with calls for foreign firms to sell stakes to the government 
 Freeport  which operates the huge Grasberg copper and gold
mine in Papua  eastern Indonesia  has come under attack in the
past  while Newmont was ordered by an arbitration court in March
to reduce its stake in an Indonesian unit which was recently
valued at  3 52 billion 
 In some cases when foreign firms were obliged to divest
shares to the government  the finance ministry did not take up
the offer  which analysts said was because it lacked the funds 
Foreign firms then had to turn to the private sector 
 Multicapital  which local media reported is a subsidiary of
coal miner PT Bumi Resources  has formed a joint venture with
three local governments to purchase a stake in Newmont s local
unit  Newmont Nusa Tenggara  Bumi is controlled by the family of
Indonesia s welfare minister Aburizal Bakrie 
 But  Warsito said that by listing their Indonesian
operations on the exchange  foreign companies may find it easier
to meet the requirements to reduce their stakes while increasing
local ownership  He said that some institutions and some members
of the government support this plan for divestment 
  There are parties in the government that are interested in
this solution  but I don t say that all branches of the
government agreed on that   he said 
 Warsito also said he would push for the government to list
more of the state owned enterprises  including lender Bank
Tabungan Negara  BTN   national carrier Garuda Indonesia 
Krakatau Steel  oil and gas giant Pertamina s various
subsidiaries  and plantations firms 
 He said he would also address the concerns of foreign
investors over the lack of adequate hedging instruments by
re launching various derivatives contracts  including stock
options and futures contracts  and would push for
demutualisation of the exchange 
  We already have  had  discussions with several stock
exchange members  Perhaps next year we can relaunch the futures
contract  stock futures   he said

188983,410499,NEM,Softness In Gold Just A Blip  Buy These 4 Stocks Instead ,opinion,Gold prices rose to a 10 month high on Feb 19 on the back of concerns related to global economic slowdown and weakness in U S  dollar  However  gold prices have wobbled since then  as has the U S  dollar  As it stands  gold is priced at  1 317 an ounce after an abrupt ending to President Trump and North Korea s Kim Jong un summit in Vietnam sparked a safe haven buying spree Though volatile  investors speculate that the yellow metal will witness a decline in value in the near term  However  such weakness  if any  is only momentary as global economic fluctuations and inflated equity valuations are likely to boost gains for gold in the long run  It is therefore advisable to invest in gold at this point Global Outlook for Gold in 2019 Remains PositiveThe impacts of global economic and political dynamics over the past two years are largely expected to be felt in 2019  There has been an increase in the adoption of protectionist trade and economic policies by major economies across the globe  Needless to say  such practices contribute to an increase in volatility in the markets On Jan 21  the International Monetary Fund  IMF  reduced its global economic growth forecasts 2019 to 3 5  from 3 7  in October  Likewise  global growth projection for 2020 was reduced to 3 6  from 3 7  in October  marking the second reduction in the last three months On Feb 6  the European Commission lowered its 2019 growth projection for the 19 member Eurozone from 1 9  in November to 1 3   Moreover  both Germany and Italy  the two largest economies of the Eurozone  are likely to face several headwinds in 2019 Further  equity valuations continue to remain high across the world  Such developments point toward an increased likelihood of a world wide recession  Therefore  there will be a surge in demand for gold in 2019 as a hedge against global financial risks Fed s Slow Rate Hike Approach to Benefit GoldExperts are of the view that the yellow metal is likely to face severe headwinds from higher interest rates and strength in the greenback  However  the Fed has indicated a more controlled approach toward hiking interest rates this year  which means that gold will surge in the long run  During an appearance at the Economic Club of Washington  D C  in January  Powell confirmed that the central bank won t be hasty in hiking rates this year  Moreover  minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee s meeting held in January were released on Wednesday Minutes of the meeting showed that officials from the Fed remained divided on the need to hike interest rates  A group of officials argued that a hike in interest rates would only be necessary if inflation levels turned out to be higher than the initial baseline forecast Market watchers widely expect that the Fed would hold interest steady in its next meeting in March  Per the   the probability that the Fed will keep its rates unchanged in the range of 2 25  2 5  at its upcoming meeting stands at 97 4  4 Best ChoicesTo make an estimate about gold s movement in the near future is dependent heavily on the prevalence of risk  strength weakness in U S  dollar as well as structural economic reforms  It is not difficult to gauge that in the current scenario all these factors indicate that gold is going to be in huge demand

188984,410500,NEM,Gold s Healthy Pullback Could Help It Spring Up ,opinion,"Cue Willie Nelson from back in  67 as we open straightaway with  Turn out the lights the party s over  They say that all good things must end    Which is what Gold s 24 week parabolic Long trend just did  the nearly six month ascent ranking third by duration since 2001  Price settled yesterday  Friday  at 1295 for its worst weekly drop   2 7   since that ending 28 November 2014   2 9      THUNK   
To wit as we herein penned a week ago     we have to think the  Baby Blues   our measure of daily trend consistency  are suggestive of the precious metals getting a case of the blues such that Gold s parabolic Long trend now 24 weeks old shall likely soon fold     And so it did  And  tis a good thing 
 A good thing  mmb    
Absolutely right  Squire  Now pay attention  With Gold starting this past week still well up in the 1330s  we began thinking that a correction in price would be healthy as nothing ascends upward in perpetuity  We ruminated that a nice pullback toward testing the mass of underlying technical support would provide enough tightened coil to then spring price back upward beyond the most recent high of 1349  20 February   once again giving Gold a shot at reaching Base Camp 1377   Tis our sense that such process now is underway  first this  thunk      consolidate     and then back up  Remember  a recapturing of 1377 with a stabilizing of price  round there  and then  tis off toward our conservative forecast high  now for the second year running  at 1434  That s why this  thunk  is a good thing  That said  the pretty picture of Gold s weekly bars instead now sports its first red dot blemish since 07 September 

Too  we ve emphasized in recent missives that in spite of the lengthy duration of this just concluded up run  it didn t cultivate the upside percentage punch that has characterized similar multi month up moves  To wit in the above graphic  the ascent was not enough to rotate the dashed regression trendline across the entirety of the chart from down to up  But if you ve been keeping up to date with The Gold Update  you know that since 2001 there ve only been two such up trends of longer duration  which brings us to this neat bit  the 25 week Long stint  ending 31 December 2004  was followed by only 10 weeks of parabolic Short trend before resuming upward     and the 26 week Long stint  ending 23 December 2005  was followed by a mere three weeks of Short trend before again flipping back to Long  Given Gold s support now here in these otherwise annoying Whiny 1290s    and in turn the thick support slab of The Box  1280 1240     price can gather itself together through these ensuing weeks in prepping for the next upside launch 
Also  it now being month s end  plus one trading day   let s go from this time a year ago with Gold s percentage track along with those of several key precious metals equities  And with Newmont Mining  NYSE NEM  opening its jaws for Goldcorp  GG  for  10 billion     notwithstanding Barrick Gold instead opening its jaws for NEM for  18 billion     we ve removed GG from our graphic and per a fine friend s recommendation replaced it with mighty Pan American Silver  PAAS   And here s how they compare  best to worst  across the last 12 months  Franco Nevada  FNV  is  5 5   the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners exchange traded fund  NYSE GDX  is  0 6   Gold itself is  1 8   NEM is  11 3   the Global X Silver Miners  NYSE SIL  is  12 5   and PAAS  sometimes ya gotta start last  is  17 3   So why highlight PAAS 

Fundamentals aside and notwithstanding our usual disclaimer that  We re not a stocks person   let s take a layman s look at a few common sense numerical measures for PAAS  From one year ago to date  the average price of PAAS relative to Silver  i e  the PAAS Silver ratio  is a pristine 1 00x  But at present  tis only 0 83x  That gives a tip of arbitrage leverage to PAAS right there  But wait  there s more  from one year ago to date  the average Gold Silver ratio is an uncannily high 81 75x  But at present  tis higher yet at 85 02x  More leverage  And more broadly  we ve the millennium to date average of the Gold Silver ratio at only 64 02x  Leverage upon which one can live  PAAS  all time high came on 14 March 2008 at 44 10  Then from December 2010 into April 2011 PAAS teased the lower 40s on multiple surges  And yet today finds PAAS at a comparatively meager 12 69   Course then there s First Majestic Silver  AG   but as we confided in our friend  one first must  paas  muster before becoming  majestic   Ok  you can bring out the hook 
Moving right along  with January  February and a day of March in 2019 s books   tis time to bring up our BEGOS Markets Standings  again featuring Oil well on top of the stack  Things that make the world go are leading the show  with all the safe havens being left back on the rack 

But then from the  Party Crasher Dept   comes the Economic Barometer  Have you noticed its decline stretches all the way back to last June and yet the so called brightest of economic bulbs out there are only recently suggesting things might be slowing down  Where were they throughout the latter half of 2018  Speaking of down  that s what this market leading tool is telling us   as continues to be the suggestion of the unsupportive Moneyflow data and our  live  S P price earnings ratio of 30 6x   Tick tick tick tick tick    

Now zooming in on near term Gold  as mentioned off the top  a week ago the  Baby Blues  which denote linear regression trend consistency were not looking very healthy  And we thus see the ensuing fallout here on the left in the panel of Gold s daily bars from three months ago to date     that s called takin  a bona fide header  No surprise therefore that on the right in Gold s 10 day Market Profile we find price down in the bargain basement of The Whiny 1290s 

As for poor ole Sister Silver  she remains in that trap wherein when Gold goes up  she kinda goes up  but when Gold goes down  she really goes down  On the left  Silver s  Baby Blues  and on the right her Market Profile  From kinda pretty to     in a heartbeat     really ugly 

Finally  we turn to Gold s broad structure by the monthly bars since 2011 s All Time High at 1923  a level which we firmly say  by some conservatively so  shall be revisited  We don t expect such to occur this year  but when it comes  it could well so do quite swiftly  Remember the trading activity from the 1600s down through the 1400s was comparatively sparse  not a pure  gap  mind you  but forget thee not the trader s axiom that  All gaps get filled   Technically we ve Gold now having entered a healthy corrective mode  And fundamentally we ve so many Gold positives they could fill  and have filled many  a book  Here s the Structure 

Willie opened for us with the party being over  now Roy Orbison closes it out from back in  64 with  it s over  it s Over  it s OVER  But all that s just in recognition of Gold s podium worthy 24 week parabolic Long trend having reached its end  Rather  for those of you who understand the Gold Story  the real upside is only beginning ",2019-03-03,Mark Mead Baillie,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold-goes-thunk-and-tis-a-good-healthy-thing-200394230,200394230

188989,410505,NEM,The Hidden Decline Of The Gold Mining Industry That No One Is Talking About,opinion,"There s been a hidden decline in the global gold mining industry unrecognized by most investors  It s an insidious and mysterious decay that has plagued the industry for many years  Unfortunately  investors can t see what s occuring in the gold mining industry because they are unable to notice the subtle changes taking place over decades as the market is focused on quarterly results 
Thus  the adage   the frogs are slowly cooked to death  fits here perfectly 
However  we really can t blame investors as they have been trained to look at short term results rather than the longer term fundamental trends  Furthermore  the overwhelming majority of investors don t read the gold companies  financial reports  and I would bet that only a small handful actually go back more than a few years 
I am probably one of the few crazy people out there who enjoy reading over gold company annual reports that were published 20 30  years ago  While most individuals may find this type of detailed research boring as hell  I am quite fascinated  And the information in this article will reveal an industry that is being devasted by the slow and agonizing impacts of the Falling EROI   Energy Returned On Investment 
For those new to reading my work  simply put  the Falling EROI is nothing more than the decline in vital net energy for the global economy  The United States was producing oil in the 1930s at a staggering 100 1 EROI  Thus  the oil industry delivered 100 barrels of oil to the market for the energy cost of one barrel  By 1970  this fell to 30 1 and today  the U S  Shale Oil Ponzi Scheme is producing oil at less than 5 1 EROI 
Please don t confuse oil profits with falling net energy  While declining net energy results in falling profits for the oil industry  the worst impact is that it will eventually bankrupt the global economy  More on that in future articles 
The Falling EROI has had a direct impact on the gold mining industry  especially since the 1970s  By looking at the data from the gold mining companies  annual reports  we can see how the investor has  unknowingly   been sacrificed to keep the gold mining industry afloat 
To understand how the gold mining industry has declined  we need to take a look at how capital investment has changed over the past 50 years 
As The Falling EROI Declines  Gold Capital Expenditures Surge
There is an interesting relationship between the Falling EROI and the increase of capital expenditures in the gold mining industry  For example  Homestake Mining  the largest gold mine in the United States in the 1970s  invested only 6  on capital expenditures  CAPEX  versus their total revenues in 1979 

In 1979  Homestake spent  14 3 million on CAPEX compared to the  235 million in total revenues  While this was one of their best years  due to the very high gold price  we can see that in 1975  with a much lower gold price  the CAPEX percentage to total revenues was only 5 8   So  this ratio didn t change that much as the gold price shot up to new highs 
However  if we compare the peak years of Homestake Mining in 1978 1979  I did not have 1980 data   to that of the top three gold miners peak in 2011 2012  the evidence points to a huge increase in CAPEX spending to total revenues 

What a difference ah  While Homestake was only investing 6  of its total revenues on CAPEX in 1978 1979  Barrick  Newmont  and AngloGold during 2011 2012 forked out 33   or one third of their total revenues on CAPEX spending  Thus  the top three gold miners spent more than five times the CAPEX per revenue ratio than Homestake Mining during the peak gold price years 
The reason is simple  As the gold mining industry transitioned from underground to open pit mining to increase production  ore grades fell and this how a dramatic impact on the cost of doing business  Not only did CAPEX spending skyrocket  so did costs all across the board 
To simplify the chart above  I took the total revenues for Barrick  Newmont  and AngloGold for 2011 and 2012 and came up with an average of  10 3 billion   10 344 million  for those two years  I then calculated an average of their total CAPEX spending of  3 4 billion  which equaled 33  of the companies  total revenues 
Now  while it is true that Barrick made some lousy investments and wasted a lot of investor money on projects that didn t pan out  Pascua Lama  for instance  I found that the average CAPEX to total revenues for the entire decade of 2009 2018 for these top three gold miners was 25   Either way you look at it  the gold mining industry CAPEX spending per total revenues quadrupled since the late 1970s 
However  a troubling sign has emerged over the past few years as the gold miners have decided to cut back on capital expenditures to increase cash flow to make their shareholders happy  According to my calculations  the top three gold miners CAPEX to total revenues in 2018 was only 18   Thus  the falling percentage of CAPEX spending will not allow these gold miners to increase or replace production in the future 
How The Gold Mining Industry Sacrificed Their Shareholders To Continue Business As Usual
I will provide two charts below that show how the gold mining industry sacrificed its shareholders to fund the business model and increase production  The first chart hits the gold mining investor right between the eyes  If you were a gold investor in Homestake back in 1978  it only took 34 shares of the company stock to produce one ounce of gold  However  twenty years later in 1998  that amount increased to 52 shares per oz of gold production in the top three gold miners 

As we can see  the company shares per ounce continued to rise to 87 in 2008 and then nearly doubled to 163 in 2018  While some of these companies instituted stock splits  the majority took place before 1997 and didn t impact the figures above all that much  Regardless  the gold mining industry resorted to diluting shares in order to fund operations and grow production  Unfortunately  even with the increased CAPEX spending and share dilution  production at the top three gold miners has declined by nearly 4 million oz since 2012 
Top 3 Gold Miners Production 2012   16 9 Million oz
Top 3 Gold Miners Production 2018   13 0 Million oz  23  decline 
While gold mining investors have been negatively impacted by share dilution  this is only one part of the unhappy story  If we consider the dividend payouts to investors  the next chart puts the icing on the cake 

If we go back all the way to 1929  an investor in Homestake Mining enjoyed a whopping  7 a share dividend  So for every share you owned  you received  7  While the dividend Homestake paid fell to  2 a share in 1979  it was more than double the average  0 90 per share paid by the top three gold mining companies to investors at the peak in 2012  Unfortunately  things aren t doing that well for the gold mining industry as the average dividend per share fell to  0 27 last year 
Of course  if the gold mining industry is going to dilute shares  then even if it paid the same total dollar amount in dividends  the price per share would fall  But  there is one shining bright spot in the bunch  and that is Newmont Mining  NYSE NEM   Newmont paid the highest amount of dividends per share at  0 56 in 2018  Basically  we can thank Newmont for the bringing up the average of the group to  0 27 last year  Here are the dividends per share for each of the top 3 gold miners 
Newmont 2018 Dividend per share    0 56
Barrick 2018 Dividend per share    0 19
AngloGold 2018 Dividend per share    0 06
As we can see  AngloGold has the lowest dividend per share at a measly 6 cents  Moreover  Newmont s gold production has held up the best in the group since 2012 as it has only fallen 7  versus a 13  drop for AngloGold and a stunning 40  cliff dive for Barrick 
If we look over the data in this article  there has been a hidden decline in the gold mining industry over the past several decades  Due to the Falling EROI  it now takes a great deal more capital expenditures to produce gold than it did 40 50 years ago  Thus  the gold mining industry has sacrificed the investor shareholder to fund business and grow production 
However  the massive amount of CAPEX spending by the top gold miners that took place during the peak price years hasn t increased production  or at least  keep it stabilized  As I mentioned  the gold mine supply from the top three has declined nearly 4 million oz since 2012  with the most coming from Barrick 
Unfortunately for investors  they can t see what s happening in the gold mining industry because they are mostly focused on short term results  While a substantial increase in the gold price will push the gold mining shares up significantly  it s been a difficult road for investors as the industry has been negatively impacted by the Falling EROI 
The insidious decline of the gold mining industry  and the global economy   due to the Falling EROI  is something not discussed by analysts or investors  There tends to be this notion that growth will continue forever  as well as business cycles  For example  one of the solutions to the massive debt in the system is to back the Dollar and global currencies with gold  While this sounds like a viable solution  it doesn t consider the most important factor  ENERGY 
I will be writing more articles on the folly of focusing on  SUPERFICIAL INFORMATION  rather than the fundamental energy data  And  if you think the gold mining industry s increase of CAPEX spending to offset the Falling EROI is bad  wait to you see what s happening in the U S  shale oil industry  Talk about an utterly clueless industry in regards to the energy analysts failure to disclose the massive decline rates and inevitable collapse of the Shale Oil Ponzi Scheme

188990,410506,NEM,Goldcorp And Exposure That Come With Gold Mining Shares,opinion,"Money manager Adrian Day reviews the latest developments in the Goldcorp acquisition saga  noting as the story unfolds  insiders quietly line their pockets 
Newmont Mining Corp   NYSE NEM  is proceeding with its bid to acquire Goldcorp Inc  NYSE GG  after Barrick Gold Corp  NYSE GOLD  made an unfriendly bid for Newmont Mining Corporation  NYSE NEM   Barrick  which only recently acquired Randgold  LON RRS  to vault to  1 in the rankings of largest gold companies in the world  launched the bid after talks to merge its and Newmont s Nevada assets talks which have been on and off again for the past 20 years failed  and Newmont bid for Goldcorp  Barrick has made it plain it does not want Goldcorp  hence the timing of its bid  It is also possible that the hostile move is an attempt to focus Newmont s mind on a meaningful alliance of their Nevada assets on Barrick s terms 
Goldcorp  as its detractors mockingly call it  agreed to sell itself at a measly premium at a time when its stock was trading at a price not seen since early 2002  We are still holding Goldcorp because if the merger with Newmont succeeds  the stock should see a bounce  It has already jumped from the  9 70 price at the time of the bid  and in a good gold market  the combined company should see investor interest  As a standalone company  Goldcorp continues to offer mediocre returns  In the latest quarter  EBITDA  earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  was down  despite the higher gold price  largely on high G A  general and administrative  costs 
Barrick and Newmont have synergies  while Goldcorp offers none However  a Barrick Newmont merger is clearly the superior move  given the tremendous and real  synergies that exist in such a hook up  mostly  but not only  in Nevada  Barrick estimates cost savings of  7 1 billion over the next two decades  with just under  5 billion from Nevada  There are simply no real synergies in a Newmont Goldcorp merger  one of the reasons analysts have been lukewarm  Initially  Newmont estimated costs savings from a merger of  100 million  and after analysts called this a  rounding error  for a company of that size  Newmont said that after looking more carefully  they think they can save  200 million  Excuse me for being skeptical  but this nice big round number hardly gives the appearance that a sharp pencil has been used in this exercise 
So  either Barrick will gain control of Newmont not as unlikely as many seem to think  given that Barrick s key shareholders also own large positions in Newmont leaving Goldcorp at the altar  or Newmont will acquire Goldcorp  leaving Barrick with the option to continue with its hostile bid  but of the combined company 
Large payments In the meantime  Goldcorp insiders are making sure they gain big time if the acquisition goes through  We have already discussed that  according to the Shareholders  Gold Council  failed CEO David Garofalo could receive as much as CA 11 million in payments  in addition to his bloated salary  while shareholders have lost 26  during his watch  Let me be clear  I understand executives joining a company may want some security  I also have no problem with rainmakers being well rewarded  but for success and not for failure 
Now the information circular supporting the Newmont bid  released Thursday  shows that another 25 officers of Goldcorp will receive change of control payments  The company estimates these will total over  33 million  not counting freebie stock and options 
Reward for a job well done  But grossest of all is a  lump sum payment retirement allowance  made to chairman Ian Telfer   In contemplation of the Arrangement  to be acquired    Telfer and the company agreed to almost triple his payment from  4 5 million to  12 million  U S  dollars   The rational is that when the payment was approved in 2006  it was not indexed to inflation  The circulate blithely notes that  other than his salary and  annual freebie shares  Mr  Telfer did not receive any other benefits from Goldcorp   My heart goes out to him 
Since 2006  shareholders have lost two thirds of their investment  Shareholders  investments were not indexed to inflation  And other than a miniscule dividend  less than 1    shareholders have  received no benefit  from Goldcorp  either 
To triple Telfer s payment right before the acquisition is one slap in the face too many  an insult to shareholders  We intend to vote against the merger with Newmont if this payment is not rescinded  We have no voice in these payments  so this is our only way to make our position clear 
Shareholders vote with the money Is it any wonder that generalist investors look at this space and steer clear  seeing these shenanigans against a background of stock prices lower today than at the beginning of the bull market  despite a quintupling in the gold price  Twenty years ago  hardly a generalist fund small cap  large cap  value or growth did not have exposure to gold mining shares  Today  hardly any does  Is it any wonder

189007,410523,NEM,Why Is It So Important That Central Banks Are Buying Gold  ,opinion,"There is an old Yiddish expression called a bubbe meise  pronounced my seh   I guess the closest English interpretation of this expression would be a grandmother s tale  or in the common vernacular  an old wives  tale 
Of late  I am seeing a bubbe meise about the importance of central bank buying of goldso  and it is making its rounds on websites all over the internet 
We have been hearing for many years about how gold is supposed to soar because countries and central banks are buying the precious metal  Most of the fundamentalists in this market are convinced that this is a bullish signal  In fact  one article I read explained that central bank buying  is significant  as central banks are the  smart money  given their influence on global economics and access to non public information  
And  all I can think is that this writer does not know their history 
All we heard between 2011 to 2014 was how bullish the gold market was because China and India were buying huge amounts of gold  Yet  gold topped at the time when central banks began their huge buying spree in 2011 and continued down for years during this buying spree   Smart money  indeed 
So  unfortunately  the facts do not support the commonly accepted proposition which seems to be making the rounds  In fact  historically  it is more common to see countries selling their gold at the bottom rather than buying 
From 1999 2002  Great Britain sold about half of its gold reserves  But guess what happened after the sales  Yes  gold began its parabolic climb from just below  300 an ounce to over  1 900 within nine years  In fact  that bottom in gold became dubbed the  Brown Bottom   named after Gordon Brown  the U K  chancellor of the exchequer  who made the decision to sell the gold at that time 
You see  governments are usually the last actors within a sentiment trend  Think about it  Aren t governments enacting new laws to protect investors at the end of bear markets   after all the damage has already been done  So  it is not unreasonable to believe that governments would be the last sellers to the market to conclude a bear market  Moreover  it is common to see them as buyers when markets are near some form of high  such as they seem to have done during 2011 2014  And this is why I was awaiting news of a government selling its gold reserves to represent the culmination of a selling trend several years ago 
Back in 2015  I read an article noting that Venezuela could be selling more than 3 million ounces of gold reserves before year end  The country had more than  5 billion in maturing debt and interest payments due before year end without the ability to repay it 
While the 12 million ounces of gold sold by Great Britain at the  Brown Bottom  is clearly more than the 3 million ounces that Venezuela was considering selling  recognize that Great Britain s proceeds from its sale were estimated at around  3 4 billion  whereas the Venezuela sale would have likely netted around  3 billion 
Additionally  back in 2015  the major players within the gold market turned bearish  At September s Denver Gold Forum in 2015  a panel of gold industry experts came to a consensus that gold is still overvalued and would likely fall below  1 000  perhaps to around  800  Moreover  at the LBMA LPPM gold conference in Vienna  an expert panel discussion on gold came up with almost an identical consensus  The panel also expected that gold will drop to below  1 000  and perhaps to  800 or less 
Again  more  smart money  
In fact  based upon the sentiment exhibited in the media  as well as in my charts  I noted at the time 
These recent events somewhat bolster my argument that the bottom to this market may be closer than most believe  and it may not drop as deep as many believe  As the next  and final  decline takes hold  we will be able to pinpoint the target more accurately  But I have been having strong doubts about whether gold will actually break below  1 000 with so many believing it is almost a certainty  Remember what happened back in 2011 when almost everyone  other than yours truly  believed that it was a virtual certainty that gold was going to exceed  2 000  As the late Yogi Berra would say  this might be  deja vu all over again  
And  in the last quarter of 2015  we rolled out a Miners Portfolio service at Elliottwavetrader net  and started buying mining stocks for the first time since 2011  In fact  one of our first purchases was Barrick Gold  NYSE GOLD  when it was in the  7 region  A little over 3 years later  and even after a multi year correction in the complex  the stock is still up 85  and poised to run higher  How many stocks do you know of which have been up 85  in the last 3 years  even after a multi year pullback 
I was also on the phone with Doug Eberhardt the night that gold hit its final lows putting in my final buying order  as I expected we were hitting the bottom that night  To this end  Doug actually posted 
I can attest to your accuracy on actually buying both gold and silver from us as close to the bottom as one could 
Then  in January of 2016  it was announced that Venezuela sent  1 3 billion worth of gold bars to Switzerland  according to data from the Swiss Federal Customs Administration  In fact  it seems that the Central Bank of Venezuela had reduced its gold holdings in 2015 by 25   and this is even before hearing about this transfer in 2016  Again  are we supposed to believe this is  smart money  action 
To add to this bottoming evidence  in early 2016  it became known that the Bank of Canada sold all the rest of its gold  Yes  you heard that right  Clearly  we have more evidence of  smart money  activity  At the time  I noted that  I would consider this akin to the  Brown Bottom  which marked the bottoming of gold back in 2002   I further noted that  while 2002 became known as the  Brown Bottom   2016 may yet become known as the  Maple Leaf Low  
So  I am going to let you in on a little secret at this time  If you want to know what is going to happen in the metals complex  it is not the central banks buying you want to watch  Right now  I would be watching Newmont Mining  NYSE NEM  very closely  As long as it remains below 34 29  it still has potential to strike lower lows below those seen in 2018  However  should you see it break out over that level  it will confirm for me that a bottom has been struck  and we are on the verge of a strong rally about to take hold in the complex ",2019-02-21,Avi Gilburt,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-is-central-bank-buying-of-gold-so-important-200390553,200390553

189012,410528,NEM,Will Barrick And Newmont Create A Gold Monster ,opinion,"Barrick wants to buy Newmont  Trump wants a deal with China  Palladium wants to fly into space  And what does gold want 
Do you remember our January 24  2019 edition of the Gold News Monitor  We analyzed in that report the historic transaction in the bullion industry  i e  the Newmont Mining s  NYSE NEM  purchase of Goldcorp  NYSE GG   which will create the world s largest gold miner  Forget it 
Today  we have something better for you  Yesterday  Barrick Gold Corporation  which is the largest gold mining company  announced that it has made a proposal to the Newmont Mining Corporation  the second largest gold producer  to merge  The proposal assumes that each Newmont shareholder would receive 2 5694 Barrick shares per Newmont share  so the value of the proposed acquisition is at around  18 billion  So far  it seems that Newmont shareholders received the news about the proposal much better than Barrick s shareholders   just look at the stock market price reactions displayed in the chart below 
Chart 1  Barrick s stock price return  blue line  and Newmont s stock price return  orange line  over the last month 

The combination of the two would create  the world s best gold company  with unprecedented potential for value creation  and  the largest portfolio of Tier One gold assets   according to the Barrick  The merged company would have revenues of approximately  15 6 billion  total gold reserves of 141 million ounces and a market capitalization at almost  52 billion  based on today s share prices  more than three times larger than Franco Nevada  TO FNV   its nearest rival  What a golden beast 
However  nobody knows whether the deal comes to fruition  It is conditional on Newmont scrapping the deal to buy Goldcorp  And Newmont s top team seems to be skeptical  describing Barrick s proposal as  desperate and bizarre   In a statement published yesterday  the company said 

Newmont has previously determined that Barrick s risk and return profile is inferior on many fronts  including factoring Barrick s comparatively ineffective operating model  poor track record on delivering shareholder returns and unfavorable jurisdictional risk

What it certain is that the proposal is just another sign of the continuing consolidation in the precious metals sector  And this is not without significance  not only for people investing in gold mining stocks but also for bullion investors  This is because the consolidation in the bullion industry usually occurs around gold bottoms  For example  the last big wave of M A took place in the late 1990s  just at the end of the bear market in gold  And we have just heard about another acquisition proposal in the industry in recent weeks   so maybe something  read  gold s bottom  is in the air 
Will The Trade Wars End  Will It Support Gold 
Maybe  After all  the Fed has turned dovish recently  which should be supportive for the yellow metal  And now not only Powell but also Trump is extending a helping hand  What we mean here  of course  is Trump s announcement that he would delay a hike in tariffs on Chinese imports  It s a sign that the end of trade wars is not very far from us  After all  the president needs a deal before the next year s elections  Neither China wants escalation  as the country faces many domestic problems 
As trade wars were positive for the US dollar and negative for the gold market  we explained this in the December edition of the Market Overview   their conclusion should bring reverse effects 
Chart 2  Gold prices  London P M  Fix  from January to October 2018 

Just look at the chart above  Between April and September  where trade wars were the most intense  gold significantly declined  Thus  gold bulls should welcome all positive news about the trade deal  Unless  they will be too positive and spur too strong risk appetite which is usually negative for safe havens assets

189032,410548,NEM,Why This Billionaire Just Bought Gold For The First Time In His Life,opinion,"Billionaire Sam Zell just announced that he bought gold for the very first time in his life because  as he puts it   it is a good hedge   In a recent Bloomberg interview  the Equity International founder and creator of the real estate investment trust  REIT  admitted to seeing an opportunity in gold s increasing supply shortage 
 For the first time in my life  I bought gold because it is a good hedge   Zell  77  told Bloomberg   Supply is shrinking  and that is going to have a positive impact on the price  
He added   The amount of capital being put into gold mines is at most nonexistent  All of the money is being used to buy up rivals  
I believe Zell s reasons for investing in gold are sound  and I ve discussed them in detail a number of times before  Supply is indeed shrinking  The  low hanging fruit  has likely already been mined  and it s become prohibitively expensive for many companies to look for large scale deposits  to say nothing of developing them  As you can see below  the number of ounces in major discoveries has been falling for years  and exploration budgets are still far below the 2012 peak   
We Believe Supply Demand Fundamentals Look Constructive As if to confirm Zell s reasoning  the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce  CIBC  forecast in a report this week that a gold deficit will emerge in 2019  on the back of stronger demand over the next two years  primarily from bar hoarding  net central bank buying and exchange traded products  ETFs    Peak production  according to the bank  will occur in 2021 at close to 34 million ounces  but then decline to under 16 million ounces by 2030  Demand isn t abating  though  We re seeing appetite grow for the precious metal  not just from investors but also central banks  which have been net buyers since 2010  According to CIBC  several central banks stepped back into the market last year  most notably the Reserve Bank of India  RBI   which until recently  has expressed negative sentiment around gold purchases  
CIBC raised its gold price forecast this year to  1 350 an ounce  up from  1 300  The bank is also looking for  1 400 an ounce in 2020 
But These Gold Miners Could Be Even More Effective as a Store of Value As attractive as I think gold bullion looks right now  there could be some incredible opportunities in gold equities  which are extremely discounted compared to the S P 500 Index 
And in an article dated January 22  Bloomberg analysts David Stringer  Ranjeetha Pakiam and Danielle Bochove point out that a good place to look for gold equities could be mid sized producers  which have outperformed both bullion and the entire global mining industry  For the 12 month period as of January 18  four miners in particular Kirkland Lake Gold  NYSE KL   Northern Star Resources  AX NST   Evolution Mining  AX EVN  and OceanaGold Corporation  OTC OCANF  all posted double digit performance 
By contrast  the Bloomberg World Mining Index was down more than 20 percent   
Northern Star was up 54 percent for the 12 month period  The Australian producer had a phenomenal fiscal year 2018  with net profit up a respectable 3 percent even as the price of gold was in decline  Dividend payouts were raised 6 percent  And the company continues to carry no debt 
Consolidation in the Goldfields  Sam Zell s other point about miners allocating their capital not to projects right now but to acquisitions is also well made  Indeed  industry consolidation is beginning to happen  which could possibly signal that the industry has found a bottom  Back in September  mining giants Barrick Gold  NYSE GOLD  and Randgold Resources  LON RRS  announced a deal worth  6 5 billion  making the world s largest gold producer by annual output  That record will stand for only four months  as Newmont Mining  NYSE NYSE NEM  just made public its own plan to buy rival Goldcorp for  10 billion 
The next deal to surface could be nearly as large  It s now rumored that South African producers Gold Fields ADR  NYSE GFI  and AngloGold Ashanti ADR  NYSE AU  are interested in merging  Although the rumor has not yet been confirmed  Gold Fields CEO Nick Holland said in an interview this month that  if you are going to survive in the long term  you are going to have to look at consolidation

189033,410549,NEM,Gold  Silver Awaken From 8 Year Slumber,opinion,"Two years ago at a conference during which I both presented and attended  a Keynote speaker   Rich Dad  Robert Kiyosaki  introduced me to a different way of looking at things  He posed the question   How many sides does a coin have  
The correct answer is  three   The front  obverse   back  reverse  and  the edge 
When you think about it  this makes sense  From this angle   uncommon to most observers   a person can begin to look more deeply at a given subject  From the edge  you are able by definition  to see  both sides  of the story 
Using Rich Dad s perspective as a research tool helps define and validate the premise of this essay  that the price action right now of gold   and soon silver   are giving us important clues about the direction  strength  and durability of the next price trend 
It s easy and understandable for Norteamericanos to become fixated on the price of gold and silver  expressed in their domestic currency  the U S  dollar 
But once in a while  it s important to take a step back and gauge how much people in OTHER countries are paying in their currency when they exchange fiat for some of the honest money that gold and silver have historically represented 
When gold is in an uptrend against other currencies it lets you know that something is going on under the hood that most people are missing 
When precious metals  buying in these countries continues to increase in spite of the fact that it has become even more expensive to do so  Mr  Market is letting you in on just one more reason why you should pay attention    and either start  stacking  or add to your current insurance investment position 
The Trend Is Your Friend
Increased gold purchases by  Silk Road  countries   for going on two decades   have continued unabated in spite of periodic currency devaluations and loss of purchasing power to the U S  dollar  Not to mention that China  which used to export millions of ounces of silver annually  has for some years  not only been keeping all of its internal production  but importing more 
The Shanghai Gold Exchange  SGE  chart demonstrates that this trend shows no signs of letting up 
Going forward  plan on gold being more challenging to find  and due to increased regulation along with overall country risk  more complicated  costly and time consuming to produce  And  not to mention  more expensive to buy as mushrooming demand across the globe kicks in and continues with a vengeance 
Goldcorp  NYSE GG  was recently bought out by Newmont Mining  NYSE NEM   creating the world s largest producer  This is the second recent gold company mega merger   with others almost certainly to follow   indicating the need these operators have for nailing down future ore bodies  as every ounce they produce depletes their reserves 
Ian Telfer  Goldcorp s Chairman  has said   If I could give one sentence about the gold mining business  it s that in my life  gold produced from mines has gone up pretty steadily for 40 years  Well  either this year it starts to go down  or next year it starts to go down  or it s already going down  We re right at peak gold here   
Physical Silver Deliveries In Shanghai Are Skyrocketing   After a brief time lag  when gold experiences a sustained and robust rise price rise  so does silver 
The directional correlation between gold and silver is close to 90   When you observe the statistical rarity of a gold silver ratio above 80 1   which happens to be where we are right now   a  reversion to the mean  is in the offing 
Central Bank Gold Holdings Reveal What  The Man  Is Doing
Even as the new gold secular bull run got underway in 2000  central banks continued to sell gold for nine more years 
However  in 2010 that trend reversed and has continued upward through the present day  From 2015 through the end of 2018  central bank buying has noticeably accelerated 
One writer has referred to central banks as  one trick ponies with printing presses  
But even as they push out more paper promises  these tricksters continue to covet the Midas metal  Former Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben Bernanke  pressed to answer why they still held gold  replied curtly   because of tradition  
We d say there s more to it than his brief reply   a lot more 
Way back in 2002  David Morgan made the following comment 

For the record  I will state  there will be another  more frenzied  scramble that will carry silver prices to highs that will repair all the excess paper money creation  price suppression  supply deficit  and bearish sentiment over the past two decades  This will become known as the Great Silver Crisis 

Gold  silver and the mining stocks are finally awakening from an eight year slumber 
While no one can predict just how far and how fast prices will rise  the odds of missing out for those who continue to look the other way or who hesitate to act  will parallel the metals  upside trajectory 
Then at some point  as surely as the sun rises each morning  many of these same people will decide to step up to the plate and start buying at much higher prices  They will be driven   not by calm  calculated decision making  but rather by FOMO   the fear of missing out 
Do yourself a favor  Behave like  Rich Dad   Get up on  the edge of the coin  and take a look at both sides 
Then start  vaulting  gold and silver on a regular basis  while availability is good  and the price is still reasonable    David Smith is Senior Analyst for TheMorganReport com and a regular contributor to MoneyMetals com as well as the LODE Cryptographic Silver Monetary System Project  He has investigated precious metals  mines and exploration sites in Argentina  Chile  Peru  Mexico  Bolivia  China  Canada and the U S  He shares resource sector observations withr eaders  the media and North American investment conference attendees ",2019-01-29,Stefan Gleason,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold--silver-awaken-from-eightyear-slumber-200380711,200380711
189034,410550,NEM,Peak Gold And The Coming Supply Crunch,opinion,"During the lackluster and otherwise unremarkable trading of 2018  a hugely important development took place in the precious metals markets  Gold production  in the estimation of some top industry insiders  peaked 
Peak gold represents the point at which the total number of ounces being pulled out of the ground by miners reaches a maximum 
It doesn t necessarily mean gold production will suffer a precipitous fall  But it does mean the mining industry lacks the capacity to ramp up production in order to meet rising global demand and even higher prices would not make it happen 
One of the leading proponents of the peak gold thesis is Ian Telfer  chairman of Goldcorp  NYSE GG   which was recently acquired by Newmont Mining  NYSE NEM  to become the world s biggest gold company  
Telfer remarked in 2018   In my life  gold produced from mines has gone up pretty steadily for 40 years  Well  either this year it starts to go down  or next year it starts to go down  or it s already going down  We re right at peak gold here  
We ll soon find out whether his call for gold production to fall in 2019 pans out  If it does  the implications for precious metals investors are enormous 
The concept of peak gold is controversial  to be sure 
Skeptics point to the thwarting of peak oil over the past decade  Just as technological breakthroughs in fracking and horizontal drilling caused an unexpected surge in crude oil supplies  could not advances in gold mining techniques also lead to an unforeseen supply surge 
When human ingenuity combines with the right market incentives  nothing can be ruled out  But unlike crude oil  which is a byproduct of decayed living organisms and exists in various grades all over the world  gold is a basic element that came to us from exploding stars billions of years ago 
The amount of gold in earth s crust is fixed  By contrast  oil and other hydrocarbons can be produced synthetically from renewable biomass 
Perhaps one day we ll mine for gold in space or generate it in nuclear reactors or particle accelerators  Theoretically  it s possible  Practically  there s no prospect of these unconventional methods of boosting earth s gold reserves becoming economically viable in our lifetimes  It would take a true  moon shot  in the gold price and or a technological breakthrough that might be decades away from coming to fruition 
In the meantime  the gold mining industry is experiencing a major wave of consolidation 
Last year Barrick Gold  NYSE GOLD  and Randgold  LON RRS  merged  This year Newmont Mining acquired Goldcorp  Many lesser known junior mining and exploration companies have been or may soon be gobbled up by senior producers looking for an economical way to grow their reserves 
Developing new mines is expensive  time consuming  and risky 
It s difficult these days for the majors to even identify viable new projects that would add significantly to their asset base  As new discoveries shrink  many have decided it makes more sense to buy up the assets of smaller competitors while they are on sale 
It may prove beneficial to corporate bottom lines  but M A activity doesn t necessarily translate into more ounces being pulled out of the ground on an industry wide basis  To the contrary  it s a sign that mining companies aren t keen on investing in the exploration and development of new mines 
After years of  high grading    processing the easier to get  higher quality deposits first   future gold extraction costs could get progressively steeper for existing major mines 
Even at  1 300 an ounce  gold prices aren t high enough to generate attractive returns on investment  Many gold mining companies are barely breaking even after their all in costs are considered 
Canadian mid tier producer IAMGold  TO IMG  announced recently that it will halt construction at one of its gold projects in Ontario  Iamgold CEO Stephen J J  Letwin said the company will  wait for improved  and sustainable  market conditions in order to proceed with construction  
That s just one example among many of why gold production could begin to taper off and decline overall in 2019 
Refinitiv GFMS analysts forecast gold mining output will decrease slightly this year   from approximately 3 282 tonnes in 2018 to 3 266 tonnes 
The expected fall off may not be huge  but the wider impact on the precious metals markets very likely will be  With central bank buying continuing to be robust  jewelry demand in India back on the upswing  and investor interest returning amidst volatile financial markets  a slight decrease in production relative to rising demand   sets the stage for a rip roaring secular bull market    Stefan Gleason is President of Money Metals Exchange  the national precious metals company named 2015  Dealer of the Year  in the United States by an independent global ratings group  A graduate of the University of Florida  Gleason is a seasoned business leader  investor  political strategist  and grassroots activist  Gleason has frequently appeared on national television networks such as CNN  FoxNews  and CNBC  and his writings have appeared in hundreds of publications such as the Wall Street Journal  Detroit News  Washington Times  and National Review ",2019-01-31,Stefan Gleason,https://www.investing.com/analysis/peak-gold-and-the-coming-supply-crunch-200381901,200381901
189035,410551,NEM,How Did Gold Perform In January ,opinion," How can you say  Ordinary  when the likes of Franco Nevada gained 10 6  for January    remember  here at The Gold Update we tell it like it is  To wit 
For the first 18 years of this third millennium   which for you WestPalmBeachers down there was 2001 through 2018   the average change in the price of Gold for January was  3 0  and the median change was  3 4   Split the difference and what do we get   3 2   which was precisely Gold s net change for January 2019  That s as dead center ordinary as it gets  Indeed with 19 of  em now in the books  here is the table of Gold s respective January performances in descending order from  11 0  in 2012 down through  6 2  in 2011  again the centerpiece as framed being this past January s  3 2  

 Course  it has felt much more exciting than that given Gold s having found its way back above The Box  1240 1280   sufficiently so that we can now morph such soft inescapable 40 point swath from resistance into support  In fact  add to price six fat points of April contract premium and for just the second time in over a year Gold has posted back to back weekly gains of better than  1  toward settling out this most recent one yesterday  Friday  at 1322  And in turning to Gold s weekly bars  the current parabolic Long trend of 21 ascending blue dots ties for fourth in duration since 2001  with that ending 12 June 2009   Of marginal note as well  the ensuing week s price that would flip the trend from Long to Short is actually just atop The Box at 1283  Now if we can just get that nasty dashed regression line to rotate upward  we ll have the whole package sailing higher 

What s really sailed higher to start the year is Black Gold as we turn to the 2019 BEGOS Market Standings for one month plus one trading day year to date  Oil is  as they say   crushin  it   up nearly 21  followed by the S P 500 up 8   only the currencies are in the red 

 So now are you giving up on your 27  correction call for the S P  mmb  
Good heavens no  Squire  In fact we had to laugh over the misleading light in which the S P was cast in Friday s wee hours   The S P 500 turns in its best January in 32 years   came the excited bedside Bloomy radio voice   Tis a fact  that  But from the  Change is an Illusion whereas Price is the Truth Dept    the S P finished January at 2704  the price at which it had last been just 37 trading days earlier on 07 December  Were we broadcasting  we d have instead said  The S P 500 has nearly completed its Gold Ratio retracement to 2719 as measured from the recent 2347 low up toward the all time 2940 high as the overall 27  correction to 2154 continues   But that ain t gonna sell radio spots 
How about selling the Economic Barometer to the Federal Open Market Committee  One thinks they might actually be looking at it having doveishly slipped  will be patient  into last Wednesday s policy statement  Indeed   twas again to laugh in reading the FinTimes above the fold headline that  Asia stocks rally on Federal Reserve s rate reversal  You mean they did a rate cut and didn t tell us   Course all that was before Friday s StateSide report of blow out January jobs creation exceeding the 300 000 mark  practically double expectations  The month s Institute for Supply Management Index on manufacturing also went up  but the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index went down  as did Consumer Confidence  whilst Hourly Earnings slowed and December s Pending Home Sales fell the most in five years  Here s the Baro as the Great Divergence continues 

Divergence as well away from lower levels is the name of the Gold equities game  Here is the chart of their respective percentage  er uh  losses from one year ago to date  save for one wee gainer  But let s drill down into how each entity has done just from its recent January low to its January high  Gold itself  4 4   Newmont Mining  NYSE NEM   NEM  post Goldcorp acquisition   11 7   the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners exchange traded fund  GDX  NYSE GDX    12 2   the Global X Silver Miners exchange traded fund  SIL   12 8   Franco Nevada  FNV   14 6   and NEM s acquiree Goldcorp  GG   19 3   Not bad for less than a three week span if you ve the trade timing of a Swiss watch   and you know that I know who you are out there  

Onward with Gold itself we next move to its two panel chart of daily bars from three months ago to date on the left and 10 day Market Profile on the right  And as price s recent rise defied the declining baby blue dots of linear regression trend consistency  the latter rather than accelerating lower  the technical rule  have instead abruptly reversed higher  the technical exception   that is an anomaly across the respective tracks for all the BEGOS Markets  but there  tis  As for the Profile  there are some decent support struts in these lower 1300s  with 1288 being the most frequently traded price over past fortnight 

As for Sister Silver  her Baby Blues  below left  haven t had the adroit reversal upward as have those for Gold  rather  hers have simply halted their decline  But per her Profile  below right  she did finally reach the 16s for the first time in over six months  since 13 July  only to stumble a bit in settling out her week at 15 91  Still for you Silver hoarders stacking at home  with the Gold Silver ratio at 83 1x    but its millennium to date average at 63 9x    calibrating Silver to that today puts price at 20 69 

Finally with the turn of the calendar month here is our graphic of the Gold Structure since price s All Time High all too long ago  We ve on occasion quipped that    unlike most markets    Gold has a tendency to rise faster than it falls  and the rightmost part of the chart is suggesting such  see those six consecutive red down months  Now look at the subsequent four consecutive up months  Contrary to the wee devil s desire  it looks like we re winning

189040,410556,NEM,Analysts Estimate Newmont Mining  NEM  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Newmont Mining  NEM  reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 21  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This gold and copper miner is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 23 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  42 5  
Revenues are expected to be  1 86 billion  down 4 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 17 12  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Newmont 
For Newmont  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 86  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Newmont will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Newmont would post earnings of  0 22 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 33  delivering a surprise of  50  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Newmont doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-02-13,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-newmont-mining-nem-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200388164,200388164
189042,410558,NEM,Can Newmont  NEM  Keep The Earnings Surprise Streak Alive ,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider Newmont Mining  NEM   This company  which is in the Zacks Mining   Gold industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
This gold and copper miner has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 29 17  
For the most recent quarter  Newmont was expected to post earnings of  0 22 per share  but it reported  0 33 per share instead  representing a surprise of 50   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  0 24 per share  while it actually produced  0 26 per share  a surprise of 8 33  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Newmont  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Newmont has an Earnings ESP of  12 07  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  2  Buy   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on February 21  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-02-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-newmont-nem-keep-the-earnings-surprise-streak-alive-200388892,200388892

189056,410572,NEM,Gold  Institutional Stampede Into Miners Ahead ,opinion," Some analysts believe China could deliver 2 trillion yuan   296 21 billion  worth of cuts in taxes and fees  and allow local governments to issue another 2 trillion yuan in special bonds largely used to fund key projects     CNBC News  January 15  2019 
China s economy is likely to grow in the 6 2  6 5  range for 2019 and the stimulus is inflationary  While that growth is the slowest pace in almost thirty years  it s still  head and shoulders  above the horrifying meltdown in growth that the United States is likely about to experience 

Goldman is predicting a meltdown in US earnings growth from 20   in 2018 to just 3  to 6  for 2019 
Goldman s heavyweight analysts are also predicting that US GDP growth melts towards 1  by the third quarter of this year  This  while Morgan Stanley is predicting an  earnings recession  
Germany s economy is already slipping towards 1  GDP growth and EU earnings are unlikely to grow more 5  in 2019 
Interestingly  most big bank economists are predicting an uptick in inflation will accompany the slide in Western earnings and GDP growth  Clearly  all roads lead to gold 

Gold continues to perform remarkably well at a time when a substantial pullback would be expected  Conspiracy buffs are waiting for the  banksters  to smash the gold price  Where is the smash  Well  it doesn t exist  All that s happening is mild consolidation 
A pullback to key Fibonacci retracement lines in the  1250  1260 area would be healthy but even that may not happen  Current technical action indicates a very healthy gold market 

Gold has raced to an all time high against the Australian dollar  There s a loose triangle pattern in play  The target of that pattern is well above  2000 
It s very important for gold stock enthusiasts to make some effort to own at least a few Australian gold stocks that trade on Australian markets  Many of these stocks have been in powerful uptrends for years and are likely in a new acceleration phase 
Gold is also doing well against the British pound and the Canadian dollar  Most of the world s gold stocks trade on the Canadian stock market and a lot of them are beginning to show good technical action 

The paint is barely dry on the Barrick Rangold  NYSE GOLD  merger  and now Newmont  NYSE NEM  is buying Goldcorp  NYSE GG  
When mergers or takeovers happen  I like to see the new entity prove itself technically  with momentum  In the case of Barrick  I ve suggested that investors need to see a weekly close of  14 for that to happen 
For Newmont  I need to see a weekly close of  36  That would suggest institutional money managers are endorsing the new entity  Once that happens I would be a buyer of every dollar of price weakness in the stock 
Both Barrick and Newmont are key VanEck Vectors Gold Miners  NYSE GDX  components  I m impressed with the relative strength of GDX in the face of the softness in both those stocks 

While GDX  should  pull back to about  20 from the current price zone  the technical action is superb  Note the fade in volume as price drifts sideways in the  21 50 resistance area  That s extremely positive  Eager accumulators should be buyers of every ten cents of price weakness between  21 and  20 
Once the current consolidation ends  I m anticipating a surge to the  23 price area  on strengthening volume 
Goldman s influential gold market analyst Jeff Currie has a new  1425 target for gold in 2019  That s an important number  because most gold and silver miners have made a significant effort to reduce their AISC  all in sustaining cost  numbers 
A gold price in the  1400  area would turn many of these companies into  cash cows   and do so at a time when most companies in America face an earnings and revenue meltdown 
An institutional stampede into gold stocks in this new and emerging situation is not a pipe dream  It s becoming more of a probable event than just a potential scenario 

My weekly gold chart shows that  1300 resistance is merely a pit stop on the road to the inverse H S bottom neckline at about  1392  If Goldman s  1425 target price is achieved in 2019  it would mean gold has traded well above the neckline  ushering in a new target zone of about  1750  That  1750 price would turn most gold miners into not just cash cows  but cash cow superstars

189058,410574,NEM,Trade Level For Leading Gold Mining Stock,opinion,Earlier this week  leading gold miner  Newmont Mining Corp  NYSE NEM  acquired Goldcorp Inc  NYSE GG  for  10 billion in stock  The news caused NEM stock to decline by roughly 6 0 percent  Often  the company that acquires another business will often see its share price decline  Today  NEM stock is trading around the  31 42 level  Traders should note that the stock is now below its key 50 day moving average which puts it in a weak technical chart position  It is also trading below its important 200 week moving average which should add further pressure on the stock in the near term  The next key support level for NEM stock will be around the  26 50 area  This is a level where the stock broke out in April 2016  Remember  stocks are often defended on a retest of their prior break out levels ,2019-01-18,Nicholas Santiago,https://www.investing.com/analysis/heres-the-trade-level-for-this-leading-gold-mining-stock-200376919,200376919
189078,410594,NEM,Gold Through Eleven Is Hardly In Heaven,opinion,"That blur you just saw was November  A month alone in which the trading range for Oil was a dramatic 32   even both Silver and Copper traced ranges exceeding 7  for the year s eleventh month  the S P 500  too  had a 7  trading range  Gold s range for November  3 6   Of the 21 trading days for the month  Gold was priced in the 1220s during 16 of them  Nary did price move up to 1240  nor below 1196  More nitty gritty  Of the 499 trading hours in November  Gold traded in the 1220s during 279 of them  that s 56  of the time  Indeed Gold settled nine of the month s last ten trading days in the 1220s  including yesterday  Friday  at 1228  To quote from last week s missive      simply guess that the price of Gold is around 1220 and you ll likely be right      Whoomp   There It Is   Whoomp   There It Is   Whoomp   There It Is  
As onerously stagnant as has become the price of Gold  there is one silver  poor pun  lining for us analysts  price s never going anywhere anymore means that we haven t been burdened with the need to adjust the scaling on our charts  in turn bringing less stress upon one s wrist in tandem with less wear to one s mouse and keyboard  So that s a good thing 
But as we turn to the standings of our BEGOS Markets year to date  what was the one big winner    Oil    has gone full off the boil  Throughout most of this year s months  Oil has dominated the top of our table  trading in the 70s at some point in each of May through October  this past week saw price go sub 50   All that plunge and yet at our local petrol pump they re still stealin  over  3 60 gallon for the El Cheapo  regular     but that s San Francisco   Can it be any worse than Oil   Course it can  for as the standings show  we ve Silver at the at the barrel s bottom   16 1  for 2018 through November 

As for Gold s being  5 9  year to date  it still finds itself above   4   where  twas at this time in 2016  but below   4   where  twas a this point a year ago  And as we go to Gold s weekly bars  the picture shows time and again these many weeks Gold s price stuck betwixt the base of The Box  1240 1280  and the parabolic Long trend s rising blue dots  In the new week  such trend would end upon price dropping through the rightmost dot at 1204  the alternative being to scamper up into the safety and serenity of The Box only to then spend many a month therein 

Not to be overlooked is the glaringly high Gold Silver ratio there at 86 2x  A valued charter reader of The Gold Update wrote to us in the midst of yesterday s trading session suggesting  tis been years since the ratio has been north of 86x  Our reply   Yep  live reading is 86 1x  We were also above it a couple weeks ago  but prior to that  on a closing basis  not since 21 Nov 2008   ten years ago    The price of Silver settled the week at 14 250  the millennium to date average of the ratio is 63 8  were Sister Silver in tune with that ratio today she d be at 19 245  or 35  higher     and that s just to play catch up  
 And priced where per the lowest ratio since 2001  mmb  
Ah Squire  back from your Thanksgiving peregrinating  Good question  the ratio s lowest reading  on a closing basis  was on 28 April 2011 at 31 7x for a price equivalency today of 38 730  or 171  higher  
 Now that s my kinda overshoot  mmb  
You ll likely live to see that and so much more  Squire   The lad is ageless  you know  
As for the picture from a full year ago to date  Gold has suffered far less than have its fellow equities  Per the below chart we find the yellow metal  4   the balance of it all becoming progressively worse with Newmont Mining  NYSE NEM   13   both the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners exchange traded fund  GDX  NYSE GDX   and Franco Nevada  FNV   15   the Global X Silver Miners exchange traded fund  SIL   26   and Goldcorp  Good Gracious    GG   27   For the latter compared to Gold s decline  that implies leverage of better than 600   Just sayin   

Lacking any and all leverage is the Economic Barometer  Just when one thought it might finally lift  it instead further lapsed  not helped this past week by a decline in November s Consumer Confidence  October slowing in both Core Personal Consumption Expenditures  a Fed favoured measure  and New Home Sales  as well as a ripe El Plungo in Pending Home Sales  To be sure  increases in November s Chicago Purchasing Managers Index and in October s Personal Income and Spending served to lessen the drop  but down is down    so much so that we think Federal Reserve Bank Chairman Powell may actually have peeked at the Econ Baro prior to his address at the Economic Club of New York wherein  tis said a dove flew from his hat  Good on ya  Jay  As for the stock market  No worries  our  live  price earnings ratio for the S P 500 at an ever so lofty 40 4x   we ll keep the medicine chest open for ya 

Meanwhile over at Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS   equity strategist Mike Wilson in commenting on  the rolling bear  sees the selling of stocks as only half done  which going into next year would directionally align with our seeking S P 2154  Even the Fed itself in a report issued this past Wednesday on private sector debt and the banking system pointed to     generally elevated  asset prices     which combined with  An escalation in trade tensions  geopolitical uncertainty  or other adverse shocks could lead to a decline in investor appetite for risks in general     The resulting drop in asset prices might be particularly large  given that valuations appear elevated relative to historical levels   Recall our p e for the S P  Got Gold  Got Silver 
Then back across the pond  derivatives darling Deutsche Bank  DE DBKGn  is under a polizei raid with respect to running money through the wash  whilst ongoing Brexit uncertainty has made  uninvestible  the UK s equity market  And looming through it all is the not so TV FinMedia favoured S P 500  death cross  because  everybody changes the channel   Moreover  oh no say it ain t so  according to a Bloomy opinion piece   The bitcoin crash is a real currency crisis   Really  A real currency crisis would be of one widely accepted  i e  not the Venezuela Bol var  in turn rocketing Gold well higher  Hasn t happened  yet   
Let s go to our graphic of the precious metals  daily bars for the past three months along with their  Baby Blues  which depict linear regression trend consistency  Also included    given their drama    therein are panels for the S P 500   Spoo   and Oil  Respectively at top left and top right  Gold and Silver continue to merely meander  their Baby Blues in both cases indicative of their 21 day trends being flat to down  At bottom left  the S P s Baby Blues managed to get back to their 0  axis before keeling over again  suggestive of still lower levels  And then at bottom right there s Oil  without combing back through 2001 and beyond  doubtless we ve never seen such Baby Blues flat lining for Oil  let alone for any of the other BEGOS Markets  But upon Oil s blue dots crossing above their  80  axis  the then already rising price ought have further to run  Something for which to watch 

For their respective 10 day Market Profiles we also show these same four BEGOS components as follows  denoted with their trading prices of highest volume  Again  narrow ranges are the order of the day for Gold and Silver  upper half   whilst vast are the ranges for the S P and Oil  lower half  

In closing  month s end wouldn t so be without our Gold Structure chart of price s monthly bars from 2011 s All Time High to date  Here they are with so much overhead strata  seemingly eternally  waiting to be recovered 

So there all  tis  Eleven months gone in 2018  with Gold indeed hardly in heaven  And speaking of the yellow metal  do you know    according to the numbering employed by International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry    that Group Eleven   11   in their Periodic Table of the Elements consists of Gold  Silver and Copper  A fourth element thrown in with that valued bunch is something called Roentgenium of which neither have we heard nor can pronounce  So keep it simple with just one syllable  keep with Gold ",2018-12-02,Mark Mead Baillie,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold-through-eleven-is-hardly-in-heaven-200364285,200364285
189079,410595,NEM,Gold Regains Shine On US China Trade War Truce ,opinion,Gold prices hit a one month high of  1 240 an ounce on Dec 3 as the United States and China agreed to a temporary truce in their trade war at the G20 summit held in Argentina from Nov 30 Dec 1  The dinner meeting between President Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping resulted in a cease fire in the ongoing trade dispute between the world s two largest economies  sending the dollar reeling and sparking an upside in gold prices  The alleviation of trade war tensions between the United States and China sparked a rally in global stock markets and commodities  The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1 1  or 287 97 points  while the S P 500 added 30 20 points or 1 1   The Nasdaq Composite Index gained 1 5  or 110 98 points  After hitting a one month high of  1 240 an ounce  gold prices closed at  1 239 60 an ounce on Dec 3  What Led to Gold s Turnaround  At the much awaited meeting  President Trump and Chinese President Xi agreed to a 90 day delay to make time for further negotiations  The United States has agreed on refraining from imposing planned increase in tariffs from 10  to 25  on  200 billion which was supposed to come into effect from Jan 1  2019 on Chinese goods exports  Per the truce  China will buy a substantial amount of U S  agricultural  energy and industrial products  The two sides agreed to launch negotiations to reduce trade tensions further and discuss forced technology transfer  intellectual property protection  non tariff barriers  and cyber and agriculture issues  among other concerns over the next 90 days  President Trump also tweeted that China had agreed to  reduce and remove  tariffs on U S  cars  now set at 40    This development put dollar under pressure with investors leaving the safe haven of U S  currency and buying riskier assets  So far this year  the constant threat of an escalating trade conflict between the United States and China led investors to seek safe haven in dollar  in turn decimating gold prices  Notably  gold prices have suffered a decline of 3 3  over the past year owing to a stronger dollar  Further  higher U S  rates dented the appeal of gold as it does not offer much interest  This temporary cessation of hostilities will act as a major tailwind   Industry Valuation is Inexpensive Over the past year  the  industry  has declined 13  against the S P 500 s growth of 6     Going by the EV EBITDA multiple  a preferred valuation metric for mining companies that have high capital expenditures   the gold mining industry has a forward 12 month EV EBITDA multiple of 6 5  much lower than the S P 500 s EV EBITDA multiple of 11 0  The industry s lower than market positioning calls for some more improvement in the near term  How to Play the Industry  None of the stocks in the gold mining space currently carry a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   You can see   We suggest a few gold stocks that have a favorable Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and are witnessing upward estimate revisions  Earnings estimate revision is the most powerful force impacting stock prices  Stocks with rising earnings estimates have a

189080,410596,NEM,Will The Rally In Gold ETFs Continue ,opinion,"Gold is trading around its five month high  The precious metal hit a five month high last week  fueled by easing signs of rate hikes from the Fed  Further  weaker jobs data has helped the precious metal to remain steady at its five month peak  Gold saw an increase of  marking its best performance since the week of Mar 23   Gold tends to rise during receding rate hike expectations because lower yields keep the opportunity cost of holding the non yielding bullion low  read     
 U S  nonfarm payrolls increased by 155 000 last month  below the economists median forecast of 200 000 jobs  Alongside weaker job data  the jobless claims fell less than expected last week  as of Dec 6   pointing to some hiccups in the economy 
Per   a number of tailwinds are in favor of the precious metal moving significantly higher in December  These include falling U S  interest rates  a declining or at least stalling dollar and wobbly U S  markets 
 have used a cautious tone with regard to the economic outlook  possibly flagging a turning point in the monetary policy stance  Per   head of metals trading at BMO  a soft employment report reinforces the narrative that markets have seen the highs of employment  According to Wong  December rate hike is done but anything in 2019 is up in the air 
The slowdown in global markets is also favorable for the non yielding bullion  Uncertainty surrounding trade talks and the recent high profile arrest of the senior official of Huawei have hit global markets 
The Fed is likely to hike rates in its next meet scheduled for Dec 18 19  However  the recent wild swings in Wall Street could keep the central bank away from its previously taken hawkish stance  This in turn will lead to a slide in demand for the greenback and boost gold prices 
In October  IMF had cut the global growth forecast by 0 2 percentage points for this year and the next owing to trade policy concerns and import tariffs  which are affecting commerce  Therefore  the ongoing volatility lends more support to gold as a safe haven  This in turn could result in more profits for gold miners 
Against this backdrop  we highlight the following gold mining ETFs in detail  These ETFs have been performing strongly over the past four weeks  as of Dec 7   see   here  
VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF  NYSE GDX    V GDX

189082,410598,NEM,Gold Forecast 2019  If Only That Were The Price  Not The Year,opinion,"Oh were 2019 in this missive s title the forecast price rather than the year 
Yet per the above Gold Scoreboard  a price of 2019 and well beyond given our currency debasement price alone of 2854 must inevitably in the cards once Gold plays catch up to the green money supply line at upper right  But again  we don t expect  2019 in 2019   Course  iconic Monty Python is on record as having said  Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition       thus one never knows  eh 
Therefore Our Forecast  A week ago we hinted at what  twould be  So again in looking at the above Scoreboard and its price tracks for the past three years  what is the overall conclusion  That the price of Gold hasn t really materially moved anywhere in any of them  That in turn means Gold s overhead price structure hasn t been altered because price hasn t reached that high   i e  above Base Camp 1377   Price is what  tis  Therefore   tisn t hard  let alone rocket science  to project price for this coming year  So given that nothing overhead has been reached such as to be altered 
  Our conservative upside price target for 2019 will remain at 1434  and   Were a material upside breakout then follow  our aggressive upside price target will again be 1526 
Fairly simple stuff  what   Whoomp   There It Is  
And whoomp here this is  with but one trading day left in 2019  Gold has marginally departed above the top of The Box  1240 1280   settling out the week yesterday  Friday  at 1283 as we next see in the weekly bars  Our call has been that come year end on Monday  price shall be nestled within the  safety and serenity  of the The Box  But should the wheels again come flying off the stock market in finishing off 2019  in furthering the  fear trade bid  we ought instead see Gold to finish atop The Box  Moreover as noted further down  Gold tends to do well on the year s last trading day  Meanwhile  here are the weekly bars 

Also looking back from this date a year ago  here is Gold s practically  unch  net cumulative percentage change of  1   along with those for the  over leveragedly lower  equities of Newmont Mining  NYSE NEM   8   the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners exchange traded fund  NYSE GDX   11   Franco Nevada  TO FNV   13   the Global X Silver Miners exchange traded fund  SI   23   and Goldcorp  NYSE GG   24   We oft think of miners  leverage to Gold itself of perhaps two times to four times  not teens times   hint hint  nudge nudge  elbow elbow   And the ratio of the yellow metal to the white metal continues to confound at a very lofty 83 1x  Got Silver 

Indeed what s confounded the entirety of the BEGOS Markets year to date is the not so amazing Dollar  the Index for which today is but 75  of its former self some 33 years ago   And whilst not a BEGOS component  we maintain it in the Market Standings which for this entire year  save for Monday  look to  likely  wrap it up as follows  we say  likely  as for the 17 prior years in this millennium  Gold has netted an up final day 13 times  with five of those instances being better than  1   Note as well that Gold  bettered  the S P this year  indeed for the first time since 2011   the year of Gold s All Time High price at 1923   But all in all  2018 was  nuthin  but down  for the BEGOS bunch 

Down as well for the year went the Economic Barometer  although that doesn t mean the economy is necessarily receding  the Econ Baro measures both changes and revisions to some 50  metrics as well as expectations thereto  On balance for this year and notably since mid year the economy has of course been growing  but at a slower pace  in turn causing the Baro to decline 

As to the above reference of there still being more  correction  to come for the stock market  here s where we now stand  from the S P s high of 2940 on 22 September  we continue to look for a 27  run down to 2154 which was a pre 2016 election resistance price 
Thus far  the S P has come down 20  to the 2347 level meaning that our expected correction has now run 75  of its course   Course this past Wednesday  there was much rejoicing as in rather  thin  trading conditions the  Dow   i e  that index at which our parents look  went up over 1 000 points  that 5 0  daily percentage gain being the 12th largest since 1970  Unacknowledged in said rejoicing was that nary was any material moneyflow makeup made up in the S P 500  despite it also gaining 5 0  that day  Here is our updated graphic of the S P s quarterly moneyflow change as regressed into S P points  suggesting that the Index itself is still some 500 points  high   which if resolved would blow significantly though our 2154 downside target 

Toward closing out 2019  let s go  round the horn for all eight BEGOS components by their daily bars from 21 days ago to date   one trading month   And as you can see  the baby blue dots of linear regression trend consistency are well up there for all of the usual  safe haven  suspects including the Bond  Gold and even Sister Silver 

As for the precious metals  10 day Market Profiles  for Gold below left the trading range is essentially that of The Box  1240 1280   whilst for Silver below right  she finally has welcomed the 15s for the first time since mid August  Underlying trading support levels are as denoted

189094,410610,NEM,Gold And The Whole Enchilada,opinion," Oh woe is Gold  The Fed shall further raise its rate  Oh woe is Gold  The Dollar is looking all so great  
We interrupt this conventional  wisdom  with the following friendly reminder 
Neither does Gold care so much about interest rates as it does the massive level of debt  nor does it play currency favorites  We need only remind ourselves of the following twelve month stint from December 2004 through November 2005  the Fed funds rate doubled from 2  to 4   the Dollar Index rose 12   and Gold rose 10    It s just impossible    No  tisn t  Perry Como  Look 

Yet for the present  Gold s picture remains poor  For even with 10 points of COMEX December premium added into Gold s now  front month  price  it still couldn t manage a gain for the past week  settling yesterday  Friday  at 1222 which we see here in the weekly bars as red dots of parabolic Short trend further descend 

But wait  there s more  or perhaps better stated  less   Tis a bit of a technical scare  so skipping the next bit is clearly warranted for the weaker stomachs out there as we turn to the same drill with the parabolic trend for Gold s monthly bars from April 2014 to date  Those two rightmost red dots are not a welcome sight 

 Enough of the pain  mmb     how does Gold stand year to date  
Well  Squire  as another month has passed  here are our BEGOS Markets Standings through July plus the first three trading days of August  And  tis clear  all that s anti Dollar is down   playing currency favorites notwithstanding   the one exception being the stock market as measured by the S P 500   6 2    which in general prefers a weaker dollar to enhance foreign returns  For Gold   6 4    it could be worse  it could be Copper   16 4    Oh wait  we proved last week that Gold IS Copper  Terrifique  eh  Here are the Standings 

As for stocks  with some 100 S P companies still to report their Q2 earnings  the season is being slanted as  terrific  with 79  of the reports thus far having beating  estimates   but the fact remains that the actual level of earnings is far too low to support the S P s lofty level of 2840  now just 32 points short of the 2872 all time high   especially as the shorter end of the yield curve rises  Bob Shiller s  cyclically adjusted price earnings ratio  is 32 7x and our median  live  p e across the 500 constituents is 23 4x 
Moreover with respect to the S P  remember all that overdue tech carnage a week back when Facebook Inc  NASDAQ FB  planted  19  and then Twitter Inc  NYSE TWTR  thudded  20   The S P just prior to those two butt kickings was at 2846 from which it declined some 50 points  yet as just noted above   tis mostly recovered  But here s the dirty little secret  the money that came out of the S P has hardly came in back a wit  From the website  here s our present view of the S P s points change from a month ago to date along with its money flow regressed into S P points  Nuff said 

Neither faring as well as touted is the StateSide economy  at least through the eyes of the Economic Barometer  And talk about  divergence   Amongst the past week s cavalcade of incoming data came a firm increase in ADP s July payrolls measure from 181k in June to 219k     but the Dept  of Labor Statistics metric fell from 248k to 157k   Doink   On the rise came readings in Consumer Confidence  Pending Home Sales  Factory Orders and the Chicago Purchasing Managers Institute s survey  but slowing or falling came results for the Q2 Employment Cost Index  the Fed s preferred inflation stat of Core Personal Consumption Expenditures  the Institute for Supply Management s surveys for both manufacturing and services  Vehicle Sales  and a deepening Trade Deficit  Add  em and subtract  em and the result is a falling Econ Baro whilst buys continue the S P s rise to the skies   And yes  S P 2154 remains on our radar  

Meanwhile with flagging Gold having passed    indeed  passed out     into August  here are the year over year percentage tracks of the yellow metal and several of its key equities brethren  for which the broad bent basically is butt ugly  Newmont Mining  NYSE NEM  is essentially  unch  from this time a year ago  Franco Nevada Corporation  TO FNV  is  1   both Goldcorp Inc  NYSE GG  and Gold itself are  4   the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners  NYSE GDX  is  7   and lagging of course at the rear is the Global X Silver Miners  NYSE SIL   20   hardly a surprise given the Gold Silver ratio remains historically high at 79 2x   Gettin  some serious negative air there  Silver dude  

As for market trend  let s next go to the last three months of daily bars for Gold on the left and Silver on the right  Give your four year old a crayon and they can intuitively draw the downtrend line on both panels  That being obvious  price for both metals has been basing these past two weeks   albeit Gold got that 10 point freebie of infused December premium this past week   Indeed  given our forecast high for this year of 1434 having well been blown to smithereens  we were asked at last Sunday s Investors Round Table where Gold will finish the year    to which we replied   right  round here   i e  in the low 1200s   for which our one minus alpha confidence level is about 3    Share the misery 

For the near term trader  here are the 10 day Market Profiles for Gold  at left and as adjusted for the roll into December s pricing   and for Silver  at right   King Gold is sporting quite the thicket of overhead resistance  whilst we find Sister Silver again giving us the single finger salute 

And so in closing  we ve Gold s structure as presented by its monthly bars from 2011 s All Time High of 1923  As bad as it looks  it doesn t look that bad  Rather  tis the stock market that looks so good   tis bad  Which in turn makes Gold down here look so good  The S P vs  Gold  Fluff vs  Foundation  Symbolism vs  Substance  Witless vs  Wealth  Mania vs  Money  Make your good choice 

Dare we conclude with a puff of the chest  your five minute read of the foregoing we trust has made you more informed that watching five days of FinTV   Course we hope  tis the case every week  Now go be the smartest  round the summer grill  The whole enchilada  and Gold ",2018-08-05,Mark Mead Baillie,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold-and-the-whole-enchilada-200336467,200336467
189095,410611,NEM,Gold Miners  Q2 18 Fundamentals For August 19  2018,opinion,"The major gold miners  stocks plummeted in brutal cascading selling this week as stops were run  That shattered strong multi year support  devastating sentiment among the handful of contrarians remaining in this forsaken sector  With fear and despair extreme  it s critical to take a deep breath and get grounded in the gold miners  just reported Q2 18 fundamentals  They reveal if this surprise anomalous plunge was justified 
Four times a year publicly traded companies release treasure troves of valuable information in the form of quarterly reports  Companies trading in the States are required to file 10 Qs with the US Securities and Exchange Commission by 45 calendar days after quarter ends  Canadian companies have similar requirements  In other countries with half year reporting  many companies still partially report quarterly 
The definitive list of major gold mining stocks to analyze comes from the world s most popular gold stock investment vehicle  the GDX VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF  NYSE GDX   Its composition and performance are similar to the benchmark HUI gold stock index  GDX utterly dominates this sector  with no meaningful competition  This week GDX s net assets are 33 4x larger than the next biggest 1x long major gold miners ETF 
GDX is effectively the gold mining industry s blue chip index  including the biggest and best publicly traded gold miners from around the globe  GDX inclusion is not only prestigious  but grants gold miners better access to the vast pools of stock market capital  As ETF investing continues to rise  capital inflows into leading sector ETFs require their managers to buy more shares in underlying component companies 
GDX s component list this week ran 49  Gold Miners  long  While the great majority of GDX stocks do fit that bill  it also contains gold royalty companies and major silver miners  All the world s big primary gold miners publicly traded in major markets are included  Every quarter I look into the latest operating and financial results of the top 34 GDX companies  which is just an arbitrary number fitting neatly into these tables 
That s a commanding sample  as GDX s 34 largest components now account for a whopping 91 7  of its total weighting  These elite miners that reported Q2 18 results produced 241 0 metric tons of gold  which accounts for fully 28 8  of last quarter s total global gold production  That ran 835 5t per the recently released Q2 18 Gold Demand Trends report from the World Gold Council  I ll discuss production more below 
Most of these top 34 GDX gold miners trade in the US and Canada where comprehensive quarterly reporting is required by regulators  But some trade in Australia and the UK  where companies just need to report in half year increments  Fortunately those gold miners do still tend to issue production reports without financial statements each quarter  There are still wide variations in reporting styles and data offered 
Every quarter I wade through a ton of data from these elite gold miners  latest results and dump it into a big spreadsheet for analysis  The highlights make it into these tables  Blank fields mean a company had not reported that data for Q2 18 as of this Wednesday  Looking at the major gold miners  latest results in aggregate offers valuable insights on this industry s current fundamental health unrivaled anywhere else 
The first couple columns of these tables show each GDX component s symbol and weighting within this ETF as of this week  While most of these stocks trade on US exchanges  some symbols are listings from companies  primary foreign stock exchanges  That s followed by each gold miner s Q2 18 production in ounces  which is mostly in pure gold terms  That excludes byproduct metals often present in gold ore 
Those are usually silver and base metals like copper  which are valuable  They are sold to offset some of the considerable costs of gold mining  lowering per ounce costs and thus raising overall profitability  In cases where companies didn t separate out gold and lumped all production into gold equivalent ounces  those GEOs are included instead  Then production s absolute year over year change from Q2 17 is shown 
Next comes gold miners  most important fundamental data for investors  cash costs and all in sustaining costs per ounce mined  The latter directly drives profitability which ultimately determines stock prices  These key costs are also followed by YoY changes  Last but not least the annual changes are shown in operating cash flows generated  hard GAAP earnings  sales  and cash on hand with a couple exceptions 
Percentage changes aren t relevant or meaningful if data shifted from positive to negative or vice versa  or if derived from two negative numbers  So in those cases I included raw underlying data rather than weird or misleading percentage changes  This whole dataset together offers a fantastic high level read on how the major gold miners are faring fundamentally as an industry  Was this week s plummeting righteous 


This ongoing quarterly post earnings season project to better understand how the gold mining industry is actually faring fundamentally is tedious and time consuming  The best insights don t emerge until all the research is complete  as the big picture is more illuminating than individual companies  results  As I was doing much of this work this week  the plummeting gold stock prices cast a dark psychological pall over everything 
I always start at the top of GDX s component list and gradually work my way down  examining the latest quarterly filings from each company  Early on I was shocked by the sharp annual production declines at the world s biggest gold miners  Newmont Mining  NYSE NEM  and Barrick Gold have run neck and neck as the top gold miners for long decades now  Compared to most other gold miners  their resources may as well be unlimited 
They have diversified portfolios of gold mines across continents and many countries  and deep pipelines of exploration projects and new mine builds  NEM and ABX pour vast amounts of capital into maintaining their gold production as existing mines are depleted  The major gold miners hate reporting declines in production  as investors punish stocks for it with sizable selling  It is seen as signaling deteriorating health 
So gold miners suffering production drops often intentionally obscure it by omitting normal year over year comparisons from their press releases announcing quarterly results  They don t present the tables with the current quarter next to the comparable prior year quarter like they do when production is growing  It feels like a game of misdirection  emphasizing other metrics while forcing investors to dig deeper for that data 
The bigger the gold miners  the more opportunities they have to make up production shortfalls at some of their mines from other mines in their portfolios  So it was stunning to see NEM report its Q2 18 production plunging 14 1  YoY  And ABX s was much worse  plummeting a catastrophic 25 5  YoY  That ominous trend infected other top gold miners too  Goldcorp mined 10 1  less gold in Q2 18 than it did a year earlier 
Kinross Gold s production fell 13 4  YoY  Together these 4 elite major gold miners account for almost a quarter of GDX s total weighting  How on earth can their total production plunge 17 3  from 4 1m ounces in Q2 17 to 3 4m ounces in Q2 18  That was actually contrary to the gold mining industry as a whole  Again according to that latest WGC GDT  overall world mine production grew 3 0  YoY from Q2 17 to Q2 18 
The excuses given are nothing new to gold mining investors  primarily lower grade ore processed along with geological and geopolitical challenges at various individual mines  Wresting gold from the bowels of the earth in remote locations is never easy  as all the low hanging fruit has long since been mined  With even the biggest and the best gold miners failing to maintain production  peak gold theories are bolstered 
Incredibly as a whole  these top 34 GDX gold miners responsible for well over a quarter of the total world gold mined in Q2 saw their overall production plummet 20 9  YoY to 7 7m ounces  That s skewed though  as two major South African gold miners had reported their Q2 17 production a year ago this week but had yet to disclose Q2 18 production as of Wednesday s data cutoff for this essay  They chose not to do it this year 
AngloGold Ashanti and Gold Fields report in half year increments  so they have no obligation to separate out quarters  I wonder if the reason they did last year but not this year is to mask slowing production  If their H1 18 results are divided by two  they would ve added another 789k and 497k ounces  But that still leaves GDX s top 34 miners with collective gold production down a sharp 7 7  YoY  way worse than the industry 
While Q2 18 s underperformance by the biggest gold miners dominating GDX and the HUI was striking  it is nothing new  That s why I ve long recommended investors avoid many of the largest gold miners  Mid tier miners with growing production as they bring new mines online and much smaller market caps have far greater upside potential during gold uplegs  They are bucking the increasingly evident peak gold predicament 
Gold deposits economically viable to mine are very rare in the natural world  and getting much harder to find after centuries of exploration  It is growing ever more expensive to explore for gold  in places that are getting less hospitable with every passing year  Even after new deposits are discovered  jumping through all the Draconian regulatory hoops necessary to secure permitting for construction can take another decade 
Building the gold mines takes additional years and hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars each  This industry normally has enough capital to invest in replenishing depleting production  But ever since 2013 when gold plunged on extreme central bank machinations  the gold miners have been heavily starved of necessary capital  So their new production pipeline has inexorably withered away to a shadow of its former self 
As long as gold stocks remain deeply out of favor among investors because gold prices are so low  this supply deterioration will continue if not accelerate  But even if gold doubled or tripled today and stayed high for years  it would still take well over a decade for world mined supply to adjust  Some top mining CEOs and analysts believe we are seeing peak gold  that production will keep declining regardless of gold prices 
Peak gold is likely bearish for the largest gold miners that drive GDX and the HUI  Capital inflows from investors will wane along with their production  But lower gold mined supply on balance going forward is wildly bullish for the mid tier and junior gold miners growing their production  The resulting higher gold prices will catapult their profits and thus stock prices higher  attracting in investors fleeing the struggling majors 
The only way to reap these massive gains is directly investing in the best individual gold miners  Their fundamentals are far superior to their sector as a whole  While buying GDX is easy  the lion s share of that capital is funneled into the major gold miners with slowing production  Their underperformance will dilute away any outperformance among mid tier miners in this ETF  leading to mediocre overall gains 
One key reason slowing production is bad for gold miners is it usually leads to proportionally higher costs  Again in Q2 18 NEM s production fell 14 1  YoY  so its all in sustaining costs rose a symmetrical 15 8  YoY  ABX s colossal 25 5  production drop fueled 20 6  higher AISCs  And KGC s 13 4  lower gold production last quarter forced its AISCs 11 9  higher  Higher mining costs naturally drive profits lower 
With major gold miners  production falling sharply  their costs of mining should be proportionally higher  Gold mining costs are largely fixed during mine planning stages  when engineers and geologists decide which ore to mine  how to dig to it  and how to process it  The actual mining generally requires the same levels of infrastructure  equipment  and employees quarter after quarter  Little changes in throughput terms 
The mills processing the gold bearing ore and inevitable accompanying waste rock have hard limits to tonnages they can chew through  When richer ore is processed  more ounces of gold are produced to spread the big fixed costs across  But when mine managers have to dig through lower grade ore  either on the way to higher grade stuff later or in depleting mines  fewer ounces of gold must bear the full cost burden 
So as I started digging through the top 34 GDX components  Q2 results  I expected to see the major gold miners  collective AISCs rise due to lower production  That s certainly bearish fundamentally  portending lower profits that could justify some of the brutal gold stock selling this summer  But as a whole  rather amazingly these elite gold miners held the line on costs  The top majors  rises were offset by other miners 
There are two major ways to measure gold mining costs  classic cash costs per ounce and the superior all in sustaining costs per ounce  Both are useful metrics  Cash costs are the acid test of gold miner survivability in lower gold price environments  revealing the worst case gold levels necessary to keep the mines running  All in sustaining costs show where gold needs to trade to maintain current mining tempos indefinitely 
Cash costs naturally encompass all cash expenses necessary to produce each ounce of gold  including all direct production costs  mine level administration  smelting  refining  transport  regulatory  royalty  and tax expenses  In Q2 18  these top 34 GDX component gold miners that reported cash costs averaged  610 per ounce  That was merely up 0 8  YoY from Q2 17  rather remarkable considering the lower production 
The capitulation grade gold stock selling this week was horrendous  with GDX plummeting 9 5  in just 3 trading days ending Wednesday  This leading gold stock ETF plunged to  18 60 per share  shattering its major  21 support that had held strong through five major challenges since the dawn of 2017  Down a dreadful 20 0  year to date  GDX was trading at a miserable 2 5 year low on cascading stop loss selling 
But with cash costs averaging  610 per ounce  the major gold miners are certainly in no fundamental peril  While gold somehow managed to plunge 2 9  in those same few trading days despite crazy all time record spec gold futures shorts  it was still near  1176  The gold stocks face no existential threat as long as gold prices remain far above the cash costs of mining it  There s nothing to fear fundamentally this week 
Way more important than cash costs are the far superior all in sustaining costs  They were introduced by the World Gold Council in June 2013 to give investors a much better understanding of what it really costs to maintain gold mines as ongoing concerns  AISCs include all direct cash costs  but then add on everything else that is necessary to maintain and replenish operations at current gold production levels 
These additional expenses include exploration for new gold to mine to replace depleting deposits  mine development and construction expenses  remediation  and mine reclamation  They also include the corporate level administration expenses necessary to oversee gold mines  All in sustaining costs are the most important gold mining cost metric by far for investors  revealing gold miners  true operating profitability 
With the top 34 GDX gold miners  Q2 18 production down 20 9  YoY or even 7 7  if that implied South African production is added in  I would ve bet their AISCs would ve surged proportionally  Yet incredibly they actually slipped 1 3  YoY to just  856 per ounce  This was no anomaly either  as the top 34 GDX miners  AISCs have averaged  867   868   858  and  884 over the past four quarters  Q2 18 s were in trend 
The fundamental implications of this are very bullish  proving that this week s gold stock capitulation was purely an overdone herd sentiment thing  Gold averaged  1306 in Q2 18  up 3 9  YoY  That means the elite major gold miners were earning average profits just under  450 per ounce  Thanks to the slightly lower AISCs and modestly higher gold price  those earnings rose 15 2  YoY from the  390 per ounce in Q2 17 
With gold mining a heck of a lot more profitable last quarter than a year earlier  you d think the gold stock prices would ve been proportionally higher  Yet GDX s average price last quarter was 1 5  lower YoY  That makes zero sense fundamentally  And even if this week s capitulation grade  1175 gold was able to magically persist as if those crazy record gold futures shorts were never covered  gold mining is still very profitable 
At Q2 18 s average AISCs which are again exactly in line with recent years  levels   1175 gold would still yield hefty  319 per ounce profits for the major gold miners  That number is quite provocative  This Wednesday the flagship HUI gold stock index plunged to 143 3 on that cascading stop loss selling  a deep 2 5 year low  But the first time the HUI ever hit this week s levels was way back in May 2002  16 2 years ago 
Then gold was trading near  326  which was its best levels of its young secular bull at that point  Think about this absurd fundamental disconnect  Today s gold stock prices were first seen way back when the entire gold price was about the same level as today s absolute profitability alone  That is just ridiculous  highlighting the extreme undervaluation in gold stocks  Their crazy low stock prices are an extreme anomaly 
Should a sector running hefty 27  profit margins even at  1175 gold be trading this week at price levels first seen when gold was 72  lower  Hell no  Similar past capitulation like anomalies have led to huge subsequent mean reversion rebound gains  During 2008 s stock panic  the HUI fell as low as 151 6 in response to  720 gold  Those were higher gold stock prices than this week despite gold being 38  lower 
Just like this week  back in October 2008 fear was extreme as investors fled gold stocks  They foolishly assumed extreme gold and gold stock declines could persist indefinitely rather than quickly burning themselves out  So the traders who couldn t get past their own herd driven emotions sold at the bottom  They unfortunately missed the HUI more than quadrupling over the next 2 9 years with a major 319 0  bull run 
As long as the gold miners can produce gold at all in sustaining costs way below prevailing gold prices  they will generate big profits for investors  Eventually their stock price levels have to reflect their true underlying profitability  With  1175ish gold and  856 AISCs  the gold miners  stock prices must rebound radically higher  Their extreme low levels today are fundamentally absurd  they can t and won t last for long 
The rest of the top 34 GDX gold miners  core fundamentals in Q2 18 reflected their lower year over year production  Their overall cash flows generated from operations fell 18 3  YoY to  2747m  That s not out of line considering the 7 2  decrease in sales to  9993m due to less gold mined  Interestingly in addition to mining 20 9  less gold YoY excluding those non reporting South African miners  silver production fell more 
GDX has plenty of major silver miners among its ranks  as the pool of major gold miners is fairly small  Silver is much less profitable to mine than gold at current depressed price levels  so traditional big silver miners are increasingly investing in diversifying into gold mining  The top 34 GDX components  overall silver production plummeted 32 4  YoY to 29 1m ounces in Q2 18  That helped sales fall despite higher gold prices 
These top 34 GDX gold miners  total GAAP accounting profits reported to regulators looked like a disaster in Q2 18  They cratered 66 2  YoY to  802m  But that s very misleading  as one off charges and gains flowing through to miners  bottom lines can greatly distort headline profitability  There were a couple massive non recurring gains in Q2 17 results that I discussed a year ago that artificially boosted those profits 
Back then Barrick Gold reported an enormous  880m gain selling half and quarter interests in a couple major gold projects in Argentina and Chile  And IAMGOLD reversed impairment charges to report a huge  524m non cash gain  Removing just these two unusual items alone from overall Q2 17 profits recasts Q2 18 s decline as a far milder 17 1  YoY  That s about what you d expect with sales sliding 7 2  in that span 
While not included in this table  the average trailing twelve month price to earnings ratios of these major gold miners declined 2 2  YoY to 38 0x  And that number is skewed way high by a few outliers  as there are plenty of top 34 GDX gold miners trading at cheap TTM P Es in the low double digits or even single digits this week  The gold miners  earnings are fine  and don t remotely justify this week s capitulation like plunge 
Another fundamental metric for gold miners  health is their cash balances  Despite the lower production and sales in Q2 18  these top 34 GDX components exited it with  12 4b of cash on their balance sheets  That provides a huge buffer to weather lower gold  and gives them enough capital firepower to expand existing mines and build or buy new ones to help offset declining production  That was only down 9 6  YoY 
If your view on gold mining stocks is solely based on their price levels  you re probably convinced they are doomed after this week s plunge  Everyone freaked out as they got sucked into anomalous gold selling which triggered all kinds of involuntary stop loss selling  This definitely wasn t the first time this sector was hammered by fearful herd psychology  and certainly won t be the last  But such extreme anomalies soon reverse 
While sentiment is devastated  the major gold miners  underlying fundamentals remain strong  They are struggling with shrinking production overall  but their mining costs still remain far below prevailing gold prices still driving strong profitability  While sales reflect fewer ounces mined  they are still generating big operating cash flows and earnings  Today s gold stock price levels are ludicrous relative to their fundamentals 
So a big mean reversion rebound higher is inevitable and imminent  While traders can play that in GDX  that is mostly a bet on the largest gold miners with slowing production  The best gains by far will be won in smaller mid tier and junior gold miners with superior fundamentals  A carefully handpicked portfolio of elite gold and silver miners will generate much greater wealth creation than ETFs dominated by underperformers 
At Zeal we ve literally spent tens of thousands of hours researching individual gold stocks and markets  so we can better decide what to trade and when  As of the end of Q2  this has resulted in 1012 stock trades recommended in real time to our newsletter subscribers since 2001  Fighting the crowd to buy low and sell high is very profitable  as all these trades averaged stellar annualized realized gains of  19 3  
The key to this success is staying informed and being contrarian  That means buying low when others are scared  before undervalued gold stocks soar much higher  An easy way to keep abreast is through our acclaimed weekly and monthly newsletters  They draw on my vast experience  knowledge  wisdom  and ongoing research to explain what s going on in the markets  why  and how to trade them with specific stocks  Subscribe today and take advantage of our 20  off summer doldrums sale  We re redeploying stopped capital in new gold stock trades at extreme fire sale prices 
The bottom line is the major gold miners  fundamentals are quite strong based on their recently reported Q2 18 results  While production declined sharply  these miners still held the line on all in sustaining costs  That fueled fat operating profits and strong cash flows  These will only grow as gold rebounds on record futures short covering  Many miners are forecasting improving H2 18 production as well on higher grade ore 
Yet gold stocks are priced today as if they are doomed to spiral lower forever  That s truly fundamentally absurd given their strong profits even at this week s battered gold levels  Traders need to look through this frightened herd sentiment to understand these anomalous gold stock prices soon have to mean revert radically higher  It s hard staying long while everyone else is scared  but that s when big gains are won ",2018-08-19,Adam Hamilton,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold-miners-q218-fundamentals-200339353,200339353
189096,410612,NEM,Are You Ready For The Fall Fireworks In Gold And Silver After Labor Day  ,opinion,"Over the years  I have come into contact with some of the smartest fund managers in the gold business and the intelligent money was very excited to see this selloff in gold as a long term discount buying opportunity  Long time investors know that the summer months are usually down that is why they call it the summer doldrums when investors go on vacation and price and volume levels usually decrease 
July was unique in that you had a very strong US dollar due to the collapse of the currencies in China  Turkey  and Venezuela  A rise in the US dollar coincided with a record short position on gold not seen since the end of 2015 and major retail funds liquidating their precious metal positions  This triple whammy caused a capitulation in gold below  1200 per ounce this summer and new lows for most major miners including Goldcorp  NYSE GG   Barrick  NYSE ABX    and Newmont  NEM   The junior miners  GDXJ  were hit even harder with many stocks hitting new lows 

One way to go poor in investing is by following the masses  The consensus opinion is usually wrong at turning points  The last time we saw this record short position in gold was at the end of 2015 before a powerful rally  The record short position is actually now even greater than the end of 2015 and coincides with the tech bubble in 2000 when gold was under  300 an ounce 

In addition to this record short position  we are witnessing retail funds leave the precious metals space most notably Vanguard  Short selling combined with huge funds liquidating has caused a short term panic  Investors know that new uptrends begin after a climax bottom or selling capitulation  Recent volume spikes in early August may have signaled that the selloff peaked 
What does this record short position and precious metals fund liquidation mean to smart contrarian value gold investors ",2018-08-29,Jeb Handwerger,https://www.investing.com/analysis/are-you-ready-for-the-fall-fireworks-in-gold--silver-after-labor-day-200341271,200341271
189098,410614,NEM,Gold Down  But Never Out,opinion,"Two thirds of the calendar year are gone  What else is gone  Gold  Gone down  Gone bad  Gone to hell in a hand basket  Gone to begging for handouts into said basket  As is Sister Silver   She s gone     oh I  oh I d     better learn how to face it    Hall   Oates  1973 
Back then in  73  the  Gold Standard  had already been nixed by Nixon such that Gold settled the year at  106 oz  The U S  national debt for 1973 was  458 billion  Today  tis  21 5 trillion   that s 4 594  more national debt   manufactured  out of nothing   Increase the  106 oz  price of Gold by the corresponding 4 594  values it today at  4 870 oz  Oh but wait  from the  Let s Be Honest Dept   Gold s supply tonnage has since doubled  So let s halve that   4 870 oz    2    2 534 oz  Or  by our StateSide Money Supply  M2  debasement method in the above Scoreboard  the value of  2 827 oz  is pretty much in that same neighbourhood  We d do a derivatives valuation as well  however our ever trusty HP 12C  circa 1981  simply does not allow for the necessary number of decimal places  But as you voracious readers know  the  ought be  five figure oz  Gold Folks are out there 
Either way  curious how  tis trading at but  1 207 oz  by yesterday s  Friday s  settle  Indeed this past week marks the tenth one in the last five years that Gold has settled between 1200 and 1210  Much ventured  nothing gained  Much written  nothing changed 
 Are you actually capitulating  mmb  
Good gracious  no  Squire   Marveling  is more like it  And for month after month after month ad infinitum 
As for week after week after week of the parabolic Short trend spanning Gold s weekly bars  price could not reach up even the mere 10 points it so needed this past week to halt the descending red dots  As below shown  taking out 1221 still remains the near term hurdle to herald a return to ascending blue dots  Here s the overall picture from a year ago to date  the rightmost third being nothing but down 

Indeed if Gold is the injury  then its equities brethren are the added insult   Twas a year ago at this point that we penned  Gold Superb through the Year s Second Third      from which we ve witnessed The Great Unraveling  Since 31 August 2017  Gold itself is now  9   Newmont Mining  NYSE NEM  is  19   Goldcorp Inc  NYSE GG  is  21   Franco Nevada Corporation  TO FNV  is  22   the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners exchange traded fund  GDX  NYSE GDX   is  25   and the Global X Silver Miners  NYSE SIL   30   Given the gradual decline   tisn t so much a crash  but nonetheless  tis carnage 

Moreover  to this point in 2017 Gold was  15  year to date  second only to Copper   24   in our BEGOS Markets Standings  Now for 2018 to date  the metals are at the bottom of the barrel  Yet note how the Swiss Franc hasn t really succumbed as we d typically  expect  with those markets listed below it  The sturdy Swiss and its currency canonists are perhaps the wiser as to what s coming  hint hint  nudge nudge  elbow elbow     

Coming ever higher is the record making S P 500  now trading above 2900  where Gold ought be  for the first time ever  the Economic Barometer looking rather lost about it all  The past week brought us affirmation via Q2 of a 4 2  Gross Domestic Product growth pace whilst  soft  metrics of sentiment from both the Conference Board and University of Michigan suggest  everybody s happy  out there  And the Federal Open Market Committee s favoured measure of inflation    that of Core Personal Consumption Expenditures    ticked higher in July  Still  such mirth is mitigated by slowing growth in July s Personal Income  the month s Pending Home Sales falling  and the Chicago Purchasing Managers Institute s August read slipping  From a year ago to date  here s the S P in red and the Econ Baro in blue    and note how the Baro has ceased leading the S P since June  tick  tick  tick     

Elsewhere leading the way are Gold s rising  Baby Blues  but without price robustly in tow  At left below across Gold s daily bars for the past three months to date  we see the blue dots of linear regression trend consistency climbing out whilst price itself wanes  At right below  Gold s 10 day Market Profile finds price mired within the overall broad thicket of range  making the glass appear half empty    or half full    depending on one s point of view 

As noted earlier in the graphic of Gold s weekly bars  the Gold Silver ratio has climbed up to 82 8x  This is rarefied air   see our 03 February 2018 missive entitled  Gold Silver Ratio Tops 80x   What Happens Next     for all the nauseating detail thereto  and from which the ratio has yet to materially unwind   Worse as well for Silver as we see below right  her  Baby Blues  lack the upside alacrity of those for Gold  and further in her Profile below right  she s buried at the bottom  Oh cries Sister Silver   I ve lost my photographers as well as my dentists   Never let it be lost  dear Sister  that more than anything else you are MONEY  honey 

However  hardly as sweet as honey    despite their similarity in colour    is Gold  And our wee fellow down there at lower right knows it as we turn to Gold s Structure by the month since price s All Time High nearly seven years ago to the day  Gold has now closed lower for five consecutive months for just the 11th time  on a mutually exclusive basis  across the 524 months from January 1975 to date  Therein  Gold has fallen for a sixth consecutive month just three times  and not since 1989   and never for a seventh consecutive month  To be sure  Buyer beware   but at the same time  Buyer don t get left out   Here s the graphic with its defined major strata

189105,410621,NEM,Gold Completes Another Nowhere Week  BUT,opinion,"Gold s last three weekly settles have respectively been  1230  1236  and now yesterday  Friday  at 1235  Moreover  Gold has settled in the 1230s for eight of the last 11 trading days   BUT    
Come Tuesday s StateSide election results during which the late night financial world shall be fixated upon Gold and the S P futures wildly reacting into Wednesday s wee hours and onward  we ll likely be cueing Dorothy Gale s famous line that  Toto  we re not in Kansas anymore  
Let s review  first with the S P 500 as it  compared to docile Gold  is where the real drama shall be  From the election night of 08 November 2016  for which the trade date was already 09 November   the S P futures swung through a range of 138 points  that was seven times the  expected daily trading range   EDTR  for that date of 19 points  Come the election results this Tuesday Wednesday  should a similar swing phenomena occur and given that today s EDTR is running at 61 points  seven times that is 427 points     Course  that would get largely mitigated by the imposed overnight futures  lock limit  of 5  which at this writing would be a mere 136 points in either direction   by day  it can then get to 20   downside only  which would be some 544 points  in turn bringing the S P within a whisker of our overall 2154 correction target  i e  the full elimination of the present President s rally to date  
Here is the same drill for Gold  Its election night swing from 2016 was a full 70 points  from 1338 on Hillary Hopes down to 1268 on Donald Did It  which was five times the EDTR then of 15 points  Now two years hence with Gold actually lower than  twas then and the current EDTR being just 13 points  should Congressional power shift left  Gold ought shift up and get above The Box  1240 1280   Should Congressional power stay right  Gold ought shift down and fumble about in the upper 1180s  Either way  look for price to escape this recent drudgery of the 1230s   aka  Kansas    Here are the weekly bars  the blue dots of parabolic Long trend nonetheless accelerating their ascent   BUT  

Staying with this time frame from a year ago to date  here we ve Gold s percentage track   7   along with those for its more suffering equities brethren  namely Newmont Mining  NYSE NEM  11    the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners exchange traded fund  GDX  NYSE GDX   13    Franco Nevada  FNV  19    the Global X Silver Miners exchange traded fund  SIL  24    and beaten down Goldcorp  GG  26    albeit this bunch has most recently sprung up  arguably on safe space pre election jitters 

And with 10 trading months plus two days now in the books for 2018  here are our year to date BEGOS Markets Standings  led we believe for the first time by the non BEGOS component Dollar Index  Well  that tells the whole story  non 

Meanwhile we re fairly convinced that Federal Reverse Bank ex Chair Janet Yellen never really learned her lesson to mind the Economic Barometer  her stating this past week that interest rates ought be further raised  The Baro did have a bit of a whipsaw week  benefitting from reports on inflation measures  payroll creation and Consumer Confidence  but the dirty little negatives ran their course as well  as the Trade Deficit grew  Truck Sales fell as did the Institute for Supply Management s Manufacturing Index  plus came slowing in Factory Orders  in Construction Spending  in Q3 s read on Productivity  and in both Personal Spending and Income despite results from the National Association for Business Economics citing wage increases are at record high levels  Here s the whole picture  which does not include the EuroZone s growth slowing to a pace not seen for four years  nor that StateSide debt issued this year shall be the most since 2010  

Important Observation  whilst our bailiwick is Gold  given the pending post Tuesday  move  in the S P   twould be a disservice to not maintain that vein for a moment  Look at the following chart from the website  the three blue lines from left to right which cover the past week  month and quarter show the difference between the respective points changes in the S P 500 and its moneyflow regressed into S P points  So what we ve got is far more money flowing out of the S P than is belied by the Index itself  The suggestion is  again from left to right  that the S P for the past week  ought be  some 130 points lower than  tis  or more than 300 points lower based on the past month  or 400 points lower based on the past three months  And as earlier noted    lock limits  notwithstanding  a  20  move toward the neighbourhood of our correction call would be largely achieved in compensating for that 400 point mismatch  Just sayin    

This kind of moneyflow leaving the building is supportive of ole Ralph  I Gotta Say It  Acampora duly noting this past week that the state of the stock market is worse than investors realize  In fact  we chuckled at this comment from a FinMedia radio reporter that      despite the rallying over the last few days  we saw stock indices down in October     That s obviously from someone who hasn t been around very long  But then came this from someone who has  James Cramer reportedly stated that     this market is reminiscent of the worst crashes I ve ever seen     Good grief  Jimbo  the S P from its all time high of 2941 on 22 September down to last Monday s low of 2604 is but a wee  11  all in move  forget thee not the two  50  moves in 2000 2002 and in 2007 2009     We re just gettin  started even if the balance of Congressional power doesn t change   Write it down  
Back to the precious metals and specifically their performance from three months ago to date  On the left we ve Gold  which as you know meandered up essentially to the base of The Box  1240 1280  before having since run out of puff  the elections nonetheless in the balance  Gold s baby blue dots of linear regression trend consistency now in decline after having been above the  80  axis generally portends lower price levels   but the elections remain the  BUT    On the right we ve Silver attempting to refute her descending Baby Blues  remember  the Gold Silver ratio still sitting above 80x ought bode very well for the white metal s inevitable upward growth over that of the yellow metal 

Now per its 10 day Market Profile  lets look at where Gold  below left  settled out its week  smack on 1235  the most heavily traded price of the past two weeks  And  tis almost the same for Sister Silver  below right  just under her 14 75 level  Pre election perfection  precisely timed for the  BUT  

Finally  the calendar having flipped to November  here is Gold s Structure with its defined strata as measured by the month since 2011  Note that from this year s April through September Gold recorded six consecutive down months  you ll recall that a seventh straight down month has never been recorded since at least as far back as Nixon s nixing of the Gold Standard  and thus it came to pass that October was an up month  and thus far  per the rightmost bar  is ever so young November   BUT  

So there  tis  BUT  with the StateSide elections in the balance  Does anybody realize that the Federal Open Market Committee meets as well this coming Wednesday Thursday  Lucky Chairman Powell does not have to pontificate in a post Policy Statement press conference whilst the nation endures its election hangover  Regardless of how it shakes out  and with an eye on the subsequent socio cultural fallout  stay firm with respect to these two truths 
  The S P 500  presently at 2723  remains at least 50  higher than our  live  price earnings ratio of 43 6x suggests it ought be  warranting at least an  all in  27  correction from September s 2941 down to 2154 which is a centered  structural support price from the date of the 2016 Presidential election  and
  Gold  presently at 1235  remains at least 50  lower than our currency debased level of 2834 suggests  that level even taking into account the increase in the supply of Gold throughout this millennium  we regularly harp on this  of course   BUT  in time it will out  and you ll be glad you have",2018-11-04,Mark Mead Baillie,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold-completes-another-nowhere-week-but-200354466,200354466

Rising political turbulence in the European Union and threats of global economic slowdown have led to strengthening of U S  dollar  which recently touched a 16 month high  This makes dollar denominated commodities expensive thus keeping investors at bay  Additionally  strengthening of greenback leads to rising bond yields  keeping the non yielding bullion out of favor 
  gold analysts are now focusing more on the U S  dollar and global macro data releases  supposed to be the two biggest triggers impacting gold in the short term  Recently  hedge fund and money managers   read    
The fall in gold prices began post the Fed s decision to keep rates unchanged in their latest Federal Open Market Committee  FOMC  meeting  ending on Nov 8  Fed is tightening monetary policy to keep inflation in check  Another rate hike of a quarter basis point has already being priced in by the markets with  a couple more expected by mid 2019  read    
Fed is sticking to its gradual rate hike measure despite the recent sell off in October  This is because the U S  economy has been performing well this year with GDP growth rate averaging 3 3  in the first three quarters  The labor market is robust with unemployment rate at a near five decade low of 3 7   Over the year  wages have advanced 3 1  or 83 cents  increasing more than 3  for the first time since mid 2009  About 250 000 jobs were added in the month of October  easily surpassing the consensus estimate of 193 000  read    
IMF recently cut global growth forecast by 0 2 percentage points for this year and the next owing to trade policy concerns and import tariffs  which are affecting commerce  Meanwhile  emerging markets are struggling due to tight financial condition and sizable outflows  So  gold may still act as safe haven to shield against market volatility  This brings to focus gold mining ETFs that have suffered lately  as of Nov 12

189119,410635,NEM,Get Out Of Crypto And Move Into Gold And Silver ,opinion,"Summary
1 2018 has seen so much volatility in the equity and bond markets after going straight up since 2009 
2  Everything  bubble is simply the result of record low negative real rates manipulated by Central Bankers to prevent deflation by all means possible 
3 The ending of QE combined with increasingly inflationary concerns has sparked the US to start raising rates 
4 Unwinding of easy money policies could be quite painful 
5 Stay away from margin and company s with any debt on their books 
One of the most overlooked stories in 2018 has been the volatility in equity and bond markets  The  everything  bubble is simply the result of record low negative real rates manipulated by Central Bankers to prevent deflation by all means possible  In 2008  the US banks were on the verge of collapse  the Fed since that time has tried every effort to protect the economy with easy money policies 

The result since 2008 has been remarkably effective  Unemployment in the USA is at record lows only ten years following the government bailouts of banks and the auto sector  The real estate foreclosure crisis has been completely turned around 
We must not forget that for every action there is a reaction  The unwinding of easy money policies could be quite painful  The ending of QE combined with increasingly inflationary concerns has sparked the US to start raising rates  10 year are now the highest in many years spiking higher taking the investment world by storm  Real interest rate hikes are happening for the first time in many years  The Fed has started warning investors about rising risks most notably recently with Deutsche Bank  DE DBKGn  

First hit is now Italy who has always lived the sweet life heavily indebted  Next will be Greece or maybe Spain or Portugal and the PIIGS as interest rates increase  Don t worry about Spain  Greece and Italy they will be bailed out by the EU again with another lifeline  Instead  be concerned for many young people living in debt  They may have jobs now with record low unemployment  Nevertheless  in many cities such as NYC  LA and Miami the average teacher can t afford a place to live 

As rates rise again to historic levels  I expect to see many more delinquencies  The recent concerns at Deutsche Bank may be just the beginning 
I remember how fast these bank panics happen  First it started with Bear Sterns then Lehman and then AIG  All during that time the pundits in the mainstream media said there was nothing to worry about and that housing and the markets were booming forever and ever 
A similar phenomenon could be happening right now  We have so many warning signs of another crash  The biggest one is the major increase in bond yields in 2018  Not only have rates moved higher but it jumped quickly the most in many years 
I expect the recent warning signs from the Fed Reserve on Deutsche Bank to be just the beginning as debtors who became over leveraged to low rates pay the price now as rates rise quickly  I don t believe the Fed is done raising rates until there is a severe market downturn 
There is no doubt that highly leveraged borrowers at record low interest rates will come into trouble  This begs the question how many of the banks still have derivative exposure like AIG and Lehman 
Remember statistically we have up to 50  corrections or more once every 10 years or so  I know you don t like to hear it but this is the second longest bull market since the 1920 s which led up to a major crash and the Great Depression  We are in the midst of trade wars not seen in 100 year since the Smoot Hawley Era which many blame as one of the accelerants in deepening the Great Depression s devastating effects 
How does one protect oneself  Stay away from margin and company s with any debt on their books  You might want to look at hedging against the financials  real estate and bonds  TBT   Stick to small cap stories with no debt over large caps with debt and look to see if they have real assets preferably in the form of some sort of commodity in the ground  The mining sector  GDX  NYSE GDX   which has been under attack by the activists and unloved for years may actually be one of the best places especially gold  GDX   silver  SIL  and copper miners  COPX   The energy  XLE  and agriculture  DBA  sector may also be safe areas which over time could outperform during a potential bear market panic 

Conditions point to a bear market and possible flash crash this summer  Please prepare for real estate and stock market valuation to come back to earth as rates move higher 
What is deeply discounted right now and could soar again if we see double digit inflation like in the 1970 s  The junior miners could be the best place especially right now the beaten down exploration stocks which have been brutally neglected by the major producers for years  I recently went to a mining conference in NYC put on by 121 Mining and met with some of the top CEO s and Fund Managers 
One of my really smart professional subscribers Art pointed out Shanquan Li  Mr  Li manages the Oppenheimer Gold and Specialty Minerals  OGPSX  Before entering the investment sector he was a director of a think tank for the Chinese Government and then joined Brown Brothers Harriman before joining Oppenheimer where he has been for 22 years managing the precious metals fund since 1997 building it to just under  1 billion under management  He has significantly outperformed his peers recently with picks such as Kirkland Lake  KL  Endeavour  EDV and Newmont  NEM  The fund pays a yield of 2 99  and has four stars from Morningstar  Over the past year Li s  OGPSX fund has stayed in positive territory while most mining funds have been down 
He mentioned to me he doesn t buy stocks until they reach a minimum market cap but he does like to follow them and start doing research at an early stage  He comes to these shows because he realizes in his experience as a portfolio manager that big miners start out little and grow  He is smart  humble and constantly looking as he does not want to miss some big discoveries in the junior mining sector  This may be an actively managed fund that I may look into  Check out this recent interview with Oppenheimer Portfolio Manager Shanquan Li here 
At the conference I had dozens of meetings with juniors  One of the things that impacted me most was when the CEO s showed up and mentioned to me that they were recently buying their own shares  This is a very bullish testament to me as an investor and it was nice to see two of the CEO s telling me that they are putting heavy amounts of their own net worth in recently as they believe their own stock has value and should rise  I m still doing due diligence to confirm what they are telling me is correct but Liberty Gold  LGD and Victoria Gold  VIT may have had some recent insider buying  If you find insider report please email it to me 
There were a few select juniors showing some great momentum at the conference based on prior results and good discoveries this included Teranga  TGZ  Fireweed Zinc  FWZ  Corvus  KOR and Silvercrest  SIL 
Many of the companies came to the conference already well positioned financially recently raising money such as GoviEx Uranium  GXU  Some recently announced financings like Alexco  AXU which seems to be a top takeout target for high grade silver companies 
Interestingly  many investors are still unaware of the recent investment by Eric Sprott into what could be the next Novo which went up ten fold last year  Sprott just made a  10 million investment in a small company which is just starting to pick up  The CEO was just interviewed and was one of the first I ve seen on this rising junior in the Pilbara in Western Australia 
Also incredibly I spoke to some of the top lithium experts on the internet and they were not aware of a discovery that I was one of the first in the industry to highlight back in November last year which could be huge  Since that time they raised  2 5 mil CAD and are advancing permitting and metallurgy  The stock has gone from a quarter to 1  and it could be just a start as there have recently been some major advancements with the permitting 
Make sure to stay tuned as I expect a positive turn in the mining market to be imminent  Be careful of the overbought cannabis and cryptocurrency sector which has attracted a lot of speculative capital and tons of fraudsters  See the recent article entitled   Buyer Beware  Hundreds of Bitcoin Wannabes Show Hallmarks of Fraud  or  SEC Tells Investors Potential For Fraud in Companies Tied to Cannabis Industry   Please be careful   caveat emptor  If you have gains in cannabis or crypto  it might be prudent to rotate into cheap mining stocks

189120,410636,NEM,Gold   Do Not Disturb,opinion," Tis only perfectly apropos on the heels of last week s missive entitled All Quiet on the Golden Front that we acknowledge therein having completely overlooked the inclusion of our usual end of month chart featuring the  year ago to date  percentage track of gold vis   vis those of various key equities brethren  Not that we re in pursuit of an excuse  mind you  but when gold today  1304  sits not even 2  higher than where  twas a year ago  1280   are we really missing out on anything   other than the inevitable return to the 2805  mean  per the debasing M2 money supply equivalent denoted in the above gold Scoreboard  
As for those brethren  without further ado in quoting Jim Lange as he d patently introduce his contestants on  The Dating Game     ABC   65  73  
 Heeerrre they Are   wherein we ve Newmont Mining  NYSE NEM   9 6   the actually positive Goldcorp Inc  NYSE GG   3 4   gold itself  1 8   the  look ma no leverage  VanEck Vectors Gold Miners  NYSE GDX   3 7   Franco Nevada Corporation  TO FNV   4 6   and floundering about as ever in last place the Global X Silver Miners  NYSE SIL   16 2    the latter in turn justifying that the gold silver ratio remains an excessively high 77 5x   And note with price ranges having sufficiently narrowed that we ve now taken to quoting the percentage changes to the  tenth  rather than the  whole  number 

Moreover   quiet a week on  continues to be gold s apt description  With price clearly having become unresponsive to any and all things  when looking at gold s EDTR   expected daily trading range     tis at the very least gone to sleep  Indeed  perhaps it has become entombed   an apt description given that here in Monaco the title of its 2018 summer exhibition is  The Gold of the Pharaohs  featuring some 150 masterpieces on loan from the Cairo Museum   Gives quite the  gold has been money for many a millennia  meaning to our oft quipping  Hang onto your Gold    through thick and thin 
And oh how thin its trading range has been  To wit  below left is gold s EDTR   10 40  from one year ago to date along with that below right for silver  20    gold having closed yesterday  Friday  at 1304 marks its 21st weekly settle between 1300 1350 for the 23 trading weeks year to date  Again as we ve marveled so much of late   tis extraordinary how lifeless have become both gold and silver given so much otherwise price influencing stuff goin  on out there 

Going next to gold s weekly bars  again the  good news   if any  is price s not succumbing too deeply into the depths of The Whiny 1290s nor the Box  1280 1240   Still  we emphasize that gold s net weekly changes have been as slight as can be  thus far through the year s 23 weeks  gold has posted a net weekly change  regardless of direction  in excess of 2  only three times     and more than half of the weeks have settled with less than a 1  net change either way  All about as exciting as Rip Van Winkle 

More broadly in turning to gold and its 300 day moving average as charted daily since price s All Time Closing High  said average  1292  is essentially being retested right now  The 300 dma has not been materially tested and violated in practically a year  gold last July then getting beaten down into the low 1200s  But as we nonetheless stated a week ago  if gold is going to make a summer s up move   now is the time  

As for the StateSide economy  the ever popular Warren Buffett says  tis  feeling strong   To be sure  the Economic Barometer was further boosted this past week by a reduction in April s Trade Deficit and a working down of Wholesale Inventories  along with a nice pop in the Services measure from the Institute for Supply Management  However  drags on the Econ Baro included a noted decline in April s Factory Orders along with a reduction in Consumer Credit  are they getting tapped out    plus a downward revision to Q1 Productivity  Thus to the Oracle of Omaha  our recommendation is to stop  feeling  and instead  look at  the Baro 
Speaking of looking  look at the continuing climb out below left for gold s baby blue dots which denote linear regression trend consistency as the daily price bars show consolidation in the upper 1290s lower 1300s  As for Silver below right  she sported a late week price pick up  yet the  Baby Blues  spanning her three month panel remain basically direction less 

Toward closing  here we ve the precious metals  10 day Market Profiles  wherein for gold  left  1303 has been the most commonly traded price  and for Sister Silver  right  16 70 is nearby support 

To be sure  these days sleepy old gold has put out the  Do not disturb  sign  Yet might nap time be nearly done  In having made several additional treks past the Monoeci offices  we ve yet to therein see a wit of activity  Perhaps with much of the air having come out of the bits  t phenomena  they ve rightly gone to lying low     but  tis really quite difficult to know  In any event  do know that  tis all been kept in mind from your author s beloved writing perch over here  And  tis just a matter of time before upside gold sees its way clear ",2018-06-10,Mark Mead Baillie,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold--do-not-disturb-200323614,200323614
189124,410640,NEM,Why Harry Dent s  400 Forecast For Gold Is Wrong ,opinion,"Harry Dent has been making the rounds suggesting that for gold to get back to its pre bubble price  it would need to fall to  400 or  450  If we were to believe Mr  Dent  then it would be bad news for gold investors  However  Harry Dent s gold price forecast is quite faulty because he fails to consider the most critical factor 
Harry Dent has become well known on the internet for his  750 gold price forecast  He bases a low gold price upon what he calls  The end of the Commodity Super Cycle   Dent sees nothing but massive deflation ahead  Thus this will cause the gold price to fall along with all commodities 
Unfortunately for Dent  his gold price forecast is incorrect because he fails to incorporate the Falling EROI  Energy Returned On Investment  and energy into his analysis  Dent  like many in the financial industry  believes in the  Energy Tooth Fairy   a term coined by Louis Arnoux   What I mean by the Energy Tooth Fairy is the notion that economy will continue to grow forever because plenty of cheap energy will always be available  Thus  economic and business cycles  forecast by Dent  will also continue forever 
Before I explain in detail why Dent is totally wrong on his  400 gold price forecast  here he is in a recent interview on Kitco 

Dent makes several forecasts in the interview  but his price target for gold is the most startling for precious metals investors  He says gold is heading for  650  750  but that is just the first target  Dent then says   Ultimately for gold to erase its bubble and get back to its bubble origin  it would be  400  450  Once gold hits  400 or  450  then Dent would be a buyer 
I gather Dent is suggesting that gold became a bubble in 2004 when it went above  400 an ounce 

As we can see in the chart above  the gold price never fell below  1 050 since the 2008 Financial Meltdown  Is Harry Dent suggesting that the gold price will drop another  600 from its low of  1 050 in 2015  
I imagine Dent arrives at his  400 gold price forecast from using the Elliott Wave Theory of technical analysis  While technical analysis is an excellent tool to forecast price  it doesn t incorporate the changing energy dynamic that controls the price of most goods  commodities  metals  energy  and services  Which means  Harry Dent is forecasting in a vacuum  or without the most crucial component  ENERGY 
For example  does Dent realize the cost of gold production has skyrocketed since 2004  The following chart shows the top four gold miners estimated total cost versus the gold market price 

In 2004  the top four gold miners  Barrick  Newmont  AngloGold and Goldcorp  average estimated total production cost was  340 an ounce based on an average  396 realized price  I calculate the estimated total production cost by using the net income or adjusted income as a percentage of total revenues  Thus  the average profit margin for the top gold miners in 2004 was 16  
Now  compare that to an estimated production cost of  1 146 in 2017 while the group received  1 260 an ounce for selling their gold  The top four gold miners average margin of profit in 2017 was approximately 10   So  the gold miners aren t getting rich producing the King Monetary metal 
Again  how can Dent forecast a pre bubble  400 gold price  if the average total production cost is nearly three times higher 

Dent s failure to understand how energy is impacting the gold price  and everything else  will come back to bite him hard in the future  If the gold price fell back to  400  that would utterly destroy the gold mining industry  I haven t seen one gold mine profitable at a price anywhere near  400  450 
Of course  this doesn t change the fact that analysts such as Dent will continue to make short sighted and incorrect forecasts because they haven t taken into account the vital ENERGY COMPONENT 
Now  if we take a very conservative approach at the gold mining industry s basic cost of production  the price is still more than double than what Dent s  400 price 

The gold mining companies now put out a new financial metric called the AISC    All In Sustaining Cost   However  this does not include all costs and is not a realistic figure for the gold mining industry to survive for long  Regardless  the average  890 All In Sustaining Cost that the top four gold miners reported is still 122  more than Dent s  400 low price 
Furthermore  the gold mining industry s costs are rising a great deal more in percentage terms than the oil price  For example  let s take a look at the change in oil price and the top four gold miners total production cost 
2004 oil price    38 26
2017 oil price    54 13
2004 2017 oil increase   41 
2004 gold cost    340
2017 gold cost   1 146
2004 2017 gold cost increase   237 
While the oil price has increased by 41  since 2004  the top four gold miners total production cost has increased by 237   How can the gold price be in a bubble if it costs 237  more to produce it today than it did in 2004   Does Dent believe really believe that the Eliot Wave Theory or supply and demand forces are the only indicators of the price  
The next chart shows the total production cost from Barrick and Newmont versus the gold market price 

As we can see  the gold market price was never below Barrick and Newmont s total production cost  If gold was ever in a small bubble  then it may have been a bit frothy in 2012 when the average spot price was  1 669 versus a  1 272 average cost for Barrick and Newmont 
If we are going to utilize  supply   demand  forces in determining price  then more demand in 2012  pushed the gold price nearly  400 above Barrick and Newmont s total production cost   Analysts need to realize that supply and demand move the price of goods  commodities  metals  and energy above or below their cost of production trend line   However  the gold mining industry continues to sell gold for more than its total cost  And  I believe this has been true for quite some time 
Now  if we want to spot a real bubble  let s compare the Gold Chart with the Dow Jones Chart 

If we take the most conservative technical analysis for gold using the 200 Month Moving Average  MMA   it s  975 versus  Red Line   Thus  the current gold price is 33  above its 200 MMA  However  the Dow Jones Index is 90  above its 200 MMA 

Now  I am not saying that the gold price will fall to its 200 MMA of  975  but to claim that gold is going to its pre bubble price of  400 in 2004 is preposterous when we understand the tremendous production cost increase to produce the shiny yellow metal 
While Dent believes most assets will decline during the next big deflation  he argues that the safe place to be is in cash or US Treasuries  While it may be a good idea to hold some cash during a meltdown  US Treasuries  especially the 30 Year Bond  are going to be toast when the world experiences a  Seneca Cliff  decline in US and global oil production  Without cheap and abundant oil  all the debts will implode in the future 
We must remember  US Treasuries are not assets per say  they are obligations or debts to be paid in the future  Because Dent does not understand how the Falling EROI of oil is destroying the global economy  he can claim that gold will go to  400 
However  as debts and assets disintegrate in the future  the safe assets to own will be the precious metals  Thus  gold will hold  or increase significantly  its value versus the majority of assets

189125,410641,NEM,Gold s Support Dear At Mid Year   No  450 Of 30 June  18 ,opinion,"The Gold Update by Mark Mead Baillie     450th Edition     San Francisco     30 June 2018  published each Saturday 
 Gold s Support Dear at Mid Year 

Precious metal Gold has precious little support left to save its year  Having settled the week yesterday  Friday  at 1254  price traded down through most of The Box  1280 1240   reaching as low as 1247 
Our present sense is should Gold post a weekly close sub 1240   twill be well en route to putting in a down year  barring  to quote from the  The Eiger Sanction  Clint Eastwood       something massive  something massive     happening to spur price back up 
It may not  feel  that bad to this point  but for 2018 Gold just completed its second poorest initial semester performance   3 9  as shown below in our year to date BEGOS Markets standings  of the last six years  the only worse one  of course  being 2013 s El Plungo of  26 3  through that year s first six months  Who knew back in toasting the New Year that 2018 would be  Nuthin  But Oil  
 Whoomp  there it is  Whoomp  there it is  Whoomp  there it is  


Indeed  the price of West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil has practically tripled in settling this past week at 74 25 from 11 February 2016 s low of 26 05  Where was Gold back on that wintry day  1247     as just noted  this past week s low as well  And as herein pointed out in our prior missive  Gold also was at 1247 eight years ago  Are we having fun yet   2011 s interim run to 1923 notwithstanding  
In fact  you wanna talk about crazy  Within the past two weeks from 15 June through 26 June  eight trading days  
  The Bond s  30 yr   price went up from 143 12 to 144 17   the yield falling    The Euro vs  the Dollar went up from 1 1545 to 1 1795   The Swiss Franc vs  the Dollar went up from 1 0014 to 1 0215   The Dollar Index correspondingly went down from 94 820 to 93 830       BUT         Gold went down  you can t make this stuff up   from 1306 7 to 1256 4     Are you kidding me 
This is inexplicably unexplainable 
In fact  so miserable has become the yellow metal s negativity in spite of the normally Gold Positive moves from the above markets   not to mention the  3Ds  of Debasement  Debt and Derivatives   that now we re seeing Gold falling even as the stock market falls  No safe haven flight from there to Gold  To wit  here is its percentage track vs  that of the S P 500 for the past 21 trading days  one month  

And when we view the daily bars for all eight BEGOS Markets components from a month ago to date     along with their  Baby Blues  showing the consistency of each market s linear regression trendline    we ve Gold winning the Ugly Dog Contest 

Naturally  the result of it all is Gold s having traded well down into The Box  1280 1240  as we next see here across the weekly bars from a year ago to date  the red dots of parabolic Short trend stretching to accelerate Gold s downside fate   Tis time to stop tapping the brakes and instead stand on them  Do  or die  what 

Year over year as well we ve the following percentage performance tracks for Gold   0 7   and these key precious metals equities  Newmont Mining  NYSE NEM   17 0   Goldcorp Inc  NYSE GG   5 7   the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners exchange traded fund  GDX  NYSE GDX    1 6   Franco Nevada Corporation  TO FNV   0 9   and lacking any and all respect the Global X Silver Miners exchange traded fund  SIL   14 4   And note therein the rightmost up blips in the equities without Gold itself participating  Did we mention this is inexplicably unexplainable 

As for some rightmost down blips  let s next turn to the Economic Barometer as charted from a year ago to date along with the S P 500  Despite hearing day in and day out that  Everything s Great    at the very least  the Baro has hit a bump in the road  Q1 Gross Domestic Product  originally stated on 27 April as having grown at a 2 3  annual pace  was then revised down a pip on 30 May to 2 2   and then boffed lower again this past week to 2 0   Personal Spending slowed from a 0 5  pace in April to just 0 2  for May  albeit Personal Income s pace did rise from 0 2  to 0 4    
 Well then people must be saving  mmb    
   oh do come along  Squire  Unlike you  we re not all cash machines  Moreover  the Conference Board s Consumer Confidence Index posted for June its second largest monthly drop in a year  Factor in too the S P s continuing   albeit still  stealth    25  correction targeting 2154  and here s the picture 

Neither overlook from the  They re Just Figuring This Out Now  Dept   this shock headline of the week that  according to the Congressional Budget Office   Ballooning National Debt Could Hurt US Economy  Increase Likelihood of Crisis  We know that  we ve known that for years 
Sadly what we ve also come to know for far too many years is that Gold likes to sit in The Box  1280 1240   It again has been the dominant trading area these past two weeks  made all too clear as we go to the 10 day Market Profiles for Gold on the left and Silver on the right  And were we to turn the latter s profile upright  one might daresay at 16 40 she s giving us  the finger   Really  Sister Silver   

Still  with respect to Silver s declining Moneyflow measure which we herein charted a week ago  price did succumb to the Market Rhythm Target of 15 89  so if you gutted it up to Short it down  yer buyin  drinks all  round 
To wind it all down   tis not the happiest of times for Gold  which now fragilely sits just above the base of The Box  Again  we view The Whiny 1290s down through The Box to 1240 as a critical  50 point wide support barrier for Gold through which not to entirely fall  But if it does  then that barrier morphs into one of resistance and  in turn  the year is lost    as would obviously be our forecast high of 1434    only adding to the party animal s delight below lower right as we close with the Gold Structure ",2018-07-01,Mark Mead Baillie,https://www.investing.com/analysis/golds-support-dear-at-midyear-no-450-of-30-june-18-200328785,200328785
189130,410646,NEM,The Peak Gold Problem Is Very Real,opinion,"Another day passes   and gold stays flat     
It s the most frustrating thing to watch as the price of gold drifts sideways   I grind my teeth often over it 
I know what s causing it too   at least I think I do   and that s the worst thing about it  The recent soaring dollar and the temporarily tightening central banks worldwide aren t great for gold 
But   after a couple of minutes of cursing the world   my rational and logical side kicks in  And I soon realize that the lower gold prices allow me to average down and find undervalued stocks 
Most investors don t realize a couple of things that are very important to them and their strategies     
First   just because the crowd isn t investing in something today does not mean that they won t rush in tomorrow 
Before every bull market  there was a bear market  For prices to climb higher  they must already be down 
Remember Bitcoin  Out of seemingly nowhere it became the biggest mania we ve seen in years  And the important part is   no one can explain why it suddenly took off  It s not like anything changed with the actual Bitcoin s themselves   just people s perceptions towards it 
Then once there are higher prices comes even higher prices  We call this  The Greater Fool Theory    when investors pay for something knowing someone else will pay more for it 
Soon  it becomes a vicious  self reinforcing cycle spiraling upwards 
To summarize this all together   just because gold hasn t rallied yet today doesn t mean tomorrow it won t  And when it does   it can go even higher than many think is possible 
Second   most investors  especially Wall Street  are short sighted and only invest for the immediate future  Not the long term 
Warren Buffet s pointed out this situation and why it ultimately gives retail investors such a leg up  When everyone s looking at the short run  the intelligent investors can cherry pick the long term and find deep value 
I worked as an equity analyst before   and I ll tell you from first hand experience that this is true 
For instance  when your job depends on you to make money   which is what Wall Street s all about   you can t tell investors to wait six months   or even a year  Because if you don t make money right out of the gate   investors will pull their capital out and put it in a place where they are generating profits now 
This forces traders and analysts to focus on what s going up today   even if the risks of losing money are much higher     
There were many times I saw positions that would return several fold my initial investment   but they needed time to mature  And I would be long gone   fired   before I could collect the huge harvest 
These two reasons are why I urge retail investors to take advantage of these situations   and look at them as opportunities     
So don t worry about gold today   because the next year or two will prove exactly why all that teeth grinding was worth it 
There are a couple of reasons why gold looks so good going forward   regardless of the potential weak short term     
I can sit here and tell you why the demand for gold will soar   but I d rather focus on the supply side  Since this is how the best bull markets have formed historically 
Putting it simply  we ve reached  peak gold    there just isn t enough we can find anymore 
Goldcorp s Chairman   Ian Telfer   has said the world has now reached this  peak gold  era  This means that global mine production will keep declining because all major gold deposits have already been discovered 
 Gold produced from mines has gone up pretty steadily for 40 years   Telfer tells the Financial Post   Well  either this year it starts to go down  or next year it starts to go down  or it s already going down  We re right at peak gold here  

Telfer says that at  1 300 gold or lower   it s all been found  There are no more significant potential mines out there at these prices  And the exploration records show just that 
Many forget that mining companies are self cannibalizing industries  Each ounce that s pulled out of the ground today is one less ounce for tomorrow  Therefore  they must always be looking for new sources of gold 
Telfer goes on to say how all the major mining companies   Barrick Gold Corporation  NYSE ABX   Newmont Mining Corporation  NYSE NEM   Goldcorp Inc  NYSE GG    are all  shrinking fast  

This is a very important signal that gold production worldwide is going to start declining 
Because when the peak s reached   the only way to go is down     
We need to ask ourselves  is it just one gold mining chairman s opinion  or is this  peak gold  an industry worry
Here are some other big names sounding the alarm       Pierre Lassonde   the billionaire founder of Franco Nevada Gold   also believes the same  That  peak gold  is here and current mine supplies are at risk 
Rudy Fronk   the CEO and Chairman of Seabridge Gold   said that  peak gold is the new reality  
Kevin Dushnisky   President of Barrick Gold   has said that  falling grades and production levels   as well as  a lack on new discoveries  are what s going to drive the next gold bull market 


As many know   I m a firm believer of the Austrian economist   Joseph Schumpeter    creative destruction  theory  And that the last few years of sub  1 300 gold has wrecked the sector 
Many of the old mining companies that couldn t survive have bankrupted   they re gone     
And all the remaining gold companies over produced just to make up for the lost revenues caused from a falling gold price  I call this the  running on a hamster wheel  problem   they depleted their finite resources  and burned through their cash  only to simply sustain without really going anywhere 
The thing is  analysts know this about the gold market  It s not some hidden secret  They know prices will rise   eventually  But like I said in the beginning   they would rather start buying after prices have risen than before  Because their careers depend on it 
This gives us an advantage to find the best  high quality assets that will have their valuations soar once the price of gold climbs higher 
The investment thesis is really simple  as gold production and supplies continue declining   the gold price will do very well in the long term  
We now know because of this  peak gold  situation that the  1 300 oz price level is the floor  And that overtime the price of gold will trend higher 
As I wrote earlier   we re in the early stages of a supply driven bull market  And these are the kinds of bull markets that get me most excited ",2018-07-15,Adem Tumerkan,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-peak-gold-problem-is-very-real-200330925,200330925
189131,410647,NEM,Top Gold Miners Production Declined 15  While Costs Escalate ,opinion,"Even though the gold price increased in 2018  the top gold miners production declined while costs continue to escalate  Output at three of the top gold miners in the world fell in the first half of 2018 compared to the same period last year  With rising costs due to higher energy prices  on top of decreasing production  the top gold miners free cash flow declined precipitously in 2018 
While many analysts focus on the company s profits or net income  I like to pay attention to its free cash flow  Free cash flow is nothing more than subtracting capital expenditures from the company s cash from operations  Because the gold mining industry is very capital intensive  the company s free cash flow is a better indicator of financial health rather than the net income 
As mentioned  all of the top three gold miners suffered production declines in the first half  1H  of 2018 versus the same period last year  The biggest loser was Barrick Gold Corporation  NYSE ABX   whose production declined over 20  by falling to 2 1 million oz in 1H 2018 compared to 2 7 Moz in the previous year  Goldcorp s production fell 10   while Newmont Mining Corporation s  NYSE NEM  output dropped by nearly 9  

Altogether  the top three gold mining companies  production fell 15  or approximately 1 Moz in the first six months of 2018 versus last year  Even though Goldcorp Inc  NYSE GG  isn t the third largest gold miner in the world  the company has already posted its second quarter results  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd ADR  NYSE AU  is the third largest gold miner  but it won t publish its financial statements until August 20th  Also  Kinross Gold Corporation  NYSE KGC  has probably ranked number four ahead of Goldcorp  but the company posts its production figures in  gold equivalent ounces   If a company has to publish its gold or silver production in  equivalent ounces   then the analysis is a bit flawed in my opinion 
Regardless  these top three gold miners all experienced declines in production which impacted their financial balance sheets  To get a better idea of the true cost of production and the health of the gold mining industry  I have come up with an  Adjusted Earnings Breakeven  price as well as a  Free Cash Flow  breakeven price 
The gold mining industry publishes  Cash Costs  and  All In Sustaining Costs  AISC    but those metrics deduct by product metal revenues and don t include ALL COSTS  For instance  Goldcorp publishes a much lower All In Sustaining Cost of  850 an ounce because it subtracts its by product credits from its cost analysis  Of the  1 639 million of total revenues 1H 2018  Goldcorp sold  431 million in silver  zinc  and misc metals  By deducting  431 million  or 26  of total revenues  from its cost of sales  the company can post a low  850 per oz AISC 
But  what if Goldcorp removed that  431 million in by product metal revenues from its financials  How would that impact its net income   Goldcorp suffered a  64 million net income loss 1H 2018  If we take away the  431 million in by product revenues  Goldcorp would have lost nearly  500 million  not the  64 million  Goldcorp needed that  431 million in by product metal revenue to fortify its balance sheet 
So  this is the sort of accounting gimmicks that the mining industry pulls on less sophisticated investors   which are many 
Again  I don t pay much attention to the Cash Costs  or All In Sustaining Costs as they do not provide an accurate picture of what is taking place in the gold or silver mining industry 
To get a better understanding of the financial health in the gold mining industry  we need to look at the companies free cash flow  In the first half of 2017  these top three gold miners enjoyed a combined positive free cash flow of  718 million  with the majority coming from Newmont 

Of the total  718 million in positive free cash flow  Newmont accounted for  530 million  Barrick provided  204 million  while Goldcorp posted a negative  16 million  However  free cash flow in all three decreased significantly in 1H 2018 to only  38 million  Newmont s free cash flow fell to  173 million  Barrick declined to  9 million as Goldcorp s dropped even further to a negative  144 million 
Also  my estimated  Adjusted Earnings Breakeven  for the group has also increased in 2018  If we compared my two financial metrics  adjusted income breakeven   Free Cash Flow Breakeven  to the average gold price during each period  we have the following 

As we can see in the chart above  these top three gold miners profit margins were much higher during the first half of 2017  even with a lower gold price  My estimated Adjusted Earnings Breakeven for the group was  1 126 per oz based on an average gold price of  1 243  Thus  the group s gold profit margin was nearly 10  last year  However  the Adjusted Earnings Breakeven increased to  1 230 for the group in 1H 2018  Thus  the profit margin of the group fell to 5 6  
Also  the Free Cash Flow Breakeven per ounce increased to  1 297 versus  1 138 last year  Because these top three gold miners combined free cash flow was only  38 million 1H 2018  they only made a few dollars per ounce of free cash flow  Unfortunately  free cash flow does not include dividend payouts  These three gold miners paid a combined  242 million in dividends to shareholders  While Newmont can afford to pay its  150 million in dividends  Barrick and Goldcorp did not have enough positive free cash flow to pay their dividends 
Furthermore  if you watched my newest video below  you would have found out the pathetically small amount of free cash flow the top four gold miners reported over the past twenty years  If we take that amount and divide it by their total production  the positive free cash flow was a miserable  19 per ounce 

Barrick  Newmont  AngloGold and Barrick only posted a net  7 5 billion in positive free cash flow from 1998 2017  If we divide the 391 Moz of total gold production  the net free cash flow per ounce was  19  Now compare that to the  832 average gold price during the twenty year period 
By focusing on the Free Cash Flow  over an extended period  we can see that the top gold mining companies haven t made all that much money  Also  I haven t included share dilution or the increase in debt  I will cover these in another article 
If you haven t watched my newest video about the Gold Mining Industry  I highly recommend it 

Lastly  while I provide data that suggests the gold mining industry cost of production is higher than the market reports or that the combined free cash flow has been quite small  I still believe the gold miners will be one of the few assets to own when the entire markets crash over the next several years ",2018-07-31,Steve St. Angelo,https://www.investing.com/analysis/top-gold-miners-production-declined-15-while-costs-escalate-200334733,200334733

189141,410657,NEM,Gold Stocks AKG   HMY Shining Amid Trade  Syria Tensions,opinion,Gold prices have been volatile but range bound so far this year  Prices of the metal are up more than 2  in 2018 after racking up a healthy 12  gain last year  Spot gold touched 2018 high of  1 366 an ounce on Jan 25 and the yellow metal is currently trending above the psychological level of  1 300 an ounce Prices of gold hit a 5 week high in March 2018 as a  less hawkish  Fed stance and threat of a fierce trade war between the United States and China weighed on the dollar and equities Moreover  gold prices reached their highest level since Jan 25 yesterday as concerns over a possible U S  military action against Syria sparked demand for the safe haven asset  The increasing geopolitical tensions add to the investors uncertainty while gold is sought as a store of value in these times  This provides a boost to gold prices Factors that Aid Gold s CauseThe U S  Federal Reserve raised the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 1 50  1 75  in its March meeting citing a brighter economic outlook  The Fed also maintained the number of expected rate hikes for 2018 at three  sticking to a gradual path of increases  The speculation of four hikes this year led to a plunge in dollar and provided a lift to gold prices  A slower pace of increases to interest rates augur well for gold prices Moreover  fears of an intense trade war between Washington and Beijing have gripped the equity market  weakened the dollar and worked in favor of gold in the process  Stock markets have been skittish in recent weeks over the prospects of a full blown U S  China trade war China  earlier this month  declared plans of imposing tariffs of 25  on more than 100 American products with shipment values worth as much as  50 billion  The Trump administration responded with a proposed  100 billion in additional tariffs on China  further intensifying the trade tussle between the two countries  The U S  had earlier announced sweeping tariffs on  50 billion of imports from China Nevertheless  Chinese President Xi Jinping recently said that Beijing would lower tariffs on imported cars  thereby easing trade tensions for now  However  the Chinese commerce ministry has reportedly said that China will not hesitate to fight back should the United States takes any action to escalate the situation Gold prices are also finding support of late from geopolitical tensions  President Donald Trump  yesterday  warned Russia of an imminent military action in Syria following a suspected chemical attack by the Assad Regime in the rebel held suburb of Douma  east of Damascus  that claimed several lives  Concerns over escalating tensions in Syria lead to a spurt in gold prices What s in the Cards for Bullion Uncertainties in the markets triggered by the developments over the past month are expected to continue to be supportive for gold prices as investors will shun risk assets such as equities and instead turn to gold The developments over the past month have led to a spike in shares of several gold miner including NovaGold Resources Inc    NYSE NG    Goldcorp Inc    NYSE GG    Barrick Gold Corporation   NYSE ABX   and Newmont Mining Corporation   NYSE NEM   that saw roughly 16   8   8  and 7  gains  respectively  over a month There are a number of reasons to be optimistic about gold s performance in 2018  A number of new mines entered production in fourth quarter 2017  which might support mine production till 2018  On the demand side  major markets  India and its neighbor China will continue to be growth drivers Last year  the Indian market had suffered a setback due to the impact of imposition of Good and Service Tax   GST   and anti money laundering legislation   AML   around jewelry retail transactions  We expect it to bounce back as the market adapts to GST  Moreover  government measures like mandatory hallmarking in 2018  will be a positive move for the industry Further  the United States continues to be a strong market driven by economic growth  improving employment levels and growth in consumer confidence  Demand from central banks is also expected to remain strong Market Beating Returns  Attractive ValuationThe  has advanced roughly 5 5  compared with the S P 500 s dip of 4 7  in a month s time  Going by the EV EBITDA multiple  a preferred

The industry s lower than market positioning calls for some more upside moving ahead 2 Gold Stocks Worth a LookGeopolitical tensions and lingering concerns over a trade war might reduce investors  appetite for riskier assets and fuel demand for safe haven gold  This may trigger more upside for the bullion in the near term   Below we have highlighted a couple of gold stocks that are good buys

189146,410662,NEM,The Dow Jones And The Barron s Gold Mining Index,opinion,"The stock market saw some action this week  On Tuesday the Dow Jones moved over 3  intraday  but closed only  1 74  from Monday s closing price  so I didn t count Tuesday as a day of extreme volatility  Other than that  it was a fairly boring week  with the Dow Jones staying well within an eight week trading range  In the BEV chart below  this range spans from February 26th s  3 41   25 709  down to March 23rd s  11 58   23 533   This week s close at  8 66   24 311  places the Dow Jones well within this range 

So what s next  I m expecting more of the same in the weeks to come  The problem is the market doesn t operate as it once did  There was a time  long ago  when the big players in the market were sharks looking for prey  They d circle each other looking for any indication of weakness  If they sensed vulnerability in someone s financial position   they d attack  Here s a little history of Jay Gould and Jim Fisk from the late 19th century  These guys were real stinkers 
Teddy Roosevelt  the Trust Buster  did much to domesticate the wild sprits running amuck on Wall Street  as did Franklin Roosevelt decades later  Today  the big players are like pampered pussy cats  fat  dumb and happy not to rock the boat  With a few hundred trillion dollars in derivatives at risk of coming into the money should the financial market see sufficient volatility  professors of economics applaud today s  stability  
But the flip side to this coin is when animals like Jay Gould and Jim Fisk were allowed to operate in the markets as they saw fit  no one did anything as stupid as over leveraging their positions as is common today  with cheap credit and derivatives  for fear of shark attack 
Here s the Dow Jones with its 200 count  Is the Dow Jones taking a well deserved break before it once again rises up to make history  Seeing its 200 count rise up to a 7 since early February argues against that  but who knows what tomorrow brings 

One point arguing against the bulls  case is the Dow Jones Total Market Groups  top 20 is trending down  It closed the week at a 49 in the table below  A point this table makes is since Barron s January 29th issue  the broad market hasn t recovered from the mauling Mr Bear gave it three months ago However  after the post November 2016 election advance  I m surprised the market hasn t corrected more   the top 20 declining deeper than it has below 

These corrections can last longer than investors would like them too  Go back to the BEV chart for the Dow Jones above  The last correction began in May 2015 and continued until July 2016  during which the Dow Jones twice declined 14   On the first 14  decline  August 2015  the top 20 dropped to only 40  on the second  February 2016  the top 20 bottomed at 26  see chart below  
Note  the Dow Jones and the DJTMG s top 20 seldom bottoms  or tops in the same issue of Barron s 

There s a big bad bear market somewhere over the horizon  but in April 2018 I can t say if January 26th s last all time high in the Dow Jones is the final all time high of a bull market that actually begun in August 1982  Three months after the January top in the Dow Jones  seeing the DJTMG s top 20 above close this week at 49 tells me this isn t a stock market that s in a big hurry to go down  Rather right now it just doesn t want to go up 
This can change very quickly  where in a week or two we ll see the top 20 drop ten or more as market valuations begin deflating  When that happens we ll have to assess whether or not we are in a correction in a bull market  or if Mr Bear is once again feeding on Wall Street  In either case  the current decline in the DJTMG s top 20 has a way to go  so don t be in a hurry to scoop up any cheap stocks as they may get even cheaper in the months to come 
Let s move on to gold  Like the Dow Jones  nothing much has happened to gold in the past week 

Here is something to note about gold  it s been doing nothing much since the beginning of the year as it refused to break above or below the two trend lines in the step sum chart below  The red step sum plot  market sentiment  is turning sour 
That s actually a positive for the gold market  I d like the step sum plot to make new lows for the year as the price of gold continues refusing to break below its lower trend line  That s one way a bull box is formed  The other is seen in the highlighted area for the summer of 2016 below  where the price of gold takes off inspite of the less than enthusiastic action in the red step sum plot 

The Dow Jones  Blue Plot  below is looking weak  Should it break below its current 2018 low of 23 533  it will be a continuation of a bearish pattern of lower highs and lows it began after its top in January  Its step sum  market sentiment  is trending down too  But unlike the Dow Jones  valuation plot  its step sum plot hasn t developed a pattern of lower highs and lows 
No matter  the step sum doesn t become interesting until its trend decouples from the valuation s trend for a couple of months  as seen in the bull box below  Most of the time a market s valuation and step sum trends are in synch with each other  as they are now 

Here are the step sum tables for gold and the Dow Jones  both step sums haven t done much in the past twenty five trading days  which tells us that there have been about as many advancing as declining days these past five weeks  That will change as gold and the Dow Jones moves upwards or downwards as 2018 moves onward towards 2019 
The Dow Jones Volatility 200 Day M A ended the week at 0 57   During March this metric was climbing fast  but has slowed down since the beginning of April  Rising volatility is a slayer of market advances  If this indicator reverses and begins to go down  it will be a real positive for the bulls 

If you study these tables along with gold s and the Dow Jones  step sum charts above  one thing is obvious  when a market is seeing a strong advance  or is deflating in a serious manner  the step sum s trend strongly validates the valuation s trend  That is also true in markets  such as gold and the Dow Jones now find themselves in  where for months now we don t know whether the next big move will be up or down  The information offered to us from the data above is not as insightful as I would like it to be 
So I looked at the chart below plotting the Barron s Gold Mining Index  BGMI   Blue Plot   the Dow Jones  Red Plot  and US Currency in Circulation  CinC   Green Plot  going back to 1920toget a sense of where we now stand in April 2018 
CinC is the number of paper dollars and base metal coins  injected  into the economy by the Federal Reserve  Unlike the Dow Jones or the BGMI  CinC never has  or ever will go down in a meaningful way  nor will it until the US dollar ceases to be a financial asset 
Looking at the Dow Jones and BGMI in relationship to CinC  notehow the Dow Jones during its  Roaring 20s  bull market  chart insert  actually increased above the CinC plot  Then in 1966 the Dow Jones touched the CinC plot  chart insert   But since then the Dow Jones has failed to keep up with the flows of inflation flooding the economy from the Federal Reserve  though it came close to the CinC plot at the 2000 top of the Dot Com  high tech bubble  However  in the past eighteen years the Red Dow Jones plot has been losing ground to CinC s green plot in the chart below 

Examining BGMI s blue plot with CinC s green plot above  note during the 1930s the BGMI enjoyed a bigger bull market in the Great Depression than did the Dow Jones during the Roaring 1920s  chart insert  
In 1966  when the Dow Jones touched the green CinC plot  the BGMI broke far above it  and from 1966 to 1996  three decades  the BGMI was either above the rate of inflation  CinC plot   or very near to it  The late 1990s was a bad time for anything that wasn t  high tech   so not surprisingly the BGMI declined by 80  from 1996 to its bear market low of 2001 
Now compare the Dow Jones red plot to BGMI s blue from 2001 to 2011  From its 2001 bottom the BGMI almost touched the green CinC plot in 2008  And after a seven month  70  decline  March to October 2008   once again the BGMI attempted to break above CinC s green plot in 2011 Unlike the Dow Jones  the BGMI was a dog that wanted to hunt  So  what changed after 2011 
The gold mining sector is a very small segment of the stock market  From the source below  the largest gold miner in the world is Newmont Mining  NYSE NEM  with a market capitalization of only  18 56 billion as of 2017  The top four gold mining companies have a total market capitalization of only  55 2 billion 

In a financial system that daily has flows of hundreds of  trillions of dollars circulating in it  it s not hard for Washington s  market regulators  to manhandle the gold miners  puny market capitalization  But this will only befor as long as the markets  regulators can keep those hundreds of trillions of dollars circulating in the debt and stock markets  and they will only be able to do that for as long as bond yields stay low  and the yield curve doesn t invert 
For the past two years the BGMI has remained in a very tight range  circle in chart above   One of these days  dollars by the trillions are going to flee the financial markets seeking an asset class that isn t actively deflating  or better yet finding one that is actively inflating 
When that happens  the Dow Jones plot in the chart above will drop like a rock as trillions of dollars begin fleeing deflation in the financial markets  This will be when the BGMI once again breaks above the green CinC plot as decades of dollar production attempts to squeeze into the gold mining industry s tiny market capitalization  The same will be true for gold and silver bullion  I don t know when this is going to happen  only thatit will be quite a sight to behold  and forpatient investors the wait will be worthwhile 
Barron s in the late 1930s began publishing bond yields for muni bonds and its best grade corporate bonds  Muni bond coupon payouts are tax free from the IRS  and the tax authorities from the state the bonds are issued from  It goes without saying that if someone from New York invests in California muni bonds  they shouldn t expect any tax benefits from New York for investing in California  Corporate bonds are taxable 
Traditionally  the bond market was used by governments and corporations to finance long term infrastructure projects  muni bonds for schools  water projects and roads  corporate bonds for new factories and capital equipment  However  like so much else in finance in the past few decades  past practices and standards have slipped  Local governments have issued bonds to finance current expenses such as pension obligations  and corporations for financing their share buyback programs These abuses will one day come back to haunt the bond market   if not today 
The yield gap between the two is plotted below  Negative values indicate those Barron s issues where muni bond yields were lower than best grade bonds  Unsurprisingly  for the bulk of the Barron s issues published since the late 1930s muni bond yields were lower than best grade corporate bonds  and for good reason  Muni bonds are financed by local government  city  county and state  tax base  which during times of prosperity or economic recession are stable when compared to corporate revenues which funds the coupon payments for corporate bonds 
However  since November 2010 when the plot below increased above its zero line  investors have shown a distinct bias towards taxable corporate bonds over tax free income from muni bonds  but why  If what we were taught in economics 101 is true  that higher rewards comes with higher risks  it s because the bond market is finally pricing in the risks of lending money to big city politicians and states whorefuse to live within their means 

However  since last September the yield gap between muni and corp bonds have narrowed  this week sgap was only sixteen basis points  Has the bond market begun to reassess the risks in muni bonds  Maybe  but if this horror story from Chicago is the coming trend in civil finance  I don t see how that s possible 
There re no shortage of past news articles on the pending problems local governments are having making ends meet  and the risks these problems pose for individual investors in the muni bond market  However  I could never have expected the problems in the muni bond market would sprout tentacles to snatch private citizen s automobiles off the roads  If you must to go to Chicago  you best be sure your brake and blinker lights are working 
The chart below plotting the actual yields of corporate and muni bonds tells the story  corporate bond yields since last September have increased to just below 4  from 3  while municipal bond yields have remained around 4   This is more than just a bit odd as even T bond yields have risen in the past two years  so why are muni yields so stable 

I m sure I don t know why  What I do know is there are plenty of responsible muni bond issuers who deserve low yields  But for investors  even holding bonds of the highest quality during a bond bear market  a financial market where interest rates and yields are increasing can be a painful experience  Also  investing in bonds   fixed income   denominated in a unit of exchange managed by a central bank  such as the Federal Reserve poses hazards of its own 
The table below lists the published values for 

Currency in Circulation  CinC 
Dow Jones
Dow Jones 10 Utility Bond Average  DJ 10UBA 

From Barron s 03 January 1938 issue  the first issue publishing the DJ 10UBA  and from Barron s 08 April 2002 issue when Barron s discontinued this bond data series  I also included data for CinC and the Dow Jones from these issues for a performance comparison between investing in blue chip stocks and utility bonds during a period where the Federal Reserve inflated CinC by almost 10 000  
In these two issues of Barron s  separated by sixty four years  the Dow Jones in April 2002 increased to 10 271 from only 120 in 1938  while the DJ 10UBA actually lost  1 50 in nominal dollar terms  That s not small change when you look at what a million dollars in nominal dollars invested returned in the period between these two issues of Barron s in the table s center section 
A million dollars in 1938 afforded its owner the best of everything  including a penthouse view of New York s Central Park  leaving most of the  1 000 000 to be invested in dividend yielding blue chip stocks  the Dow Jones  or  safe  high quality utility bonds to support the lifestyle of the rich  But for the million dollars invested in  high quality  utility bonds in 1938  the next sixty four years were very unkind 

Thanks to inflation flowing from the Federal Reserve a million dollars invested in utility bonds wasn t even a million dollars anymore  The Dow Jones on the other handabsorbed enough inflation to inflate a million dollars invested in blue chip stocks in 1938 to become worth  85 million dollars during these same sixty four years  while paying dividend income to their owners 
However  note howeven the Dow Jones failed to keep up with the production of inflationary dollars flowing from the Federal Reserve  When priced in constant 1938 dollar terms  a million 1938 dollars invested in blue chip stocks lost  130 000 in Barron s 08 April 2002 issue  But look at what happened to the million dollars invested in the bond market  In 1938 dollar terms it had been reduced to only  10 077 
I m anticipating the next ten years will see bond yields increase drastically higher  and the declining purchasing power of the dollar will once again squeeze the bond market as we saw above 
I pointed out the importance of the yield curve in the financial market  When short term interest rates rise above longer term bonds  bubbles are popped in the markets 
Below is a chart displaying two inverted yield curves with the yield curve from this week s close 
The top YC  Blue  is from July 1981  where not only did the Fed Funds rate soared to over 21   but the bond yields found themselves ever lower as they went out in time  This is what it took for then Fed Chairman Volcker to slay the double digit consumer price inflation that plagued the economy of the late 1970s and early 1980   a yield inversion in a Treasury bond market yielding double digits along the entire curve 
What bubble did this yield inversion pop  The 1969 to 1980 bull market in gold  silver and the BGMI 

The next inverted YC  Red  was the one that popped the sub prime mortgage bubble  Not much of an inversion of the Fed Funds Rate over the various T Bond yields  but it was enough to trigger the second deepest decline in the Dow Jones since 1885 
The last YC  Green  is from the close of this week  and this is an YC at risk of inverting in the months to come  If  or when it does  Wall Street will see some historical excitement that ultimately will reignite the bull market in gold  silver and precious metals assets like gold mining companies ",2018-04-29,Mark Lundeen,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-dow-jones--the-barrons-gold-mining-index-200310584,200310584
189149,410665,NEM,Another May Of Dismay For Gold ,opinion,"Not exactly the most cheery way to transit toward the month of May  For as we look above at Gold s comparative weekly tracks    2018 in Gold  2017 in White and 2016 in Grey    the past years  like weeks have brought dismay into May  Not that seasonality has to repeat itself  but we re not optimistic on Gold near term  especially with certain technical studies having turned negative 
That said  millennium to date  Gold has suffered but eight down Mays  as opposed to 10 for both June and October and 11 for March  However  for the past seven years  Gold hasn t posted a May net gain of even just 1  in any of them  To wit  here are Gold s May percentage changes from 2001 through 2017 

 So what has been Gold s best month  mmb  
August  Squire  In the last 17 years  Gold has had just four down Augusts  including only one  2016  since 2009   Luv August       But that is four months out from now  and in just the past week on Gold s daily chart  the MACD  Moving Average Convergence Divergence  crossed to negative  as did the Price Oscillator  and the Moneyflow slipped below its midpoint at 50  scale 100 to 0  indicative of outflow  With Gold having settled out this past week yesterday  Friday  at 1324   tis been these lower 1300s that have supported price time and again year to date  nary a trade in the 1200s  as yet   made 
Indeed to this point in 2018  with but one trading day left to complete the year s first four months  we find per the BEGOS Markets Standings that Gold still is up  barely   the bulk of trading dough having poured into Black Gold as shown here below 

Specific to real Gold  we noted a week ago price s then being within range to flip the weekly Parabolic trend from Long    which still is the case    to Short  But the wiggle room now to the ensuing week s flip price of 1316 being just eight points likely ends this 16 week run of ascending blue dots as next shown in the weekly bars  Gold s  expected daily trading range  is now 14 points  let alone the  expected weekly trading range  being 31 points  All just in time for May 

Note too that Silver s joyride binge up into the 17s did quickly unhinge  price in turn settling out the week at 16 550 for a  3 6  splat  vs  Gold s  1 0    enough to shove the Gold Silver ratio back above 80x 
Moreover we ve this view of Silver s sub par performance from a year ago to date as measured by the Global X Silver Miners exchange traded fund  SIL   10   the worst of the comparative bunch which shows Newmont Mining  NYSE NEM   24   Franco Nevada  FNV   7   Gold itself  5   the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners exchange traded fund  GDX  NYSE GDX    4  and the miraculously not under water Goldcorp  GG   unch   the latter without a year over year loss  by this monthly measure  for the first time since February 2017  Now if we could just get the miners  leverage to return   or at least after any post May dismay  

Turning from dismay to upside display is our Economic Barometer  Whilst  tis said that in the shadows lie indications of contraction and stagflation  headline metrics hitting the Econ Baro have it heading higher for a second consecutive week  Highlights there included improvements in both New and Existing Home Sales  the Employment Cost Index increasing in Q1 by 0 8  for just the second time since Q4 of 2007    indicative of better pay and compensation    all supported with sentiment improvement in surveys by both the Conference Board and University of Michigan  Perfect timing for it all to coincide with the Federal Open Market Committee were they to vote this coming Wednesday  02 May  to raise their Bank s Funds Rate up into the 1 75  to 2 00  target range  Or might further stocks shocks instead keep the FOMC in thumb twiddling mode  their preferring to stay home and watch on television the latest soap opera installment of  As the Yield Curve Flattens   Stay tuned   

Indeed with our eyes still focused on the S P 500 to correct a full 25   jumping on the southward bandwagon from the venerable McClellan family is son Tom  noting this past week that stocks   big bear market  is underway toward an indicator s  promise  of lower lows  And from the tiniest trader to the biggest behemoths in the business  it can get gruesome out there  one only need look at the Grand Duke of Derivatives  Deutsche Bank  DE DBKGn   to see that this year s declines in both stocks and bonds mauled the institution s Q1 trading results   Tis what happens when the  sell  button ain t on the firm s keyboards 
But  tis certainly on the keyboards of precious metals traders  As we turn to Gold s daily bars across the past three months to date  below left   note the  Baby Blues  of trend consistency having just now crossed below their 0  axis  whilst price in the 10 day Market Profile  below right  has burrowed itself well down  the nearby 1325 level looking quite resistive 

Such is the same stance for Sister Silver  her  Baby Blues   left  likely to accelerate lower into the new week such that price in the Profile  right  falls from this present view 

And thus it being month s end   save for one trading day   here we ve our Gold Structure graphic of monthly bars since 2011 s All Time High  One can tell that our little fiendish friend down there knows May is nigh 

In summary as you can tell  we re a bit dour on Gold and Silver as May looms     but we re also devastated by something far more dire as follows 
Emanating this past week from 18 rue d Aguesseau in Paris came the harrowing report by L Organisation Internationale de la Vigne et du Vin that  notably to the extenuating circumstances of poor weather in the EU last year  global output of wine fell to its lowest level in 60 years  Sacr  blue  mes amis  Given our personal daily dependency on this greatest gift from the gods    and with prices at the store well and truly rising    our demand alone may materially push up the rate of inflation so much so that  twill arrive at the Fed s desired level in fairly swift order   As least we re doing our part   But hopefully there shan t be too much dismay for Gold in May ",2018-04-29,Mark Mead Baillie,https://www.investing.com/analysis/another-may-of-dismay-for-gold-200310585,200310585

189169,410685,NEM,Gold Lacks Spring  What Doth The Fed Bring ,opinion,"Two trading months plus two days of 2018 already GONE  Yet across the US and  round into Europe it hardly feels like Spring is about to do so a wit   snowing here  says a text from the small Mediterranean fishing village of Monaco  put that in yer palm trees 
Neither springing so far this year is Gold  In looking at our above opening Scoreboard  yes Gold is trading at higher levels than  twas to this point in both of those prior two years  But 2018 s price track clearly lacks the spring and upside tilt seen early on in 2017 and 2016  Indeed Gold s having just been poised a mere 10 trading days ago at 1364 to spring up and over the hurdle at Base Camp 1377 instead finds price having settled out the week yesterday  Friday  at 1324  trading en route as low as 1304 
And then there s this annoying technical note  Gold s study of  weekly moneyflow  as we next show has now dipped below the red horizontal line  at 50 on a scale of 100 to 0  in the chart s lower panel  This is only the sixth such downside crossing since September 2014  in all five of those prior downside crossings  price then traveled further south by at least 32 points  a repeat of which would have us visit those  Whiny 1290s    We ll spare you the average number of points south in those prior cases  as on balance  we view Gold to be in fairly firmer stead these days  Moreover  should Gold stay stout such as to pull the moneyflow study back up above the red line without too much of a price rout  again we ll be settin  our sights on Base Camp 1377 

Staying with the weekly bars theme  below we find Gold at 1324 still with some 43 points of clearance above the parabolic flip price of 1281  Yet at present  Gold s  expected weekly trading range  is 31 points  so by that measure there s not a lot of space for downside excursion in the next week or two without flipping the trend from Long to Short  So don t flip  get a grip 

It being month s end plus two days into March   tis time to go year over year with Gold alongside these precious metals  equities as follows  from best to worst we ve Franco Nevada  TO FNV   15   Newmont Mining  NYSE NEM   13   Gold itself  7   the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners exchange traded fund  VanEck Vectors Gold Miners  NYSE GDX    1   the Global X Silver Miners exchange traded fund  Global X Silver Miners  NYSE SIL    13   and Goldcorp  NYSE GG   17   The overall picture is somewhat analogous to old Uncle Harry s vital signs monitor clamped onto the head of his hospital bed   But the lines always do better when Nurse Penelope comes in   If anyone needs some stimulative nursing out there  tis Sister Silver  her present denominator price of 16 353 and Gold s numerator of 1323 7 continue to make for an historically high ratio Gold Silver of 80 1x vs  the millennium to date average ratio of 63 0x        beep       beep       beep      

Either way  through February plus March s first two days  here are the year to date standings for the BEGOS Markets  led by the ever stalwart Swiss franc   Tis the de facto go to currency amidst uncertainty  be it by the inflation scare  the tariffs dare  the Brexit affair  more debt to bear  and or by earnings for which there s no real  there  there  Given all these scenarios  Gold ought be far higher  one might swear  But be thee not stuck with the Bond unaware 

 Course the other real bear  yet to fully emerge from its lair  is the stock market  now not so fair  Take away the Fed s punch bowl  acknowledge the S P 500 s four year earnings vacuum and we find Ms  March  to be one angry grizzly  Still barely positive at this point in 2018  the S P now at 2691 is 6 3  below our precisely called  Blow Off Top  of 2872  from which we continue to anticipate a 25  decline down to 2154  Say no more 
But wait  there is more  Has anyone been following the Economic Barometer  Its recent stint of some slowing didn t garner any mention in Federal Reserve Bank Chairman Jerome Powell s initial t te   t tes with the House Financial Services and Senate Banking Committees  And yet this past week brought us reports of a tick slower in Q4 gross domestic product growth  a drop in the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index  no growth in Construction Spending  and declines for both Durable Goods orders and Pending Home Sales   Always behind the Curve  is oft said of our Fed  Gradual rate hikes for us to dread  Here s the Baro s downside stead 

On to the  now  for the precious metals  We start with our two panel view of Gold  its daily bars for the last three months to date on the left and 10 day Market Profile on the right  And therein at left the good news continues for the  Baby Blues   the measure of 21 day linear regression trend consistency still refusing to give in to the downside  Contra to the weekly moneyflow line breaching its red 50 level  as depicted near the top of this missive   the stabilizing we see here of the blues dots  round their 0  axis defines the 21 day trend more as  trendless  rather than down  Meanwhile at right we see the dominant trading prices of 1331 as resistance and 1319 as support  a range too tight to hold in reality 

Meanwhile for Sister Silver  her  Baby Blues   below left  are still recovering from their recent low  which as noted a week ago didn t extend down to the  80  line  suggestive that the recent selling does not contain much commitment  And in her Profile  below right  we see similar to that for Gold a too tight trading range between the resistor at 16 65 and supporter at 16 45 

Finally with the turn of the monthly calendar page  here is the Gold Structure graphic with its defined pricing layers  The rightmost wee candle represents the first two trading days of March  Our red friend down there remains on the wrong side of the trade  indeed in the wrong product  Someone s got to lose 

Indeed February is already GONE  But clearly not the chill of winter  One wonders if the infamous Newsweek piece from 28 April 1975 entitled  The Cooling World  is finally being vindicated after some 43 years  We trust that same shan t extend into the price of Gold  the market forces for which still have it trading at but half its currency debasement value  So burn up the Buck and let s warm this yellow metal UP ",2018-03-05,Mark Mead Baillie,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold-lacks-spring-what-doth-the-fed-bring-200295757,200295757
189170,410686,NEM,Gold Lacks Pluck  Silver Just Stuck ,opinion,"Long time readers of The Gold Update know that our microphones are just about everywhere as we return to those placed inside the Salzburg clinical offices of esteemed analyst in the psychosis of precious metals  Dr  Youara Nichtsogut   
Dr  Nichtsogut   Ahhh  Sister Silver  such the honourable surprise is this  Your good man Gold was here October last  suffering from CEUD  
Silver   preferring to stand rather than lie upon the couch    CEUD  Doc  
Dr  Nichtsogut   Chronic Extreme Undervalaution Depression  I suppose this  too  is why you are here  
Silver   You can nix the fancy lingo  Doc  I ve fallen off the radar and am forever wearing this industrial metal jacket  Day after bleedin  day I watch Gold being priced at better than 80 times myself  while I can t even find my way out of the 16s  I ve come close to having to hock my precious metal pinstripes just to survive  I tell ya  Doc  I get no respect  
Dr  Nichtsogut   Oh you like Dangerfield  do you  We once had a patient    
Silver  interrupting    Cut the crap  Doc  I m being viewed as danger instead of being outstanding in my field  
Dr  Nichtsogut   Ok  Sister  Let s look at your chart        ya  ya  ya  your problem is obvious  38 days of SPE     uh  that s Single Price Entrapment  Our records indicate that you last had a 53 day run of SPE during 2005 when you were stuck in the 7s  The good news of course is that you re better than twice as high that level today here in the 16s  
Silver   Yeah  that s cute  Doc  but I was seven times as high at 49 back in 2011  
Dr  Nichtsogut   And so again shall you be  my dear  Just stay positive  Now  our time being up  that will be two 1893 Morgan Dollars  please    
Silver   In yer dreams  Doc    leaves in a huff  slamming door 
Dr  Nichtsogut   She always was a head strong child    
But to be sure  lacking comparative strength through Q1 in 2018 are the precious metals  Gold year to date is barely above water at  1 5   after Q1 performances in 2017 and 2016 respectively of  8 6  and  16 3   As for  stuck in the 16s  and  still seeking respect  Sister Silver  she s  3 8  through Q1  her prior three Q1 readings  2017 2015  having been  14 5    11 6  and  6 0   Here s how all the BEGOS Markets now stand  with Oil at the top and Copper the big flop 

Still through it all  we find Gold s weekly parabolic trend still in ascent  but price now just 26 points above the 1299  flip to short  level  this past shortened trading week having settled out Thursday for the yellow metal at 1325  Gold s expected daily trading range is 15 points whilst that for the weekly is 32 points  a sufficient enough distance to put us on  flip watch   Mind thereto the year s low    1304    for should it go  the Long trend likely gets the heave ho  Regardless as the year unfolds  our eyes remain on the initial prize up there at Base Camp 1377 

It being month s end  indeed quarter s end  from this time a year ago to date here next is Gold along with several of the prime precious metals equities brethren  From best performance track to worst we ve Newmont Mining  NYSE NEM   18   Gold itself  6   Franco Nevada Corporation  TO FNV   4   the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners exchange traded fund  GDX  NYSE GDX    4   Goldcorp Inc  NYSE GG   7   and the Global X Silver Miners  Gettin  no respect   exchange traded fund  Global X Silver Miners  NYSE SIL    14  

Yes that s correct  even languishing SIL is underperforming laggard GG  And not to overly harp on the Gold Silver ratio  presently 81x  and as detailed in our 04 February piece  Gold Silver Ratio Tops 80x   What Happens Next     but stints above 80x exceeding five days are extremely rare  the longest one this millennium being 18 days just in this past February and the present one now 12 days in length  There was one that reached 17 days during 2016  one of five days in 2009  and prior to that  one of six days in 2003  Be on alert either for Gold to tank without Silver suffering  improbable   else for Silver more likely to play catch up  Remember  given the millennium to date average Gold Silver ratio is 63x  a return to that with Gold flat puts Silver at 21     write it down 
Speaking of down  so remains the track of the Economic Barometer  How s that Q1 gross domestic product growth of  2 9  workin  out for ya  Or that record  92 billion StateSide increase in credit card debt last year  That s greater than a full month s dosage of  80 billion back during QE purchases    and the outstanding balance of such costly debt now exceeding  1 trillion is more than a year s dosage of QE purchases  Creepeth ever lower  our Baro  Shan t be on television  but  tis here 

As for the S P 500  red line   now at 2641  tis  8  from its 2872 all time high  so  17  more to go shall bring us  25  to 2154 in toto   just in case yer frettin  at home over yer faux dough

As for the 10 day Market Profiles  Gold  below left  has fallen back into its thicket of supporters as depicted  whilst Sister Silver  below right  tested hers at 16 25  indeed finishing the week on Thursday at her high trade for that day     encouraging perhaps  but given price at just 16 340  hardly are we impressed 

So with both the month and quarter  sounds like a pub  in the books  to Gold s structure chart we go with its defined pricing zones  Again  the nearest pronounced highlight therein per the arrow remains Base Camp 1377   So close     and yet so far      Herv  Villechaize as  Nick Nack    The Man with the Golden Gun   Eon Productions   74   Get up through 1377 and then we ll focus on some real Golden Fun

189184,410700,NEM,Multi Year Breakout In Gold At  1400 Could Boost Junior Miners ,opinion," We see a breakout at  1 400 in gold  which could mean new multiyear highs   said Jeb Handwerger  editor of GoldStockTrades com  which offers a newsletter focusing on mining exploration companies  Gold futures haven t topped  1 400 since 2013 

A decline in the value of the U S  dollar has recently helped boost dollar denominated prices of gold  but Handwerger pointed out that  many investors have been diverted away from mining into much more speculative areas like blockchain and cannabis  

 Even investment conferences and newsletter writers who were once gold bugs are now cryptocurrency gurus   and this is very similar to 1999 when gold bulls became dot com gurus   he said   Eventually  we will have another gold rush possibly even bigger than the late 70s but possibly more like the 30s  

Given all that  he expects  a lot of institutional capital to return and significant short covering that could cause the price to gap to  1 750   Gold futures haven t settled above that level since 2012 

And  the miners boom after gold makes a sustainable move   said Handwerger 

Even at a  1 400 gold prices  he expects junior gold miners  which are exploration companies in search of new gold deposits  to soar  That  could set off a huge  merger and acquisition  push by the major  gold mining companies  to replace their reserves  which have been in decline   Handwerger said 
Year to date  the exchange traded VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners fund VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners  NYSE GDXJ    0 09  has climbed 1 3  
Handwerger believes investors should  avoid the royalty companies in this part of the cycle  those that help fund exploration and production projects and instead look at some of lowest cost producers  especially in Nevada  like Barrick Gold Corporation  NYSE ABX    0 20  Kinross Gold Corporation  NYSE KGC    1 18  and Newmont Mining Corp  NYSE NEM    0 07 
He said he doesn t personally own shares in the large producers  but does invest in the  developers and explorers with proven management teams and world class assets backed by top sponsors  preferably below the  50 million market cap  that may eventually get bought out by the majors  ",2018-01-21,Jeb Handwerger,https://www.investing.com/analysis/multiyear-breakout-in-gold-at-1400-could-boost-junior-miners-200282005,200282005
189185,410701,NEM,U S  Gold Reports New Mineralization Zone At Copper King,opinion,"U S  Gold Corp   NASDAQ USAU  is picking up attention at the start of this week on news that the company has just announced  and released  the results from an end of 2017 drilling effort at one of its lead North American projects 
Here s what the announcement covers and what it means for the company going forward 
For anyone new to US Gold  the company is a gold and natural resources exploration company that s headquartered in Nevada and has two primary projects in development   one called Keystone  which is located along the Cortez trend in the just mentioned Nevada and another called Copper King  which is located in Southeast Wyoming 
US Gold s leadership team includes Dave Mathewson as Vice President of Exploration  who led the discovery and development of some of Newmont Mining Corporation s  NYSE NEM  top deposits throughout the last two decades and also founded and built Gold Standard Ventures Corp   TO GSV  
Anyway  let s get to the latest news 
As mentioned  it relates to some fresh drilling results from the company s Copper King project  which  again as mentioned above  is the project that s located in Southeast Wyoming 
This project came with a completed Preliminary Economic Assessment when US Gold acquired it  which was completed by Mine Development Associates back in 2012  The latest drilling program is an attempt to build on this PEA  which was updated  again by Mine Development Associates  at the end of last year 
Before jumping into the most recent results  it s worth touching on the outcome of the updated PEA   it resulted in the current known deposit showing a Net Present Value  NPV  for the project of  178 5 million at  1 275 per ounce gold price and  2 80 per lb  copper price 
So  the latest drilling results derive from a four hole  reverse circulation drilling program with a 3 945 feet 1 202 meter total drill depth  It was designed to provide what s called a  first pass drill test  of anomalies obtained from a ground magnetics survey that the company carried out in June last year and combined with an induced polarization  IP  survey conducted that was completed by another entity  Zonge Geosciences  in October 2017 
The program included four holes but it s one of these holes that s really grabbed the attention of markets  The hole is called CK17 01rc and it was a 1 030 feet deep hole located around 200 meters from the existing deposit  which is the deposit covered by the existing and recently updated PEA 
As per the results  hole CK17 01rc encountered a composite of almost 700 feet of base and precious metal mineralization beginning almost at the surface  with gold  silver copper and zinc all encountered at between 20 85 feet  Mineralization of all four continues right down to the 940 1025 feet bracket  pointing to the fact that this is the strongest anomaly obtained by the above mentioned IP survey on the property  Further  and just as interestingly from a market response perspective  this is an anomaly that had not previously been specifically tested by drilling and that  as a result  had essentially escaped detection on the back of all previous activity at the site 
The company believes that the new discovery zone could extend further west and  if this proves true  could add additional potential upside to the known deposit and could necessitate a further updating of the PEA that s in place at Copper King ",2018-01-30,Samuel Rae,https://www.investing.com/analysis/us-gold-corp-usau-just-reported-a-new-mineralization-zone-at-copper-king-200285003,200285003
189186,410702,NEM,Gold Silver Ratio Tops 80X  What Happens Next ,opinion,"Throughout this millennium  the rare instance of the Gold Silver ratio topping 80x has always bode well for the white metal  We ll show you 
But first  this short  pun    swift statement on the stock market  at last Sunday s Investors Roundtable  in suggesting that the S P 500 had just put in its high for the year and then querying if anyone else might agree   No no no   they laughed  We ll see if they show up tomorrow   albeit one participant admitted as being  engendered with a sense of doom   
Now  for just the fourth time  give or take some immaterial flutter  since 2001  the ratio of Gold s price to that for Silver has just crossed above 80x  Gold settled out the week yesterday  Friday  at 1335 2 and Silver at 16 555  That puts the ratio at 80 7x  Here s its chart  noting in red the three prior eclipses of the 80x level  and now the fourth 

What happens next  Here s the history of the three prior occurrences looking forward six months in each case 
  1st   02 June 2003  Silver settles at 4 540  within six months it settles at 5 485   20 8  
  2nd   17 September 2008  Silver settles at 10 52  within six months it settles at 14 420   37 1  
  3rd   23 February 2016  Silver settles at 15 300  within six months it settles at 20 665   35 1  
 But how did gold do during those same periods  mmb  
Squire poses the perfect question  Here s the answer  from those three exact dates  Gold settled higher within six months respectively by as much as   10 3    18 3    11 8   The defense rests 
 Course  from the  Past Performance Does Not Guarantee Future Results Dept    one has to only look at the stock market  Earnings  or lack thereof  suggest it ought have crashed nearly three years ago  yet  tis only just starting now  But specific to the Gold Silver ratio  should the white metal again score increases of 20  40  within the ensuing six months  the leverage that infuses into mining company stock prices ought see them turn white hot 
As for the stock market in general  in having a week ago cited its vertical  Blow Off Top   an astute investing friend of ours then suggested the S P 500 as literally poised to keel over backward as we see per the red curve here in this 30 year to date view   the actual  damage  of this past week being so comparably infinitesimal that you can barely see it  

So all that s just for openers  It now being month end  plus two trading days  here are the young year to date standings of the BEGOS Markets  Note that the S P is still actually up     at least for the moment   Course  the key component in the stack is the last place Bond  the longer end of the interest rate curve on the ascent  The yield on the 10 year U S  Treasury Note closed out 2017 at 2 405    tis presently 2 854      and you ll receive the Note s par value in return at maturity  The yield on the S P is presently 1 823      and you ve no idea what you ll actually get back once you capitulate   Yeah  we re feelin  a bit bearish out there   Here are the standings 

On to Gold s daily percentage track from one year ago to date coupled with those of these precious metals equities  Franco Nevada  FNV   12   Gold itself  10   Newmont Mining  NYSE NEM   6   the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners exchange traded fund  VanEck Vectors Gold Miners  NYSE GDX    6   Goldcorp  NYSE GG   16   and the Global X Silver Miners exchange traded fund  NYSE SIL   21   Did we mention the Gold Silver ratio is  80x  I believe we did 

Specific to Gold itself  here are its weekly bars from a year ago to date  Quite dubious we were a week back about Gold being able to score a seventh consecutive  higher high   which indeed did not materialize  Blame it part on the Dollar Index firming just above the critical support we showed a week ago  round the 88 150 area  going on to settle yesterday at 89 045  More importantly  upon Gold s having already taken out 2017 s high  1362  on 25 January  every precious metal eye in the world sees price having neared the vaunted Base Camp 1377 level  in turn bringing the clarion call to be careful  Rather  we view it as the rallying cry to get ready  Our  conservative  forecast high of 1434 ain t sittin  up there in the scoreboard fer nuthin    Specially should the parabolic Long trend  rising blue dots in this chart  just be gettin  started 

Speaking of dots and given the increasing volatility  per a gander at our Market Ranges page  across the BEGOS Markets  here for all eight of them are the daily bars of the past 21 trading days  their respective grey trendlines  and their  Baby Blues  depicting the day by day consistency of those trends  Might someone please notify Sister Silver to stop imitating the stock market  After all  she s a hard asset  not a wastebasket 

As to the near term trading view for the precious metals  here next are their 10 day Market Profiles  For Gold on the left  price has traveled deep into its Profile lows  yet has stayed above the low from two weeks ago  But in the case for Silver on the right  we ve an  Oh no      price having taken out the prior four weeks  lows 

And no  we ve not forgotten the Econ Baro  for which we ve quite the view below  the S P 500 commencing a correction due both years and thousands of earnings reports ago  Still  the Economic Barometer put in a pretty robust week  highlighted by gains from December s Factory Orders and January s Non Farm Payrolls     albeit Hourly Earnings growth did not accelerate and the Average Workweek actually shortened  However  fueling the inflation front came an increase not just in December s Personal Income  but also in that month s PCE  Personal Consumption Expenditure  Price Index  Here s the Baro 

So with another month in books  plus two February trading days  the rightmost red nub   we wrap it up with our Gold Structure as charted by the month since price s All Time High of 1923  06 September 2011   all those lovely upside defined layers waiting in the wings  And again we can t say it enough  the doors really open wide once Gold takes out Base Camp 1377 in stride 

To close   twould not appear we ve one s garden variety ride  round February s financial circuit this year  So pull firmly down on that shoulder harness  make sure your helmet and attendant  HANS device  are firmly set in place  give due deference to managing the tyres  and hopefully you ll bring it home lookin  Golden ",2018-02-05,Mark Mead Baillie,https://www.investing.com/analysis/goldsilver-ratio-tops-80x--what-happens-next-200286843,200286843

189188,410704,NEM,Top Gold Miners  Supply Set To Fall Right When Investor Demand Is Poised To Soar,opinion,"The gold market is setting up for a perfect storm as the top mining producers  supply is forecasted to decline right when demand is likely to surge  The surge in gold demand will occur as the broader stock markets roll over and begin their inevitable massive correction  Due to the tremendous amount of leverage in the system  the coming market correction will be quite violent at times  If investors believe the correction is over  and high times are here again  then they haven t learned anything about the cyclical nature of markets 
For example  I have stated that Bitcoin and the crypto market are classic bubbles  and wasn t at all surprised by the collapse of the Bitcoin price from  20 000 to  6 500 in a short period  However  now that Bitcoin and the crypto market have reversed  I see analysis and comments that anyone suggesting that Bitcoin is in a bubble is flat out wrong  I would kindly like to remind these individuals that markets don t go down in a straight line 
We can see this quite clearly in the following two charts  from the article  

The price of Bitcoin in 2013 surged higher  crashed and then corrected higher before falling over the following year  The same thing took place in 2013 and 2014 

At the end of 2013  the Bitcoin price surged more than ten times to a high of  1 150 before falling to nearly  500  reversed direction and shot back up to  900   However  over the next year  the Bitcoin price trend was lower 
Now  I ve put this chart together to compare the current Bitcoin price trend with the previous graphs 

As we can see  after Bitcoin fell from nearly  20 000 to  6 500  it reversed and quickly added  5 000  But  this is exactly how corrections behave  as they did for Bitcoin in the past  Moreover  the Bitcoin price may move even higher before it starts to sell off in the longer run  Unfortunately  the notion that Bitcoin will continue to endure these corrections on its way to  100 000 or  1 000 000 will likely disappoint crypto investors who are counting on a wealthy lifestyle from their tremendous digital Bitcoin profits 
I realize my opinion on Bitcoin and the Crypto Market runs counter to many followers or a percentage of the Alternative Media  While a decentralized cryptocurrency seems much more appealing than our present highly leveraged debt based fiat monetary system  it has degraded to nothing more than mere hype and speculation  Furthermore  even though blockchain technology offers positive solutions  it can function quite nicely without the highly speculative crypto coin values  
In a nutshell  blockchain and hashgraph technology can offer useful solutions  however  rampant speculation causing volatile cryptocurrency values are worthless distractions  Regardless  Bitcoin and the Crypto Market are behaving like classic bubbles and will eventually end up at the same value from where they started  So  it s probably a good tactic for crypto investors to consider SELLING THE RALLIES rather than BUYING THE DIPS 
Top Gold Producers Mine Supply To Fall As Future Demand Surges
If we understand that the stock and crypto markets are bubbles  then it can be said that the opposite is true for precious metals  Thus  when these bubbles pop  logic suggests that investors will seek the 2 000  year store of value history of the precious metals  As I have mentioned in several articles and videos  investors moved into gold in a big way during market turmoil  The two record quarters of Gold ETF  NYSE GLD  flows were Q1 2009 and Q1 2016  Both periods had one thing in common  investors panicked into gold because they thought stock markets would continue to head much lower 
While the Dow Jones Index fell 3 000 points and has reversed much higher  this is only the first stage of the massive correction and crash to come  Again  stock markets don t go down in a straight line  
If we apply the logic that investors will return to buying gold hand over fist as equity markets sell off  they will be doing so right at a time when supply from the top miners declines  According to Barrick Gold  NYSE ABX s year end report  production will decrease from 5 3 million oz  Moz  in 2017 to 4 7 Moz in 2018 and even lower to 4 4 Moz in 2019  In just two years  the largest gold producer in the world is forecasted to lose nearly one million oz of production 
If we look at the top four gold miners past production  Barrick  Newmont Mining Corporation  NYSE NEM   AngloGold  NYSE AU    Goldcorp  NYSE GG   and the forecast for future supply  the picture isn t pretty 

What a difference since 2011 when the top four gold miners were producing 20 4 Moz  In just six years  the combined production from these top gold miners fell by 3 7 Moz to 16 7 Moz  While the majority of the decline came from Barrick  Newmont and AngloGold suffered production decreases of 700 000 oz each during the same period  The only miner in the group that experienced an increase in production was Goldcorp  However  Goldcorp s production peaked in 2015 at 3 5 Moz and has fallen to 2 6 Moz in 2017 
The problem that all these gold mining companies are facing is the consequence of the Falling EROI  Energy Returned On Investment  of energy on their ability to sustain or increase production  Moreover  the rapid decline in the gold price since 2012 has destroyed the ability for these gold miners to invest enough capital to sustain or increase production  This next chart shows the dramatic reduction in capital expenditures  CAPEX  in the top four gold miners 

The combined CAPEX spending for these top gold miners fell from  14 3 billion in 2012 to a low of  3 6 billion in 2016  That s a staggering 75  decline in CAPEX spending in just four years  While it is true that new gold mining projects take a decade to arrive at commercial production status  the rapid decline in CAPEX spending has seriously hurt the top gold miners ability to sustain or grow production 
Unfortunately  the forecast of continued falling mine supply from these top gold producers will take place right at the same time as investors will be moving into gold in a BIG WAY  Thus  a spike in demand will cause the gold price to increase  but it will still take years for these miners to increase production  Thus  a surging gold price will not impact gold mine supply for years  if ever 
I say   If ever   because there is still the issue of the Falling EROI and its impact on the U S  and global oil production  I know that sounds insane to say as U S  oil production hits new record highs  but future production at this level is not sustainable  I posted this chart in a previous article  and it s worth looking at once again 

While anti peak oil enthusiasts are smacking each other on the back pointing to the supposed success that technology has solved the issue of resource depletion and thermodynamics  the tremendous rise of U S  shale oil production will be a FLASH IN THE PAN  Another easy way to explain the U S  shale oil phenomenon is by applying the simple logic 
    What goes up quickly  also comes down quickly 
Lastly  as the stock and crypto markets correct higher  they won t do so forever  Matter a fact  they will likely correct lower much quicker than investors realize  Also  while the broader markets are in a bubble  the Crypto market is in a massive bubble 
As investors flee bubble assets  if they are smart and prudent  they will move into gold and silver to protect wealth  Unfortunately  just at the time when investors are moving into gold in record numbers  the mine supply from the top gold producers will continue to fall  This is a perfect storm that will cause much higher gold prices for investors who are wise enough to see it ",2018-02-20,Steve St. Angelo,https://www.investing.com/analysis/top-gold-producers-mine-supply-to-fall-right-when-potential-investment-demand-200291902,200291902
189197,410713,NEM,Gold s 2018 High  Conservatively 1434  Aggressively 1526 ,opinion,"Conservative Gold High Target for 2018  1434
Flashback to Stateside Tax Day  15 April 2013  Do you remember what really got  taxed  that day  Gold  high to low it fell 160 points from 1495 to 1335  the largest single day points thrashing through this millennium s 17 years  and on a percentage basis   10 7    the third worst of the bunch  Following that fallout  Gold continued through springtime attempting to spring back  only to then bang about between the upper 1300s and lower 1400s  Then come 28 August of that year  gold reached up to tag 1434  only to have traded lower ever since  That s the bad news 
The good news is that the rampant  bad mouth impugning of gold is down to a few also rans   who perhaps are blindly buying Bitcoin   And let s face it  not only has gold s price consolidated since the December 2015 low of 1045  but despite seemingly having been stuck forever in the 1200s  it has put in fairly respectable years back to back with net gains of 9  in 2016 and now 13  for 2017  closing out the latter yesterday  Friday  at 1305 
 Course since the dollar s unraveling to the Gold Standard  from 1975 there have been 25 up years for Gold  their median annual net gain being 18    for the 18 down years  their median annual net loss is 8    So the two most recent years of net percentage gains for gold have been clearly been below par  And per the above Scoreboard  the dirty little secret that agonizes us all is that gold by U S  currency debasement alone ought rightly be presently priced at 2781  To reach that level during 2018 requires a price rise of 113    Tis not gonna happen   barring 2018 becoming a re run of 1979 when gold recorded a net gain of 136   1978 s gain running a distant second at only 37   
That said  we see very minimal downside risk for Gold in 2018  Rather  the key is yet again returning up to Base Camp 1377  2016 s high and 2017 s  near high  of 1362   Then at 1377 we look for the fun to begin  You know the old trading expression that  Triple tops are meant to be broken   As price closes in on 1377   twouldn t surprise us a wit see a zillion buy stops hit the market just in or above there  That in turn ought open the top fuel dragstrip for the nitro burning drive back above 1400  the finish line being a retest of 1434 for the year s high  Dramatic  Perhaps  But still conservative as the overall run from 1305 to our 1434 target would be but a 9 9  gain 
Aggressive Gold High Target for 2018  1526 This one s easy  You might recall the following graphic from our 19 August 2017 piece   Gold 1300   Stuck Anew  Or Set to Brew     It simply shows us that given the limited amount of time gold spent in the 1400s and 1500s that  tis really  nuthin  but air  up to the 1600s  Or as an esteemed trader colleague of ours would quip   All gaps get filled   Why our specifically targeting 1526   Twas the key structural centerpiece low  in May 2012  in gold s topping process that ran from August 2011 to April 2013  From here at 1305  achieving 1526 in 2018 would be a 16 9  gain  Here s the reprised graphic 

As for putting the trading bow on 2017  here are the final standings for the BEGOS Markets  The year s theme song   Down with the Dollar  Up with the World   But here s the real take  industrial metal Cousin Copper rose a dominant 31 4   precious metal gold finished mid pack with a rise of 13 3   yet the paired metal Sister Silver managed just a 6 4  gain  The Gold Silver ratio finished the year at 76 8x  the ratio s millennium to date median is 63 2x   Hint Hint  Wink Wink  Nudge Nudge  Elbow Elbow  

Specific to gold  in looking at its weekly bars with the descending red dots of parabolic Short trend and rising dashed regression line  we queried a week ago     A meeting of them all at 1300  It does have  that look      Look indeed  1300 achieved 

Also year over year for gold along with some of the key precious metals equities we find Franco Nevada Corporation  NYSE FNV   30   the yellow metal itself  13   the miners chasmatically behind as measured by the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners exchange traded fund  GDX  NYSE GDX    7   which includes Newmont Mining  NYSE NEM   6   the Global X Silver Miners  NYSE SIL   3   and taking up the rear the gangly galloper Goldcorp Inc  NYSE GG   8   The year s tune for the miners   Ma leverage dun hemorrhaged     

On to 2017 s Economic Barometer  which from late in Q3 through most of Q4 went on its steepest upside tear since our compiling EconData from as far back as 1998  As for the  I wanna be like Bitcoin too   S P 500  just how expensive has it become   You best be sitting down for this   If we kindly  benevolently  dare we say conservatively eliminate all of the S P s constituents having earnings of less than  1 share on a trailing 12 month basis  that leaves us with the  S P 424   the  live  price earnings ratio for which right now is 34 0x   more than double the taught  norm    Shall the 40  reduction in the corporate income tax rate serve to double earnings  Or will the S P  presently 2674  halve itself to 1337  If a bit of both  the  mid point  is practically smack on S P 2000  Just a thought for some post New Year sobering 

As for the precious metals near term  let s first bring up Sister Silver toward giving her some of the attention she s lacked so much this past year  On the left  Silver s daily bars have been rising like a phoenix  the baby blue dots of 21 day linear regression trend consistency racing astride in upward glide  On the right  the 10 day Market Profile suggests trading support down to 16 75 

Quite similar to those for silver do we find gold s two panels  the daily bars below left and Profile below right  Indeed should you peek at the website s copper page  the patterns there also look very much the same  Pedals to the Metals in 2018  baby 

In closing out 2017 s colourful graphics parade  here is our broad based Gold Structure graphic  the upper strata designations longing to be penetrated  Again our aggressive gold high call for 2018 is 1526   tis not enough to clear the basement  sous sol  such as to get back up onto The Floor  yet we d certainly welcome so much more 

So there  tis  folks  Arrivederci to 2017  and for gold and silver  let s bring it on in 2018  Technically  Gold s consolidation these last two years with an upside bias is supportive of driving price to higher levels  Fundamentally we see nary a wit to get out of gold   Oh   tis all about bitcoin    they say  to which we say  BS   Oh   tis all about rising interest rates    they say  to which we say remember 2004 2006  If you don t  put down that glass of champagne and look it up  Indeed LOOK up  for that s where we ll see gold in 2018 ",2018-01-01,Mark Mead Baillie,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold39s-2018-high-conservatively-1434-aggressively-1526-200276817,200276817
189198,410714,NEM,Don t Worry About Market Volatility  Buy 5 Low Beta Stocks,opinion,Investors generally believe only risky stocks could garner better returns than the market  The strategy works only when the market remains bullish  In a bearish market  the scenario  however  will be opposite   In this article  we have proven that less risky stocks can also reward investors with handsome returns if some specific parameters are considered while building an investment strategy Beta UnderstandingBeta measures the volatility or risks to a security relative to the market  we are considering the S P 500 here   That is  beta measures the extent to which the price of a stock moves with respect to the market If the beta is equal to 1 it means that the stock is as volatile as the market  So  a stock is relatively more volatile if it has beta greater than 1 and less volatile if beta is less than 1 For example  if the beta is 1 8 then the stock will witness 80  more movement than the market   Hence  we can say that if the market goes up  the stock will outperform by 80   Conversely  if the market plunges  the stock will lose much more value than the market Building a Low Risk PortfolioIn order to find stocks with lower than market volatility  we added beta between 0 and 0 6 as our main criterion for screening  However  we need to keep in mind that low beta is not the only metric to be considered for choosing stocks in a volatile market  Hence to reach the winning strategy  we have considered a few additional criteria Percentage Change in Price in the last 4 Weeks  We considered those stocks that saw positive price movement over the last month Average 20 Day Volume greater than or equal to 50 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stocks are easily tradable Price

189212,410728,NEM,Gold  Monotony Of Waiting For Price To Return  It Will  Eventually ,opinion,"We start by dusting off our dog eared Funkin  Wagnalls dictionary 
  mo not o ny noun  lack of variety and interest  tedious repetition and routine   Gold s state of being forever stuck in the  1 200s is one of monotony  
  des ti ny noun  an event that will necessarily happen to a particular thing in the future   Gold s date of being priced beyond  2 000 is one of destiny  
  when adverb  at what time   Better to be in before the when than wait  til then  
 But time is money  mmb    
So is Gold  Squire  as well as its being a store of value   unlike popular equities past such as Bear Stearns which slid from  159 to  2  or Enron  its skid from  90 to 60   or even contemporarily the 35 companies in the S P 500 that have negative  earnings   
Still  per our opening Gold Scoreboard  price remains well behind the currency debasement curve  by which  with a tip of the cap to the World Gold Council for confirming to us their updated Gold tonnage figure  we calculate ought have price today at 2760  rather than at 1275 per yesterday s  Friday s  settle 
Monotony indeed  considering that a year ago today Gold was but a buck higher at 1276  Yet since then  the S P 500 is up 21  from 2133 to 2581  And you can forget the old saw that Gold and the S P cannot significantly rise together  year over year from 23 July 2010 through 22 July 2011  the S P rose 22 0   from 1103 to 1345  whilst Gold simultaneously rose 35 4   from 1189 to 1600   at which time you ll recall our writing about Gold s  getting ahead of itself    Course today  from  The Dept  of Duh     tis horribly behind itself 
Now we re not quite at month end  but let s so treat it  given Monday and Tuesday  30 and 31 October  are but two trading days ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee s policy statement on Wednesday  01 November   typically in anticipation of that  there s not much early week market movement  So here we go with our 10 month  less two trading days  year to date standings of the BEGOS Markets  wherein we see  Cousin Coppa partyin  like there s no tommorra   whilst the declining Dollar Index is en route to its worst annual loss in 10 years   8 1  back in 2007     a year in which Gold rose 31 3   

Specific to Gold and its equity mates from a year ago to date  the picture doesn t look so great  Save for Franco Nevada  NYSE FNV   25   we find Newmont Mining  NYSE NEM   3   Gold itself as noted  unch   the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners exchange traded fund  NYSE GDX   5   Goldcorp  NYSE GG   11   and the Global X Silver Miners exchange traded fund  NYSE SIL   20   Here are their not so crack percentage tracks 

And as a great and good friend of The Gold Update frequently reminds us  the present Gold Silver ratio is 75 6x versus the average millennium to date ratio of 62 7x  Simply to return to that mean requires Silver rising from its present 16 87 level to 20 33  or Gold declining from the present 1275 to 1058     or something by both in between  But our lean is for Silver to rise rather than Gold decline  as by the Copper Silver ratio   presently  184 vs  average  173   we ought find Silver at nearly 18  Time Sister Silver gets a little industrial metal polish to enhance her precious metal luster 
But lackluster as we d anticipated is now the state of Gold s weekly bars  their parabolic trend having flipped to Short   Twas a fun Long trend run up to the year s high of 1362  falling just shy of last year s high at Base Camp 1377  only to now be back down here at 1275  a level first achieved over seven years ago on 14 September 2010  The StateSide money supply  M2  alone on that day was  8 67 trillion     today  tis 59  higher at  13 74 trillion   hint hint  nudge nudge  elbow elbow   Here s the weekly bars chart from a year ago to date  replete with the ever present purple bounded centerpiece of The Box  1280 1240    which we hope doesn t get bust   along with the first fresh red dot of parabolic Short trend 

 Course of late  from bust to boom has gone the Baro  which in a sense may belie the new release of U S  annualized 3  growth in gross domestic product as some two months of the data making up the third quarter was recorded during the blue line s decline  Still  the Baro s burgeoning up through October  on September data  helped the GDP spree in Q3     from which in turn we ll likely see a rate hike from the FOMC 

As for the precious metals  good timing is not all that it could be  So in turning to the daily bars over the past three months for both Gold on the left and Silver on the right  in both cases we see the baby blue dots of 21 day linear regression trend consistency running out of puff rather than completing the trip up to the  80  level  the latter run having generally been their wont throughout the year 

Still  the rightmost bar in both of the above panels shows price resilience as buyers came in post GDP report on Friday to push levels to session highs right up into the close  That is below reflected as well in the 10 day Market Profiles for Gold  left  and Silver  right   And for the bazillionth time   tis all about Gold getting at least back above the top of The Box  1280  and for Silver to reclaim at least 17 00 

Finally in concert with month end we go to Gold s structure  it s defined upper strata still lying in wait for price s inevitable return  despite the heated machinations of the wee fellow down below 

In closing  as noted  the FOMC folks are gathering this Halloween  Tuesday  toward providing us with their next policy statement on All Hallows  Day  Wednesday   So what ll it be  FOMC  Trick  or Treat

189226,410742,NEM,Gold Superb Through The Year s Second Third ,opinion,"For the fervent follower of Gold  to say  tis been  superb  year to date may seem at first blush an excessively exaggerative stretch  given the above panel s showing us that price is but one point above where  twas at this time a year ago    and to just be in sync with currency debasement    ought be at 2716 rather than at yesterday s  Friday s  settle of 1330  Indeed to some   paltry  might appear a more proper adjective  even as this is Gold s highest weekly settle since mid September a year ago 
Still  let s go inside the numbers  Through August and a day in 2017  Gold is  15 4   For the 45 years going back through 1975  this is Gold s eighth best January through August percentage performance  and the fourth best like performance millennium to date  Considering the drudging Gold has endured these past six years  not to mention its ridiculously low valuation  we d say this year s performance to date is superb 
Further  given our quip that  change is an illusion whereas price is the truth   let s take a look at this present 1330 level   tis but 47 points   3 4   below last year s high up at Base Camp 1377  And as you regular readers know  from 1377 up to the 1600s is a fairly unfettered path  That s pretty superb as well 
Fact is  were it not for our topper Cousin Copper   twould be Gold sitting atop the year to date BEGOS Market Standings with eight months plus one trading day in the books 

Time was  of course  when one referred to the red metal as  Dr  Copper  given its prowess as a leading economic indicator  prior to global demand then softening  in turn relegating Copper to merely a metals family cousin  But in 2017 with a purported pickup in China s demand and striking supply concerns  pedal to the metal Copper is red lining its tachometer  in stark negative correlation to our StateSide Economic Barometer  Below with the Baro we ve also the red line which is the ever correctionless stock market as depicted by the S P 500 Index from one year ago to date 

 Jeepers  mmb  that s quite a sudden plunge  
Squire  just because some of the  headline  numbers such as an upwardly revised Gross Domestic Product  along with improvements in Personal Income and Spending  Consumer Confidence and the Institute for Supply Management s manufacturing survey are all attractive  other core foundational hard data is not looking so good  growth in Non Farm Payrolls slipped as did that for Hourly Earnings  the Unemployment Rate ticked up  the Average Workweek was reduced  the rate of layoffs rose  vehicle sales declined  and Construction Spending actually shrunk as did the level of Pending Home Sales  Still confident after reading that 
Here s something that is a confidence builder  below in the chart of Gold s weekly bars we see the blue dots of parabolic Long trend now ascending at a better pace than that of their four week failure during June  And not only does the rightmost bar mark Gold s second strongest week year to date  moreover the dashed trend line across the graphic now is rising in rousing Vicki Sue Robinson  Turn the Beat Around  1976  style 

 That s nice  but don t slip your disco there mmb    
Tu parles toi  Squire   En route in visits to Amsteg  the lad s own dancing antics have become quite popular at Lausanne s XOXO Club   
But the point is   tis energizing to see Gold on the improve both near term and broader term  rather than suffering through the annoyance of up stints running out of puff within an overall downtrend  That looks to be changing  and explains to some degree why Gold s  Baby Blues     those dots below shown that depict 21 day linear regression trend consistency    have hovered as high as they have for as long as they have  More so  they ve curled back upward as we below see on the left  the 10 day Market Profile on the right 

 Course  leave it to our  Nothing Keeps Going in a Straight Line Dept   to caution us from the website s Market Values page with this next graphic  wherein we see from one year ago to date Gold presently some 50 points  high  above its smooth pearly valuation line  born of the yellow metal s changes relative to those of the other four primary BEGOS Markets  You can see per the oscillator in the lower panel that the 50 level has repetitively led to pullbacks in price 

Speaking of from one year ago to date and this being month s end  here is our comparative chart of Gold s percentage track with those of major precious metal equities brethren  Therein we find Franco Nevada  FNV   14    Gold itself essential  unch   Newmont Mining  NYSE NEM   2    the exchange traded fund of mining companies  GDX  NYSE GDX    6    Goldcorp Inc  NYSE GG   GG   12    and the exchange traded fund of Silver miners  SIL   21    But note the steeper acceleration for the miners vs  Gold over the past month  And specific to laggard Sister Silver herself  the average millennium to date Gold Silver ratio is 59 8x  yet is at present 74 7x  Silver settled the week at 17 805  but bringing her price in line with that ratio s average puts her at 22 220  nearly a 25  increase  Then figure in some of that good old fashioned miners leverage  and you may just be lookin  at an Silver equities double  Something about which to think 

Finally to our monthly Gold Structure as charted since the All Time High for which the sixth anniversary is this Wednesday  06 September   Again   tis all about regaining Base Camp 1377  morphing that level from resistance into support  and then standing by for Gold to fly 

In closing  a tip of the cap to one Danielle DiMartino Booth over at Bloomy  who rationalized that the next rate decision  20 September  by the Federal Open Market Committee could actually be one of easing  That would true up nicely with the declining Econ Baro  wouldn t you say  May Gold continue to light the way ",2017-09-04,Mark Mead Baillie,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold-superb-through-the-year39s-second-third-200211248,200211248
189228,410744,NEM,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  Barrick Gold  Newmont Mining  Asanko Gold  Yamana Gold And Pretium Resources,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   September 25  2017   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Industry  Gold Mining  Part 3  including Barrick Gold Corp   NYSE   NYSE ABX        Newmont Mining Corp   NYSE   NYSE NEM        Asanko Gold Inc   NYSEMKT   TO AKG        Yamana Gold Inc   NYSE   NYSE AUY       and Pretium Resources Inc   NYSE   TO PVG       Industry  Gold Mining  Part 3Link  Though the market for gold will remain strong in the years to come given the demand for jewelry  bars and coins as well as its safe haven appeal  it has a number of threats lurking  Below  we have discussed some of the key challenges and what investors in the sector should be wary of in the coming months and years Changing Preferences of Younger Generation in ChinaFor the second quarter  China s economy grew by 1 7  in seasonally adjusted terms  It was in line with expectations but higher than 1 3  increase reported in the March quarter The International Monetary Fund s  IMF  forecast for growth in China is pegged at 6 7  for 2017  As per the IMF  a faster slowdown in China could have a serious impact on trade  commodity prices and investor confidence  and lead to a more generalized slowdown in the global economy  Even though the recent upbeat GDP figures raise hope  it remains to be seen whether it can be sustained While rebalancing progresses  the Chinese economy continues to slow down  In China  policymakers continue to shift the economy away from its reliance on investment and industry toward consumption and services  This is anticipated to slow growth in the short term while building the foundations for a more sustainable long term expansion The continued general economic slowdown has had a negative impact on customer sentiment  Jewelry demand in China 2016 slumped 17  due to higher gold prices  Gold jewelry demand has been negatively affected by the slowing economic environment as well as changing consumer tastes  It has been observed that the younger Chinese consumers want to spend their money on experiences rather than material goods Recently  a shift from pure 24k gold to lower carat  higher designed and higher margin gold jewelry has been witnessed among the young customers in China  Consumers are expressing their individuality and differentiating themselves from older generations   leading to the shift from traditional plain 24k jewelry  As younger consumers continue to shy away from the tradition jewelry  higher margin  lower gold content products are being developed to fill the void  Retailers and manufacturers are attempting to prosper in a competitive industry by alluring customers with new  innovative and higher margin products Brexit Anxiety Quells Demand in UKIn UK  demand in the second quarter of 2017 slumped 10  to a three year low of 3 8 tons due to prolonged uncertainty over Brexit  which continues to deter anxious consumers Production at RiskEven through a small number of major projects are anticipated to come online by the end of 2017  the project pipeline remains weak  And while major miners have improved cash flow and reduced debt over the last few years  production development expenditure remains at multi year lows  Per the World Gold Council  the project pipeline will experience a small pick up in 2017 and 2018 before global mine production levels begin to decline in 2019 Previously  incremental production from newer mines led to continued growth in overall gold production  However  newer mines are now at or near full potential  leading to slowing down in growth rates  This has made further production gains increasingly difficult This is the aftermath of sharp cuts in capital expenditure in recent years as well as the lack of significant discoveries  Though there have been signs of renewed interest in brownfield development and extending the life of existing mines  these are not adequate to mitigate the slashed project development spending  As existing reserves are depleted  the current project pipeline will be inadequate to replace them completely and ultimately leading to a supply crunch Some gold companies  including Barrick Gold Corp   NYSE      and Newmont Mining Corp   NYSE      are currently high grading at certain mines  The high grade portion of a mine is mined first as this increases the grade of the mined ore and lowers cost per unit  However  it has pitfalls as it depletes reserves very quickly  thus affecting long term supply Gold Substitutes in TechnologyDemand for gold in technological applications is affected by cheaper substitutes  Despite inferior durability  copper and palladium coated copper have made vast inroads into the share of gold in the bonding wire sector  The decade long decline in the dental sector shows no sign of abatement as gold continues to lose ground to ceramic alternatives  which have improved steadily in quality  strength and durability Impact of a Stronger Greenback  Rate HikeThere is an inverse relationship between the trade weighted US dollar and the price of gold  If the dollar gains strength against major currencies on the back of positive macroeconomic data  like an improving job market and growing industrial activity  it will again put gold prices under pressure  Also  higher U S  rates raise the opportunity cost of holding non yielding bullion and normally weigh on gold Inherent RisksGold exploration and mining are time consuming and expensive tasks  Given its scarcity and remote location of deposits  exploration for new gold deposits is difficult  Once an economically viable deposit is identified  bringing a mine on line can take a decade or more  and it requires substantial capital investment Moreover  the mining industry is subject to several risks such as political conflicts  environmental hazards  industrial accidents  unexpected geological conditions  labor force disruptions  unavailability of materials and equipment  weather conditions  pit wall failures  rock bursts  cave ins  flooding  seismic activity and water conditions  However  once a mine is successfully developed  its returns can be enormously high  This is likely to more than neutralize the risks inherent in development and the capital invested for the project Gold Stocks to Avoid for the Time BeingWe presently recommend investors to stay away from the following gold stocks as they presently have an unfavorable Zacks Rank  The other metrics also indicate that they are not profitable investment options at present Asanko Gold Inc  NYSEMKT      currently carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   The 2017 earnings estimates for Asanko Gold have gone down by 59  in the last 30

189231,410747,NEM,Gold In Q4  Must Price Work Lower ,opinion,"Tis a bit early to begin crooning the mid 20th century yuletide pop tune  It s beginning to look a lot like Christmas     Meredith Willson   51   but a glance at the above track of Gold year to date gives the impression that 2017 is pretty much a  pick up the needle  and play 2016 reprise 
Still  with three fourths of 2017 already in the books  were we now at year end  Gold s being up 11 3  would rank as its best annual net performance since 2010 s gain of 29 7   Moreover  in having survived  barely  a septic September  Gold remains in the upper echelon of double digit gainers through Q3  which sadly for Silver is not the case as you can below see in our year to date BEGOS Markets standings 

Indeed  the above table shows quite a bit of  conventional wisdom disconnect   both Gold and the stock market as measured by the S P 500 are up by almost identical amounts  That s not supposed to happen  Copper is flying  yet Oil is dying  Has that ever happened  The Oil Copper ratio  17 5x  just came off its lowest reading in over 21 years 
But then look again at Sister Silver  with King Gold still nicely up for the year and Cousin Copper soaring  should not the white metal in all her precious and industrial metal glory be at the top of the heap  The Gold Silver ratio at present is 76 8x which is 22 7  above the millennium to date average of 62 6x  So much mis direction amongst the BEGOS Markets   Tis worthy of repeating one of our favourite quotes from back in the day when the NFL was about playing football   What the hell s goin  on out there        Vince Lombardi  
Graphically  here s the entire bunch from a month ago to date  the consistency of the linear regression trendlines denoted by those baby blue dots  In anticipating a week ago that the  Baby Blues  had further to fall for both Gold and Silver  hopefully such descent shall quickly relent  But October is not always a friendly month for the precious metals 

Next as we turn toward Gold s weekly bars from a year ago to date  we still think the overall picture looks healthy  As noted  September wasn t pretty  but as written a week ago      further to      price bunching  support  we ve also same within those otherwise  Whiny 1290s  as well as with the top of the purple bounded 1280 1240 box     And  tis atop said box where Gold now sits  having closed out the week Friday at 1283 
Now here s the critical bit  time and again over the past four years  we d love it when Gold would work its way up to this area  only to then disappoint us and retreat  But today we see the tables as turned  our notion being that this area of former resistance has morphed into one of support  Certain technicians may view these last few weeks as  three black crows   that about which we hope to soon be crowing is Gold s turning back higher for the run to Base Camp 1377  But again  the seasonal vicissitudes of October may have to be navigated  Here are the bars 

Next in  still measuring from this time a year ago  we see that  with one exception  Gold and several of its precious metal equities brethren are lower  Franco Nevada  NYSE FNV  is  9   however Gold itself is  3   Newmont Mining  NYSE NEM  is  4   the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners exchange traded fund  NYSE GDX  is  14   Goldcorp  NYSE GG  is  22   and the Global X Silver Miners exchange traded fund  NYSE SIL  is  27    Course year to date  all of these entities  save for GG  are higher following a horrid Q4 in closing out 2016  Let s not  pick up the needle  to again play that tune 

As for the irony whereby  they  measure the economy  how did that slowing in August s Personal Income and Spending  along with further shrinkage in Pending Home Sales work out for ya  Your vote by the decline in September s Consumer Confidence is a pretty good answer  Nothin  like being right in sync with reality  Here s the Baro 

More to the point  have you as yet screamed  Abort   and abandoned the stock market  After giving us all a scare last Monday  the S P 500 then managed to recover and even add a few more points to its pile  But the Index closed out its third narrowest September trading range     just 3      since at least 1970   as far back as our data goes   Moreover  save for a loss of less than one li l ole point for March  the S P has not had a losing month since last October   Oops  sorry  bad word   October   
 Course  bad  is often  good  for Gold  Beyond the fact that Gold is trading at half its currency debasement value  we were reminded this past week of the cavalcade of catastrophes that ought well work in favour of the yellow metal  For example  did you happen to catch Fitch having just downgraded Deutsche Bank s  NYSE DB  long term credit grade to BBB    aka  three levels above  junk     We tend to notice little things like that  Especially when they re a tile in our dominoes set   as if you need be reminded  

For the near term trader  the 10 day Market Profiles clearly show the overhead resistance rows that one must hoe toward getting on with the show for Gold on the left and Silver on the right  More broadly as stated  Octobers in general are not very kind to the precious metals  In the 17 years back through 2000  Gold has suffered 10 losing Octobers  including four of the last five  But as dear old Dad used to say   Ya gotta take  em one day at a time   Why even the Chicago Cubs suffered many a miserable October only to eventually win the World Series a year ago  So let s  Batter up   out there 

Finally it being month s end  here again is our Gold Structure graphic  Clearly Gold is making positive progress through its ebb and flow since December 2015 s low  Still  as we ad nausea repeat    tis all about getting back up to Base Camp 1377  staying above that level  and then launching on to higher strata 

So there  tis  three quarters down and one to go  And hardly shall Q4 start with a whimper given we ve 16 metrics hitting the Economic Barometer through the first week of October  including what is expected to be severe slippage in September job creation given hurricanes Harvey  Irma and Maria  So keep those seat belts fastened 
Speaking of cinched  we ll leave you with this  the good folks over at Qatar Airways are now sporting double beds in business class  which naturally brings to mind the notion of privacy  albeit said beds are described as being  enclosed   Nonetheless  we re envisioning aisle signs which read  In passing  head up and eyes straight ahead please   At present  the beds are only in use on the Doha London route  which we find rather curious as  tis but a seven hour flight  following cocktails  dinner  a film and a stretch  why   tis practically time to land  But then again  one ought account for the Mile High Club in taking their pleasure when they can  Either way  we suggest pleasuring one s wealth by tucking in with some Gold  now that s first class  baby ",2017-10-02,Mark Mead Baillie,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold-and-october--must-price-work-lower-200216334,200216334

189244,410760,NEM,Gold Pushing To 1300  Again     ,opinion,"Kudos to our good colleague and bon vivant Squire who a week ago  with respect to our annoyance over gold s returning up only to get stuck yet again in its 1240 1280 box  quintessentially queried      what if price just keeps powering up through here this time  
The lad s not being  round this time to take credit himself  we say  Well done  son   For as the above panel shows  price has spritely picked up the pace these past three weeks  settling yesterday  Friday  at 1269  For us futures folks  add in six more points of premium as volume rolls into the December contract    first notice  for August physical delivery being Monday   and you ve got price at 1275  Further   tis nice to have some  technical push  associated with this up move  which since 07 July is a 4 7  gain  gold s best three week stint since mid January 
Which brings us to the following two panel chart  On the left is our familiar three month view of gold s daily bars with their  Baby Blues  of 21 day linear regression trend consistency  note how the blue dots are powering up with room still to go  barring the  top of the box  1280 sellers putting the kibosh on it all  On the right for the same period we ve again the daily bars  but with the canned textbook study known as the  Price Oscillator   whilst we caution that no technical study is perpetually reliable  this one has been sufficiently so in recent months such as to regularly make our  Market Rhythms  page  seven of the last 10 crossings of the oscillator from down to up and vice versa have seen price then follow through in the same direction by 40 or more points   which for you WestPalmBeachers down there means it has failed to so do 30  of the time   The point is  the oscillator confirmed a positive crossing at the close a week ago at 1255  Were a full 40 point follow through to again occur  1255   40   6 points of December contract premium   1301   TA DA    Course  between here and there also come those horrible Whiny 1290s  Remember them  Just sayin  

Either way  if you re now all pumped up  let s put gold in prudent perspective  Save for one trading day  we re now at month s end  which means  tis time to bring up our BEGOS Market Standings year to date  And just as they were positioned at the end of June  today we ve gold   10 2   still in fourth place and silver   4 9   still in sixth  but now with Copper   14 8   for the first time in forever leading the pack 

Note  too  the boffing of conventional wisdom in the above performances  Both gold and the S P 500 are up by almost identical amounts   That s not supposed to happen   Plus there s the recent strength in the Euro at the natural expense of the Dollar  yet not keeping like pace is the Swiss Franc  its succumbing to hard selling this past week as the Bern bunch at the Schweizerische Nationalbank muddle over LIBOR to be no more come 2021 
Notwithstanding the above standings  gold s  technical push  is to be put to the test as stands stark in this next graphic of the weekly bars from a year ago to date  Having closed the last three weeks in a row within five points of each one s respective high    a phenomena which has not occurred since January 2014    gold now stares directly upward at the top of the omnipresent purple bounded 1240 1280 box  just beyond which come the declining red dots of parabolic Short trend  Shall they gold contain  Or shall gold further gain  We see gold as  up  to the challenge 

Continuing on this year over year timeframe with July all but in the books  here next we ve the percentage tracks of the yellow metal itself   5    barely now beaten by Franco Nevada  NYSE FNV   4    followed by the earnings exuberant Newmont Mining  NYSE NEM   13    the lagging exchange traded fund of the miners  GDX  NYSE GDX    21   and grip lacking Goldcorp  NYSE GG   26    with the as yet to accelerate exchange traded fund of the Silver Miners  NYSE SIL   30    Why  as yet to accelerate   The millennium to date gold silver average ratio is 62x  but is at present 75x  Mathematically if we freeze gold here at 1269  getting the ratio back to that average puts the white metal at 20 47  vs  today s lowly 16 75  

 Course  aiding gold with some  fundamental push  is the dollar s recording its fourth down week in five  along with the StateSide economy slowing as the Economic Barometer clearly has been showing  Q2 Gross Domestic Product   2 6   not surprisingly missing expectations   2 8   albeit  twas closer than we thought  twould be  yet still there s the Federal Open Market Committee s 26 July stated exaltations 

Moreover what the FOMC doesn t seem to see is that which the International Monetary Fund does decree in slashing America s growth forecasts for 2017 and 2018 given Washington D C  fiscal uncertainty  And with 19 metrics set to affect the Baro next week   twill day by day be worth the peek 
Thus combining the positive technical fundamental push for gold  we find it for third consecutive week near the top of its ever evolving 10 day Market Profile  below left  of contract volume traded per price point  and similarly so for Sister silver  below right  

As for the broad view from here on the advent of August  we ve gold s structure by the month since 2011 s All Time High  the pattern these last two years likened to a golf ball s bouncing upon a freshly mown uphill fairway  Let s just hope the approach shot flies nice and high 

Finally from our  Did All Y All Notice  Dept   we ve these two items 
  How  bout that micro  flash crash  that hit the stock market during lunch hour this past Thursday  No  it didn t make the news   not that we give the news much due at all anymore   But if you were glued to the S P futures as were we just after 09 30 Pacific Time  you couldn t have missed it  The lunch hour is obviously the quietest time during the stock market trading day  the S P futures typically stuck in a three point range  But on Thursday   twas 10 points  all straight down in a heartbeat  with traders and algorithms running for the exits as the bid and offer sizes halved themselves  So stunning was the plunge and evacuation of traders that we issued a note entitled  Did the  Crash  Just Commence   And yet since then  we ve found no explanation  That s just how fragile the stock market is right now 
  Taking their cue from the French  as we ve already noted in a recent missive   Great Britain has also now announced their intention to ban sales of new petrol  and diesel powered cars come 2040  We can t see this going over very well up in silverstone within the hallowed halls of the ultra exclusive British Racing Drivers  Club  Neither can our Girl Scouts be too excited about it either  one of their new uniform badges is that of a racing car  What s next  Electric jumbo jets  Good luck with that 
Bottom line  when it all doth fold  be glad you ve got gold ",2017-07-31,Mark Mead Baillie,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold39s-push-to-1300-again-200204465,200204465

	Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations     

Here are highlights from Tuesday s Analyst Blog  

Gold Climbs Amid More World Turmoil

	Gold prices are on the rise Tuesday amid turmoil in both Washington D C  and abroad  Prices of the fail safe commodity are now heading closer to  1 300 an ounce 

	In Washington  backlash surrounding President Donald Trump pulling the U S  out of the Paris climate agreement currently dominates the news  On top of that  former FBI director James Comey is set to testify in front of Congress on Thursday 

	In Europe and the Middle East  uncertainty and tragedy have also helped lead to gold s jump  The recent string of terror attacks in the U K  come before Thursday s parliamentary elections  and just a few days ago  Saudi Arabia  the United Arab Emirates  Egypt  Yemen and Bahrain ended diplomatic and even some commercial ties with Qatar  stating that the small Gulf state sponsors terrorism 

	The recent wave of political uncertainty around the world and domestically has pusded gold prices up 1 06  to  1296 30 per ounce on Tuesday  Gold s recent spike comes as the U S  dollar begins to dip the two opposite movements often go hand in hand  Last Friday s weaker than expected jobs report also contributed to today s movement 

	Some of the top performing gold and gold mining stocks also jumped today 

	Barrick Gold Corporation  NYSE          stock popped 3 83  in early afternoon trading on Tuesday  Newmont Mining Corporation  NYSE         is up 2 32   Canadian gold mining companies McEwen Mining Inc   NYSE          and Klondex Mines Ltd   NYSEMKT          gained 4 41  and 3 25   respectively  And DRDGOLD Limited skyrocketed 7 06  

	Despite today s jump  gold sits well below its 52 week high of  1 375 08 per ounce  which it reached last summer  However  the price of gold has slowly climbed  with a few big fluctuations  since the start of the year 

	Look for gold prices to keep on fluctuating along with the seemingly constant political and social turbulence in the U S  and around the world 

Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars  

	Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge 
	With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as the  1 stock to buy according to Zacks research 
	It s not the one you think 

Strong Stocks that Should Be in the News

	Many are little publicized and fly under the Wall Street radar  They re virtually unknown to the general public  Yet today s 220 Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buys  were generated by the stock picking system that has nearly tripled the market from 1988 through 2015  Its average gain has been a stellar  26  per year

189257,410773,NEM,The Great Gold Supply Disconnect  Market Severely Undervalues Price,opinion,"The market has no clue that it has severely undervalued the price of gold  While Central bank intervention has worked hard at capping the gold price  the  Great Gold Supply Disconnect  will most certainly remedy that situation  This gold supply disconnect took place after the gold price peaked in 2011 
That being said  the world is speeding recklessly towards an epic market catastrophe  No  this isn t hype  I wish it was  But  unfortunately  the poor folks who continue to believe their STOCK  BOND   REAL ESTATE portfolios will provide them with a healthy retirement in the future  have no idea that their true values evaporated many years ago  However  the market just hasn t BAKED THEM INTO THE CAKE YET  LOL 
Before we get to the Gold Supply Disconnect  let s look at this wonderful chart that shows the carnage taking place in the commodity market  This is  Commodity Index  divided by the S P 500 Index 

This chart shows that the commodity index is at the lowest ratio to the S P 500 since 1971  Thus  the   Moreover  the commodity index is lowest ratio  below 1 0  when we compare it to the average median which is 4 1  shown as the red dotted line on the chart  Now  either commodity prices are too low  or the S P 500 and its illegitimate older brother  the Dow Jones Index are severely over inflated 
I would like to remind investors  without a properly functioning commodity supply market  companies wouldn t be able to produce and manufacture their products  Which means  energy and commodities are the foundation of our markets 
Of course  if an individual still had a semi functioning brain stem and wasn t one of the millions of Americans now suffering from serious BRAIN DAMAGE  they would realize that the stock markets are in record bubble territory 
Now  another thing that it totally overlooked by most Americans and the Mainstream analyst community is how the falling oil price is gutting the U S  and global oil industry  Today  we received news of one of the largest U S  gasoline and distillate inventory builds in the past five months  However  if we look at the  it rose the most since August 2015 
This had a wonderful impact on the price of U S  crude oil  which is now down  2 15 to  46 05 a barrel  This low oil price continues to gut the U S  oil industry even though the media suggests that the Shale Oil Industry is now profitable at  20  40 a barrel  I will be publishing an article shortly on the Permian Basin in Texas  which is now the Darling of Wall Street and the U S  shale oil Industry  Everyone is jumping into the Permian to make that big money  or so they believe 
Regardless  collapse is on its way because the very energy we use to run everything is rapidly disintegrating  And without energy  the global gold supply would most certainly evaporate into thin air 
THE GREAT GOLD DISCONNECT  How The Market Has Severely Undervalued The Gold Price
The Fed and Central bank magicians have fooled the audience with a clever slight of hand that a newly printed  100 bill  which costs 13 cents each to produce  is worth  100 in gold  it isn t  However  the skyrocketing gold price hasn t been BAKED INTO THE CAKE YET  but it will 
Before I show you the Gold Supply Disconnect  let s look at this interesting chart which show the falling ore grades of five different gold producing countries 

At one time  1900   the average gold ore grade in the world was over 20 grams per ton  32 grams equals one troy ounce  Today  the top gold miners are struggling to produce gold at a little more than 1 2 grams per ton   Back when Nixon dropped the U S  Dollar Gold peg in 1971  the average gold ore grade from these five countries was approximately 8 10 grams per ton  nearly EIGHT TIMES higher than today 
When means  the gold mining industry is now producing the most expensive gold dust in history  and doing so for mere peanuts 
Furthermore  we also have the falling EROI   Energy Returned On Investment of oil that is used to extract and produce gold 

Thus  falling global gold ore grades and the declining EROI of oil means it costs a great deal more to produce gold today than it did in the 1900 s and especially in the past 15 years  However  the profitability and the share prices of the top five gold miners have suffered greatly since the gold price peaked in 2011 
If we take a look at the next five charts  we can see that the gold miners share prices have under performed the gold price since the beginning of 2012 
Barrick Gold Corporation  NYSE ABX 

Newmont  NYSE NEM 

Anglo Gold  NYSE AU 

Goldcorp Inc  NYSE GG 

Kinross Gold  NYSE KGC 

You will notice in all five charts  the price of gold  Gold color  was underneath all the gold mining companies stock price trend up until 2011  Then after 2012  the Great Gold Disconnect took place as the gold price is now higher than these companies share prices  Some of these gold miners share prices are much lower than the gold price trend  such as Kinross Gold  AngloGold and Barrick 
What is quite amazing is that Kinross  ranked 5th largest gold miner  produced 2 7 million oz of gold in 2016  and its share price is currently trading at less than  5   Think about that  Kinross produced  3 8 billion worth of gold in 2016  and its share price is trading at less than  5 a share  Now  compare that to the first chart in article  above  which shows the commodity index trading at a 50 year low versus the S P 500 Index 
What we have today is a totally insane and hyper inflated STOCK  BOND and REAL ESTATE market  and a severely under valued gold market price and gold mining shares 
The investors of the world believe the hyper inflated values of STOCK  BONDS and REAL ESTATE will continue indefinitely  Unfortunately  the gold supply disconnect that took place in 2011 is a big RED WARNING LIGHT that the something is seriously wrong 
When the broader stock  bond and real estate markets start to crack and drop like a rock  watch for the gold price and the mining shares to head in the opposite direction ",2017-06-08,Steve St. Angelo,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-great-gold-supply-disconnect:-market-severely-undervalues-price-200193899,200193899
189258,410774,NEM,These Two Projects Could Be Barrick s Next Cortez Acquisition Targets,opinion,"Barrick Gold Corporation  NYSE ABX   for most prolific  in terms output  gold producer in the world during 2016  The company also came in at number one during 2015  with Newmont Mining Corp  NYSE NEM  and AngloGold Ashanti Ltd ADR  NYSE AU  taking positions two and three on the list respectively for  again  both 2015 and 2016 
Some of Barrick s biggest exploratory achievements during the last 15 20 years have been based in Nevada  Specifically  and central to the company s reaching  and maintenance  of its number one spot  in and around a rock formation in Nevada called the Cortez Trend  The trend lies in the center of the state  just west of its more famous counterpart  the Carlin Trend 
The company is constantly seeking to expand its footprint in the region  and for good reason  three of Barrick s leading resources  producing multi million oz  gold annually and estimated to hold in excess of 10 million oz  each  are located on the Cortez Trend   it s Pipeline  Cortez Hills and Goldrush deposits 
Back in 2008  Barrick  a large portion in what would become the Cortez Hills property from Rio Tinto plc  LON RIO   In 2012  the company expanded its footprint in the region with  from Victoria Gold Corp  VIT   Many mining investors track progress at a variety of projects in and around the Cortez Trend solely to try and anticipate which present as potential acquisition targets for the mining behemoth  One that has been touted recently as a potential Barrick target was Coral s Robertson Property   
With this in mind  here s a look at two more potential Barrick targets in the same region   Keystone and Iceberg 
Let s kick things off with Keystone 
This one s owned by US Gold Corp  DRAM  and is located along the Cortez Trend  approximately 10 miles south of the two above mentioned Barrick properties  Pipeline and Cortez Hills  It s one of two properties owned by the company  with the other being a copper mine in Wyoming called Copper King  The former is what we re interested in here 
It was first drilled back in the late 1960s and has since been the focus of a number of small scale type programs conducted by various entities  None of these entities  however  have conducted programs to the scale at which  and using the technology with which  exploratory gold drilling is conducted today  With the presence of gold having been established through the early programs  but in the absence of any full scale programs  this is a very much underexplored property and one that could prove attractive to Barrick if US Gold Corp can go some way towards demonstrating the presence of the substantial resource the company expects it holds 
Historical drilling in the area has produced high grade and thick intercepts of gold and across the approximately 15 square miles   7500 acres  of land  within which US Gold Corp holds 479 claims  the company expects the project has a potential in excess of 10 million oz 
The initial target for the company is 1 million oz  and management is working right now to establish a resource estimate to reinforce the reliability of this target 
For those familiar with the space  VP  Head of Exploration at US Gold Corp is geologist Dave Mathewson  For those not familiar with Mathewson  he s the guy that served as Head of Exploration in Nevada for the third company on the list in the introduction to this piece   Newmont   between 1989 and 2001  During this period he was responsible for the discovery exploration of the company s Tess  Northwest Rain  Saddle and South Emigrant deposits  a list that pretty much covers all of Newmont s most prolific and most stable producing properties 
US Gold Corp is currently midway through a drilling program aimed at establishing the above mentioned resource estimate  and the company expects to ramp up its exploration program throughout late 2017 and early 2018 based on  guided by  the results of this initial program  Beyond that  a National Instrument 43 101  or NI43 101  will establish a resource estimate and serve as something tangible with which a company like Barrick can value the property 
Now let s look at Iceberg 
This one is owned by a Canada based company called Nulegacy Gold Corporation  V NUG   The company owns a region of land called Red Hill that is located between Barrick s Goldrush deposit immediately to the north and Tonkin Springs to the south  The property as a whole is the second largest independently owned land package in the trend  second only to Barrick Gold s adjacent holdings  The company has actually made two discoveries in Red Hills  one called Avocado  discovered more recently  2016  and the one in focus here  Iceberg  discovered in 2012  
The Iceberg deposit is a near surface deposit  meaning the gold is more readily accessible and   by proxy   that it s cheaper to extract  and is currently the subject of an expansive exploration program designed to establish a resource estimate  Early signals are positive  with the current target grades coming in at 0 9 1 1 oz  t  and in a specific northern region  reported as high as 3 9 oz  t 
Geographically  the project consists of three primary mineralization zones spread across more than 3km  and the company has drilled approximately 25  of the total claim covered area 
Right now  Nulegacy is focused on expanding the gold content of the established near surface oxide deposit through further drilling  As of May 16  a reverse circulation  RC  truck rig is on site at the project with the remit of  over the next six to eight weeks  drilling the first 12 of 24 holes planned for the expansion of Iceberg s established exploration target  The company also just reported results from what s called bottle roll leaching tests  the industry standard testing procedure for assessing leach potential at gold deposits  and the results read back as favorable  suggesting the project is a strong contender for economic viability 
Again  and just as with US Gold Corp s Keystone  this one s all about the drill results  Once they come in expect the bigger names  and especially Barrick  to sit up and take notice ",2017-06-09,Samuel Rae,https://www.investing.com/analysis/these-two-projects-could-be-barrick's-next-cortez-acquisition-targets-200194208,200194208
189260,410776,NEM,Equity Bulls Are Back On The March,opinion,"The equity bulls are back on the march and it s a global theme  Clearly  clients are active in US indices with the Dow and S P 500 pushing to new highs and the NASDAQ 100 gaining 1 6  and staying long here and having a bullish bias  regardless of how we feel about the macro backdrop  is the right trade for now  Don t fight the tape as the bulls are finding the sellers easy to overcome and we have seen good participation and breadth  with Tech wrestling back its dominant leadership spot  backed with gains in healthcare  and financials 
It s not just US markets  but the FTSE 100 is pushing higher and into the key sell zone of 7550 to 7600 and a break here in the short term is not out of the question  In Europe  the EU Stoxx 50 has built a base and a close through 3600 would be a buy signal and confirm the bulls have the upper hand here to push prices higher  Certainly  the German component of the index is upbeat and we are seeing the DAX breaking to new highs 
In Japan  view the Nikkei 225 on a four hour chart and see the bullish break of the bull flag pattern  which is in effect a continuation pattern and we can expect higher levels here  We are seeing Chinese equity markets  both offshore in Hong Kong and on the mainland  moving higher  likely in anticipation of tonight s MSCI review on greater representation for Chinese equities in the MSCI Emerging Market basket 
In the FX markets we have seen the US dollar index pushing 0 4  higher  and for the first time in a while we have seen the USD rise against all G10 currencies on the session  Fairly upbeat comments from New York president Bill Dudley have been noted  with US nominal bond yields rising across the curve  the US 10 year treasury is up 4bp at 2 18    There has been no movement in the markets pricing of inflation expectations  thus  real  yields have therefore moved higher  although I wouldn t say this is a positive at all for risk appetite and should be monitored 
USD JPY has been well traded and looks bullish  with the bulls building on last week s bullish outside week reversal  with price trading below the prior week s low and closing above the high   I like this pair higher and perhaps into  112 50  although we need a break of the  111 71  2 June high  and  111 82 in the short term  AUD USD pushed to a high of  0 7629 by 10 00 AEST  but has found sellers ever since and the pair sits below the 76c level here  which is a shame as I  like many speculators  were willing the pair into the  0 7700 to  0 7750 and the markets conviction  sell  zone  
In commodity markets  the move higher in US  real   or inflation adjusted  bond yields has been taken very poorly by gold traders  with gold trading 0 8  lower on the session  although this is not a new theme and gold has been trending lower for a number of days here  It is not a good time to be a gold bull  at least in the short term anyhow  as the price is not looking happy and I would be expecting this move into  1230 to  1235  Gold stocks should in theory fare poorly in Australia today  but that being said  we are actually seeing modest gains in US listed Barrick Gold Corporation  NYSE ABX  and Newmont Mining  NYSE NEM   so there is hope for those holding gold equity exposure 
Oil is also getting some focus  with price gravitating to the May lows  on the continuous undated contract   Either way  we have seen price trade above Friday high and close below the low  so a bearish reversal is in play  with traders focusing on the weekend news that the US rig count gained for a 22nd consecutive week and Libya continues to increase production 
It s not all doom though  copper   1  on the session  and spot iron ore   1 9   have seen gains  with the latter pushing up for a fourth consecutive day  These positive moves tend to happen when a US bank turns uber bearish 
The wash up of all of these moves is that we are likely to see the Aussie index open largely unchanged  SPI futures did find a few sellers after Moody s announced the downgrade to the big four Aussie banks credit rating due to elevated risks in the household sector  It s a story that of course garners headlines  but scratch around below the surface and see Moody s rating is now on a similar footing as S P  who have them on AA  
Equity investors will likely then take their cues from the credit markets  but the prospect of a strong rise in the Aussie banks corporate bond yields seems very low in my opinion and the idea the banks are going to pay up for funding from this downgrade seems a low risk  If we look at the various banks American Depository Receipts  ADR  have all closed unchanged on the session and this seems in fitting with SPI futures  which are up a mere three points from 16 10 AEST and the official ASX 200 cash close ",2017-06-20,Abigail Doolittle,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-long-and-the-short-of-it-200196160,200196160
189263,410779,NEM,Do Gold Mining Stock Prices Follow Cycles ,opinion,"Usually when I write in this blog  I try to look at some aspect of the gold market  or silver market  in which I have expertise  and at the same time that thing  or fact or theory is not well known or talked about among the readers of the blog  In short I attempt to bring something fresh to the table of discourse on the subject of gold investing 
This week I considered mining stocks  There are many other people who talk or write about mining stocks  so I appreciate that adding information on this is entering a crowded space  One way to freshen things up is to bring some market history into the conversation  History has a tendency to repeat from time to time  and somehow surprise everybody when it does so  But not all that many mining companies have a long history what with the limited lifespan of their mines  takeovers  mergers and so on 
Newmont Mining  NYSE NEM  is an exception though  It was founded in 1921  wikipedia says 1916 but I take Newmont s own date of 1921   by  and consequently  this year Newmont is 96 years old 
My first encounter with this stock came about 1989 when Corporate Raider billionaire Jimmy Goldsmith   using a stake generated from swopping ownership of Cavenham Forest  the 5th largest timber corporation in the US  tried to take Newmont over and break it up for resale as parts  Newmont resisted and survived these attacks  It also fended off unwanted advances from Consolidated Goldfields  Hanson Industries and T Boone Pickens about that time 
Newmont is big  I thinks it s the second biggest gold producer  after Barrick Gold Corporation  NYSE ABX   and it s the only gold mining company included in the S P 500 Index  Last quarter Q1 2017 it produced 1 23 million ounces of gold 
The above attempts to take ownership of Newmont took place during the nineteen year long 1980 s gold bear market following the gold price high during 1980  Newmont is a stock that billionaires have historically become attracted to when it was down after a general gold bullion market decline 
This long history and large capitalization means there is liquidity in the stock of Newmont  Liquidity is something I look for when beginning to analyze a financial asset  Liquidity is one of the glues that hold cycles together  and cycles is one thing I look for 
Are there cycles in the price of Newmont  Let s see what I can find 
Here is Newmont relative to the HUI Index 

That s three and a half years of outperformance there  This is one to watch 
So what if any cycles did I find  I decided to look for larger swings first  So I chose a monthly timeframe 

This is using a double logarithmic plot  And it looks cyclical  doesn t it 
If you count along either the highs or lows in the above chart it becomes apparent that  for the last thirty years or thereabouts  Newmont has made highs to highs and lows to lows from seven to nine years apart 
So I ran an algorithm to test for such cycles  In monthly 7 to 9 years would be 84 to 108 months  The results were disappointing  There are not many repetitions of such long cycles  I have data since 1983  and as a result the cycles had not built up a strong track record  Also the length keeps changing from 7 to 8 sometimes to 9 and so on  So reliability is a problem 
So to get around this I looked for smaller nested sub cycles that might add up build into to a 7 9 year  parent  wave and this is what I found 
Length of Hypothetical cycles in months 
5 64  6 79  12 52  17 79  68 98  72 60
Here is what these look like  synthetic cycle composite in green  

It is an intriguing fit  isn t it 
I added the dates of the forecasted turns in black  But I do not expect that forecast to work 
If you look  you can see that during the period since 2011  the price of Newmont has already been departing from the forecast made by these cycles  and not only that  but the difference between the forecast and reality is increasing  So i wouldn t trust it 
The reason I show it here is that there could still be a use for this faulty analysis  If I stand back and take the broadest result  and avoid taking the details I can say this 
Since 1993  Newmont has made a low every 7 to 9 years on average  this period varies each time  and is a tendency that may already be gone completely or it may just be changing again 
What can this do  The last low was October 2008 so if I add 7 to 9 years onto October 2008 I get late 2015 to late 2017 
So look at this chart of Newmont 

So I am  based on these cycles  looking for a low between 2015 and 2017  The low at end of 2015 early 2016 fits this nicely 
But what about the errors so visible in that  idealized cycle  chart 
My thinking on this is that I don t trust that chart  But regardless of that it did do one thing  It made me go looking for a possible 7 to 9 year variable pattern  And that is enough  You see  there is a nine and a quarter year cycle in the bond market 
So if the central banks have a 37 year cycle in their minds  and their published research papers show that they have  then 9 25 is a quarter of that  a nested sub cycle of a 37 year cycle in interest rates  So this is a second  external reason why there might be a nine year swing up and back again in gold  The price of gold  and the inflation adjusted rate of interest on bonds are closely correlated  And the price of gold should have correlations with the price of a big producer like Newmont 
This gives me a great interest in trying to identify the next low in the price of Newmont  Because the 2016 low may be the low  But if it wasn t  then the next low will be it  So buying the later of such a set of lows would be safer than buying the earlier low if you see what I mean  In theory 
In which case a downtrend line can be put over the recent highs in Newmont  and if price breaks it that is one thing  I don t buy things after they go up  rather after they go down But if price should decline under such a trendline to a lower level  say between now and 12 18 months from now   then a break to the upside of that downtrend might be a good entry for what would follow  Of course there would also have to be other signals and triggers to buy  and levels to set stops off to limit risk  but that s always the case 
It s all a scenario  A construct  or an idea  But it interests me for obvious reasons 
Like all stock market ideas  only time will tell if it has any value or not  It stimulates the brain synapses to wonder about these kind of possibilities  Exercises the old gray matter  And without exercise we lose our abilities  So debating these scenarios should be a good thing in itself  whichever decision we eventually come to about them ",2017-06-25,Craig Hemke,https://www.investing.com/analysis/do-gold-mining-stock-prices-follow-cycles-200197310,200197310

189271,410787,NEM,Gold Mining ETF Investing Guide,opinion,"Gold peaked to a six week high last week  triggered by disappointing U S  jobs data  Further  terrorist attacks in London ahead of the U K election have given a boost to gold prices  The most anticipated Bureau of Labor Statistics  BLS  monthly non farm payroll numbers revealed that 138000 new jobs were created in May 2017  much below economists  expectations of 184 000  The unemployment rate declined to 4 3    the lowest in 16 years  Figures for March and April were also revised to show that 66 000 less jobs were created than expected  indicating that the labor market may be losing momentum  Average hourly earnings grew 2 5  year over year  which was another disappointing figure    Read   
Gold investors were jittery before the much awaited Fed meeting on Jun 14  in anticipation of an interest rate hike for the second time this year  The key interest rate was hiked to 1 00 1 25  from 0 75 1 0  set in Mar 2017  Policymakers reiterated their projections of one more rate hike this year  followed by three hikes each in 2018 and 2019   This move  followed by encouraging data on U S  initial jobless claims  prompted a rebound in dollar and pushed gold prices to 3 week lows   Nevertheless  gold is up 9  so far this year 
The U S  dollar has a close inverse relationship to commodity prices and gold  Considering that gold is not yield producing and investors have to rely on price appreciation for returns  the yellow metal normally has a strong inverse correlation to inflation adjusted interest rates  Gold traditionally is also viewed as a hedge against inflation   Read   
The uncertain political climate both in the UK and the United States is negatively impacting currencies and concerns over the fragility of both the economy and geopolitical tensions will keep the safe haven demand for gold up 
Macroeconomic trends in Asia will support economic growth in the coming years  Given that gold demand is generally closely correlated to increasing wealth in the continent  the commodity should be on fire  Asia mostly sees retail demand for the metal due to festival and wedding related buying activities in countries like India and China   Read   
While demand will remain strong  supply of this precious metal has already attained peak levels as per reports  Lower gold prices in the past few years had restricted the ability of gold producers to invest in new projects  There are few new projects and expansions anticipated to commence production this year  Further  those in the near term pipeline are generally fairly modest in scale  Thus  global mine supply is in danger of trickling down  The combination of lower mined gold supply and higher demand could eventually help prices navigate north

189273,410789,NEM,Gold Loses Its Cheer Into Mid Year,opinion,"Here in wee Monaco amongst its most famous district Monte Carlo lies the  Carr  d Or  or  golden Square   The name is perfectly analogous to the ongoing  spoiled attitudinal state of late for gold   tis acting like a  square   continuing as ever to not go anywhere 
Further  as the above panel shows  gold now lies  104 points  or  7 7   from where  twas at mid year in 2016  still choosing to be docked in its 1240 1280 box  wherein week after week little opportunity knocks  To be sure for the long term stacker  averaging in at the same price over and over rather defeats the whole purpose 
Moreover with precisely one half of 2017 in the bag  the precious metals have finally lost what had been their cheery month after month leading role within the BEGOS Markets as we see below  the chart topping component now being the Euro  And from  The Dept  of Never Say No   coming in second is the ever correctionless S P 500  don t you know  our  live  price earnings ratio therein at 34 3x     oh say it ain t so 
So here are the current year to date standings  with gold  round the center row  And query this  ought silver s performance really be so low   4 2    given not just gold s is almost double   7 8   most of which came in the year s first two months   but that copper s too is  7 9   The average gold silver ratio millennium to date is 62 4x  but presently is 74 8x  To price silver back up to that average means an increase of 19 9   which from today s level of 16 625 would bring us to 19 930   Just sayin    

Specific to this past week  gold settled yesterday  Friday  at 1241 
How comparatively narrow has become gold s trading range  Its  expected weekly trading range  is now 28 points  a year ago  that was just about gold s  expected daily trading range   25 points   Squished in range and squished in its purple bounded 1240 1280 box  here are gold s weekly bars  the parabolic Long trend now four weeks in length without a wit of upside price movement 

Worse for those of the miners  leverage persuasion  year over year the leading brethren are lower  and year to date they re barely off the mat  if that  Here from a year ago are the percentage tracks of Franco Nevada  TO FNV   5   gold itself  7   Newmont Mining  NYSE NEM   17   the prominent exchange traded fund of the gold miners  GDX  NYSE GDX    20   the popular exchange traded fund of the Silver Miners  MX SIL   SIL   22   and poor ole Goldcorp  NYSE GG   GG   33   Ouch 

Continuing to say  Ouch   as well is the still falling Economic Barometer 
Oh to be a fly on the wall within the hallowed halls of the Federal Reserve Bank   To raise or relax  That is the question  Perhaps to rescind   Here s the year over year Baro  the S P  red line  actually appearing to have run out of puff   yet hardly worth the mention as it has no declension  

What is sporting declension are gold s  Baby Blues   the dots of day to day 21 day linear regression trend consistency continuing their fall as we see below left  Of interest here is with the blue dots crossing under  80    meaning the downtrend is truly intact    tis also the area from which price itself oft turns back up  which coincident with this being the lower end of the  as yet inescapable  1240 1280 box suggests  tis time to reverse back up  And the nut over which to come as seen below right in the 10 day Market Profile is the 1245 level  the most heavily traded price these last two weeks 

Below for Sister silver  her Baby Blues  left  have shown a lack of directional consistency over the last several trading days  As earlier noted  silver is priced quite low relative to the performances of both gold and Copper  suggesting for the moment she s adorned neither in her precious metal pinstripes nor in her industrial metal jacket     Course this being Monaco  just about anything  or indeed practically nothing  goes   Either way  silver presently sits just below her profile resistance  right  of 16 65 

And thus to gold s monthly bars we go  You may recall from the prior month end missive our inference that gold was rather due for a down month  the rightmost red bar for June now clearly so showing  One wonders as well given last year s strong price ascent   albeit much of which was given back in the year s final trimester   if the gold Troops can garner the necessary energy for a similar upside performance  A return to Base Camp 1377 would be nice  but in back to back years to reach up there twice seems more and more like a roll of the dice 

This week brings us the Federal Open Market Committee s minutes from their 13 14 June meeting  followed by Friday s grand finale for a purported up tick in payrolls  Should gold fall from its box   twill surely bring cries of the yellow metal being nothing but rocks  But at the end of the day   twill truly be gold which rocks ",2017-07-02,Mark Mead Baillie,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold-loses-its-cheer-into-mid-year-200198645,200198645
189275,410791,NEM,The Top Six Things You Should Know About Royalty Companies Now,opinion,"While in New York last week  I had the privilege of seeing many colleagues face to face  It s always a pleasure for me to be able to talk gold with industry friends and experts  One stop during my trip that I thoroughly enjoyed was to chat with Pimm Fox and Lisa Abramowicz on Bloomberg Radio  Our discussion was dynamic as always and I shared with them my outlook for gold in the second half of the year  along with the opportunities I continue to see with royalty names 
I still find it curious that many investors don t realize what a significant role royalty and streaming companies play in the mining business 
Last year I wrote about some of my favorite royalty names  and how I came to know about this business model in the gold mining industry early in my career  I think that now is a good time to take another look at royalty companies  Here are the top six things I believe investors should know about this specialized sector 
1  What Is a Royalty Company 
Royalty companies  sometimes called streaming companies  serve a special role in the mining industry  Developing a mine property to start producing gold or other precious metal is an expensive  often time consuming process  Infrastructure needs to be built out  permits applied for  laborers hired and more 
A royalty company serves as a specialized financier that helps fund exploration and production projects for cash strapped mining companies  In return  it receives royalties on whatever the project produces  or rights to a  stream   an agreed upon amount of gold  silver or other precious metal 

2  Many Gold Royalty Companies Have Still Been Outperforming Gold
When looking over the last 12 months  many of the royalty companies have outperformed gold  While this is indeed remarkable  it is important to remember that royalty companies do have a robust business model 
Their ability to generate revenue in times when the gold  or other precious metal  price is both rising and falling is what makes them attractive 

3  Remember Real Interest Rates
There s no question that the gold price is volatile  and in any given 12 month rolling period  historically it s not unusual for the price of the yellow metal to fluctuate up or down by 20 percent  It s important for investors to remember that gold historically shares a strong inverse relationship with real interest rates  You can see in the chart that as rates rise  the price of gold falls  and vice versa 

This is another reason why I like the royalty model  Since royalty companies set fixed  lower than market prices for mining output  they can better manage the volatility that is inherent in the gold market  For example   19 agreements in 2016 entitled the company to buy silver at an average price of  4 42 an ounce and gold at  391 an ounce 
4  Speaking of Revenue
Last time I wrote about these companies  I shared with you that the three big royalty names boast impressive sales per employee  This is still true  Take a look at the 12 month revenue per employee of Franco Nevada  Royal Gold and Wheaton Precious Metals  Wheaton has only around 30 employees  but has one of the highest rates in the world  generating  25 8 million per employee  By comparison  Newmont  which employs around 30 000 people  generated  310 000 per employee during the same period 
Barrick also falls short by comparison 

5  Friendly to Shareholders
Paying dividends is important to investors  as it reflects the health of a company in terms of its cash flow and profits  Even more favorable in the eyes of investors is a company that is growing its dividends  Between 2012 and 2017  royalty companies had a combined annual dividend growth rate of 17 percent  Compare that to 11 percent growth for the S P 500 Index  and as low as negative 23 and negative 32 percent for global and North American precious metal miners 

In fact  2017 marks Franco Nevada s 10th straight year of dividend increases since the company went public in 2007 
6  Less Reliance on Debt
Royalty companies are better allocators of capital than some of the biggest gold miners  Take a look at Newmont Mining  NYSE NEM   which has a 43 percent debt to equity ratio  and Barrick  NYSE ABX  has a massive 91 percent  By comparison  many of the royalty companies have much lower debt  and Franco Nevada has zero debt  This history of profitability and fiscal discipline is one of the main reasons I find royalty companies so attractive

189276,410792,NEM,The Nevada Gold Bar Deposit Is About To Hit Production,opinion,"The Gold Bar Deposit is a mineral resource located along the Cortez trend in Nevada  US  Over the past six years  US mining company McEwen Mining Inc   NYSE MUX  has developed the deposit from the exploratory stage into a project poised for production  On the back of a feasibility study  which McEwen completed at the end of 2015  estimates suggest that the mine should produce 65 000 oz  of gold annually at a cash cost of  728 oz  All in sustaining costs at the mine are estimated to be  995 oz  of gold 
Measured and indicated resource estimates suggest there are 2 1 million tons grading 0 95 g t Au or 611 000 oz  of gold and the inferred resource at the deposit is 4 6 million tons at 0 82 g t or 111 000 contained oz 
With around  60 million initial investment  the company is set to ramp up towards the above noted 65 000 oz  of gold production over the coming 24 months and expects a payback period of three years at  1 150 oz  gold  which serves as the base case of the study  or  if gold runs higher  just two years at  1 300 oz 
Permitting is underway right now and the company expects to start building out the site during late 2017  with production ramping up as the build progresses throughout 2018 and  beyond  into 2019 
It s a strong resource for a company of McEwen s size  the company trades for a current market capitalization of  830 million  and adds to an already strong portfolio of producing mines for the company 
Back in January 2016  McEwen announced that it had expanded its claim count at Gold Bar with the acquisition of a property called Gold Bar South  The expansion added 190 mining claims to the Gold Bar count as a whole and drilling subsequent to the acquisition has demonstrated very similar geological formation and  as implied by the similarity in formation  the potential for a high grade resource to complement the estimates initially put together as part of the above referenced feasibility study 
For an investor looking to pick up an exposure to the Gold Bar deposit  McEwen might make for a nice allocation ahead of the company pulling its first oz  out of the ground at the site 
It s not the only player in the region  however 
There s another gold miner  US Gold Corp  NASDAQ USAU   which just made a move that sees it lay claim to a significant part of the Gold Bar district  While McEwen expanded its claim count to the south  US Gold Corp  has snatched up a number of claims to the north of the primary Gold Bar deposit  with its acquisition of what s called  unsurprisingly  Gold Bar North 
The company  this acquisition on July 5  2017  and is pitching it as an extension of its current lead mineralization district  a project called Keystone 
Interestingly  when it acquired Gold Bar South  McEwen justified the purchase in a very similar way to that in which US Gold Corp  explained its Gold Bar North claims acquisition  Here s a quote pulled from the  
 The objective is to develop the property into a satellite resource that can contribute to the production from Gold Bar     And a similar quote from Dave Mathewson  Head of Exploration at US Gold Corp   in the PR announcing the latter s acquisition of Gold Bar North 
 The property is very synergistic for our flagship Keystone district scale project and provides an additional exploration upside for a potential discovery     So why is this worth highlighting 
Well  with Gold Bar North  US Gold Corp  is at a similar stage of development as was McEwen with the central Gold Bar deposit back at the start of the decade  That is  the project has been shown to exhibit very similar geological features to that of the surrounding  high grade producing properties  with the implication being that it could be developed into one such producing property itself 
For a gold mining investor looking to turn back the clock  therefore  and pick up an exposure to Gold Bar at a price reflective of its pre development status  US Gold Corp  might be a smart allocation  There s an inherent risk associated with an allocation to junior gold explorers  of course  primarily rooted in the fact that the company still has to prove that the resource in question is economically mineable  McEwen investors were willing to take on this risk ahead of the company proving said feasibility at Gold Bar  however  and there s a good chance a large portion of the gold community will be willing to do the same with US Gold Corp   especially given that McEwen s efforts in the region have served to reduce the risk somewhat 
For those not familiar with US Gold Corp   the company is a relatively young mining company seeking to bring the above noted Keystone resource to production in Nevada  The resource is strategically located along the state s Cortez trend   one of the most reliably mineralized trends in the world and home to some of the US s biggest deposits  most of which are currently under processing by mining behemoths like Newmont Mining Corporation  NYSE NEM  and Barrick Gold Corporation  NYSE ABX  
The company s exploration lead is Mathewson  who is quoted above and who is one of the most well known and well respected geologists in the Nevada gold space  Over the last twenty years  he has worked with a number of incumbents in the space and the state  most notably having led the teams that made three of Newmont s biggest Nevada discoveries   Tess  Northwest Rain and Saddle   each of which is now producing multi million oz  gold annually  Subsequent to his role at Newmont  Mathewson founded Gold Standard Ventures Corp  NYSE GSV  and built the company to its current valuation just shy of  1 billion  US Gold Corp  is the prolific geologist s next attempt at doing just that 
Bottom line here is that the Gold Bar district has been subject to various exploratory efforts over the past two decades and  with the McEwen progress  is finally about to move to the production phase  McEwen makes for a potentially rewarding exposure to the resource if the company can execute against its build out strategy across the coming twelve to eighteen months  while US Gold Corp  makes for a slightly riskier  but potentially far more rewarding  exposure to the resource ahead of its establishing of estimates at Keystone and Gold Bar North ",2017-07-13,Samuel Rae,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-nevada-gold-bar-deposit-is-about-to-hit-production-200200822,200200822

189289,410805,NEM,Gold Wins Trimester One  Yet So Familiar Is This Run,opinion,"Reminiscent of that classic 1970 LP  D j  Vu     CSN Y   Gold these days is quietly crooning the spacey tune      and I feeeeel like I ve been     here before    
For as the above panel shows  in closing out of last week  Friday  at 1270  gold is just about where  twas relative to this point a year ago  1295   And yet  how ornery indeed it  feeeeels   dare we say practically  responsiveless   given fundamental surroundings ranging from a lackluster dollar  to an erosion in gross domestic product growth  to France s Macron being odds on  and further still to what some may consider to be gold s ultimately booster  that of NorK nukes puttin  up their dukes  But then again  maybe all that logical rationale for higher gold is too abstract to quantify into the trading algorithms 
Yet simple to quantify amongst the BEGOS Markets is where gold stands with the first trimester of 2017 now complete  in first place   10 2    shadowed in second by a somewhat slippery Silver   7 9    Here s the entire bunch year to date 

Whilst one can t really quibble with a trimester s gain of 10   again in consideration of it all  it  feeeeels  unduly small  Small  too  are the moves of the miners   tis as if their aspect of leverage has been leveled  As a valued friend of The Gold Update just wrote in      This year so far GLD  NYSE GLD   or gold itself  is ahead of the big miners    
That we can strikingly see  for it being month s end   tis time to bring up our year over year percentage tracks graphic  whereon we ve drawn a red vertical line from which we can assess this year s progress to date  and specific to the bright blue line of the large miners exchange traded fund GDX  NYSE GDX    tis in 2017 but  6 3  versus gold s  10 2  
And if you re looking ahead  whilst  traditionally  the month of May is considered one of strength for gold   tis been a downer in four of the past five years  Of further note  gold has just completed its fourth consecutive up month  on a mutually exclusive basis  a fifth straight up month has only happened twice in the last 25 years 
As for where we stand year over year  the graphic shows us gold   2   versus the metals equities NEM  Newmont Mining  NYSE NEM    3    FNV  Franco Nevada  also  3    SIL  the popular exchange traded fund of the Silvers   5    GDX   14    and still the stinker GG  Goldcorp   31    the latter having nonetheless just reported Q1 earnings double both that of a year ago as well as estimates 

As for gold s weekly bars  with price having failed again up in the Whiny 1290s   Ugh    to now be back in the purple bounded 1240 1280 resistance zone   twould also appear the 15 week parabolic long trend is nearing its end 

As for that aforementioned slippage in Q1 GDP growth to just 0 7   blame it  so we re told  on the  frugal consumer   who decided to cut back on spending  despite hard data reports of it having now increased for 25 consecutive months through February  and is expected to have also so done for March   due to the unseasonably warm winter  the largest GDP contributing state in the union being California  its Squaw Valley ski area still reporting over 20 feet of snow on the ground   and rising inflation  despite hard data reports of it actually being deflationary  
Put it all together into the Economic Barometer and does the Federal Open Market Committee nudge up its FedFunds rate this next Wednesday  Just for the heck of it anyway 

As for the Fed s eventually pairing down its balance sheet  such  13 trillion in Treasury securities replete  the giant sucking sound we ll no doubt hear shall be an equities escape in highest gear   as in  08  to pick a year   some say even perhaps more dear  Keep therefore thy gold quite near 
Notwithstanding the weekly parabolic long trend nearing its flip to short  and as the below two panel graphic shows on the left across gold s daily bars for the past three months the recent pullback in price with the  Baby Blues  finally having cracked as the uptrend s consistency breaks down  we re not expecting too much further price damage  albeit May may well be a down month 
The 1250s   themselves inside of the 1240 1280 resistance zone   we d like to see to hold  barring something from the FOMC untold  Either way  in the 10 day Market Profile on the right  Gold s overhead trading resistors stand quite stark there in the 1280s 

 Course as you know  Sister Silver s Baby Blues  below left  let go several weeks ago  well before Gold s  in sympathy with industrial metal Cousin Copper s unraveling  But per the website s Market Trends page  you ll find the red metal s blue dots already beginning to curl back up  Still with the white metal now buried at the very bottom of her Profile  below right   more gold slippage may further Sis  plight 

So toward this week s wrap  again it being month s end  here is our broad based view of gold s layer defined structure across the monthly bars from 2011 s All Time High  Always better to be in the basement   sous sol   than in the toasty red zone  but then to re achieve at least  The Floor  would brighten gold s throne 

Thus we traipse into Trimester Two  it coming to bat with as an extensive opening array of data as one might be able to digest 
For in addition to the FOMC s decision on Wednesday come 20 data metrics for the Econ Baro  including April s payrolls data at week s end  D j  vu  indeed disconcerting days these may  feeeeel      but it ain t boring out there  Just think    and in due course thank    GOLD ",2017-04-30,Mark Mead Baillie,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold-wins-trimester-one,-yet-so-familiar-is-this-run-200186179",200186179

189295,410811,NEM,Will The Gold Industry Reel Under Headwinds ,opinion,"Though demand for gold will remain strong in the years to come given the demand for jewelry  bars and coins as well as its safe haven appeal  it has a number of threats lurking  Below  we discuss some of the key challenges and what investors in the sector can look forward to in the coming months and years 
Slowdown in China
China s economy grew at an annual rate of 6 9  in the first quarter of 2017  a tad better than the 6 8  growth witnessed in the fourth quarter  For 2017  the Chinese government projects growth figure of 6 5  compared with the 6 7  expansion in 2016  which is the slowest growth in 26 years 
While rebalancing progresses  the Chinese economy continues to slow  In China  policymakers continue to shift the economy away from its reliance on investment and industry toward consumption and services  This is anticipated to slow growth in the short term while building the foundations for a more sustainable long term expansion 
The continued general economic slowdown has had a negative impact on customer sentiment  Jewelry demand in China 2016 slumped 17  due to higher gold prices  Demand in China will remain constrained in the short term  Gold jewelry demand has been negatively affected by the slowing economic environment as well as changing consumer tastes  It has been observed that the younger Chinese consumers want to spend their money on experiences rather than material goods 
Production at Risk
As per the World Gold Council  mined production has already reached a plateau and it is a matter of time before it goes downward  Over the next five to 10 years  the production profile of currently operating mines shows a relatively steep drop 
Previously  incremental production from newer mines led to continued growth in overall gold production  However  newer mines are now at or near their full potential  leading to slowing down in the growth rates  This has made further production gains increasingly difficult 
This is the aftermath of sharp cuts in capital expenditures in recent years as well as the lack of significant discoveries  Though there have been signs of renewed interest in brownfield development and extending the life of existing mines  these are not adequate to mitigate the slashed project development spending  As existing reserves are depleted  the current project pipeline will be inadequate to replace them fully  and ultimately there will be a supply crunch 
Some gold companies  including Barrick Gold Corp   ABX   Goldcorp  Inc   GG  and Newmont Mining Corp   NEM  are currently high grading at certain mines  The high grade portion of a mine is mined first as this increases the grade of the mined ore and lowers cost per unit 
However  it has pitfalls as it depletes reserves very quickly  thus affecting long term supply  Gold miners  grappling with low gold prices and cost pressure  have not been in a position to invest in new projects in recent years  Companies including AngloGold Ashanti Ltd   AU  and Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd   AEM  have slashed capital and exploration spending 
Gold Substitutes in Technology 
Demand for gold in technological applications is affected by sluggish economic conditions in key markets and substitutes being found  Despite inferior durability  copper and palladium coated copper have made vast inroads into the share of gold in the bonding wire sector  The decade long decline in the dental sector shows no sign of abatement as gold continues to lose ground to ceramic alternatives  which have improved steadily in quality  strength and durability 
Impact of a Stronger Greenback  Rate Hike
There is an inverse relationship between the trade weighted U S  dollar and the price of gold  If the dollar gains strength against major currencies on the back of positive macroeconomic data  like an improving job market and growing industrial activity  it will again put gold prices under pressure 
The Federal Reserve hiked rates for the third time since the Great Recession in March  in a widely expected move that reflects confidence in the strength of the economy  Fed Chair Janet Yellen and her colleagues lifted a key interest rate for the second time in three months 
Citing an improving labor market and greater confidence in consumers  the Fed raised federal funds rate to a range of 0 75  to 1   The policy rate rose by 25 basis points to 1  for the first time in a decade  The Fed has signaled two more rate hikes by the end of the year 
Inherent Risks
Gold exploration and mining are time consuming and expensive tasks  Given its scarcity and remote location of deposits  exploration for new gold deposits is difficult  Once an economically viable deposit is identified  bringing a mine on line can take a decade or more  and it requires substantial capital investment 
Moreover  the mining industry is subject to several risks such as political conflicts  environmental hazards  industrial accidents  unexpected geological conditions  labor force disruptions  unavailability of materials and equipment  weather conditions  pit wall failures  rock bursts  cave ins  flooding  seismic activity and water conditions  However  once a mine is successfully developed  its returns can be enormously high  This is likely to more than neutralize the risks inherent in development and the capital invested for the project 
Gold Stocks to Avoid for the Time Being
We presently recommend investors to stay away from the following gold stocks as they presently have an unfavorable Zacks Rank  The other metrics also indicate that they are not profitable investment options at present 
Alamos Gold Inc   AGI  currently carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   In the trailing four quarters  the company posted an average negative earnings surprise of 137 50   The 2017 earnings estimates for Alamos Gold have gone down by 7  in the last 30 days and for 2018 have plunged 50   You can see  
Eldorado Gold Corp   EGO   another Zacks Rank  4 stock has witnessed a 20  drop in estimates  The company delivered a negative average earnings surprise of 13 89  in the trailing four quarters 
Pershing Gold Corp   PGLC  carries a Zacks Rank  4  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 is at loss of 24 cents per share  The estimates for 2017 have aggravated from a loss of 12 cents to 24 cents per share in the last 60 days  The company has a negative average earnings surprise of 1 18  in the preceding four quarters 
Bottom Line
Dwindling production  lack of new projects and the constant threat of a stronger greenback are some of the sector s worst detractors  But what about investing in the space right now  are there opportunities for short term investors overriding the headwinds

189298,410814,NEM,Gold Climbs Amid More World Turmoil,opinion,"Gold prices are on the rise Tuesday amid turmoil in both Washington D C  and abroad  Prices of the fail safe commodity are now heading closer to  1 300 an ounce 
In Washington  backlash surrounding President Donald Trump pulling the U S  out of the Paris climate agreement currently dominates the news  On top of that  former FBI director James Comey is set to testify in front of Congress on Thursday 
In Europe and the Middle East  uncertainty and tragedy have also helped lead to gold s jump  The recent string of terror attacks in the U K  come before Thursday s parliamentary elections  and just a few days ago  Saudi Arabia  the United Arab Emirates  Egypt  Yemen and Bahrain ended diplomatic and even some commercial ties with Qatar  stating that the small Gulf state sponsors terrorism 
The recent wave of political uncertainty around the world and domestically has pusded gold prices up 1 06  to  1296 30 per ounce on Tuesday  Gold s recent spike comes as the U S  dollar begins to dip the two opposite movements often go hand in hand  Last Friday s weaker than expected jobs report also contributed to today s movement 
Some of the top performing gold and gold mining stocks also jumped today 
Barrick Gold Corporation   NYSE ABX   stock popped 3 83  in early afternoon trading on Tuesday  Newmont Mining Corporation   NYSE NEM   is up 2 32   Canadian gold mining companies McEwen Mining Inc    TO MUX   and Klondex Mines Ltd    NYSE KLDX   gained 4 41  and 3 25   respectively  And DRDGOLD Limited   NYSE DRD   skyrocketed 7 06

Despite today s jump  gold sits well below its 52 week high of  1 375 08 per ounce  which it reached last summer  However  the price of gold has slowly climbed  with a few big fluctuations  since the start of the year

189316,410832,NEM,My 2 Major Goals For Gold In 2017,opinion,"Gold settled the year 2016 on Friday at  1152  up 9  over 2015 s settle of 1061  en route up as much as 30  when at Base Camp 1377 on 11 July   Twas Gold s first net up year since 2012 and its 17th best annual net gain over the past 42 years  since 1975 inclusive  
As measured from the All Time High of 1923 on 06 September 2011  Gold has fallen as much as 46  to 1045 on 03 December 2015  So the Good News from 2016  Gold got a grip  But the Bad News from 2016  Gold gave up 71  of its intra year gain  Still  a win is a win is a win  and we ll take it over the alternative  Now  what s in store for Gold in 2017 
Came this past week the query of our prediction for Gold in 2017  Having precisely forecast 2016 s high of 1377   revised to which after price cleared our initial 1280 target   there s no way we ll be precisely correct in picking two consecutive years   for as a long time trading colleague occasionally muses   If we re so smart  how come we re not rich     Rather  let s just put forth two common sense goals for Gold in 2017 
  Goal One  Global traders of Gold unite  Let s not have Gold s price pounded down into the 1000s and lower  To give back over four decades of gains during which time the United States faux dough M2 money supply has increased twelve fold from less than  1 trillion to now over  12 trillion would be beyond unfathomable  especially given that Gold tonnage during that time frame has only doubled  and throughout which duration other foundationless fiat currencies have been gelandesprunging all over the planet  As do all things in financial nature  excesses revert to means  Gold is excessively low to our present scoreboard M2 debasement  mean  of 2656   just as the stock market is excessively high to its earnings  mean    So a word to the wise is sufficient  or as a great credit mentor of ours back at SocGen used to say   Think about what you re doing  THINK  
Goal Two  Be realistic about the upside  Save for the Shorts  we d all like to see Gold eclipse the  2 000 oz  level in 2017   Tis not gonna happen   if it so does  we ll stop writing  as we stated some three years ago as our penning goal   But in a year s time  to see Gold sitting atop Base Camp 1377 would be terrific  and even more so marvelous  per our Gold Structure chart near the foot of this missive  were price to crawl up out of the Basement and onto The Floor at 1466 
However  the biggest technical obstacle to all that in 2017 shall again be the 1240 1280 resistance zone  Get that big ole resistor behind us    permanently    and we ll be good to go  So with percentage growth in mind as guided by what price has done since 1975  we put together the following  paired bars  graphic of each year s maximum percentage gain  in gold  and yearly net gains  in green  or net losses  in white   The rightmost pairing shows us just how dramatic was Gold s 2016 gains give back 

Next  here are the final 2016 standings for the BEGOS Markets  the precious metals having led the way through mid year  again to then give back the majority of their gains  as above noted  Gold at one point was impressively  30  on the year     but Silver was  53  en route to finishing  only   15   still making the Top Three Podium along with Copper  17  and Big Oil   which  45  was its sixth best up year since at least 1984  

As for Gold s year over year weekly bars  this incipiency of an ensuing upswing would brighten the New Year  but as we noted a week ago  upon price piercing the declining red parabolic Short dots   twill still be below the aforementioned 1240 1280 resistance zone as bounded by the purple lines 

Maintaining our theme from a year ago to date  here are 2016 s final percentage tracks for Gold itself   9    and key precious metals equities that include Goldcorp  NYSE GG   18   Franco Nevada  NYSE FNV   31   VanEck Vectors Gold Miners Fund  NYSE GDX   the prominent exchange traded fund of the Gold miners   52   Global X Silver Miners  NYSE SIL   the popular exchange traded fund of the Silver miners   73   and Newmont Mining Corporation  NYSE NEM   89    What s to complain about      a notable reader  

Now we ve the entire year s performance of the Economic Barometer and S P 500  Again note the pre election building of the Baro  but that now  tis somewhat running out of puff 
We just had an  unexpected  setback in the Chicago Purchasing Managers  Index for December  which may portend for same with the release of the Institute for Supply Management Index on Tuesday  03 Jan  

Zooming in nearer term  here next is the two panel chart of Gold s daily bars on the left spanning the last three months  the baby blue dots of day to day 21 day linear regression consistency on the rise from below the  80  level  that normally bodes well for higher prices ahead  on the right is Gold s 10 day Market Profile which shows good volume support at 1140 and 1133   but we d rather not go there     

Here are the same panels for Sister Silver  whose  Baby Blues   left  continue to descend as Cousin Copper s December decline has not been a friendly industrial metal ally  Silver s centerpiece of trading volume per the Profile  right  is at the 16 05 level 

And thus in ending the year  here we ve the broad based Gold Structure chart  price having maniacally found its way back into the lowest of the major defined strata   Feeeel the heeeeat        Some Like It Hot   The Power Station   85   But in looking out one month across the sixteen January s millennium to date  Gold netted gains in ten of them  moreover  Gold has not had a losing January since 2013   the wee fellow down there is likely thinkin  one is due  but hopefully his is the wrong view  

Toward wrapping up this year ender  let s also assess the State of the Stack

So there  tis for 2016  And as we now write with 2017 arriving by the hour  round the world  again  Gold s Goal One is not to tank and Gold s Goal Two is work toward realistically higher territory  a price of  2 000 oz  in 2017 is out of reach   barring a repeat of 1979 s 136  rise   but a nice 20  net gain back toward 1400 would be nifty

The Idaho Maryland mine  or IM mine for short  produced as much as 129 000 ounces of gold per year until World War II forced the closure in 1942  It was mined on and off on a shoestring basis from after the war until being optioned by Emgold in 1995  Emgold spent a lot of money on management and a little money on the project before they blew up 
From its discovery in 1851 until the last mining in 1956  the mine produced 2 38 million ounces of gold at a grade of  43 opt  The  was reputed to be the second largest and most productive gold mine in California outclassed only by the nearby Empire Mine that began the long history of Newmont Mining  NYSE NEM  
Rise Resources Inc  SNX UPP   the purchase of the entire project including 93 surface acres and 2750 acres of mineral rights for a flat  2 million USD including all core and technical data  The purchase is a straightforward deal that includes no royalty to anyone 
In California permitting an open pit mine is nearly impossible  Permitting an underground mine is quite possible  As of today s price for the shares  Rise has a market cap of  10 million CAD or about  7 5 million USD  That s about  5 68 an ounce in the ground USD and damned cheap 
The market for Rise shares went up today by  0 04 or 15  only because it s a C Exchange listing and nobody reads press releases anyway  When people figure out the deal it will go up more 
Gold under  6 an ounce in the ground in the U S  with a pro business president is the closest to legal stealing since Jon Corzine got into the commodities business  You aren t going to be able to buy gold at that price in an existing mine in the U S  for very long 
Essentially  Rise paid  2 million for something the market used to value at  40 million when gold was a lot cheaper  We are in a bull market  and in a bull market gold shares go up with gold

189318,410834,NEM,Gold Braves The Blues  Moves Higher Still,opinion,"Six weeks into 2017  the above panel shows us Gold s being ahead of where  twas over the same time frame in 2016  although the challenge of so staying appears dead ahead 
Still  you know you re sensing a serious commitment to the Gold market upon seeing it stay firm despite the dropping off of late by its  Baby Blues   For as shown below left across Gold s daily bars over the last three months  even with the falling blue dots being representative of the 21 day linear regression trend losing its upside consistency  price nonetheless is braving the blues by rising against their descending grain  And as for racy Sister Silver below right  the picture is similar  albeit her blues clearly must be equipped with Formula One type carbon fibre disc brakes  the falling dots there having stopped on a dime 

Better still  the ongoing swing back into Gold is keeping price on our anticipated track toward attacking at least the underside of the 1240 1280 resistance zone  the purple lines as next shown   the parabolic Long trend of the weekly bars continuing to unfold 

But as is their wont  our FinMedia friends are instead all again a gaga as  The Dow  regains its five digit milestone which begins with  2   the index itself  1 6  year to date  Nary a word  bout the real leaders   aka  The Precious Metals    which one month plus three trading days into 2017 are leading the BEGOS Market Standings as we see here 


 Course our crony miner colleagues continue to crow over the leverage afforded them by their engaging in the metals equities  made evident by our year over year percentage track of comparably  sleepy old Gold   6  versus those for Goldcorp Inc  NYSE GG   25   Franco Nevada Corporation  NYSE FNV   37   VanEck Vectors Gold Miners  NYSE GDX   the prominent exchange traded fund of the Gold miners   52   NEM  Newmont Mining  NYSE NEM    57   and Global X Silver Miners  NYSE SIL   the popular exchange traded fund of the Silver miners   98    Y all here at the Circle K take stock certificates  


 Course it helps when 
  In leading the ugly dog contest  the almighty Dollar suddenly cowers back into its kennel  the Index posting a loss of  2 8  last month  indeed its worst January save for that of 1987 when the loss was  3 6    Gold going on to post a 20 2  gain for that year   and
  The Federal Open Market Committee s policy statement issued last Wednesday being deemed as dovish  albeit if actually read   twas a bit different than what was reported it said  at least in our head   Gold nevertheless applauding the FOMC s unanimous vote to stand pat   then again  perhaps they are finally giving our Economic Barometer some due 

 But mmb  we just had that blowout jobs number    
Indeed so  Squire  and that it  purportedly  points to an improvement for the full time payrolls side of the ledger  albeit growth of Hourly Earnings for January declined from  0 4  to  0 1   suggestive of a part time payrolls bias  But also  in just this past week  the Baro s incoming data recorded declines in the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index  Consumer Confidence  the Institute for Supply Management s Services reading  and actual shrinkage in Construction Spending

Meanwhile  cross the pond   tis all being going from bland to grand  the EuroZone s economic confidence readings finding six year highs astride growth pickups in gross domestic product  inflation and manufacturing  With presidential elections looming notably in France and Germany   tis curious to see this economic improvement  for  tis similar to what we just saw StateSide in leading up to our own presidential election   Who is that wizard behind the global economic curtain  
No wizardry needed here  as we ve the traders who ve created the following 10 day Market Profiles for both Gold  left  and Silver  right   the white bars being yesterday s  Friday s  respective closing levels of 1222 and 17 52  and the underlying support shelves at the most heavily traded prices as labeled  Of note  when we ve seen the metals toward the highest levels in their profiles  it oft seems a week hence that prices then have scampered back down  but the key of late is that the profiles themselves are pushing out to higher highs  both Gold and Silver having so done this past week in the young year to date 

So toward wrapping it up  this missive featuring our usual month end graphics  we can t slink off to begin preparing for Sunday s Super Bowl without bringing up the Gold Structure s broad based picture  the wee fellow down below clearly not understanding the Gold Story a wit

189319,410835,NEM,Gold Again Slacks  Silver Finally Cracks,opinion,"Through much of this young year  Gold has basked in its glow of being above where  twas through much of the same period a year ago    but now   tis not so  Price settled out the week yesterday  Friday  at 1235  which per the above panel is 25 points   2 0   below 2016 s level nine like weeks into year   then at 1260   Proof once again that the trend is our friend  til it reaches the bend  which by Gold s slacking continues to be the repellent  dare we say repugnant  1240 1280 resistance zone  But as for Sister Silver   
   Ouch  Silver had been on one of those stock market like  we never go down  binges  pretty much from the 20 December low of 15 675 to the year s high of 18 510 on both this past Tuesday and Wednesday  To be sure  we ve been marveling for many a week at how Silver s  Baby Blues  have been depicting an almost perfect upside day by day consistency of the 21 day linear regression trend  But then came this past Thursday and   
   Crack  went Silver s Blues  price plummeting so swiftly as to hoover back 13 trading days of gains    4 9  since 10 February  by falling 3 7  in less than two hours  Yet  tis hardly understatement to assert that selling Silver was absolutely due  having previously noted from the precious metal aspect Gold had already come off its own upside rails  and from the industrial metal aspect  Copper had already for some three weeks been flailing about and failing  From left to right here are the three metals across the last 21 trading days  with their respective Baby Blues and current grey diagonal trendlines 

Still  have a look at each of the above markets  rightmost bar  yesterday  of recovery  For even with Federal Reserve Bank Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer s  per his most diplomatic terminology of  If there has been a conscious effort I m about to join it   jumping on the rate hike bandwagon  the dovely Chair Yellen nonetheless hedged so as to  evaluate whether employment and inflation are continuing to evolve in line with our expectations   That is to say  her eyes are squarely focused on the late arriving February payrolls data due this next Friday  10 March    Course  one need take no more than a mere glance at the Economic Barometer to see that it has  rate hike  written all over it 

Moreover as we move into March  in spite of all the ballyhoo over a stock market true   Yikes      tis the unspoken about metals which continue to lead the BEGOS Markets through the first two months  plus three trading days  of 2017  as we go to the current standings  Sister Silver still shining atop the table 

That said  notwithstanding Friday s partial comeback resilience  should Silver reverse into correction mode near term  how low might be  low   Why  we can turn to our old pisano Leonardo  Fibonacci  Bonacci  don t you know 

Specific to Gold as we turn to its weekly bars    which remain in a parabolic Long trend despite having yet again been cast beneath the bus of the purple bounded 1240 1280 resistance zone    the price pattern from December on balance is similar to that for Silver such that in correction mode  we d eye 1200 as the place to hold  Note  too  that the dashed diagonal regression trend line is of late sporting a bit more negative tilt 

Looking year over year as well for Gold and several of its key equity brethren  as noted at the outset the yellow metal itself is now  2  from where  twas at this time last March  the stocks stacking up as follows  Goldcorp Inc  NYSE GG   1   Franco Nevada Corporation  TO FNV   8   GDX  NYSE GDX   the prominent exchange traded fund of the Gold miners   12   NEM  Newmont Mining  NYSE NEM    27   and Global X Silver Miners  NYSE SIL   the popular exchange traded fund of the Silver miners   45   Sorta gives ya that  We just hit an air pocket  feeling  eh 


 Tell me about it  mmb    

Well  Squire  at least you re a player   to the extent we re willing to keep your trading account replenished   tis not exactly a taxable deduction out there   Perhaps toward improving your timing you ought put more serious focus upon the precious metals  10 day Market Profiles as below displayed for Gold on the left and Silver on the right   and as further updated daily at the website  

Next from near term to the big picture of Gold s Structure by its monthly bars and defined layers  Therein note that the green bars are  up months  and the red bars  down months   This past January and February were both  up months   the rightmost red nub now being just these first three trading days so far in March  Here s the rub of that red nub  not since summer of 2012 has Gold recorded three consecutive  up months   If it can so do this time  round  indeed such as to finish March clear above the 1240 1280 resistance zone   twould open the door for another run to Base Camp 1377  So can Gold make it three for three   Tis why we keep records  such that they can be broken 

Speaking of broken  we wonder  what is one smokin   Bob Shiller s Cyclically Adjusted Price Earnings Ratio for the S P 500 is presently 29 36x   our  live  reading using cap weighted trailing 12 months earnings is 34 35x   Professor Shiller rightly suggests the high valuation is good reason for pruning one s equities holdings  But  one Warren Buffett said this past week  given the still low interest rate environment  that stocks are  on the cheap side   Can we please do a collective  Oh c mon  man    
Here are a few other parting quick hits 
  From the  You Don t Say  Dept    we nevertheless take to heart Josh Steiner s recent piece on China s economy being but one quarter the combined economic size of the US and Europe     yet the dragon s having taken on  24 trillion in debt since 2007 equates to that of the US Europe debt increase from 2000 to 2007     and then came our Black Swan  Got some Gold 
  From  The Lost World Dept    in shaking Venezuela s piggy bank  its sounds like the  30 billion it had in foreign reserves back in 2011  which just two years ago was shaken down to  20 billion  is now but  10 billion rattlin   round inside  Outstanding debt payments due in 2017   7 billion  From Caracas to carcass  Got some Gold 
  From the  Uh Oh    Dept    Bitcoin settled out the week at  1 260  Gold settled out the week at  1 235  Nuff said  Got some Gold ",2017-03-06,Mark Mead Baillie,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold-again-slacks---silver-finally-cracks-200177799,200177799
189321,410837,NEM,Silver No  1 through Q1  No Foolin ,opinion,"Silver is  14 5  year to date by settling yesterday  Friday   as well as the week  the month  and the quarter at 18 275  Pale in comparison is gold s performance  its settle at 1251 6 marking a  8 6  run to this point in 2017  albeit that was its entire net increase for 2016   after en route having been  29 9  at Base Camp 1377  
So as we oft quip   change is an illusion where as price is the truth   for in looking at the above panel  we find gold ahead of where  twas a year ago by only 28 points   2 3    Yes   tis is better than that return on your savings account  but precious metals  prices persist as paltry  For as shown in the scoreboard  the yellow metal  ought be  at  2 681 oz  and in applying the average millennium to date gold silver ratio of 62 3x the white metal  ought be  at  43 oz 
 And then there s the overshoot  right mmb  
Right  Squire  So there s still time for you to plan that big party  for which payment can be made in entirety by owning the precious metals today rather than someday  Either way  in marking both March s and Q1 s conclusion  here we go with the BEGOS Markets standings year to date  Of note  at this time a year ago   twas gold leading the pack   15 4   followed by silver   8 9    this year  they ve swapped performance almost to perfection  at least to this point  for it remains to be seen if they ll again peter out come mid year s point 

Having mentioned the ratio of gold s price to that of silver  here  tis from 01 January 2001 through yesterday  31 March 2017   The ratio being relatively  high  in recent times vindicates silver s bulls   or arguably gold s bears  although year to date suggests they re still in winter hibernation   hence a robust silver nation 

Indeed as we go to our year over year view of gold itself   2   vis   vis the key precious metals equities   tis SIL  the popular exchange traded fund of the silver miners  leading the pack  36   followed by NEM  Newmont Mining  NYSE NEM    24   GDX  NYSE GDX   the prominent exchange traded fund of the gold miners   13   Franco Nevada Corporation  NYSE FNV   7   and managerially maneuvering Goldcorp Inc  NYSE GG  actually  9   A core reader wrote in suggesting that the miners  leverage may have gotten a bit ahead of itself last year  upwards of 6x  over the price of gold  justifying less accelerative  umph  this year  The chart bears that out  but do not be without 

As we next turn to gold s weekly bars  price remains  per last week s missive  rattlin   round in the purple bounded 1240 1280 resistance zone  Also  as the leftmost  oldest  data drops off the chart week by week  the dashed linear regression downtrend line has been somewhat steepening  Still  measuring from the present price  1252  to the rightmost Parabolic blue dot  1211  leaves 41 points of room for price to wiggle about in the ensuing week without flipping the trend to Short   gold s  expected weekly trading range  is presently 33 points  
That said   per the website s Prescient Commentary   gold s technical study of the 12 hr  MACD   moving average convergence divergence   negatively crossed on Thursday  giving us a Market Rhythm Target of 1232   prior to the next positive crossing of that MACD   Were such to will out and the next Parabolic blue dot reach up to around 1220  this Long trend shall have all but run out of puff 

Economically  the Barometer continues to impress  the only weak chink in the incoming data this past week being a softening in the growth of Personal Spending  from  0 2  in January to  0 1  in February   But March s Consumer Confidence reading of 125 6 was its best level since November 1998 s 126 4  The highest Consumer Confidence level in our data bank was 144 7 reached twice during 2000  in January and May  from which followed the  dot com  bomb  Here s the present Baro from a year ago to date  as usual with the S P 500 in red 

Or perhaps  we should less stress the word  impress   for in a newly issued report from the Congressional Budget Office  the current 77  percent of federal debt held by the public is expected to expand  should today s spending and tax laws remain as they are  to 150  over the next 30 years  Moreover  the CBO says such debt growth would increase the likelihood of a fiscal crisis   Now  perhaps I m the last person to figure this out  but aren t we all ready in one  Got gold  Got silver  
Speaking of which  let s drill down into the near term states of the precious metals  beginning with this two panel chart for gold  On the left across three months of gold s daily bars we see the recent recovery in both price and the baby blue dots that depict the day by day consistency of the 21 day linear regression trend  but there is the rather ominous presence of price s now forming a  double top   recall as well per the weekly bars  price is still stuck in resistance and the Parabolic trend is  if you will  getting  Long in the tooth   On the right in gold s 10 Market Profile  clearly the bulk of the trading volume over the last fortnight has gone off at the 1251 level  and from our Market Magnets page  1250 is the volume weighted average price traded across the entire Profile   Tis quite the near term line in the sand 

Here are the same two panel descriptions for Sister silver  at left in her daily bars is the early appearance of a  lower high   at right we again find her presently at the top of her Profile  but there is quite the dearth of contract volume traded down the chasm from 18 20 to 17 55 and you know how market s have that tendency to  fill the gap  

Therefore near term  things could be couched as a bit gamey for the precious metals  That said  and with respect to the earlier analysis that precious metal prices  ought be  more than double their present levels  here s our broad term look at gold s structure and upside milestones which continue to lie in wait  no foolin  

So  ahead of a hefty week of incoming EconData for the EconBaro  we ve these brief across the pond notes of which to keep abreast 
   Brexit  was initiated this past week in rather ceremonious style  Prime Minister May invoking for the first time the European Union s  Article 50  via a hand delivered letter through the bustles of Brussels to the EU  in turn kicking off a two year slog over negotiating the this s  and that s   In the midst of it all  we understand that our British friends may be more preoccupied with getting that new 12 sided  1 coin to work properly in the parking meters and rail stations 
  We shan t overlook that coming right  round the bend like a TGV is Round UN of France s presidential election on 23 April  followed by a runoff between the final two candidates  neither for whom over 50  of the nation shall have initially voted  on 07 May in Round DEUX and then comes  Frexit   Sounds like the EU could really have its hands full 
  April has arrived and you know what that means  yes  the start of the European Central Bank s reduction in monthly debt purchases from  80 billion to  60 billion  Still  a slowing of inflation in both Spain and Germany is now weighing on the euro itself  and in turn  diminishing thoughts of the ECB perhaps nicking up rates late in the year  Still  the  morale  amongst German businesses was just reported at near a six year high 
  And whilst not exactly  Germexit   exiting this past Monday from Berlin s Bode Museum was a Canadian  Big Maple Leaf  24 carat 100kg gold coin  Given its being 99 999 pure gold  in rounding down price s settle by a buck to  1 250 oz   that values to  1 250 oz  x 35oz  kg x 100kg    4 3 million  roughly on par with the amount of loot stolen last Saturday from the Cartier in Monte Carlo   Course  given that Monaco can seal off its 486 acre country in two minutes  they got the bad guys and recovered the stash  But for the as yet unsolved Berlin caper  there s no doubt about it  somebody s got gold  No foolin  ",2017-04-02,Mark Mead Baillie,https://www.investing.com/analysis/no-foolin-39;---silver-no.-1-through-q1-200180923,200180923

189346,410862,NEM,Looking For Asymmetric Risk And Rewards,opinion,"The old adage that we have to take on a great amount of risk in order to earn a high return  isn t always true  Sometimes  we can protect our downside without sacrificing any upside potential gains  This doesn t happen often  but when it does it creates a good trading opportunity 
For example  earlier this year in June  the United Kingdom held a referendum to decide whether or not it should remain in the European Union  Most traders and investors were pretty confident that people in the UK would prefer to keep their status quo and therefore  vote to remain in the EU  This meant that the British financial markets were nearly fully priced for a  remain  outcome 
However  when the votes were finally counted it turned out that voters have actually chosen to exit the European Union  This had an immediate negative affect on the UK markets because it had to now price in an exit  instead of a stay  The British pound sterling fell from US  1 50 to US  1 30 within mere hours  which is a huge move for a currency  The price of gold climbed by over  100 per ounce  before settling back down but still closing the session over  50 per ounce 
Shorting the pound or having a long position in gold just before the referendum is an example of an asymmetric risk reward investment opportunity because the risk is disproportionately smaller than the potential profit  If the British population had voted to remain in the EU  then nothing much would have happened to the markets because a remain outcome was already priced in  But if they voted to exit  then there would be large market correction and a boost for gold  which is what ended up happening 
Investors and fund managers should use all the tools available to them when trying to earn returns in the markets  Kyle Bass of Hayman Capital utilized an asymmetric bet in 2009 where the risk adjusted return was 1 to 500  By predicting that Greece will restructure  he purchased CDS for really cheap which paid off well for him 
The U S  presidential election on Tuesday this week represents another asymmetric trading opportunity  The majority of polls put Hillary Clinton slightly ahead of Donald Trump  but it will probably still end up being a close race  Despite the uncertain results of the election  the markets have signaled an 80  or greater chance that Clinton will become the next president  This means that the financial markets in the U S  have already priced in a win for the Democrats 
So one potential trade at this point is to short U S  stocks and or buy gold right before the election  According to investor and best selling author James Rickards  if Hillary Clinton wins then there will not be any major movements to the financial markets because it already expects her to win  But if for some reason Clinton loses  then the markets will have to reprice for a Donald Trump win  Rickards predicts that if Trump becomes the next president  the S P 500 index could drop by 200 points in the short term 
The Dow Jones could fall by 1000 points  and the price of gold could rise by  100 per ounce  CNN Money claims that a Trump win could send gold up by as much as 10  to  1 400 per ounce  This asymmetric strategy isn t meant to be political or partisan in nature  It s simply a statement about how the financial markets work 
Last week the stock of gold miner Newmont Mining  NYSE NEM  climbed 7  on Clinton s falling poll numbers amidst new FBI developments  But on Monday this week  the stock price fell 5  as gold backed off on the news that the FBI said they did not find any criminal wrongdoing in Clinton s emails  On Tuesday  Americans vote and we will see how the markets react to the outcome ",2016-11-08,Modest Money,https://www.investing.com/analysis/looking-for-asymmetric-risk-and-rewards-200163322,200163322
189347,410863,NEM,Newmont  NEM  Pours First Gold From Long Canyon Mine ,opinion,"Newmont Mining Corporation   NYSE NEM   said that its Long Canyon mine located 100 miles from its existing Nevada complex poured first gold on Nov 8 and the company anticipates declaring commercial production next week  The operation was completed two months before schedule for just below  225 million which was about  50 million or 18  below budget 
During the first phase  Newmont will produce between 100 000 and 150 000 ounces of gold annually over an eight year mine life at some of the lowest costs in its portfolio  Costs applicable to sales are anticipated to be in the range of  400 and  500 per ounce and all in sustaining costs are projected to average between  500 and  600 per ounce 
Newmont took a phased approach by lowering initial development capital  which helped to generate a 26  rate of return and reduce the payback period to just over four years  The project was further optimized by utilizing refurbished equipment instead of new  building a leach facility instead of a mill  as well as leveraging the established infrastructure  expertise and stakeholder relationships in Nevada  the company noted 
Newmont has grown the resource base at Long Canyon by 30  in two years  Newmont geologists have increased the mineralized strike by 70  to a length of over 5 kilometers and oxide mineralization remains open in all directions  Long Canyon is among the four profitable operations the company has added to its portfolio over the last three years 
Newmont s adjusted earnings for third quarter 2016 were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate   Revenues rose by double digits year over year  but missed expectations  Newmont continues to invest in growth projects that are expected to boost its production performance  The company is also making significant progress with its cost and efficiency improvement programs  which is allowing it to generate positive free cash flow  However  Newmont is exposed to a volatile pricing environment and challenges in the copper market NEWMONT MINING Price

189348,410864,NEM,Gold s Fading Ember Into December,opinion,"With the precious metals running out of puff deep into 2016  recall how they completely dominated our BEGOS Market Standings throughout the year s first two trimesters   oil also sneaking up there to appear on the podium in the top three   But with it all going wrong for gold and silver these past two months   tis  black gold  that has taken the top step as we see with a turn of the calendar s page  this year to date table encompassing 11 months plus 2 December days now being in the books 

Still  with the precious metals presently en route to posting their best annual gains of the past six years    barring it all going even further wrong with but 19 trading days remaining in 2016    the  Yeah  But Dept   reminds us that silver and gold have been respectively up as much as 53  and 29  since New Year   Doink  
 Course   tis a mere pittance compared to the far more fiery tracks of the precious metals equities when measured from one full year ago to date  As they presently stand from 03 December last  NEM  Newmont Mining  NYSE NEM   is  79   Global X Silver Miners  NYSE SIL    the popular exchange traded fund of the Silver miners  is  77   GDX  NYSE GDX   the prominent exchange traded fund of the gold miners  is  52   Franco Nevada  NYSE FNV  is  21   and the more subtle sleeper for now    corporately restructured Goldcorp  NYSE GG     is  12   But look from what mid summer heights they ve fallen  live by their volatility  but nimbly attempt to circumvent one s demise as they dive   Ouch  

Specific to gold from a year ago  let s next turn to the weekly bars  The declining red dots denoting now nine weeks of parabolic short trend are catching up in number to the 11 week down run wherein we found gold at this time a year ago  those left most red dots   This is becoming a bit reminiscent of a scene from  The Man With The Golden Gun   Eon Productions   74  wherein one of the participants in a car chase blurts out  I can t find the brakes      

As for their once entwining pas de deux  gold and the S P 500 have quite obviously parted ways along their percentage tracks over these past 21 days  ahead of the interest rate raise 

However  clearly having rejoined ways are the S P and Economic Barometer  both in rapt anticipation of the Federal Reserve Bank s nudging up of their targeted Funds rate from the 0 25  0 50  zone to the 0 50  0 75  zone come 14 December  practically the same date of a year ago 

But specific to the stock market  we wrote this past week as follows to an inquiring great friend and colleague 

   I ve been expecting a stock market correction of some 35  50  for several years  The  faux  P E ratio  of the S P  bandied about by the FinMedia is nowhere near the truthful measure  which if you do the math  is presently 32 9x     Bottom line  either earnings have to double without stock prices rising  else stock prices have to collapse  The rising interest rate scenario shall hasten this  Timing which quarter  twill occur is not as important as getting into cash right now  Better not to grow one s wealth rather than lose it    

A word to the wise is sufficient  As is the dollar foundationless without gold  so is a stock market foundationless without earnings  Write it down 
And that brings us to this cool technical view  the below three panel chart displays the last 21 trading days for the S P   Spoo  left   gold  center  and silver  right   As many of you readers know  the baby blue dots represent the consistency of the 21 day linear regression trends  diagonal lines   Note how these  Baby Blues  for the S P have just begun to crack  whilst those for the precious metals just barely have begun to curl upward  The early bird really can get the worm   assuming prudent cash management should the worm away squirm  

Given that near term stealth nugget for both gold and silver  here next are their 10 Day Market Profiles  Note how gold  left  has come off its lowest bars  as more notably has Silver  right   Is gold s fading ember into December on the verge of getting reignited   For more on that  we ll check in with our Italian friends at the foot of this missive  

So once again  it being now just past month s end   tis time to bring up gold s structure in monthly bars with the defined strata  Yes  the little fellow  down there  is becoming quite exercised about it all  However  if gold indeed can  find the brakes    twill again break the heart of the red zone s wee resident 

Now  by the time many of you digest this  we ll be on the other side of Italy s Sunday constitutional referendum toward more parliamentary stability  for which a victory of  No   could well produce an insolvency slide for several Italian banks  and even invigor inspirations for an eventual  Italexit    which for you West Palm Beacher intellects would mean a parting by Italy from the European Union   But specific to a ruined referendum  and potentially in turn a resigning Renzi  if not then short of an  Italexit      does gold expect it   Twould be quite the gold positive     Si  ",2016-12-04,Mark Mead Baillie,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold-39;s-fading-ember-into-december-200168044,200168044
189349,410865,NEM,Gold Mining  Sectoral Bonds Market Review ,opinion,"I think it s really interesting to watch a sectoral public debt dynamic in step with certain market growth after local recession  Unfortunately  reviewing one is receiving too little attention in the media  For example  when we look briefly at the gold market  we note that debt investors  confidence and trust are being enhanced as far as gold prices stabilize 
The graph below shows us how approximated the YTM curve of the world s largest gold producers bonds moved down during 2016 

This diagram consolidates massive points  duration YTM  representing past and actual market circumstance of international bonds of nine public gold producers such as Barrick Gold Corporation  NYSE ABX   Newmont Mining  NYSE NEM   Anglogold Ashanti Ltd  NYSE AU   etc  Together  these companies provide over 50  of yearly world gold supply 
Risk premium in gold producers  bond yields soared to barely believable heights by 2015  Depending on the duration  it ranged from 0 1 to 6 4 p p  spread between sectoral and riskless  US Treasuries  curve  After the great fall of gold spot market in the spring of 2013  most traditional debt investors had become skeptical about industry bond perspectives 
It happened because such indicators as Debt to Equity  Debt to Market Cap and others had dramatically worsened against the background of the explosive growing of industrial borrowing in the previous period  when gold traded for as much as  1850 per ounce and companies aggressively stepped up mining 
As we can see  that risk premium has now declined in connection with spot market volatility falling  By contrast  Treasury curve itself moved up in so far as FOMC increased federal funds rate  The recovering of gold industry debt credibility is evident  Today  the environment of economic uncertainty fueled interest in traditional protective assets  such gold from investment funds 
As example  the latest World Gold Council Demand Trends Report shows that the investment component of gold demand begins to dominate over industrial again  Spot market growing can be expected in 2017  especially as prices obviously found a resistance area around  1050 per ounce  Therefore  sectoral risk premium for debt investors has the potential to further lowering 
Maybe in the near future  world gold producers  corporate bonds would offer possibilities for not only speculative  but long term portfolio investment strategies  And anyway  it s always useful to understand the condition of some raw material sectoral public debt markets such as gold  oil and gas etc ",2016-12-15,Ruslan Zaripov,https://www.investing.com/analysis/sectoral-bonds-market-review-(gold-mining)-200169873,200169873

189366,410882,NEM,Factors That Could Halt The Gold Rush,opinion,"Demand for gold will remain strong in the years to come given the demand for jewelry  bars and coins as well as its safe haven appeal  Yet  the gold mining industry has a number of lurking headwinds  Below  we have discussed some of the key challenges and what investors in the sector can look forward to in the coming months and years 
China Woes
China s stock market has been shaken by the slowdown in the country s economy  China s economy grew at an annual rate of 6 7  in the second quarter  the slowest quarterly growth in seven years  The Chinese government is targeting for growth of 6 5 to 7  in 2016  a slower pace than what it had got accustomed to in the past two decades 
The International Monetary Fund  IMF  projects 6 6  growth in China in 2016  In China  policymakers continue to shift the economy away from its reliance on investment and industry toward consumption and services  This is anticipated to slow growth in the short term while building the foundations for a more sustainable long term expansion 
The continued general economic slowdown has had a negative impact on customer sentiment  Demand in the second quarter slumped 15  to 143 5 tons  taking the first half total to 322 5 tons  the lowest first half total for Chinese jewelry since 2012  Moreover  changing consumer preferences is also impacting volumes as a growing younger customer base opting for fashionable  unique  highly designed 18k or gem set pieces rather than traditional 24k jewelry 
Production to Flatten on Lack of New Projects
Mine production in 2015 saw its first quarterly decline and its slowest annual growth rate since 2008  While output is slowing down from older mines  particularly in South Africa and the U S   the incremental impact on production from new mines coming on stream is gradually on the ebb  Previously  incremental production from newer mines led to continued growth in overall gold production  However  newer mines are now at or near their full potential  leading to a slowing down in the growth rates  This has made further production gains increasingly difficult 
After a period of implementing cuts to spending on capital and administration  much of the recent cost reduction has come from lower oil prices and favourable exchange rate moves  Reduced spending on exploration and development has already taken its toll on the production pipeline and will further squeeze production over the coming quarters 
Some gold companies  including Barrick Gold Corp   ABX   Goldcorp  Inc   GG  and Newmont Mining Corp  NYSE NEM    NEM  are currently high grading at certain mines  The high grade portion of a mine is mined first as this increases the grade of the mined ore and lowers cost per unit 
However  it has its pitfalls as it depletes reserves very quickly  thus affecting long term supply  Gold miners  grappling with low gold prices and cost pressure  have not been in a position to invest in new projects in recent years  Companies including AngloGold Ashanti Ltd  AU  and Agnico Eagle Mines Limited  AEM  have slashed capital and exploration spending  Given the lack of new projects  mine production will eventually reach a plateau in the next couple of years 
Gold Substitutes in Technology 
Demand for gold in technological applications is affected by sluggish economic conditions in key markets and substitutes found for the metal  Despite inferior durability  copper and palladium coated copper have made vast inroads into the share of gold in the bonding wire sector  The decade long decline in the dental sector shows no sign of abatement as gold continues to lose ground to ceramic alternatives  which have improved steadily in quality  strength and durability 
Impact of a Stronger Greenback  Rate Hike
There is an inverse relationship between the trade weighted U S  dollar and the price of gold  If the dollar gains strength against major currencies on the back of positive macroeconomic data  like an improving job market and growing industrial activity  it will again put gold prices under pressure 
Lately better than expected economic data has increased the speculation that the FED will raise interest rates by December  This led to a climb in US dollar to two months high and consequently gold dipped below  1 300 an ounce  Additionally pushing down gold is the dollar s rise against the British pound  which slumped to a 31 year low against the dollar after the release of a timeline for Britain s exit from the European Union 
Inherent Risks
Gold exploration and mining are time consuming and expensive tasks  Given its scarcity and remote location of deposits  exploration for new gold deposits is difficult  Once an economically viable deposit is identified  bringing a mine on line can take a decade or more  and it requires substantial capital investment 
Moreover  the mining industry is subject to several risks such as political conflicts  environmental hazards  industrial accidents  unexpected geological conditions  labor force disruptions  unavailability of materials and equipment  weather conditions  pit wall failures  rock bursts  cave ins  flooding  seismic activity and water conditions  However  once a mine is successfully developed  its returns can be enormously high  This will more than offset the risks inherent in development and the capital invested for the project

189368,410884,NEM,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  Tahoe Resources  Goldcorp  Seabridge Gold  Fortuna Silver Mines And Newmont Mining,opinion,"For Immediate Release

Chicago  IL   October 14  2016   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Gold  part 2  including Tahoe Resources Inc   NYSE            Goldcorp Inc   NYSE            Seabridge Gold  Inc   NYSE            Fortuna Silver Mines Inc   NYSE           and Newmont Mining Corp  NYSE NEM    NYSE           

Industry  Gold  part 2

Link  

Declining output from existing mines  geopolitical tensions  concerns over Brexit  China worries and delay in rate hikes is working in favor of gold after years of languishing prices  There are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the gold mining industry for both the short and the long term  Below  we discuss what investors in the gold mining sector can look forward to in the coming months and years 

India  China Long Term Growth Drivers

Over the last decade  combined demand for gold from India and China has risen 71   Last year  these two markets accounted for 54  of consumer gold demand  up from 33  in 2005  India has a strong tradition of investing in gold  mainly in jewelry  Demand mostly increases around the wedding and festive seasons  which begin from mid to late August and continue until January  Expenditure on gold can account for almost 30  of the total wedding cost  This gives a boost to local currency demand and raises gold prices 

In China  people view gold  whether in the form of bars  coins or jewelry  as a natural vehicle for savings and diversification  Gold is embedded in China s culture and the Chinese New Year and weddings are key events for the country s gold consumption  In China  although demand might drop from the highs of 2013  growth remains intact  A continuous shift toward higher margin products has lately been observed in the Chinese jewelry market  Gem set and 18 carat gold items are increasingly popular  with the latter largely gaining popularity among the younger generation 

The World Gold Council anticipates demand from China to grow at least another 20  by 2017  While China s middle class is expanding  India has a comparatively low level of per capita gold holdings  The powerful combination of increasing urbanization and strong cultural affinity for gold bodes well for the metal s demand in both these countries 

China s central bank also continues to purchase the precious metal on a monthly basis  as it sees value in diversifying in gold  People s Bank of China  PBOC  now holds a total of 57 18 million ounces of gold  Currently  China s gold reserves are ranked fifth in the world  behind the U S   Germany  Italy and France 

U S Markets Hold Promise

In the second quarter of 2016  demand for gold jewelry in the U S  went up 1  year on year   the tenth consecutive quarterly increase  Demand in H1 at 48 6 tons was the strongest since 2009  Consistent  albeit moderate economic growth  improving employment levels and growth in consumer confidence are supporting demand 

Revived Appetite for Acquisitions

Vancouver based Tahoe Resources Inc  s  NYSE           acquisition of Lake Shore Gold Corp  will address challenges faced by both companies  The transaction added Timmins West and Bell Creek mines in Timmins  Ontario  to Tahoe s holdings  which include mines in Guatemala and Peru 

The enlarged company is expected to produce 370 000 430 000 ounces of gold in 2016 at total cash costs of  675  725 per ounce and all in costs of  950  1 000 per ounce  Last year  Tahoe had bought a smaller rival Rio Alto Mining to expand its presence in Latin America 

Goldcorp Inc   NYSE           has acquired Kaminak Gold Corporation  Kaminak s primary asset is the wholly owned Coffee Gold project   a hydrothermal gold deposit located at Yukon  This project has considerable potential for near mine discoveries  with mineralization remaining open along strike and at depth 

The Coffee gold deposit currently has total indicated gold mineral resources of 3 million ounces and total inferred gold mineral resources of 2 2 million ounces  The acquisition is in sync with Goldcorp s strategy of aligning with smaller exploration companies to identify and develop mining districts with large exploration potential that can grow its net asset value per share 

Seabridge Gold  Inc   NYSE           acquired SnipGold and its Iskut project which is a gold silver copper project with measured and indicated resources of 2 16 million ounces of gold  13 17 million ounces of silver  and nearly 502 7 million pounds of copper  Fortuna Silver Mines Inc   NYSE           acquired Goldrock Mines and its Lindero gold project in Argentina  The project contains 1 15 million ounces of gold 

Gold Miners Optimizing Portfolio

The drop in gold prices in recent years had put the gold mining companies  bottom lines under pressure  The companies were actively pursuing opportunities to optimize their portfolio  including the divestiture of certain non core or non productive assets and reduction of debt  maximization of return on capital along with driving value across the portfolio 

Newmont Mining Corp   NYSE           sold Newmont Waihi Gold Limited in New Zealand to OceanaGold Corp  Over the last two years  Newmont has generated  1 7 billion through non core asset sales  allowing the company to reduce its debt  invest in profitable production and return capital to its shareholders

189369,410885,NEM,Newmont  NEM  Q3 Earnings  Will The Stock Beat Estimates ,opinion,"Gold miner Newmont Mining Corporation   NYSE NEM   is scheduled to report third quarter 2016 results after the closing bell on Oct 26 
Last quarter  the company had delivered a positive earnings surprise of roughly 57 14   Newmont has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters  with an average surprise of 17 17  Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement 
Factors to Consider
Newmont continues to invest in growth projects that are likely to boost its production performance  The company is pursuing a number of projects including Long Canyon  in Nevada and Merian in Suriname  Newmont remains optimistic about its Long Canyon project in which is expected to start of production in first half 2017  The company s Merian project recently started commercial production  The Tanami expansion project in Australia is also expected to come on stream in 2017 
Newmont is also making significant progress with its cost and efficiency improvement programs  Successful cost reductions are allowing the company to generate positive free cash flow   The company reduced its gold all in sustaining costs  AISCs  by roughly 10  in 2015  Further  gold and copper AISCs declined in second quarter 2016 
Moreover  Newmont remains committed to de lever its balance sheet  Newmont paid  200 million for its current term loan and  250 million for project debt in Ghana and Indonesia in 2015  The company remains on track to pay down further debt in 2016  The company s move to divest its stake in PTNNT  the operator of the Batu Hijau mine in Indonesia  will allow it to pare debt and invest in high margin projects 
Newmont anticipates attributable gold production to increase from a range of 4 7 5 0 million ounces in 2016 to 4 9 5 4 million ounces in 2017  and remain stable thereafter in a range of 4 5 5 million ounces through 2020 The company projects copper AISC to average in the band of  2 20  2 40 per pound in 2016 and increase to  2 30  2 60 per pound in 2017 due to timing on sustaining capital spend  It is anticipated to further increase to the range of  2 75  2 95 per pound in 2018 due to stripping at Boddington NEWMONT MINING Price and EPS Surprise   Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Newmont is likely to beat estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  2 or 3 for this to happen  This is not the case here  as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP for Newmont is 0 00   This is because the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate both stand at 52 cents 
Zacks Rank  Newmont has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  the company s ESP of 0 00  makes surprise prediction difficult 
We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Stocks That Warrant a Look
Here are some other companies in the basic materials space you may want to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter 
The Chemours Company   NYSE CC   has an Earnings ESP of  25 71  and sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see 
B2Gold Corp    NYSE BTG   has an Earnings ESP of  25  and carries a Zacks Rank  2 
The Dow Chemical Company   NYSE DOW   has an Earnings ESP of  1 25  and also carries a Zacks Rank  2

Ah  but first  with just Halloween left in October s trading balance  let s call it a month and bring up the BEGOS Market Standings through these 10 months of 2016   save for Monday  which may be an abbreviated one as folks rush out early from their travails to prepare the little ones for trick or treat   And for just the second time year to date  neither gold nor silver are at the top of the table  for given the early October selloff in the precious metals  plus oil s being fairly firm throughout   tis so called  Black Oil  leading the pack as was the case at the end of May 

That s how they now stand  but if something tells you the above table may look a bit different in a month s time  you re not alone  as much may befall the markets come November s end 
As for the precious metals  in tracking percentage performances from a full year ago to date  gold itself is up but a mere 11  as opposed to this group of equities brethren  Goldcorp Inc  NYSE GG   13   Franco Nevada  NYSE FNV   25   GDX  NYSE GDX   the prominent exchange traded fund of the gold miners   57   NEM  Newmont Mining  NYSE NEM    78   and Global X Silver Miners  NYSE SIL   the popular exchange traded fund of the silver miners   92   

Now  much anticipated was yesterday s  Friday s  first peek at Q3 gross domestic product  And   some might say  conveniently    it came in at a comparably robust annualized rate of  2 9   well in excess of expectations and clearly the fastest annualized growth pace since that recorded for Q2 of 2015   3 9    So  bye bye  gold  right 
Wrong  Save for gold s instantaneous knee jerk seven point decrease smack on the GDP s release  price fully recovered and then some in less than 30 minutes  Followed was the FBI s much reprised surprise  spurring gold higher still  such as to trade above the 1280 1240 support zone for almost a full hour before settling out the week at 1276  Whilst  tis nothing about which to write home  given gold s hard selloff in kicking off October   twas price s best weekly performance since that rout and evidence that the below shown purple bounded 1280 1240 support zone has    to this point    contained any further selling 

So   tis probably fair to say gold is not anticipating a vote by the Federal Open Market Committee to raise their bank s Funds rate come Wednesday  Oh you didn t know there s an FOMC meeting this week  Nor   twould seem  does anyone else  For  tis written   Fed policy shall not conflict with election duplicity   Rather  the financial mainstream is focused on the FOMC s 14 December decision  albeit the fallout following the 08 November election may well find a forgotten Fed having folded and frittering about in the far corner 
Specific to the GDP s  2 9  annualized Q3 growth rate  let s bring up the Economic Barometer  As you know  the GDP is a very bluntly broad based  kill the fly with the sledge hammer  measure  combining private sector investment and consumption with government spending  plus exports less imports  Perhaps with more precision  the Econ Baro assesses some 50 data points per month for their changes  their revisions  and their expectations  The lavender portion of the below line approximates the Q3 reporting period  essentially August through October   As always  you are the judge 

With respect to herein twice mentioning gold s early October selloff   price having settled 30 September at 1317  only to then fall as far as 1243   8   in just five trading days   here next we ve gold s percentage track from one month ago to date  along with the tracks for both the S P 500 and the dollar Index   Tis interesting to note that from about mid chart onward  both gold and the dollar on balance have been rising together  suggestive of gold s selloff having been a bit overdone  But then again  as we oft hearken  gold plays no currency favourites  as ought become more apparent upon  full faith  morphing into  abstract wraith  

On we go to the precious metals  ascending  Baby Blues  and Market Profiles  First for gold  in this two panel view we ve on the left price s daily bars covering three months ago to date  the rising blues dots trending toward a cross of their 0  axis  from which the 21 day linear regression would swing to positive  on the right  the 10 day profile depicts 1270 as the centerpiece price ideally above which to stay 

Second for Sister Silver   who arguably ought be first as her upside acceleration is  expected  to outdo that for gold  the present yellow white metal price ratio of 72x seemingly  high  vis   vis the 25 year median of 64x   her two panels are like those for gold  her centerpiece price in the profile being 17 65 

And by our using poetic license in calling this  month s end    tis time once again to review where we are within the gold structure in turning to the monthly bars and therein the broadly defined trading zones which have developed since the All Time High of 1923 back on 06 September 2011  Whist we ve an ever so long upside battling road ahead   tis presently better being in the basement   sous sol   than being baked  Moreover  as this year s d nouement approaches  there s still time for us to hopefully be incorrect about having thus far precisely picked Base Camp 1377 as 2016 s high  We pray that we re wrong 

Finally  these few closing notes 
  If you ve peeked at our page for Earnings Season  you ll have noted that 63  of companies have actually improved their Q3 bottom lines from those of a year ago  we re not quite half way through the Q3 season  but should that 63  level hold up   twill be the best set of year over year results since Q4 of 2010  64   
  That said   tis a good thing  earnings don t matter anymore   for even with such improvement  specific to the S P 500  our  live  price earnings ratio at 35 0x remains double what  it ought be    Nice to know those days of 50  stock market corrections are behind us  what   
  The Eurozone yo yo is traveling up its string  Spain s rate of unemployment falling below 20  for the first time in some six years   OL    German business sentiment  too  is on the move  and    this just in from our  Just Like That Dept      thanks to cost cutting  Deutsche Bank  NYSE DB  has returned to profitability  Can you believe it   But on the  actually doing business  side  their exchange traded fund unit year to date is down some  8 billion    shuussh    don t tell anybody  
  Across the Channel  banks which had been droppin  are now poppin   the Royal Bank of Scotland  NYSE RBS  posting its highest investment banking revenue in over two years   which may help with pending  misconduct  charges   whilst over at Barclays  NYSE BCS   the bond traders came through in helping the bank post a 35  rise in its Q3 profit   Or to quote James Carville   It s the bond market  the bond market      
  As noted  yes Martha  there is an FOMC meeting this week   twould be a heckova Halloween trick if they  pulled the rate trigger   non  Fawgit about it  it ain t gonna happen  But we do get a treat as 20 metrics will have the Econ Baro on stage throughout  Again  unscriptable stuff  Stay tuned 
  And in closing  apparently  President Rodrigo  Rody  Roa  Digong  Duterte has  through some form of divine intervention  been instructed to cease employing the prolific profanity pervading his parlance  Time as well  ole buddy  to start abiding by the The Golden Rule  So go do the right thing  Buy gold ",2016-10-30,Mark Mead Baillie,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold-survives-gdp-pop;-fbi-then-adds-a-prop-200161552,200161552

189401,410917,NEM,Gold Mining Industry Stock Outlook   Oct  2016,opinion,"Looking back at the first half of this year  the major highlights for the gold mining industry were   Record H1 investment demand  and a  25  rise in gold price   Record gold ETF inflows drove investment demand 16  higher than the peak attained during the recession  
After three lackluster years  gold prices finally seem to have found solid ground  surging 25  in the first half and remaining above  3 300 an ounce threshold  making it the best H1 since 1980  The yellow metal has been the best performing asset  trumping major equity indices  investment grade and high yield bonds as well as commodity indices 
What Led to the Surge 
Worries over the global economy  Brexit induced volatile equity markets  the Federal Reserve s  Fed  stance to maintain steady interest rates and the introduction of negative interest rates by several central banks increased the safe haven appeal of gold 
With the uptrend in gold prices  gold producers staged a comeback this year after suffering harrowing losses last year  The emphasis on cost management as a reaction to lower gold prices in recent years has borne fruit  In the second quarter  year on year total cash costs and all in sustaining costs fell 6  and 8   respectively 
While further cost cuts appear difficult  costs are now under control and producer margins are now at healthy levels  Top gold producers Barrick Gold Corporation  ABX   Newmont Mining Corporation  NYSE NEM   NEM   Agnico Eagle Mines Limited  AEM  all reported a rise in second quarter earnings buoyed by higher gold prices 
Solid Investment Demand Leads to Record Demand in H1
As per the World Gold Council  the first half of 2016 was the best on record with total gold demand rising 18  year over year to 233 5 5 tons  Investment demand was at 1 063 9 tons  a 127  rise year over year  Additionally  it was 16  higher than the previous H1 high since 2009  when the market was in the doldrums due to recession 
Further  for the first time on record  investment demand has been the largest component of gold demand for two consecutive quarters fueled by pent up demand among Western investors across the board  from retail to institutional and for bars  coins and ETFs  In fact  the growth in demand for gold backed ETFs has outperformed all other sectors in the first half with demand at 580 tons  bettering the previous high of 458 tons in the first half of 2009 
Negative Interest Rate Policies  NIRP  implemented by central banks in Japan and Europe  Fed s dovish stance on interest rates  uncertainty regarding Brexit  upcoming US elections   the increasingly parlous state of Italy s banking sector and geopolitical unrest in the Middle East triggered a flight to safety 
On the contrary  jewelry demand plunged 17  to 925 3 tons in the first half of 2016 as high gold prices affected consumer sentiment  Demand in the second quarter was at 444 1 tons  the lowest quarterly total in six years mainly due to combined weakness in India and China  In India  following the nationwide strike that ended in April  pent up demand did not work in favor of gold due to the reigning high prices which deterred customers from buying 
Further  two consecutive years of deficient monsoon rainfalls took its toll on rural spending that accounts for almost half of India s demand  Government regulations and additional 1  excise duty on jewelry manufacturing also had a negative impact  Demand in China at 322 5 tons in H1 was the lowest first half total in four years due to highs prices against a backdrop of continued economic slowdown  In the technology sector  gold demand was down 3  to 161 tons in the first half of the year 
The central banks were the primary acquirers of gold  purchasing 185 tons net over the half  At June end  world official gold holdings were over 32 800 tons  the highest value since the first quarter of 2013 
Supply Up in H1  Will It Be Sustained 
Total supply in the first half surged 8  year on year to 2 307 tons  Increase in total mine supply  net of mine production and net hedging  was 8   Mines like Fresnillo  LON FRES  PLC s Herradura and Noche Buena in Mexico and Torex Gold Resources Inc  s  TORXF  El Limon Guajes mine in Mexico  Goldcorp Inc  s  GG   l onore and Cochenour mines in Canada  Guyana Goldfields Inc  s  GUYFF  Aurora project and Troy Resources Limited  TRYRF  Karouni project in Guyana continued to add to the numbers  Another marked improvement was the 10  increase in recycling activity triggered by the dramatic price increase 
However  the increase in production is a temporary phase as project pipeline is seen to be diminishing  In recent years  additional production from new mines brought on stream has waned  Producers have cut down on expenditure and are focused on maximising production from their existing portfolio of assets

189402,410918,NEM,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  Gold Fields  Caledonia Mining And New Gold,opinion,"For Immediate Release

Chicago  IL   October 13  2016   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Gold Mining  part 1  including Gold Fields Ltd   NYSE    Caledonia Mining Corporation Plc  OTCBB    andNew Gold  Inc   NYSEMKT     

Industry  Gold Mining  part 1

Link  

Looking back at the first half of this year  the major highlights for the gold mining industry were   Record H1 investment demand  and a   25  rise in gold price   Record gold ETF inflows drove investment demand 16  higher than the peak attained during the recession 

After three lackluster years  gold prices finally seem to have found solid ground  surging 25  in the first half and remaining above  3 300 an ounce threshold  making it the best H1 since 1980  The yellow metal has been the best performing asset  trumping major equity indices  investment grade and high yield bonds as well as commodity indices 

What Led to the Surge 

Worries over the global economy  Brexit induced volatile equity markets  the Federal Reserve s  Fed  stance to maintain steady interest rates and the introduction of negative interest rates by several central banks increased the safe haven appeal of gold 

With the uptrend in gold prices  gold producers staged a comeback this year after suffering harrowing losses last year  The emphasis on cost management as a reaction to lower gold prices in recent years has borne fruit  In the second quarter  year on year total cash costs and all in sustaining costs fell 6  and 8   respectively 

While further cost cuts appear difficult  costs are now under control and producer margins are now at healthy levels  Top gold producers all reported a rise in second quarter earnings buoyed by higher gold prices 

Solid Investment Demand Leads to Record Demand in H1

As per the World Gold Council  the first half of 2016 was the best on record with total gold demand rising 18  year over year to 233 5 5 tons  Investment demand was at 1 063 9 tons  a 127  rise year over year  Additionally  it was 16  higher than the previous H1 high since 2009  when the market was in the doldrums due to recession 

Further  for the first time on record  investment demand has been the largest component of gold demand for two consecutive quarters fueled by pent up demand among Western investors across the board  from retail to institutional and for bars  coins and ETFs  In fact  the growth in demand for gold backed ETFs has outperformed all other sectors in the first half with demand at 580 tons  bettering the previous high of 458 tons in the first half of 2009 

Negative Interest Rate Policies  NIRP  implemented by central banks in Japan and Europe  Fed s dovish stance on interest rates  uncertainty regarding Brexit  upcoming US elections  the increasingly parlous state of Italy s banking sector and geopolitical unrest in the Middle East triggered a flight to safety 

On the contrary  jewelry demand plunged 17  to 925 3 tons in the first half of 2016 as high gold prices affected consumer sentiment  Demand in the second quarter was at 444 1 tons  the lowest quarterly total in six years mainly due to combined weakness in India and China  In India  following the nationwide strike that ended in April  pent up demand did not work in favor of gold due to the reigning high prices which deterred customers from buying 

Further  two consecutive years of deficient monsoon rainfalls took its toll on rural spending that accounts for almost half of India s demand  Government regulations and additional 1  excise duty on jewelry manufacturing also had a negative impact  Demand in China at 322 5 tons in H1 was the lowest first half total in four years due to highs prices against a backdrop of continued economic slowdown  In the technology sector  gold demand was down 3  to 161 tons in the first half of the year 

The central banks were the primary acquirers of gold  purchasing 185 tons net over the half  At June end  world official gold holdings were over 32 800 tons  the highest value since the first quarter of 2013 

Supply Up in H1  Will It Be Sustained

189403,410919,NEM,Why Gold Stocks Are Must Adds For Your Portfolio,opinion,"Declining output from existing mines  geopolitical tensions  concerns over Brexit  China worries and delay in rate hikes is working in favor of gold after years of languishing prices  There are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the gold mining industry for both the short and the long term  Below  we discuss what investors in the gold mining sector can look forward to in the coming months and years 
India  China Long Term Growth Drivers
Over the last decade  combined demand for gold from India and China has risen 71   Last year  these two markets accounted for 54  of consumer gold demand  up from 33  in 2005  India has a strong tradition of investing in gold  mainly in jewelry  Demand mostly increases around the wedding and festive seasons  which begin from mid to late August and continue until January  Expenditure on gold can account for almost 30  of the total wedding cost  This gives a boost to local currency demand and raises gold prices 
In China  people view gold  whether in the form of bars  coins or jewelry  as a natural vehicle for savings and diversification  Gold is embedded in China s culture and the Chinese New Year and weddings are key events for the country s gold consumption  In China  although demand might drop from the highs of 2013  growth remains intact  A continuous shift toward higher margin products has lately been observed in the Chinese jewelry market  Gem set and 18 carat gold items are increasingly popular  with the latter largely gaining popularity among the younger generation 
The World Gold Council anticipates demand from China to grow at least another 20  by 2017  While China s middle class is expanding  India has a comparatively low level of per capita gold holdings  The powerful combination of increasing urbanization and strong cultural affinity for gold bodes well for the metal s demand in both these countries 
China s central bank also continues to purchase the precious metal on a monthly basis  as it sees value in diversifying in gold  People s Bank of China  PBOC  now holds a total of 57 18 million ounces of gold  Currently  China s gold reserves are ranked fifth in the world  behind the U S   Germany  Italy and France 
U S Markets Hold Promise
In the second quarter of 2016  demand for gold jewelry in the U S  went up 1  year on year   the tenth consecutive quarterly increase  Demand in H1 at 48 6 tons was the strongest since 2009  Consistent  albeit moderate economic growth  improving employment levels and growth in consumer confidence are supporting demand 
Revived Appetite for Acquisitions
Vancouver based Tahoe Resources Inc  s  TAHO  acquisition of Lake Shore Gold Corp  will address challenges faced by both companies  The transaction added Timmins West and Bell Creek mines in Timmins  Ontario  to Tahoe s holdings  which include mines in Guatemala and Peru 
The enlarged company is expected to produce 370 000 430 000 ounces of gold in 2016 at total cash costs of  675  725 per ounce and all in costs of  950  1 000 per ounce  Last year  Tahoe had bought a smaller rival Rio Alto Mining to expand its presence in Latin America 
Goldcorp Inc   GG  has acquired Kaminak Gold Corporation  Kaminak s primary asset is the wholly owned Coffee Gold project   a hydrothermal gold deposit located at Yukon  This project has considerable potential for near mine discoveries  with mineralization remaining open along strike and at depth 
The Coffee gold deposit currently has total indicated gold mineral resources of 3 million ounces and total inferred gold mineral resources of 2 2 million ounces  The acquisition is in sync with Goldcorp s strategy of aligning with smaller exploration companies to identify and develop mining districts with large exploration potential that can grow its net asset value per share 
Seabridge Gold  Inc   SA  acquired SnipGold and its Iskut project which is a gold silver copper project with measured and indicated resources of 2 16 million ounces of gold  13 17 million ounces of silver  and nearly 502 7 million pounds of copper  Fortuna Silver Mines Inc   FSM  acquired Goldrock Mines and its Lindero gold project in Argentina  The project contains 1 15 million ounces of gold 
Gold Miners Optimizing Portfolio
The drop in gold prices in recent years had put the gold mining companies  bottom lines under pressure  The companies were actively pursuing opportunities to optimize their portfolio  including the divestiture of certain non core or non productive assets and reduction of debt  maximization of return on capital along with driving value across the portfolio 
Newmont Mining Corp  NYSE NEM    NEM  sold Newmont Waihi Gold Limited in New Zealand to OceanaGold Corp   OCANF   Over the last two years  Newmont has generated  1 7 billion through non core asset sales  allowing the company to reduce its debt  invest in profitable production and return capital to its shareholders 
IAMGOLD Corp   IAG  LON ICAG   completed the sale of its Niobec mine to a group of companies led by Magris Resources Inc  for cash proceeds of  500 million  This sale will increase IAMGOLD s liquidity position  thereby strengthening its financial position over many of its competitors  Goldcorp had sold its 26  stake in Tahoe Resources for just under  1 billion in order to focus on cash flow generation 
Barrick Gold Corp   ABX  is also shedding non core assets to optimize its portfolio and strengthen its balance sheet  The company  in late 2015  completed the sale of a 50  interest in the Zaldivar copper mine in Chile to Antofagasta  LON ANTO  Plc  and also closed the divestment of its 70  interest in the Spring Valley project and its 100  interest in the Ruby Hill mine to subsidiaries of Waterton Precious Metals Fund II Cayman  LP 
Moreover  the company wrapped up the sale of its 50  interest in the Round Mountain mine and divested the Bald Mountain mine in Nevada to Kinross Gold Corp   KGC  earlier this year  receiving  610 million in cash for these non core assets  Barrick reduced its total debt by 24  in 2015  exceeding its original debt reduction goal of  3 billion 
Gold s Safe Haven Appeal 
Gold has always been viewed as a store of value and a safe haven asset  The buying of gold is a hedge against inflation  macroeconomic  geopolitical  systemic and monetary risk  This trend intensifies during periods of economic turmoil and geopolitical tensions  The current economic scenario is rife with all these factors 
Superiority Over Other Precious Metals
Gold s worldwide acceptance as a store of value sets it apart from other precious metals such as platinum  palladium and silver whose demand stems mainly from their industrial applications  Gold is produced primarily for accumulation while the other commodities are produced for consumption 
Moreover  in contrast to other commodities  gold does not perish  tarnish or corrode  nor does it have quality grades  There has not been any material change in gold s quality over the years  gold mined thousands of years ago is the same as today  Gold existing above ground is easily interchanged with newly mined gold  This ensures the continuous demand of the metal for years to come 
Bottom Line
Gold is having a good ride this year on mounting global economic fears  This accelerated flight to safety makes investment in gold a prudent option at the moment

189423,410939,NEM,5 Gold Mining Stocks Soaring As Fed Keeps Rates On Hold,opinion,Gold prices trudged higher on Wednesday after the U S  Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged at its September meeting as it wants to see further improvement in the labor market and more sign of strength in the economy  The Fed  however  signalled one hike by the end of the year Bullion Gains as Fed Stands PatGold prices for December delivery on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange closed 1  higher at  1 331 40 a troy ounce yesterday  the highest level since Sep 9  Prices of the metal are up roughly 25  year to date The Fed kept benchmark interest rates steady in the band of 0 25  0 50   The central bank  in its statement  said that  the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has strengthened but decided  for the time being  to wait for further evidence of continued progress toward its objectives   A delay in raising interest rates elevates demand for gold  which produces no income but relies on price appreciation to attract investors The Fed statement noted a pickup in economic activity since a choppy first half 2016 and strong growth in employment and household spending  But it added that business fixed investment remains weak  The Fed also stated that near term risks facing the economy appear  roughly balanced  Gold prices also gained support from a slump in the U S  dollar that hit a one month low yesterday on the combined effect of the dovish Fed stance and Bank of Japan s announcement that it would focus on keeping the yield on 10 year Japanese government bonds at zero in its latest bid to tackle deflation  The Fed s announcement also triggered a spurt in the equity markets yesterday Gold is enjoying a solid run in 2016 after three lackluster years  Gold prices broke above the  1 300 per troy ounce level in Jun 2016 after Britain voted to leave the European Union  EU   The market shattering move sparked as much as around 8  surge in the metal s prices to trade at levels last seen in Jul 2014  The Brexit induced chaos in the global markets spurred investors  demand for safe havens  triggering a strong rally in gold Moreover  gold prices have been gaining support from expectations that central banks around the world would step up monetary stimulus to avert economic damages from Brexit  The deferral of U S  interest rate hikes has been another major factor that has helped gold regain its shine this year after a tumultuous 2015  Prices of the metal rose more than 2  in second quarter 2016  aided by a supportive macro environment Still Room for Further UpsideA low rate environment augurs well for the yellow metal  Moreover  there is still a lot of risk in the market that are expected to support prices of the metal in the coming days  Concerns about global economic growth and lingering economic and political uncertainties are likely to act in favor of gold in the near to medium term Moreover  gold prices are generally helped by retail demand in countries like India and China  with the wedding and festival seasons occurring in the second half of the year  India will be a major driver with pent up demand having intensified due to the shutdown of jewelry stores earlier this year 5 Glittering Gold Stocks to Buy NowThe current low interest rate climate makes a solid investment case for

189428,410944,NEM,Barrick Gold  ABX  Upgraded To Strong Buy  Here s Why,opinion,"On Sep 28  Zacks Investment Research upgraded Barrick Gold Corporation   NYSE ABX   to a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  
Why the Upgrade 
Barrick s second quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share  excluding one time items  of 14 cents were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Earnings surged 180  from the year ago quarter figure of 5 cents per share  Revenues plunged 9 8  year over year to  2 012 million in the reported quarter and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 036 million 
Recently  Barrick announced that it will partner with Cisco Systems  Inc    NASDAQ CSCO    for the digital reinvention of the former s business  The collaboration will bring together state of the art technology and expertise to unleash the full potential of mining along with enhancing productivity and efficiency  Harnessing the digital technology potential will help the company to grow its free cash flow per share and will also add value across its business  This will enable it to become a leading twenty first century company by increasing productivity and efficiency at its mines  along with improving decision making and performance across every area of its business  Digital technology will also enable the miner to lessen its environmental impact and be even more transparent with its local partners especially indigenous communities  local governments  and NGOs 
Barrick has a healthy liquidity position and generates healthy cash flows  It is poised to take advantage of attractive development  exploration and acquisition opportunities  The company continues to make high return investments in its businesses 
Barrick is expected to benefit from major exploration programs  The company maintains a significant focus on Nevada for growth opportunities  A considerable portion of its exploration budget for 2016 has been allocated to the Americas  with an extensive focus on Nevada  At Goldstrike  the miner has started development of new areas to access deeper reserves that are expected to come into production by end 2016 
For the Turquoise Ridge mine  the company is currently conducting an expansion of the underground mining  At Cortez  it is conducting a feasibility study for expanded underground mining in the Deep South zone and is also advancing a feasibility study for an underground mine at its Goldrush deposit 
The miner is making significant progress with its cost and efficiency improvement programs  Barrick s initiatives including overhead expenses cut  portfolio optimization and headcount reductions are anticipated to generate meaningful cost savings  Additionally  the company is implementing a simplified operating model which will increase efficiency and contribute to cost reduction 
Barrick reduced its total debt by 24  in 2015 and exceeded its original goal of  3 billion  The company has already reduced its total debt by  968 million in 2016  representing nearly half of its debt reduction target for the year  Currently  the miner has less than  150 million in debt due before 2018 and roughly  5 billion of its  9 billion outstanding debt will mature after 2032  In 2016  the company plans to reduce its total debt by at least  2 billion  Barrick estimates to save roughly  180 million in interest expenses on an annualized basis 
However  the volatile gold price environment is concerning  Last year  a stronger dollar  slump in oil prices and the climb in U S  equities led to more than 11  plunge in gold s value in 2015  Barrick had slashed its quarterly dividend by 60  in an effort to improve financial flexibility and cope with the gold price slump  While gold prices have recovered in 2016 to cross the  1 300 an ounce threshold  volatility prevails

189447,410963,NEM,Did Gold Production Peak In 2015 ,opinion,"Gold is one of the rarest elements in the world  making up roughly 0 003 parts per million of the earth s crust   For some perspective  one part per million  when converted into time  is equivalent to one minute in two years  Gold is even rarer than that   If we took all the gold ever mined all 186 000 tonnes  from the bullion at Fort Knox to India s bridal jewelry to King Tut s burial mask and melted it down to a 20 5 meter sided cube  it would fit snugly within the confines of an  
The yellow metal s rarity  of course  is one of the main reasons why it s so highly valued across the globe and  for most of recorded history  recognized and used as currency  Unlike fiat money  of which we can always print more  there s only so much recoverable gold in the world  And despite the best efforts of alchemists  we can t recreate its unique chemistry in a lab  The only way for us to acquire more is to dig 
But for how much longer 
Goldman Sachs  analyst  took a stab at answering this question last year  estimating we have only  20 years of known mineable reserves of gold  
The operative word here is  known   If King s projection turns out to be accurate  and the last  known  gold nugget is exhumed from the earth in 2035  that won t necessarily spell the end of gold mining  Exploration will surely continue as it always has though at a much higher cost 
 In fact  our insatiable pursuit of gold might one day soon take us to space  as President Barack Obama signed legislation in November that permits commercial mineral extraction on asteroids and the moon 
Many near Earth asteroids are said to contain trillions of dollars  worth of precious metals and other minerals  But that s a discussion for another time  
We ll probably see  as I told Kitco News  Daniela Cambone last week  I think that as long as they have reliable output  mid cap companies could be gobbled up by the Barricks and Newmonts of the world 
Another consequence of recovering the last known nugget  The gold price could spike dramatically to levels only imagined  My colleague Jim Rickards  in his book  puts it at  10 000 an ounce  GoldMoney founder James Turk says   There s really no way of knowing how high gold could go 
Did Gold Production Peak in 2015  What we do know is that global gold output has been contracting since 2013  Last year might have been the tipping point  however  in line with Goldcorp CEO Chuck Jeannes  prediction that peak gold was within spitting distance 
 There are just not that many new mines being found and developed   he told  in 2014  adding that this was  very positive  for the gold price going forward 
This year  second quarter mine supply was 2 percent less than the same period in 2015  according to preliminary estimates made by Thomson Reuters GFMS  Some analysts now expect global production to fall 3 percent in 2016  after seven straight years of growth 
What s more  few new projects and expansions are expected to come online this year     and those in the near term pipeline are generally fairly modest in scale  hence our view that global mine supply is set to begin a multiyear downtrend in 2016  
Indeed  if we look at projects that opened in just the last two or three years  we see that they re of lower grade  meaning they don t produce nearly as much as older  easy to mine gold deposits 
The truth of the matter is  when it comes to discovering new gold deposits  the low hanging fruit has likely already been picked  Gone are the days when someone could stumble upon an exposed hunk of gold at the bottom of a riverbed  as James Marshall did in 1848  setting off the California Gold Rush  Every year  the pursuit of gold becomes increasingly more challenging not to mention more expensive requiring ever more sophisticated tools and technology  including 3D seismic imaging  direction drilling and airborne gravimetry   A satisfactory  gold fracking  method  however  seems unlikely to become reality any time soon  
Compounding the issue is the fact that the number of years between discovery of a new major deposit and production is widening  due to the increase in feasibility assessments  compliance  licenses and more and that s all before nugget one can be extracted  The average lead time for gold mines worldwide is close to 20 years  though it can sometimes be more  depending on the jurisdiction  This highlights the need for worldwide policy reform to remove many of the barriers that obstruct responsible mining 
In   the book I co wrote with John Katz  I expressed the importance of knowing which developmental stage of a mine s lifecycle a project currently falls into  as this has a strong influence on stock performance  Investing  like life  is all about managing expectations 
Few New Mines as Companies Deleverage What all of this means is we ll probably continue to see fewer and fewer major discoveries  or those that yield more than a million ounces 
As you can see below  new gold discoveries peaked in 1995 
Exploration spending peaked nearly 20 years later when the price per ounce averaged  1 600 
With gold now trading above  1 340 an ounce  up 26 percent for the year  many investors expect producers to begin lifting spending on exploration and production  or dividends  
Instead  most companies are in cost cutting mode  using this opportunity to pay down debt and liquidate assets  According to Reuters  North American gold producers have managed to lower their debt levels 30 percent since late 2014 
Speaking to Mining com   said his company  the second largest gold producer in the world  is one of the few that s currently building new mines specifically the Merian project in Suriname and Long Canyon in Nevada  Because of the lack of new mines being built  he sees supply falling 7 percent between now and 2021 
Demand for the yellow metal  on the other hand  should remain strong during this period  helping to support prices even more 
Massive Inflows into Gold Funds 
In the meantime  gold continues to find support from global monetary policy and low to negative government bond yields  Last week the Bank of England cut rates as part of a stimulus package  which both weakened the British pound 1 5 percent and gave the yellow metal a jolt 
These gains were erased  however  following Friday s better than expected U S  jobs report  which sparked a rally in Treasuries  This contributes to the narrative that gold and government debt are inversely related  a key component of the Fear Trade 
When priced in the local currencies of the U S   Canada  South Africa or Australia four of the largest gold producing countries bullion is up  which has boosted miners  profits  Gold stocks  as measured by the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index  have appreciated 128 92 percent in the last 12 months 
For the first half of 2016  inflows into commodities have been the strongest since 2009  Gold and other precious metals account for about 60 percent of the new money  which has pushed commodity assets under management above  235 billion  Barclays  believes 2016 could be the best year on record for gold related ETFs and other funds  with many big name hedge fund managers  from Stan Druckenmiller to Paul Singer to Bill Gross  singing the praises of the yellow metal

Demand for Natural Hedge Remains

	Despite the increasing prospects of at least one Fed rate hike this year  the global environment provides enough reasons for investors to opt for gold  The Bank of Japan and the central banks in Europe are inclined toward further monetary stimulus measures  Additionally  some degree of uncertainty continues to prevail over the chances of a rate hike

	This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM score 

	We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and VGM score 

AngloGold Ashanti Ltd      is based in South Africa and involved in gold exploration and mining activities 

	AngloGold Ashanti has a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and a VGM Score of B  The company has expected earnings growth of more than 100  for the current year  The forward price to earnings ratio  P E  for the current financial year  F1  is 19 89  lower than the industry average of 30 20

Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research This Value Screen Is Our Top Performer This Year 

Value investors and traders favor good stocks at great prices  This does not mean they have to be cheap in price though 

The key is the belief that they are undervalued  That they are  for some reason  trading under what their true value or potential really is  And the value investor hopes to get in before the market  discovers  this and moves higher 

Value investing became famous from legendary investor Benjamin Graham  and more recently Warren Buffett  Obviously  they know something  And they do 

In fact  value investing has proven to be one of the most successful forms of investing over time 

Let s take a look at our  Value Method 1  screen  which is our top performing screen so far this year  and how you too can benefit from value investing 

Parameters

  Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2
	 Only Zacks Rank  1 Strong Buys and  2 Buys will get through  This immediately tilts the odds of success in our favor as they ve handily beaten the market by nearly 3 times and 2 times as much  respectively  

    Change Actual EPS  Q0 Q 1  greater than X Industry Median
	 EPS growth above the median for their expanded industry  Too many value stocks are cheap because there s no real growth to speak of  This item selects stocks with growth rates above the median for their industry  and specifically excludes those below it  

  P E Ratio Using 12 Month EPS less than X Industry Median
	 P E ratio below the median for its industry  Certain items have averages or medians that vary from industry to industry  This identifies only those trading at a discount to the median to their peers  

  Price Sales Ratio less than X Industry Median
	 This is my favorite valuation metric  The P S ratio is calculated as price divided by sales  If a stock is trading at a P S ratio of 1  that means you re paying  1 for every  1 of sales the company makes  If a stock has a P S ratio of 2  that means you re paying  2 for every  1 of sales the company makes  As you can see  the lower the number  the better  If a stock has a P S ratio of  5  that means you re paying 50 cents for every  1 of sales the company makes  Like the P E ratio  different industries have different P S ratios that are considered normal  So we ll be focusing on stocks with a P S ratio less than the median for its industry  

   Rating Change over 1 Week       Change Q1 Estimate over 4 Weeks       Change F1 Estimate over 4 Weeks    Top   7 
	 This calculated expression combines three items together because of their predictive performance  Stocks with positive broker rating changes  broker rating upgrades  outperform those with broker rating downgrades  and those with no broker rating change at all  And stocks with upward earnings estimate revisions tend to receive more upward earnings estimate revisions  which often leads to higher prices  Using the current quarter and the current year shows increased optimism for both the short term and the longer term  Only the 7 stocks with the highest scores for all three items combined get picked  

Results

Over the last 16 years  2000 thru 2015   using a one week holding period  this strategy has shown an average annual return of 49 8  vs  the S P s 3 8  

And so far in 2016  thru 8 5 16   it s up 70 0  vs  the market s 8 4  

It was designed to hold 7 stocks in its portfolio at a time  It s rebalanced weekly  And it trades on average of 4 stocks a week 

One of the potential drawbacks with some value screens is that you often have to wait awhile before the market recognizes that it has mispriced  undervalued  a certain stock and starts to move higher  Some value stocks  for whatever reason  have been ignored by the market  Hence the typically longer time horizon while you wait for the market to take notice 

But there s no better catalyst to get a stock moving than a series of upward earnings estimate revisions  Throw in a broker rating upgrade  and the timeliness of the Zacks Rank  and you have a list of stocks with virtually every reason to move up   and fast 

Stocks

There are 7 new stocks coming thru this screen this week  Here are 3 of them 

   Omega Protein
	   Newmont Mining
	   Semiconductor Manufacturing

189454,410970,NEM,Deep Value ETF  DVP  Hits New 52 Week High,opinion,"For investors seeking momentum  Deep Value ETF   HN DVP   is probably on radar now  The fund just hit a 52 week high  which is up roughly 2 2  from its 52 week low price of  24 52 share 
But are more gains in store for this ETF  Let s take a quick look at the fund and the near term outlook on it to get a better idea on where it might be headed DVP in Focus    DVP seeks to track the TWM Deep Value Index  which in turn closely follows the performance of 20 dividend paying S P 500 stocks that are also believed to be undervalued  The fund has a large cap focus with key holdings in the materials  information technology and industrials segments  DVP charges investors 80 basis points a year in fees and has top holdings in Newmont Mining  NYSE NEM   Exxon  NYSE XOM  and Weyerhaeuser  see all  here  
Why the Move 
The large cap value ETF space has been an area to watch lately as investors are looking to derive healthy gains from the rally in the U S  markets  In an environment  when major benchmarks are hitting all time record highs  investors are seeking to invest in potentially strong undervalued funds as they are poised to yield high returns in the current scenario  Moreover  stocks with favourable dividend yields are gaining attention in an environment when most of the government bonds are suffering from low or negative yields  These factors led the ETF to register significant gains in recent times       
More Gains Ahead  
Currently  DVP has a Zacks ETF Rank  3  Hold  so it is hard to get a handle on its future returns one way or another  However  the fund has   A positive weighted alpha hints at more gains

189464,410980,NEM,Gold And Silver Still The Year s Stalwarts,opinion,"North of the equator  we ve but 19 days left of summer  the year speeding past   tis already September  And  oh  what a year for the precious metals  performances which    as measured over the past four decades    are as top tier as they can appear  So now with two trimesters plus two days in the trading books for 2016  here are our year to date BEGOS Markets standings 

Moreover  another month having passed  let s look at Gold s comparatively docile year over year percentage track   18   versus those of its high level equities brethren  Goldcorp Inc  NYSE GG   20   Franco Nevada Corporation  TO FNV   75   GDX  NYSE GDX   the prominent exchange traded fund of the Gold miners   104   SIL  the popular exchange traded fund of the Silver miners   141   and NEM  Newmont Mining  NYSE NEM    150   Still lagging under managerial massaging   tis said that GG will be Go Go as their structural improvements take hold 

Note  too  that GDX s bright blue track is also representative of its year to date performance   99   and as much as  131  upon price having touched 31 79 on 12 August   a sound doubling so far this year for  the miners   We point this out per that which was just received from a highly valued reader   Most gold guys don t know or have forgotten since 2004 when the miners last really delivered on their promise of out performance of the metal     If gold hits   1500 this year  the miners could double again THIS YEAR   A bit of a mathematically optimistic stretch one might say  given the present year to date growth ratio of GDX Gold is 3 9x     but then there s the overshoot     Ka Ching 
 Course  if Gold were to settle this year at 1500   41     twould be its sixth best performance since President Nixon s 1971 Gold standard nixing  after which price in 1972 rose  43   And for those of you scoring at home  the other bettering years were 1979 s  59   1974 s  64   1973 s  67   and 1980 s  100   From our more modest purview for this year s balance  we remain curious as to Gold s course upon its regaining Base Camp 1377  our revised projected high which to date has precisely held  Hopefully   twill prove us wrong 
In the interim  the trend remains Gold s friend  as we next see by the weekly bars  the linear regression trend  dashed line  is in brilliant ascent  as continues the parabolic Long trend of the ascending blue dots  The 1306 structural supporter  green line  was essentially twice tested during first two days of September  with price repelling back up to settle out the week yesterday  Friday  at 1329 

To be sure  there were expectations had the StateSide August payrolls number   151 000  been more robust   twould have resulted in  as a dear reader wrote   goodbye gold     Fed s could raise in September   To which I responded   My  funnymental  sense is that  they  shan t raise for the foreseeable future  They re stuck  probably need to re organize  re invent themselves   Or in replying as queried during last Sunday s Investors Roundtable as to if the Fed would raise interest rates during 2017   No    I like easy questions   Add to that the Bloomy interview on Tuesday with FRB Vice Chairman Stanley Fisher  with all due respect during which the responses were mainly mental mush  and the markets moved nary a wit 
Still  the year s stalwart run for Gold and Silver remains silently buried in the financial news flow  if for no other reason than  nobody  owns such multi millennia proven assets  Rather  incessant media machinations remain of adapting practically anything and everything into how it might sway members of the Federal Open Market Committee into  raising  their central bank s overnight lending rate in just 18 days on 21 September  else so do in December   their November pre election get together not even mentioned in the conversation  heaven forbid their first nicking up the rate  the stock market then tanking  Mr  Trump then winning  and the FedFolks then hearing  You re fired     And yet MarketWatch reported this past week that the  U S  Economy Is Providing Ammo for Higher Interest Rates Ahead   What do you think 

 Jeepers  mmb  the jobs data caused that plunge  
Squire   twas more than just the aforementioned payrolls for which growth declined  It also declined in the average hours worked per week and in hourly earnings  But wait  there s more  the Chicago Purchasing Managers  Index weakened  the Institute for Supply Management s manufacturing index contracted sub 50 for the first time since February  construction spending went flat  vehicle sales declined  and Q2 productivity was revised to an even more negative number  All that  quantitative easing  and look what we ve got  46 million folks between the ages of 20 and 65 out of work  per Pulitzer Prize winning Politifact   and a stock market set to halve itself simply to find reasonable valuation to its earnings  per our  live  price earnings ratio of the S P at 37 9x   Got Gold 
And  tis not just here  this Thursday s European Central Bank meeting shall find its members grappling with further EuroZone economic deterioration  following August s failed inflation acceleration  And not since October of 2013 have there been such low readings of business confidence in the Zone  Moreover  manufacturing across Europe  save for a British up blip  and Asia remains wobbly  demand being described as  fitful at best   Clearly   tis not all happening there 
What is happening for the precious metals are some improvements in their near term technicals  And since Sister Silver is still atop the BEGOS Markets standings  she gets top billing in her below two panel view  On the left is the familiar view of Silver s daily bars for the past three months  the baby blue dots being the consistency at each day s measuring of the 21 day linear regression trend  and those  Baby Blues  are curling upward  On the right we ve Silver s daily bars from August to date  note that the dark blue dots  which are the bars  parabolics  have just flipped to Long  the newest dot  yesterday s  being encircled  this suggests Silver ought move at least up into the mid chart price bunching around the 20 area 

Similarly below for Gold  on the left are its three months of daily bars and a like up curling of the  Baby Blues   whilst on the right are the 12 hour bars since 18 August  their MACD   moving average convergence divergence   study beneath the chart just having confirmed a positive crossover  our  Market Rhythm  data there suggesting a run up to at least 1360 

As for both markets  10 day Profiles here they are with Gold s  left  and Silver s  right   nice to note that yesterday s settles are no longer near the bottom of the respective Profiles  indeed that Silver s is the wee white bar at the top of her stack 

Finally  passing from one month to another wouldn t be the same without our big picture view of Gold s layer defined structure  So here  tis  Gold by the month since its All Time High  the fifth anniversary for which is Tuesday  Gold s low since then down to 1045 this past 03 December was a decline from 1923 of 878 points or nearly  46   Today  just a human gestation period later  Gold has recovered 284 of those lost points  or  27   Still  quite the long upside row to hoe  what  And yet year to date   tis been a fabulous run  As for that little fellow down at lower right  may his impatience be eternal 


Finally  by now you ve doubtless read the United Kingdom s SMC   Social Mobility Commission   report on  Socio Economic Diversity in Life Sciences and Investment Banking    And you roll your eyes at where our StateSide taxpayer money is spent    Fairly startling results that apparently one still requires being dressed in the conservative polish of a dark pinstriped suit  white shirt  black shoes and correctly knotted tie to have any hope of gainful employment as an investment banker in The City 
Nice that the time honoured song from 1939  There ll Always Be an England continues to will out   Twas much the same here in San Francisco s busy as a bee financial district for many decades  our Wall Street West streets a buzzing hive of starched and properly pressed business garb     until  dress down Friday  came into being about a generation ago  which over recent years has morphed into  Slobby Sot Everyday   To wit  this shot of the district s Montgomery Street subway station at rush hour  Do you realize that any one of these folks just might be runnin  yer dough  Got Gold 
 But c mon  mmb  you yourself practically live in tennis sweats  eh  
Principal s prerogative  Squire   And since you don t own a single tie  I ve plenty to lend to you

Can Gold Mining ETFs Keep Shining in 2H16 

Gold has had a solid run in 2016  gaining 26  so far  In fact  gold has been the best performing asset  trumping major equity indices  investment grade and high yield bonds and commodity indices 
	The World Gold Council in its last report had stated that gold demand grew 21  to 1 289 8 tons in the first quarter of 2016  the strongest Q1 on record  ETF inflows were at 363 7 tons  the highest since Q1 2009  Increasing safe haven demand due to a weakening greenback  slowdown in China  volatile equity markets and introduction of negative interest rates by several of the world s central banks  including Japan  have turned the tables in favor of gold  Further  a delay in raising interest rates elevates demand for gold   Read   
	U K s historic vote in late June to leave the EU added fire to gold  which was already on a roll this year  Gold ETF  NYSE GLD  inflows were at  800 million on the day U K  s decision shook the markets  which led to a scurry for the safe haven metal  Gold jumped 8  to  1 358 an ounce on Jun 24  the biggest increase in a day since 2008  The yellow metal had last crossed the  1 300 threshold in 2014 
	Some analysts expect gold prices to cross  1 400 an ounce in the near future following the uncertainty regarding Brexit  Further  notwithstanding the upbeat June employment report  concerns about global economic growth  fresh signs of slowdown in the Chinese economy  manifested by recently reported weak manufacturing data  as well as economic and political uncertainties in a post Brexit world are likely to prompt the Fed to hold off raising interest rates for now  A low interest rate environment elevates demand for gold  which produces no income but relies on price appreciation to lure investors  Read   
	Gold prices should also find support from physical demand from top consumers  India and China  during the festive season later this year  A good monsoon in India will also brighten prospects of a bigger harvest  which in turn is expected to boost the purchasing power of gold among farmers and support demand ETFs to Tap the Sector

189481,410997,NEM,Will Mixed Earnings Take Shine Off Gold Mining ETFs ,opinion,"The gold mining space this year is on a tear  Higher safe haven demand for the yellow metal helped the space to hang on to strong gains so far this year  This makes it more important to look at how key companies in this field fared last quarter 
Two gold mining companies Barrick Gold Corporation    NYSE ABX    and Goldcorp Inc    NYSE GG   reported on July 27  While ABX came up with mixed results  Goldcorp dampened investors  moodby missing on both lines However  Newmont Mining Corp   NYSE NEM    which reported on July 20  was the star as it outpaced on both counts  Let s dig a little deeper  read    
Barrick Gold s Q2 Earnings in Focus
Barrick Gold s Q2 adjusted earnings per share of  0 14 matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Earnings  however  grew from the year ago quarter figure of  0 05 per share Revenues fell around 9 8  year over year to  2 012 billion in the reported quarter and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 036 billion  Average realized price of gold grew about 5 8  year over year to  1 259 per ounce in the quarter while all in sustaining costs tumbled 12 6  to  782 per ounce For 2016 the all in sustaining cost guidance was cut to  per ounce from  760  810 per ounce at the end of the first quarter  The new guidance is below the initial 2016 guidance of  775  825 per ounce 
Investors played down this positive in the outlook and put more attention to the sales miss punishing the stock price by about just 0 4  
Goldcorp s Q2 Earnings in Focus 
The company s Q2 loss per share was  0 01  adjusted for  and negative deferred tax effects offoreign exchange on tax assets and liabilities and losses  against the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 04 earnings per share  Its revenues of  753 million  down 36 6  year over year  also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  898 million 
Lower output weighed on the bottom line and was partly compensated by an uptick in the realized gold price Gold output of 613 400 ounces in Q2 was 32 4  lower year over year and below the 680 200 average of 10 estimates  as per  
Not only this  the company s average all in sustaining costs came in at  1 067 an ounce of gold in Q2 compared with the  1 001 average of four estimates compiled by Bloomberg and  853 recorded in the year ago period  The stock fell about 5 9  following downbeat earnings 
Newmont s Q2 Earnings in Focus
Another gold mining giant  Newmont Mining reported second quarter 2016 adjusted earnings of  0 44 per share  representing a 69 2  surge from  0 26 earned in the year ago quarter  Earnings also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 28 per share 
Newmont s revenues of  2 038 billion went up 6 8  from  1 908 billion in the year ago quarter as higher gold volumes and pricing more than offset lower copper volumes and pricing  Revenues also topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 863 billion 
In Q2  average net realized gold price was  1 260 per ounce  reflecting a year over year increase of 6 9   The average net realized copper price was  1 94 per pound  representing a year over year decline of 19 5  
All in sustaining costs of  876 per ounce for gold were down roughly 3 6   Newmont anticipates attributable gold production to increase from a range of 4 7 5 0 million ounces in 2016 to 4 9 5 4 million ounces in 2017  and remain stable thereafter in the range of 4 5 5 million ounces through 2020 
ETF Impact The aforementioned companies have considerable exposure in large cap funds like Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF  NYSE GDX    V GDX    iShares MSCI Global Gold Miners     PowerShares Global Gold   Precious Metals    and Sprott Gold Miners Exchange Traded Fund   see  here   In PSAU  NEM  7 98    ABX  7 79   and GG  6 83   take the top three positions  More than 36  of RING goes to ABX  14 74    while NEM and GG take 13 07  and 8 85   respectively 
In GDX also  ABX  NEM and GG take the top three spots with a respective share of 10 37   9 47  and 6 17   SGDM puts about 11 87  and 4 11  in GG and ABX  respectively Bottom Line
With mixed to downbeat earnings  now it remains to be seen if the gold mining companies and the related ETFs can continue to tack on solid gains  The Fed was dovish in its July meet too but kept the doors open for a September hike given that the economy has started taking root  Then again  a lower inflationary outlook and a still fragile global macroeconomic backdrop make a September hike dicey  read    
Overall  though some glitches have started to appear lately in the gold mining space  the growth story is not finished yet in our opinion  Gold mining as a sector is quite strong now with the Zacks Industry Rank in top 3  at the time of writing  Investors can easily mitigate the weakness in GG by the strength in other mining stocks like NEM and ABX by investing in the afore mentioned mining ETFs

189483,410999,NEM,Silver And Gold Leading The Fold,opinion,"We ve again had our annual July reminder of just how swiftly time passes  gold s trading volume having moved from the August contract into that for December  And for those of you lucky enough to be scoring at home  did you note the amount of contract premium built into December over August  Eight points      August gold settling Friday at 1350  but December s at 1358 
Short of enlisting a gaggle of summer interns to comb back through decades of contract data  said leap in premium is the largest in this writer s memory  typically  the difference in pricing from one  front month  contract to the next is a few points  in either direction  for example a year ago  the premium of December over August was less than four points 
But the willingness to pay  8 oz  more for gold due five months from now    or conversely when you can lock in a price for  8 oz  less today    seems a bullishly biased indication of traders and gold hedgers  expectations 
So  we may already be tradin  December gold  but having only made it though July  here are our seven months year to date standings of the BEGOS Markets  with silver and gold leading the fold 

And on the heels of the Bank of Japan Friday announcing an increase to its stimulus policy  but at an  unexpectedly  understated pace  the dollar was sufficiently clobbered on Friday for its 3rd worst daily loss of the year  such as to send the yen and every component of the eight BEGOS Markets into a robust  upside finale in closing out the week 
Add in the fact that the Q2 StateSide annualized Gross Domestic Product growth was the dud we thought  twould be   despite any  aid  from it being an election year   and  twas nothing but GO  for gold as we below see per the weekly bars   again the wee green arrow suggesting trading support at 1306  

Specific to the lackluster 1 2  growth rate from Q2 GDP  if you ve been following the Economic Barometer   twas fairly obvious that the expectation for a 2 6  pace was rather a pipe dream  In fact  we ve placed a linear regression trend line across the Econ Baro as next shown  A bit of a declination  don t you know 

Yet Friday  San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President John Williams said the U S  economy  is doing well  such that he s not concerned about a recession  To quote Alice   Curiouser and curiouser   for if we contextually take the declining trendline for the above Baro in tandem with the economic assessment of our own Fed Head  we delicately point out that this past Tuesday  the SAMHSA  Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration  reported that over 15 percent of San Franciscans used cannabis in the last month   purportedly per the Washington Post   the highest rate in the country    A pipe dream indeed  Go ask Alice 
Moreover  is it not interesting that toward figuring out the Fed  we hear  tis all about when they shall  hike   rather than when they shall  move   Yes  there is a difference  And yesterday s celebration across all eight BEGOS components    a quite rare occurrence    seems stimulus suggestive to us 
Here below for the entire bunch are their last 21 trading days  one month   the rightmost bar in each panel being yesterday s up for all session  along with the diagonal linear regression trendlines and  Baby Blues  as day by day readings of trend consistency   The  Spoo  is the unable to correct S P 500 futures market  

And speaking of the S P  according to its just issued Foreign Sales Report  the percentage of products and services produced or sold by S P 500 companies outside the U S  during 2015  44 3   was the lowest since 2006  43 6

Barring one time items  net loss was a penny per share for the reported quarter  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of earnings of 4 cents Goldcorp  which is among the top gold producers  along with Barrick Gold   NYSE ABX    Newmont   NYSE NEM   and Kinross Gold   NYSE KGC    posted revenues of  753 million in the reported quarter  down roughly 37  year over year  Revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  898 million

Gold sales plunged around 31 8  year over year to 616 100 ounces in the reported quarter  and production tumbled 32 5  to 613 000 ounces  All in sustaining costs were  1 067 per gold ounce  up 25 1  year over year  due to lower sales volumes at Penasquito  Cerro Negro and Red Lake  while cash cost totaled  728 per ounce on a by product basis  up 33 1  year over year  and  716 per ounce  up 9 1   on a co product basis 
Silver production fell roughly 49  year over year to 5 3 million ounces from 10 4 million ounces in the prior year quarter 
Shares of the company fell around 5 9  to close at  17 73 on Jul 28 
Mining Highlights    
At the Penasquito mine  gold production was 36 000 ounces  a year over year decrease of around 87 9   Production declined due to lower ore grade and recovery from the upper transitional ore and low grade stockpiles  Production was also down due to a 10 day shutdown for plant maintenance and a longer than expected period to ramp up the plant to full production owing to a number of restart issues  All in sustaining cost was  3 094 per ounce compared with  416 per ounce in the year ago quarter 
Cerro Negro in Argentina produced 86 000 ounces of gold in the second quarter  at an all in sustaining cost of  808 per ounce  Production fell compared with the year ago quarter as a result of lower mill tonnage processed due to the exhaustion of surface stockpiles 
At Pueblo Viejo  where Goldcorp holds 40  interest and Barrick Gold holds 60  interest  gold production jumped nearly 14 9  year over year to 100 000 ounces  40  basis   at an all in sustaining cost of  587 per ounce  The increase in gold production was backed by higher grades 
Financial Position
As of Jun 30  2016  cash and cash equivalents were  328 million  down from  940 million as of Jun 30  2015  Long term debt was  2 603 million as of Jun 30  2016  compared with  3 361 million as of Jun 30  2015  The company s adjusted operating cash flow fell to  307 million as of Jun 30  2016  from  523 million as of Jun 30  2015  mainly due to lower production  partly offset by higher realized gold price 
Developments
During the reported quarter  Goldcorp advanced its project pipeline with the completion of the Hoyle Deep project at Porcupine  Further  the company secured board approval to proceed with the Pyrite Leach Project at Penasquito  PLP   with an expected capital investment of roughly  420 million  and the Materials Handling Project at Musselwhite  with an expected capital investment of about  90 million   each of which are expected to increase gold production starting in 2019   
The company concluded the acquisition of Kaminak  and its Coffee project in the Yukon  Canada after quarter end which is projected to provide a medium term opportunity for low cost  high return gold production along with a solid pipeline of expansion opportunities at existing mines 
Outlook
For 2016  Goldcorp reiterated its gold production guidance range of between 2 8 and 3 1 million ounces at AISC between  850 and  925 per ounce 
Third  and fourth quarter production is expected to enhance over the second quarter as Penasquito returns to normal operations after its maintenance shutdown  Grades are likely to increase at a number of mine sites   AISC are expected to decrease as a result of higher production 
With the approval to proceed to construction of the PLP and the Materials Handling Project  and the addition of the Coffee Project  growth capital for 2016 has been forecast to increase by about  90  100 million to roughly  190  200 million GOLDCORP INC Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise  ",2016-08-01,Zacks Investment Research,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/goldcorp-(gg)-records-loss-in-q2,-misses-estimates-200145539",200145539

189505,411021,NEM,UBS Analyst  New Gold Bull Just Getting Started,opinion,"It s been a stellar six months for gold investors  The yellow metal has surged 28 percent year to date  its best first half of the year since 1974  And now there are signs that the rally is just getting started 
That s the assessment of analysts from UBS and Credit Suisse   who see gold entering a new bull run  According to UBS analyst Joni Teves  gold could climb to  1 400 an ounce in the short term on macroeconomic uncertainty  dovish monetary policy and lower yields   These factors   Teves writes   justify strategic gold allocations across different types of investors  and should encourage hesitant investors to participate 
Already low bond yields around the globe have fallen even further in Brexit s wake  many of them hitting fresh all time lows  including yields in the U S   U K   Germany  France  Australia  Japan and elsewhere  For the first time ever  Switzerland s entire stock of bond yields has fallen below zero  with the 50 year yield plunging to negative 0 03 percent on July 5 
Canada s 30 year bond yield also plunged to a record low  as did yields on the 10 year and 30 year Treasuries 
About  10 trillion worth of global government debt now carries historically low or negative yields  which is  in the world economy  according to billionaire  bond king  Bill Gross in his recent Investment Outlook 
Anemic yields are also contributing to gold s attractiveness right now  Since Britain s June 23 referendum  the precious metal has rallied more than 8 percent  helping it achieve its best first half of the year in more than a generation 
Negative Real Rates Fuel Prices
 Joining UBS in forecasting further gains is Credit Suisse  which sees gold reaching  1 500 by as early as the start of next year  As  Credit Suisse analyst Michael Slifirski writes 

 The surprise Brexit vote has solidified and intensified macro and political uncertainty and extended the time frame for a negative real rate environment in the U S  and potentially abroad  

This is precisely what I told BNN s Paul Bagnell this week  using Canada as an example  The Canadian 10 year yield is sitting just below 1 percent  while inflation in May came in at 1 5 percent  When we subtract the latter from the former  we get a real rate of negative 0 5 percent meaning inflation is eating your lunch  Like negative bond yields  negative real rates have in the past accelerated momentum in gold s Fear Trade 
We need only look at the end of the last upcycle in gold to see this to be the case  When gold hit its all time high of  1 900 in August 2011  real interest rates were around 3 percent  A 5 year Treasury bond yielded only 0 9 percent  and that s before inflation took 3 8 percent  But as real rates rose  gold prices fell  Now the reverse is happening 

Gold Miners Rally
The appreciation in bullion is helping to push up gold mining stocks  The FTSE Gold Mining Index which tracks seniors such as Barrick Gold  NYSE ABX   Newmont Mining  NYSE NEM  and Goldcorp  NYSE GG  is up a phenomenal 125 percent year to date 
With gold having possibly entered the early stages of a new bull run  it might be time to consider gold stocks

Our proven model does not conclusively show that Newmont is likely to beat estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  1  2 or 3 for this to happen  This is not the case here  as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP for Newmont is 0 00   This is because the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate both stand at 28 cents 
Zacks Rank  Newmont has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  the company s ESP of 0 00  makes surprise prediction difficult 
We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Stocks that Warrant a Look

189508,411024,NEM,Can Gold Mining ETFs Keep Shining In 2H ,opinion,"Gold has had a solid run in 2016  gaining 26  so far  In fact  gold has been the best performing asset  trumping major equity indices  investment grade and high yield bonds and commodity indices 

	The World Gold Council in its last report had stated that gold demand grew 21  to 1 289 8 tons in the first quarter of 2016  the strongest Q1 on record  ETF inflows were at 363 7 tons  the highest since Q1 2009  Increasing safe haven demand due to a weakening greenback  slowdown in China  volatile equity markets and introduction of negative interest rates by several of the world s central banks  including Japan  have turned the tables in favor of gold  Further  a delay in raising interest rates elevates demand for gold   Read   

	U K s historic vote in late June to leave the EU added fire to gold  which was already on a roll this year  Gold ETF  NYSE GLD  inflows were at  800 million on the day U K  s decision shook the markets  which led to a scurry for the safe haven metal  Gold jumped 8  to  1 358 an ounce on Jun 24  the biggest increase in a day since 2008  The yellow metal had last crossed the  1 300 threshold in 2014 

	Some analysts expect gold prices to cross  1 400 an ounce in the near future following the uncertainty regarding Brexit  Further  notwithstanding the upbeat June employment report  concerns about global economic growth  fresh signs of slowdown in the Chinese economy  manifested by recently reported weak manufacturing data  as well as economic and political uncertainties in a post Brexit world are likely to prompt the Fed to hold off raising interest rates for now  A low interest rate environment elevates demand for gold  which produces no income but relies on price appreciation to lure investors  Read   

	Gold prices should also find support from physical demand from top consumers  India and China  during the festive season later this year  A good monsoon in India will also brighten prospects of a bigger harvest  which in turn is expected to boost the purchasing power of gold among farmers and support demand

Chicago  IL   June 20  2016   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses Gold  Part 2  including  Tahoe Resources Inc      Goldcorp Inc      Newmont Mining Corporation  NYSE NEM      OceanaGold Corporation     IAMGOLD Corp       and Barrick Gold Corporation    

Industry  Gold  Part 2

Link  

Declining output from existing mines  geopolitical tensions  a stock market rout  China worries and a possible delay in further rate hikes will work in favor of gold after years of languishing prices  There are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the gold mining industry for both the short and the long term  Below  we have discussed what investors in the gold mining sector can look forward to in the coming months and years 

India  China to Be Long Term Growth Drivers

Over the last decade  combined demand for gold from India and China has grown 71   Last year  these two markets accounted for 54  of consumer gold demand  up from 33  in 2005  India has a strong tradition of investing in gold  mainly in jewelry  Demand mostly increases around the wedding and festive seasons  which begin from mid to late August and continue until January  Expenditure on gold can account for almost 30  of the total wedding cost  This gives a boost to local currency demand and raises gold prices 

In China  people view gold  whether in the form of bars  coins or jewelry  as a natural vehicle for savings and diversification  Gold is embedded in China s culture and the Chinese New Year and weddings are key events for the country s gold consumption  In China  although demand might drop from the highs of 2013  growth remains intact  A continuous shift toward higher margin products has lately been observed in the Chinese jewelry market  Gem set and 18 carat gold items are becoming increasingly popular  with the latter largely gaining popularity among the younger generation 

The World Gold Council expects demand from China to grow at least another 20  by 2017  While China s middle class is expanding  India has a comparatively low level of per capita gold holdings  The powerful combination of increasing urbanization and strong cultural affinity for gold bodes well for the metal s demand in both these countries 

China s central bank also continues to purchase the precious metal on a monthly basis  as it sees value in diversifying in gold  People s Bank of China  PBOC  now holds a total of 57 18 million ounces of gold  Currently  China s gold reserves are ranked fifth in the world  behind the U S   Germany  Italy and France 

Growing U S  Trend

In the first quarter of 2016  demand for gold jewelry in the U S  went up 2  year on year   the ninth consecutive quarter of such an increase  The industry continues to benefit from retailers re entering the gold segment  Rising household wealth is also providing support  Some promising trends  like a continued shift from 10 carat toward 14 carat jewelry  and responsiveness among consumers to targeted marketing campaigns  continue to emerge  Growth in consumer confidence and lower oil prices are likely to lead to further improvements in this market over the coming quarters 

Revival in Acquisitions

Vancouver based Tahoe Resources Inc  s    acquisition of Lake Shore Gold Corp  will address challenges faced by both companies  The transaction added Timmins West and Bell Creek mines in Timmins  Ontario  to Tahoe s holdings  which include mines in Guatemala and Peru  The enlarged company is expected to produce 370 000 430 000 ounces of gold in 2016 at total cash costs of  675  725 per ounce and all in costs of  950  1 000 per ounce  Last year  Tahoe had bought a smaller rival Rio Alto Mining to expand its presence in Latin America 

Goldcorp Inc     has inked a deal to acquire Kaminak Gold Corporation  The total consideration offered for all of Kaminak s outstanding shares is roughly C 520 million  The acquisition is in sync with Goldcorp s strategy of aligning with smaller exploration companies to identify and develop mining districts with large exploration potential that can grow its net asset value per share 

The Coffee Gold project is located within a politically stable jurisdiction and gives Goldcorp an opportunity to add high quality ounces to its development pipeline  at low all in sustaining costs  The project will create lasting positive benefits for local First Nations and communities of Goldcorp 

Gold Miners Optimizing Portfolio

The drop in gold prices in recent years had put the gold mining companies  bottom lines under pressure  The companies were actively pursuing opportunities to optimize their portfolio  including the divestiture of certain non core or non productive assets and reduction of debt  maximization of return on capital and driving value across the portfolio 

Newmont Mining Corporation    sold Newmont Waihi Gold Limited in New Zealand to OceanaGold Corporation   Over the last two years  Newmont has generated  1 7 billion through non core asset sales  allowing the company to reduce its debt  invest in profitable production and return capital to its shareholders 

IAMGOLD Corp     completed the sale of its Niobec mine to a group of companies led by Magris Resources Inc  for cash proceeds of  500 million  This sale will increase IAMGOLD s liquidity position  thereby strengthening its financial position over many of its competitors  Goldcorp had sold its 26  stake in Tahoe Resources for just under  1 billion in order to focus on cash flow generation 

Barrick Gold Corporation    is also shedding non core assets to optimize its portfolio and strengthen its balance sheet  The company  in late 2015  completed the sale of a 50  interest in the Zaldivar copper mine in Chile to Antofagasta  LON ANTO  Plc  and also closed the divestment of its 70  interest in the Spring Valley project and its 100  interest in the Ruby Hill mine to subsidiaries of Waterton Precious Metals Fund II Cayman  LP 

Gold s Safe Haven Appeal

Gold has always been viewed as a store of value and a safe haven asset  The buying of gold is a hedge against inflation  macroeconomic  geopolitical  systemic and monetary risk  This trend intensifies during periods of economic turmoil and geopolitical tensions  And there is no dearth of these factors in the current economic scenario right now 

Superiority Over Other Precious Metals

Gold s worldwide acceptance as a store of value sets it apart from other precious metals such as platinum  palladium and silver whose demand stems mainly from their industrial applications  Gold is produced primarily for accumulation while the other commodities are produced for consumption 

Moreover  in contrast to other commodities  gold does not perish  tarnish or corrode  nor does it have quality grades  There has not been any material change in gold s quality over the years  gold mined thousands of years ago is the same as today  Gold existing aboveground is easily interchanged with newly mined gold  This ensures the continuous demand of the metal for years to come 

Bottom Line

Gold is having jolly good ride this year on mounting global economic fears  This accelerated flight to safety makes investment in gold a prudent option at the moment

189532,411048,NEM,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  Barrick Gold  Goldcorp  Newmont Mining  AngloGold Ashanti And Agnico Eagle Mines,opinion,"For Immediate Release

Chicago  IL   June 20  2016   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses Gold  Part 3  including  Barrick Gold Corporation     Goldcorp  Inc      Newmont Mining Corporation  NYSE NEM      AngloGold Ashanti Ltd      and Agnico Eagle Mines Limited    

Industry  Gold  Part 3

Link  

Demand for gold will remain strong in the years to come given the demand for jewelry  bars and coins as well as its safe haven appeal  Yet  the gold mining industry has a number of lurking headwinds  Below  we have discussed some of the key challenges and what investors in the sector can look forward to in the coming months and years 

Production to Flatten on Lack of New Projects

Mine production in 2015 saw its first quarterly decline and its slowest annual growth rate since 2008  While output is slowing down from older mines  particularly in South Africa and the U S   the incremental impact on production from new mines coming on stream is gradually on the ebb  Previously  incremental production from newer mines led to continued growth in overall gold production  However  newer mines are now at or near their full potential  leading to a slowing down in the growth rates  This has made further production gains increasingly difficult 

After a period of implementing cuts to spending on capital and administration  much of the recent cost reduction has come from lower oil prices and favourable exchange rate moves  Reduced spending on exploration and development has already taken its toll on the production pipeline and will further squeeze production over the coming quarters 

Some gold companies  including Barrick Gold Corporation     Goldcorp  Inc     and Newmont Mining Corporation     are currently high grading at certain mines  The high grade portion of a mine is mined first as this increases the grade of the mined ore and lowers cost per unit  However  it has its pitfalls as it depletes reserves very quickly  thus affecting long term supply 

Gold miners  grappling with low gold prices and cost pressure  have not been in a position to invest in new projects in recent years  Companies including AngloGold Ashanti Ltd    and Agnico Eagle Mines Limited     have slashed capital and exploration spending  Given the lack of new projects  mine production will eventually reach a plateau in the next couple of years 

Restricted Margins

The price decline in past years added to the woes of an industry that was already fighting rising costs  labor issues  strikes  delays and or the cancellation of projects  As costs are difficult to curtain beyond a point  miners will only profit if gold prices rise in response to demand and other macroeconomic factors  Production cutbacks and mine closures would spell more financial pain for producers and investors  who have watched gold mining stocks slump  In case market fears are allayed and gold prices fall again  the industry would see a rise in the number of producers reducing output or even shutting down operations 

A Struggling China

China s stock market has been shaken by the slowdown in the country s economy  China s economy grew at an annual rate of 6 7  in the first quarter  the slowest quarterly growth in in seven years  The International Monetary Fund  IMF  projects 6 5  growth in China in 2016  The international organization cut its 2016 world growth outlook to 3 2  from its earlier estimate of 3 4  as China s slowdown and weak commodity prices are taking a deeper toll on emerging markets than expected 

Gold Substitutes in Technology

Demand for gold in technological applications is affected by sluggish economic conditions in key markets and substitutes found for the metal  Despite inferior durability  copper and palladium coated copper have made vast inroads into the share of gold in the bonding wire sector  The decade long decline in the dental sector shows no sign of abatement as gold continues to lose ground to ceramic alternatives  which have improved steadily in quality  strength and durability 

Low Recycling Levels

Recycling fell for the sixth consecutive year in 2015  Supply from this source was down almost 40  from the peak attained in 2009  Recycling activity will remain low and might deteriorate further given that a large portion of near market supply has been flushed out in recent years  Less distress selling may further suppress recycling volumes  Many collectors are struggling to source feed stock 

U S  Dollar vs Gold Prices

There is an inverse relationship between the trade weighted U S  dollar and the price of gold  If the dollar gains strength against major currencies on the back of positive macroeconomic data  like an improving job market and growing industrial activity  it will again put gold prices under pressure 

Inherent Risks

Gold exploration and mining are time consuming and expensive tasks  Given its scarcity and remote location of deposits  exploration for new gold deposits is difficult  Once an economically viable deposit is identified  bringing a mine on line can take a decade or more  and it requires substantial capital investment 

Moreover  the mining industry is subject to several risks such as political conflicts  environmental hazards  industrial accidents  unexpected geological conditions  labor force disruptions  unavailability of materials and equipment  weather conditions  pit wall failures  rock bursts  cave ins  flooding  seismic activity and water conditions  However  once a mine is successfully developed  its returns can be enormously high  This will more than offset the risks inherent in development and the capital invested for the project 

Bottom Line

Dwindling production  lack of new projects and decline in recycling activity and the constant threat of a stronger greenback are some of the sector s worst detractors  But what about investing in the space right now  are there opportunities for short term investors overriding the headwinds

189533,411049,NEM,6 Sector ETFs Threatened By Brexit Uncertainty,opinion,"With two days remaining to the Brexit decision  the entire world is busy in analyzing the outcome and its impact on the global financial market  While a  remain  verdict of Britons will cause no upheaval in the market  a  leave  outcome may lead the global market into a tailspin 
Though polls at the start of this week showed weaker chances of Britain exiting the European Union  EU   the margin of lead for  Remain  is pretty thin by only about  point  The direction of polls may change any time  thus continuing to unnerve investors  read    
In fact  several U S  companies will bear the brunt of a Brexit  if at all it happens     the U S  makes up 68 8  of the S P 500 revenues  followed by China responsible for 4 9   and then the U K  with 2 9  weight 
Though the U K  exposure is not great in the U S   there are a few stocks and ETFs that will come under pressure if Britain parts from the European Union  Investors should note that U S  companies doing considerable business with Britain will be hurt by the falling pound which will cut U S  earnings on repatriating the income 
Plus  a likely lower demand from the U K  may weigh on foreign companies  earnings  Also  a lot of global ETFs having substantial exposure in the U K  will be marred if the  leave  camp gains momentum by any chance  Let s find out those high tension sector ETFs 
Finance
U S  banks  operations are highly dependent on Britain as the latter provides easy access to the European Union  As soon as Britain cuts the cord with the EU  its importance as a corporate transit to the rest of the Europe would be lost  going by an article in   Many global institutions may even want to shift their base from London to the German capital Frankfurt   another hot spot in the European Union 
As per   earnings of large U S  banks could be down by as much as 5 6  this year and as much as 9  next year if Britain exits the EU  Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS   Goldman and J P  Morgan would be at the highest risk while Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC  would be relatively better off 
The big U S  banks will experience a rise in expenses and feeble capital market if the  Leave  camp wins  In any case  banking earnings have come under pressure owing to global growth issues  read     
All these have put iShares U S  Financial Services ETF   PowerShares KBW Bank     Financial Select Sector SPDR   U S  Broker Dealers Index Fund   WA IAI   and iShares MSCI Europe Financials ETF  in danger 
Energy 
Several energy ETFs are made up of stocks that are either headquartered in the U K  or share strong business relation with Britain  Such companies are Apache  NYSE APA  which operates pipelines and facilities in the UK and BP  LON BP  Plc which is based in the U K  While Apache finds place energy ETFs like VanEck Vectors Unconventional Oil   Gas ETF  and First Trust ISE Revere Natural Gas Index Fund   AX FCG   with 5 6  weight  BP Plc puts SPDR S P International Energy Sector ETF  in focus  The U K  accounts for over 30  of the fund  read    
Not only this  energy MLP ETF VanEck Vectors High Income MLP ETF also has substantial weight in the fund 
Auto
Big auto companies will also feel the pinch as their business thrives on demand in the U K  For example  Ford Motor  NYSE F  had about 14 3  market share in Britain in 2015  almost similar to its U S  exposure  14 7    This is the reason why auto ETFFirst Trust NASDAQ Global Auto Index Fund  may be hit hard if a Brexit happens CARZ invests about 8 2  in Ford Motor  read    
Technology 
According to Bloomberg and J P  Morgan  eBay generates a huge amount of revenues from Britain  In 2015  the company grabbed about 16 3  sales from U K  This piece of information puts PowerShares NASDAQ Internet Portfolio ETF  and First Trust Dow Jones Internet Index Fund   If this was not enough  as per   the U K  is responsible for about 4  of U S  IT revenue 
Consumer Staples 
As per Factset  the overall consumer staples sector has a meager exposure of 2 6   but investors should note that Wall Mart has over 600 properties in United Kingdom  Only the U S   Mexico and Central America were ahead of the United Kingdom  This solid exposure puts ETFs heavy on Wall Mart at risk  These ETFs are iShares Edge MSCI Multifactor Consumer Staples ETF  andConsumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund

In this section  we would like to highlight that Newmont Mining  NYSE NEM  Corpis heavily reliant on U K   generating over 60  of its revenues from that country  This invariably brings Newmont rich ETFs like iShares MSCI Global Gold Miners ETF  NYSE GDX   and PowerShares Global Gold and Precious Metals Portfolio ETF  in focus ",2016-06-20,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/6-sector-etfs-threatened-by-brexit-uncertainty-200137341,200137341

189535,411051,NEM,5 Things Every Investor Needs To Know About Gold Mining,opinion,"Following the so called  Brexit   global markets slipped into mayhem and investors flocked to the safest harbors they could find  This rush caused gold to skyrocket 8  to  1 358 an ounce  the biggest one day jump since 2008 
The transition from the risky world of stocks to the often safer world of precious metals like gold can be confusing for investors who are less familiar with the commodity  Simply put  the business of discovering  producing  and selling gold is complicated and takes time to understand 
Of course  one of the most important aspects of gold trading is the actual mining of the product  Gold mining takes many forms  and mining companies can come in all shapes and sizes  For investors looking to get into gold  it s essential to understand the mining industry and how it affects the price and availability of the yellow metal 
For investors looking towards gold after the Brexit  or for those just looking to become a bit more familiar with the mining industry  we ve highlighted five of things every investor needs to know about gold mining below 
1        Know Your Type
There are two main types of gold mining  Placer mining is the discovery of gold as it accumulates through gravity during the sedimentary process  Typically water is involved  and placer mining includes techniques like panning and dredging  This is typically not a large commercial practice and only makes up a small piece of the gold mining industry 
Most of the world s gold supply comes from hard rock mining  Instead of looking for gold in loose rocks or sand  hard rock miners literally chisel or detonate actual rocks to remove the gold  A lot of hard rock mines are underground and consist of elaborate tunnels and vents  but aboveground mines  called open pit mines  are also a source  Gold can also be produced as a by product from hard rock mines that are focused on other minerals 
 
2        Exploration
Gold mining companies are typically separated into three categories  The first is called an exploration company  As the name implies  these companies search for and discover new gold deposits  They typically don t have many assets and own only what it takes to drill for and find gold 
In 2015  the gap between the global demand for gold and the supply of the resource from mines was 1047 tons  up from 663 tons just a decade earlier  As the world s existing mines shrink and demand climbs  the need for exploration companies grows  This group of companies is tracked by the Global X Gold Explorers ETF  
 
3        Development
After the discovery of gold  the next step in the process is for a development company to come in and set up a mine  Sometimes exploration companies attempt to turn into development firms  but development companies often just buy the proven deposits from discoverers  The key here is that development companies will only set up shop on land that is known to have gold 
 
4        Production
The final category of companies are production companies  These are the big boys of the industry and include giants like Barrick Gold   NYSE ABX    Goldcorp   NYSE GG    Newmont Mining   NYSE NEM    Polyus Gold   OTC OPYGY    and Newcrest Mining   OTC NCMGY    among others 
These massive companies basically do it all and will extract  produce  and sell gold  Again  mining companies come in all sizes  but some of the most frequently traded are going to be these blue chip stocks 
 
5        Gold Survey
Similar in manner to a farmer s almanac  the GFMS Gold Survey is followed closely by gold investors  This manual includes the latest information on mine production  scrap recovery  price outlook  bullion trade  fabrication demand  and official sector demand  another way of saying how much banks and financial institutions are buying  
 
Other Things To Note
As mentioned above  banks and other financial institutions will buy up gold  and it s important to note that gold is considered an international currency  In other words  a bar of gold should be worth the same price in the United States and Hungary  for example 
It s also important to note what gold is used for  The majority of gold that is actually produced into something goes towards jewelry  Tooth fillings  computer parts  and other miscellaneous memorabilia also make up a large chunk of the industry 
Finally  investors interested in gold should go into the market with a clear plan  Some highly ranked gold mining stocks right now include B2Gold Corp    NYSE BTG   and Pretium Resources   TO PVG    which both have a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can also check out our guide on  ",2016-06-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/5-things-every-investor-needs-to-know-about-gold-mining-200138821,200138821
189536,411052,NEM,Mid Year Outlook For Gold ,opinion,"I think we are beginning or nearing a new bull market in gold  I made my first buy of physical gold this month in the mid  1000 area  If gold continues to fall I plan to average down  and if it rises I will average up  And I am ending 2015 with the largest percentage holdings of precious metal stocks of the year  I think it s time to begin accumulating gold and silver once again both as an insurance policy and as an investment 
I further wrote that I thought we would see a resolution of which scenario wins out in the first quarter    a move toward a deflationary recession  or one toward an inflationary recovery  The resolution did occur    to the upside  We reversed from moving toward deflation and recession toward slightly higher growth and inflation 
I tripled my position in gold and silver stocks early in the year and leveraged it to 75  of net worth  I sold most of that position in the spring for a huge profit  My holdings have since varied between 45  and 25  in gold and silver stocks with a 10  position in the physical metals 
So what now  There s a time to trade and there s a time to buy and hold  I ve gone from active trading in the first part of the year  to essentially a buy and hold investor since  However  I ve found that trading opportunities present themselves at least a couple of times a year  This year was no exception  I doubled my position after the unemployment report came out on June 3rd showing a 100k shortfall in employment from what was expected  As fears of higher interest rates waned and gold shot up  I added to my holdings  And as Brexit took over as the main catalyst  I added more 
    I made the case that the correction to  1200 gold was the low and bought what I believed was the beginning of a second leg up  And even though many feared a recession at the time  I made the case that it was stagflation that we were more likely entering  Let me say that I am not a roaring bull on gold  I see it trending moderately higher but with good trading opportunities  Gold  silver  and precious metal ETFs are the perfect vehicle to play volatility 
With the Brexit vote behind us  we are set up for uncertain times as markets adjust to the new unknowns  The fears of recession are back as estimates of world growth rates continue to be cut  I doubt that recession is in the cards yet  Stagflation is more likely and is in fact with us as anemic growth and slightly higher inflation rates are creating anxiety and caution of both producers and consumers all over the world  And central bankers will likely act aggressively to add liquidity to markets in the attempt to stimulate their economies  As usual they will fail and only retard the onslaught of recession and deflation at best 
So  looking into the rest of the year I think the odds are that we will see slow growth  but more growth than last year  The important thing is the direction  Last year  particularly the second half  the direction was down  This year it s up  But there is a big difference between last year and this    it s the degree of uncertainty  Uncertainty about Britain s exit  Uncertainty about the future of the euro and the eurozone  Uncertainty about the elections here and abroad  Uncertainty about currency values  interest rates  central bank policy  international trade  and the world economy 
The collective weight of all this uncertainty will lead to more market volatility  Gold benefits from uncertainty  It s an insurance policy against the things that can go wrong  For that reason I expect gold to move higher  But given the nature of the uncertain world we live in I have placed defensive stops to protect the profits I have made in precious metal stocks 
The main beneficiaries will be the mining companies that have positioned themselves to take advantage of higher precious metal prices through the reduction of costs and new projects ready for expansion  Compared with most other companies that are in a earnings recession  profits should be substantially higher and more secure  That s why Newmont Mining  NYSE NEM  is at the top of the list of the S P 500 this year 
I ve taken profits into this second leg of this bull market and am now invested to the tune of 30  of my net worth in mining stocks that I want to hold longer term  I have cash on the sidelines looking for the next trading opportunity  Cash on the sidelines is essential to take advantage of breaking news  And in times like this  breaking news is an ever more common event ",2016-07-01,Paul Nathan,https://www.investing.com/analysis/mid-year-outlook-for-gold-200139431,200139431

189538,411054,NEM,Gold s Target Is Moved Higher  Silver Is A Screaming Flier,opinion,"The more wobbly becomes the world  the more warranted becomes the ownership of Precious Metals  Dare we say   Stop the World   I Want to Get Off     Bricusse Newley   61      whilst taking along both gold and silver  Indeed Sister Silver  come flee with me  For in 2016  now halfway  plus a day   tis silver that is running away  as we see per this year s BEGOS Market Standings through Friday  yesterday  

Oh how  per the above year to date standings  is that white metal rockin   And if hopefully you ve been stackin  some  as sang Keith Richards in  You Got The Silver     Stones   69   it ll buy some time  and in due time  a lot more than the folded fibrous paper in your pocket  or ostensibly  what you think your bank  owes you  should you wish to withdrawal that which you ve deposited   as long as you don t ask for your rightful share at the same time everyone else does   Or  as we re wont to say   If everyone sold all their stock today  everyone would receive ixnay  
And speaking of stock  if that s all you ve got  you might query   Did Brexit actually just go for naught   For stocks have come all the way back  thanks a lot  Crazy  eh  Or perhaps not  pending central banks  printing to maintain the upshot  Indeed  saved again is the Great American Savings Account  as described below by the red line  S P 500  vs  the blue line  Economic Barometer   from one year ago to date 

To view the stock market s stunning recovery  yes one might opine that Brexit s vote never happened   cept that the Precious Metals did not revert back lower from whence they came pre Brexit   recall gold having drifted down to 1253 and silver to down to 17 11 as Nigel Farage prematurely threw in the towel   But Mama  look at  em now  gold having settled out the week at 1345   its highest close since 18 March 2014   and Screamin  Sister Silver at 19 85   her best settle since 14 August 2014   Here are the weekly bars for the yellow metal  the parabolic Long trend  rightmost blue dots  just three weeks young  note as well that the purple bounded 1280 1240 zone is now labeled as  support  

And without further ado  yes  our four technical criteria finally have been met to declare for gold that 
 We now know that the bottom is in   The bottom to which we refer is last 03 December s low trade at 1046  And if we re correct  on a wing and a prayer and savvy entities moving into gold  we ll see the eclipsing of the All Time High  1923 on 06 September 2011     and indeed the 2000 level    before returning  if ever  to 1046  Here are the four criteria having driven that decision  and their attendant graphic 
  The weekly parabolic trend ought be Long   tis     Price ought be above the 300 day moving average   tis     The 300 day moving average itself ought be rising   tis     Price ought trade at least one full week clear above 1280  just did  

 But mmb  it says in that chart that yer only raising yer target this year to 1377    
Modest that does seem  Squire  Considering we ve still six months  and who knows what unconscionable events  to run in 2016    and moreover that the  reaction Brexit Getsit high  already tapped 1362    Base Camp 1377 is but a puddle jump away  But from the  Predicting With Prudence Dept    as pointed out a couple of missives back  were gold to achieve 1377 this year   twould be a percentage increase for 2016 of practically 30   On a year s closing basis  such increase has been exceeded but once in the past 37 years  for 2007 when price settled that year  31 2   In the  post Nixon Gold nixin  era   only two years have exceeded    and materially so    2007 s increase   36 7  in 1978  en route to the Gold Spike in 1979 of  136 2   We rather not see the latter occur for something humanitarily horrific having happened  Instead  consider this  were Gold from the start of 2016 to increase at a rate of 15  per year  price would trade up through 2000 in 2020 right about mid year  just four years from now  We d happily greet that   Course  if we end up getting stuck for months on end back in The Whiny 1290s  which was the centerpiece trading area from June 2013 through September 2014  then methinx I ll take the vows   There s a convent over that hill     Deborah Kerr   Casino Royale   1967      or in my case  a monastic winery  Anyway    
In the interim  we ve referred to Sister Silver as screamin   and rightly so  As you saw topping the BEGOS Market Standings at  43 6  year to date  silver alone from 01 June through yesterday  01 July  is  24 3   So as we go to our graphic of gold and its equities brethren  Global X Silver Miners  NYSE SIL   the popular exchange traded fund of the silver miners  is leading the pack  up an electrifying 81  from a year ago  in tow are also NEM  Newmont Mining  NYSE NEM    70   FNV  Franco Nevada Corporation  NYSE FNV    66   GDX  NYSE GDX   the prominent exchange traded fund of the gold miners   65   and more modestly GG  Goldcorp Inc  NYSE GG    22  and gold itself  15   Nice 

Specific to the metals themselves  here next is the dual panel graphic showing three months to date of daily bars for both gold on the left and silver on the right  The  Baby Blues  are the dots depicting day to day 21 day linear regression trend consistency  and at  80   dat s consistent  One cautionary technical trading note with respect to Sister Silver  if you peek at our Market Magnets page  silver is at an extreme deviation from her Magnet  suggestive of a price  snap back   which being near the milestone level of 20 wouldn t be untoward 

On to the Market Profiles for gold  left  and silver  right   The yellow metal  presently 1345  appears nicely supported down to 1322  whilst same for the white metal  presently 19 86  down to 19 30  That said  their  expected daily trading ranges   EDTRs  per the website s Market Ranges page are respectively 26 points  gold  and 0 54 points  silver   thus said support areas could get tested in a heartbeat 

Finally  with another trading month in the books   tis time to bring up our Gold Structure graphic with its broad based defined strata  As we ve one trading day already completed in July  that alone is the rightmost green stub  But stubby or otherwise  our little friend near the base of the chart has changed his demeanor such as to not look very happy about it all    course  it being an election year here  folks do worry about losing control     am I allowed to write that  Mr  Editor    Nothing like making headway back up into the basement   sous sol  eh 

In closing  we ve these few salient thoughts 
  From our good colleagues on the opposite side of the globe at New Delhi s Sakshi Post    in citing the opinion of  commodity experts     10 grams of gold  that  just over one third of an ounce  ought reach a price of 33 500 Rupees come this December  Why the emphasis  That works out to one ounce of gold at some 95 000 Rupees  Figuring 66 Rupees for one Buck  95 000   66    1 439 oz  What was that hit by The Miracles  appropriately  back in  66   Going to a Goa     
  Again with reference to the standings of the BEGOS Markets shown at the outset  you ll have noted the Bond  30 yr  Treasury futures price  is  14 4  thus far this year  driven higher by the underlying product s yield having dropped from closing out 2015 at 3 015  to now 2 241   The 10 yr  variety at 1 456  is now a four year low  Surely our Federal Open Market Committee shall  in turn  lie low  perhaps even rescind to increase the spend  But wait  there s more  per the FinTimes this past week  global sovereign debt now totals a record  11 7 trillion on which yield is negative  Say goodnight  Janet 
  Speaking of the Fed  you may have read that some 71  of StateSiders think that our economy is  rigged  toward  certain groups   Obviously we take that seriously as also we take to heart the reported metrics that build our Economic Barometer  One has to wonder if  certain groups  include the Bureau of Labor Statistics  which again speaking of miracles  typically comes up with 100 000s of net new payrolls per month  whilst concurrently folks are leaving the labour force at an arguably faster pace  Welcome to the world of one less one equals one  So for all you film producers out there  you ve likely a blockbuster in something such as  The Day It All Went Wrong    Twould be the perfect film for Cannes  Palme d Or  Gold Palm award   Call me  sweetheart  to stop by the yacht and we ll make a deal 
  Lastly  in the reeling wake of the Brexit vote  Fitch having downgraded the UK s  Long Term Foreign and Local Currency Issuer Default Ratings  from AA  to AA  whilst flicking their outlook toggle switch to Negative  and Moody s having downgraded the UK s banking sector   save for RBS  LON RBS   which being in Scotland merited a reaffirmation of  positive    there is a notion running about that the US ought adopt the UK as a 51st State  But should it not be 180  right  round  that the US replace the UK in the EU  Why  given the trend of our economics and political tilt these last few decades  we d fit right in

189562,411078,NEM,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  Golden Star Resources  Richmont Mines  Barrick Gold  IAMGOLD And Yamana Gold,opinion,"For Immediate Release

Chicago  IL   June 17  2016   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Gold  including Golden Star Resources  Ltd      Richmont Mines Inc      Barrick Gold Corp       IAMGOLD Corp     and Yamana Gold  Inc      

Industry  Gold

Link  

Gold has regained its luster  as exemplified by a 21  rise since the beginning of the year with prices flirting close to the  1 300 mark  Needless to say  the yellow metal has been the best performing asset in the first quarter  trouncing major equity indices  investment grade and high yield bonds and commodity indices 

What Set Gold Rolling 
	A weakening greenback  slowdown in China  volatile equity markets and introduction of negative interest rates by several of the world s central banks  including Japan  have spurred safe haven demand for gold 
	The spike in gold prices has led to a surge in the share prices of many gold miners  Among others  Golden Star Resources  Ltd      Richmont Mines Inc      Barrick Gold Corp       IAMGOLD Corp     and Yamana Gold  Inc      have appreciated more than 150  year to date Gold vs  the Fed
	Part of gold s recent allure is due to the Fed s  lower for longer  view of monetary policy  A combination of uneven economic readings and global uncertainty has forced the Fed to take a pass on following up on its December 2015 rate hike  with many in the market sceptical of any rate hike at the July meeting either Brexit  Will it or Won t it Happen 
	Another macroeconomic factor that the market is scared of is the possibility of United Kingdom exiting the European Union  The referendum scheduled for Jun 23 is closely watched and  in case UK voters decide to leave the union  there is sure to be more turbulence in the market ahead  This uncertainly is also fuelling gold prices Record Global Gold Demand in Q1
	As per the World Gold Council  the first quarter of 2016 was the best on record with total gold demand rising 21  year over year to 1289 8 tons  Following outflows over the last three years  ETF inflows surged to a seven year high of 363 7 tons 

Negative Interest Rate Policies  NIRP  implemented by central banks in Japan and Europe  China s devaluation of the yuan stoking fears over the country s economic health and the potential impact on global growth and the slowdown in the pace of U S  interest rate triggered a flight to safety  This led to a 122  jump in total investment demand  Total bar and coin demand edged up 1  year over year to 253 9 tons 
	On the other hand  jewelry demand dropped 19  to 481 9 tons in the quarter  Grabbing headline was the 41  plunge in jewelry demand in India to 88 4 tons  the worst quarter in the past 7 years  This was mainly due to the Finance Ministry s plans to impose a 1  excise duty on jewelry manufacturing  which led to a nationwide strike in March 

Demand in China also fell 17  in the quarter to 179 4 tons affected by higher gold price against a backdrop of continued economic slowdown  In the technology sector  gold demand was down 3  to 80 9 tons 
	The central banks were the primary acquirers of gold  purchasing 109 tons net over the quarter  the 21st consecutive quarter of net purchases  The accumulation of gold reserves is an act of diversification  especially away from the U S  dollar Supply  Production Up  Will it Stay 
	Total supply in the first quarter increased 5  year on year  driven by an 8  increase in total mine supply  the sum of mine production and net hedging   offset by a 1  dip in gold recycling 

Mine production in the quarter grew 5  to 734 tons led by increases at Barrick Corporation s Goldstrike and Cortez projects in the U S   Fresnillo  LON FRES  PLC s Herradura and Noche Buena in Mexico and Newmont Mining Corporation  NYSE NEM  Batu Hijau mine in Indonesia  Russian production was aided by a 9  increase in output by Polyus Gold

Negative Interest Rate Policies  NIRP  implemented by central banks in Japan and Europe  China s devaluation of the yuan stoking fears over the country s economic health and the potential impact on global growth and the slowdown in the pace of U S  interest rate triggered a flight to safety  This led to a 122  jump in total investment demand  Total bar and coin demand edged up 1  year over year to 253 9 tons On the other hand  jewelry demand dropped 19  to 481 9 tons in the quarter  Grabbing headline was the 41  plunge in jewelry demand in India to 88 4 tons  the worst quarter in the past 7 years  This was mainly due to the Finance Ministry s plans to impose a 1  excise duty on jewelry manufacturing  which led to a nationwide strike in March 
Demand in China also fell 17  in the quarter to 179 4 tons affected by higher gold price against a backdrop of continued economic slowdown  In the technology sector  gold demand was down 3  to 80 9 tons The central banks were the primary acquirers of gold  purchasing 109 tons net over the quarter  the 21st consecutive quarter of net purchases  The accumulation of gold reserves is an act of diversification  especially away from the U S  dollar Supply  Production Up  Will it Stay Total supply in the first quarter increased 5  year on year  driven by an 8  increase in total mine supply  the sum of mine production and net hedging   offset by a 1  dip in gold recycling Mine production in the quarter grew 5  to 734 tons led by increases at Barrick Corporation s Goldstrike and Cortez projects in the U S   Fresnillo  LON FRES  PLC s Herradura and Noche Buena in Mexico and Newmont Mining Corporation  NYSE NEM  Batu Hijau mine in Indonesia  Russian production was aided by a 9  increase in output by Polyus Gold  Apart from established mines  new mines like Torex Gold Resources Inc  s  TORXF  El Limon Guajes mine in Mexico  Goldcorp Inc   GG   l onore and Cochenour mines in Canada  Guyana Goldfields Inc  s  GUYFF  Aurora project and Troy Resources Limited  TRYRF  Karouni project in Guyana also added to the numbers However  the increase in production is a temporary phase as project pipeline is seen to be diminishing  In recent years  additional production from new mines brought on stream has waned  Producers have cut down on expenditure and are focused on maximizing production from their existing portfolio of assetsSector Level Earnings Trend As per the Zacks classification  the gold mining industry comes under the broader Basic Materials sector which suffered a 15 9  drop in earnings in the first quarter  Even though earnings are expected to decline 15  in the second quarter  a dramatic recovery is projected for the latter half of the year with 5 6  growth in the third and 18 6  in the fourth   For a detailed look at the earnings outlook for this sector and others  please read our  report  Industry Ranking   Outlook   Positive
   We rank all of the more than 257 industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook for the constituent companies in each industry  This ranking is available on the  page 
The way to align the ranking and outlook from the complete list of Zacks Industry Rank for the 257  companies is that the outlook for the top one third of the list  Zacks Industry Rank of  86 and lower  is positive  the middle one third  between  87 and  172  is neutral while the outlook for the bottom one third  Rank  173 and higher  is negative  Currently  the gold mining industry is in the top tier with a Zacks Industry Rank of  68  indicating a positive outlook 
What Next  A delay in raising interest rates elevates demand for gold  which produces no income but relies on price appreciation to attract investors  Gold prices are generally supported by retail demand for gold in the latter part of the year  as it is a seasonally strong period in countries like India and China  Moreover  pent up demand due to the shutdown of jewelry stores in India will likely be a catalyst this year  Moreover  demand from the central bank will support prices as this sector has remained remarkably consistent  Another factor that will eventually be a tailwindis that the supply of this precious metal has already attained peak levels as per reports  Lower gold prices in the past few years and cost pressure had restricted the ability of gold producers to invest in new projects 
Production of gold is likely to decline by 3  in 2016  thus ending a seven year stint of rising output  Lower mined gold supply could help prices navigate north  A positive outlook for the industry reinforced by expectations of earnings growth eventually in 2016 makes a good investment case for the gold mining industry  Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research  Today  you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days ",2016-06-16,Zacks Investment Research,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold-has-strong-tailwinds-courtesy-brexit,-fed-and-india-200136517",200136517
189564,411080,NEM,Get The Midas Touch With Gold Stocks,opinion,"Declining output from existing mines  geopolitical tensions  a stock market rout  China worries and a possible delay in further rate hikes will work in favor of gold after years of languishing prices  There are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the gold mining industry for both the short and the long term  Below  we have discussed what investors in the gold mining sector can look forward to in the coming months and years 
 
India  China to Be Long Term Growth Drivers
 
Over the last decade  combined demand for gold from India and China has grown 71   Last year  these two markets accounted for 54  of consumer gold demand  up from 33  in 2005  India has a strong tradition of investing in gold  mainly in jewelry  Demand mostly increases around the wedding and festive seasons  which begin from mid to late August and continue until January  Expenditure on gold can account for almost 30  of the total wedding cost  This gives a boost to local currency demand and raises gold prices 
In China  people view gold  whether in the form of bars  coins or jewelry  as a natural vehicle for savings and diversification  Gold is embedded in China s culture and the Chinese New Year and weddings are key events for the country s gold consumption  In China  although demand might drop from the highs of 2013  growth remains intact  A continuous shift toward higher margin products has lately been observed in the Chinese jewelry market  Gem set and 18 carat gold items are becoming increasingly popular  with the latter largely gaining popularity among the younger generation 
The World Gold Council expects demand from China to grow at least another 20  by 2017  While China s middle class is expanding  India has a comparatively low level of per capita gold holdings  The powerful combination of increasing urbanization and strong cultural affinity for gold bodes well for the metal s demand in both these countries 
China s central bank also continues to purchase the precious metal on a monthly basis  as it sees value in diversifying in gold  People s Bank of China  PBOC  now holds a total of 57 18 million ounces of gold  Currently  China s gold reserves are ranked fifth in the world  behind the U S   Germany  Italy and France 
Growing U S  Trend 
In the first quarter of 2016  demand for gold jewelry in the U S  went up 2  year on year   the ninth consecutive quarter of such an increase  The industry continues to benefit from retailers re entering the gold segment  Rising household wealth is also providing support  Some promising trends  like a continued shift from 10 carat toward 14 carat jewelry  and responsiveness among consumers to targeted marketing campaigns  continue to emerge  Growth in consumer confidence and lower oil prices are likely to lead to further improvements in this market over the coming quarters  
Revival in Acquisitions
Vancouver based Tahoe Resources Inc  s  TAHO  acquisition of Lake Shore Gold Corp  will address challenges faced by both companies  The transaction added Timmins West and Bell Creek mines in Timmins  Ontario  to Tahoe s holdings  which include mines in Guatemala and Peru  The enlarged company is expected to produce 370 000 430 000 ounces of gold in 2016 at total cash costs of  675  725 per ounce and all in costs of  950  1 000 per ounce  Last year  Tahoe had bought a smaller rival Rio Alto Mining to expand its presence in Latin America 
Goldcorp Inc   GG  has inked a deal to acquire Kaminak Gold Corporation  The total consideration offered for all of Kaminak s outstanding shares is roughly C 520 million  The acquisition is in sync with Goldcorp s strategy of aligning with smaller exploration companies to identify and develop mining districts with large exploration potential that can grow its net asset value per share 
The Coffee Gold project is located within a politically stable jurisdiction and gives Goldcorp an opportunity to add high quality ounces to its development pipeline  at low all in sustaining costs  The project will create lasting positive benefits for local First Nations and communities of Goldcorp 
Gold Miners Optimizing Portfolio
The drop in gold prices in recent years had put the gold mining companies  bottom lines under pressure  The companies were actively pursuing opportunities to optimize their portfolio  including the divestiture of certain non core or non productive assets and reduction of debt  maximization of return on capital and driving value across the portfolio 
Newmont Mining Corporation  NYSE NEM   NEM  sold Newmont Waihi Gold Limited in New Zealand to OceanaGold Corporation  OCANF   Over the last two years  Newmont has generated  1 7 billion through non core asset sales  allowing the company to reduce its debt  invest in profitable production and return capital to its shareholders 
IAMGOLD Corp   IAG  LON ICAG   completed the sale of its Niobec mine to a group of companies led by Magris Resources Inc  for cash proceeds of  500 million  This sale will increase IAMGOLD s liquidity position  thereby strengthening its financial position over many of its competitors  Goldcorp had sold its 26  stake in Tahoe Resources for just under  1 billion in order to focus on cash flow generation 
Barrick Gold Corporation  ABX  is also shedding non core assets to optimize its portfolio and strengthen its balance sheet  The company  in late 2015  completed the sale of a 50  interest in the Zaldivar copper mine in Chile to Antofagasta  LON ANTO  Plc  and also closed the divestment of its 70  interest in the Spring Valley project and its 100  interest in the Ruby Hill mine to subsidiaries of Waterton Precious Metals Fund II Cayman  LP 
Moreover  the company wrapped up the sale of its 50  interest in the Round Mountain mine and 100  of the Bald Mountain mine in Nevada to Kinross Gold Corporation  KGC  earlier this year  receiving  610 million in cash for these non core assets  Barrick reduced its total debt by 24  in 2015  exceeding its original debt reduction goal of  3 billion 
Gold s Safe Haven Appeal 
Gold has always been viewed as a store of value and a safe haven asset  The buying of gold is a hedge against inflation  macroeconomic  geopolitical  systemic and monetary risk  This trend intensifies during periods of economic turmoil and geopolitical tensions  And there is no dearth of these factors in the current economic scenario right now 
Superiority Over Other Precious Metals
Gold s worldwide acceptance as a store of value sets it apart from other precious metals such as platinum  palladium and silver whose demand stems mainly from their industrial applications  Gold is produced primarily for accumulation while the other commodities are produced for consumption 
Moreover  in contrast to other commodities  gold does not perish  tarnish or corrode  nor does it have quality grades  There has not been any material change in gold s quality over the years  gold mined thousands of years ago is the same as today  Gold existing aboveground is easily interchanged with newly mined gold  This ensures the continuous demand of the metal for years to come 
Bottom Line
Gold is having jolly good ride this year on mounting global economic fears  This accelerated flight to safety makes investment in gold a prudent option at the moment

189570,411086,NEM,Are There Reasons To Worry About Gold ,opinion,"Demand for gold will remain strong in the years to come given the demand for jewelry  bars and coins as well as its safe haven appeal  Yet  the gold mining industry has a number of lurking headwinds  Below  we have discussed some of the key challenges and what investors in the sector can look forward to in the coming months and years 
Production to Flatten on Lack of New Projects
Mine production in 2015 saw its first quarterly decline and its slowest annual growth rate since 2008  While output is slowing down from older mines  particularly in South Africa and the U S   the incremental impact on production from new mines coming on stream is gradually on the ebb  Previously  incremental production from newer mines led to continued growth in overall gold production  However  newer mines are now at or near their full potential  leading to a slowing down in the growth rates  This has made further production gains increasingly difficult 
After a period of implementing cuts to spending on capital and administration  much of the recent cost reduction has come from lower oil prices and favourable exchange rate moves  Reduced spending on exploration and development has already taken its toll on the production pipeline and will further squeeze production over the coming quarters 
Some gold companies  including Barrick Gold Corporation  ABX   Goldcorp  Inc   GG  and Newmont Mining Corporation  NYSE NEM   NEM   are currently high grading at certain mines  The high grade portion of a mine is mined first as this increases the grade of the mined ore and lowers cost per unit  However  it has its pitfalls as it depletes reserves very quickly  thus affecting long term supply 
Gold miners  grappling with low gold prices and cost pressure  have not been in a position to invest in new projects in recent years  Companies including AngloGold Ashanti Ltd  AU  and Agnico Eagle Mines Limited  AEM  have slashed capital and exploration spending  Given the lack of new projects  mine production will eventually reach a plateau in the next couple of years 
Restricted Margins
The price decline in past years added to the woes of an industry that was already fighting rising costs  labor issues  strikes  delays and or the cancellation of projects  As costs are difficult to curtain beyond a point  miners will only profit if gold prices rise in response to demand and other macroeconomic factors  Production cutbacks and mine closures would spell more financial pain for producers and investors  who have watched gold mining stocks slump  In case market fears are allayed and gold prices fall again  the industry would see a rise in the number of producers reducing output or even shutting down operations 
A Struggling China
China s stock market has been shaken by the slowdown in the country s economy  China s economy grew at an annual rate of 6 7  in the first quarter  the slowest quarterly growth in in seven years  The International Monetary Fund  IMF  projects 6 5  growth in China in 2016  The international organization cut its 2016 world growth outlook to 3 2  from its earlier estimate of 3 4  as China s slowdown and weak commodity prices are taking a deeper toll on emerging markets than expected 
Gold Substitutes in Technology 
Demand for gold in technological applications is affected by sluggish economic conditions in key markets and substitutes found for the metal  Despite inferior durability  copper and palladium coated copper have made vast inroads into the share of gold in the bonding wire sector  The decade long decline in the dental sector shows no sign of abatement as gold continues to lose ground to ceramic alternatives  which have improved steadily in quality  strength and durability 
Low Recycling Levels 
Recycling fell for the sixth consecutive year in 2015  Supply from this source was down almost 40  from the peak attained in 2009  Recycling activity will remain low and might deteriorate further given that a large portion of near market supply has been flushed out in recent years  Less distress selling may further suppress recycling volumes  Many collectors are struggling to source feed stock 
U S  Dollar vs Gold Prices
There is an inverse relationship between the trade weighted U S  dollar and the price of gold  If the dollar gains strength against major currencies on the back of positive macroeconomic data  like an improving job market and growing industrial activity  it will again put gold prices under pressure 
Inherent Risks
Gold exploration and mining are time consuming and expensive tasks  Given its scarcity and remote location of deposits  exploration for new gold deposits is difficult  Once an economically viable deposit is identified  bringing a mine on line can take a decade or more  and it requires substantial capital investment 
Moreover  the mining industry is subject to several risks such as political conflicts  environmental hazards  industrial accidents  unexpected geological conditions  labor force disruptions  unavailability of materials and equipment  weather conditions  pit wall failures  rock bursts  cave ins  flooding  seismic activity and water conditions  However  once a mine is successfully developed  its returns can be enormously high  This will more than offset the risks inherent in development and the capital invested for the project 
Bottom Line
Dwindling production  lack of new projects and decline in recycling activity and the constant threat of a stronger greenback are some of the sector s worst detractors  But what about investing in the space right now  are there opportunities for short term investors overriding the headwinds

189585,411101,NEM,Mixed Earnings Put Gold Mining ETFs In Focus,opinion,"With gold prices on the tear in the first quarter of 2016 thanks to safe haven demand  the gold mining industry has once again grabbed investors  attention  Bearish bets on this long abandoned space have started to ease lately  This makes it more important to look at the Q1 earnings of gold mining companies 
While the sector is not yet out of the woods  the undercurrent looks favorable  At least Q4 earnings delivered by some sector bellwethers give such cues  After all  the Zacks Industry Rank of the sector is in the top 23  segment  at the time of writing 
Let s peek into the earnings picture  
Two gold mining companies Barrick Gold Corporation    NYSE ABX    and Newmont Mining Corporation    NYSE NEM    came up with their earnings reports lately  While Barrick Gold reported mixed results  Newmont beat on both lines  read    Barrick Gold s Q1 Earnings in Focus

Barrick Gold s adjusted earnings per share of  0 11 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny  Earnings also increased considerably by 120  from the year ago quarter figure of  0 05 per share 

Revenues fell around 14  year over year to  1 930 million in the reported quarter and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 972 million  Average realized price of gold fell 3 1  year over year to  1 181 per ounce in the quarter while all in costs tumbled 26  to  758 per ounce  and all in sustaining costs dropped about 24  to  706 per ounce 

For 2016  the company reiterated its gold production outlook and expects to produce 5 5 5 million ounces of gold at all in sustaining costs of  760  810 per ounce  down from previous guidance of  775  825 per ounce   Also  the company plans to reduce its total debt by at least  2 billion in 2016 

Investors valued the company s cost cutting efforts and following earnings released on April 26  the stock gained about 8 9   as of April 28  2016  
Newmont s Q1 Earnings in Focus

Newmont s adjusted earnings were  0 34 per share  above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 21  Earnings declined about 26 1  year over year  Newmont s revenues went up 3  year over year to  2 032 million in the reported quarter  Revenues topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 786 million

Following the earnings announcement on April 20  the stock gained about 8 3   as of April 28  2016  
ETF Impact 

The aforementioned companies have considerable exposure in large cap funds like Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF  NYSE GDX      iShares MSCI Global Gold Miners    and PowerShares Global Gold   Precious Metals     see  here  

In PSAU  NEM  8 18   and ABX  7 86   combine to make up about 16 04  of total assets  More than 24  of RING goes to ABX  12 80   and NEM  11 23    In GDX too  ABX and NEM take the top two spots with a respective share of 8 51  and 7 57   read    
Bottom Line

Investors should note that though the gold mining companies and the related ETFs secured solid gains in the last ten trading days  as of April 28  2016   the strength was partly reflective of earnings and partly due to a still dovish Fed  Still  investors can play the latest earnings led bullishness and a strong industry rank via the ETF route  However  we are not sure of how long this surge will last  So  gold bugs should tread cautiously while playing these metal oriented investments  read    ",2016-04-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/mixed-earnings-put-gold-mining-etfs-in-focus-200127115,200127115

Adjusted loss excludes one time items  including positive deferred tax effects of foreign exchange on tax assets and liabilities and restructuring costs 
Goldcorp  which is among the top gold producers  along with Barrick Gold   NYSE ABX    Newmont   NYSE NEM   and Kinross Gold   NYSE KGC    posted revenues of  944 million in the reported quarter  down around 7 2  year over year  Revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  930 million

Shares of the company rose around 6  to close at  18 94 on Apr 28 
Mining Highlights    
At the Penasquito mine  gold production was 124 700 ounces  a year over year decrease of around 19 9   Production declined due to mining in a lower grade portion of the pit  All in sustaining cost of  1 004 per ounce surged 43  year over year 
Cerro Negro in Argentina produced 115 400 ounces of gold in the first quarter  at an all in sustaining cost of  503 per ounce  supported by higher grades  recoveries and a reduction of in circuit inventory 
At Pueblo Viejo  where Goldcorp holds 40  interest and Barrick Gold holds 60  interest  gold production rose nearly 26 7  year over year to 114 300 ounces  40  basis   at an all in sustaining cost of  443 per ounce  The increase in gold production was backed by higher plant throughput and grade 
Financial Position
As of Mar 31  2016  cash and cash equivalents were  401 million  up from  365 million as of Mar 31  2015  Long term debt was  2 727 million as of Mar 31  2016  compared with  3 670 million as of Mar 31  2015  The company s adjusted operating cash flow fell to  330 million as of Mar 31  2016  from  366 million as of Mar 31  2015  mainly due to lower cash flow from Alumbrera and Pueblo Viejo 
Outlook
For 2016  Goldcorp reiterated its gold production guidance range of between 2 8 and 3 1 million ounces  However  the company anticipates that gold production during the second quarter will be unfavorably impacted by planned lower grade mining sequences in most mines and a 10 day mill shutdown for preventative maintenance at Penasquito 
The company expects AISC to be between  850 and  925 per ounce  Higher costs are expected in the second quarter compared to the first mainly due to higher sustaining capital and lower gold production  The third and fourth quarters are expected to see AISC normalize vis   vis the second quarter as a result of higher gold production

189596,411112,NEM,What Is The Best Trade On The Gold Mining Sector ,opinion,"Gold prices soared last week when market pricing went to extremes  with bond prices indicating that there was next to no chance of a rate hike in the next twelve months  We have covered the cause of this irregular pricing  which was the stopping out of 2016 consensus macro trades  in a previous article  so we will not repeat ourselves here  For the purpose of this analysis it suffices to say that gold prices were heavily overbought when they challenged  1250 and that the currently high levels are unsustainable 
As gold spiked to one year highs the precious metals mining sector followed suit and tore ahead  The HUI increased more than 60  in value from its January lows to triple the performance of gold  With this strength many have been calling to load up on precious metals miners while they are  cheap  
However  we are not so hasty to jump on the band wagon due to the historic underperformance of the gold mining sector and the underlying fundamentals for gold  which remain bearish over the long term  Therefore in this article we analyse the risk reward dynamics involved with the precious metals mining sector 
The mining sector faces increasing costs
The significant decline in oil prices have led some to believe that the costs of production for mining companies will also fall  While energy costs are likely to be lower  these are far from the only cost facing mining companies  One of the most significant and threatening to the mining industry is the increase in debt costs 
In 2013 Hecla Mining Company  N HL  raised capital to fund the takeover of Aurizon Mines  selling bonds with a coupon rate of 6 875   In 2015 the yield on these bonds had risen to around 9   Today these bonds offer a yield of over 17   Hecla Mining is not the only company facing extremely high borrowing costs  Coeur d Alene is another miner whose debt offers close to a 20  yield  While the bonds for much larger miners  such as Barrick  offer lower yields  the fact remains that borrowing costs are high and increasing for the mining industry 
Of course  these companies may not need to borrow and the high yield on their current debt may not be an issue as the pay the lower coupon rate  However  any miner looks to borrow in the next five years will almost certainly be subjected to higher costs  This means that miners will struggle to expand into new projects  as the increased cost of borrowing will makes these financially inviable  This means that any undeveloped assets in the ground are unlikely to be greenlit  and therefore any expected increase in earnings from those projects are unlikely to eventuate 
Perhaps more importantly is the cost of rolling over debt  If Hecla Mining needs to roll over their current debts  then they would have to do so at almost three times their current borrowing rate  This means if Hecla Mining wishes to refinance any of their debt in the next five years  it will almost certainly be at a higher rate  This means that they are locked in to their current rate  as are many of the mining companies 
Borrowing is just one of the many costs that face the mining industry  One can make the argument that these are unlikely to flow over to some of the larger miners  but this holds little water  Newmont Mining Corporation  N NEM   one of the largest and best performing mining stocks in 2015  had an all in sustaining cost  AISC  of  999 per gold ounce in Q4 2015  compared to  927 the previous quarter  The numbers do not lie  Oil and commodity prices may be in a rout  but the miners costs are still going up 
Take a look at the earnings
In terms of earnings per share  last year Newmont Mining Corp  N NEM  was one of the best performers in the gold mining sector  In fact  of the top 10 largest holdings in the Market Vectors Gold Miners  N GDX  fund  Newmont was the best performer with earnings per share of 3 83  its current stock price  By taking a closer look at the figures  we can paint a rough picture of how the company will be likely to perform going forward 
The first figure that stands out here is that of their 2015 gold reserves  which were calculated at a gold price of  1 200  However  the average realised gold price was  1084  which means that the estimation for the value of reserves is based on figure more than 10  over the price achieved  Of course  the price of gold fluctuates and the metal has been off to a roaring start in 2016  so it is not impossible that the average realised gold price could be  1200 in the first quarter this year 
However  it is highly unlikely that such a level can be sustained in 2016  and over the next five years it would be close to impossible to secure an average realised gold price of  1200  Gold has only closed above  1200 four times this year and is likely to continue falling back as market pricing returns to more normal levels  This means that going forward the value of reserves is likely to fall  which means that earnings over the long term will be lesser 
There is also the matter of production costs to consider here as well  As mentioned above  Newmont had an AISC of  999 per gold ounce last quarter  which means they made a profit of  85 per ounce  A crude deduction from this means that if the average gold price  not the spot  for this quarter drops  86  then Newmont will lose money 
Admittedly  the currently high gold price means that this is unlikely to happen this quarter  perhaps not even this year  However  it is likely that over the second half of 2016 and beyond we will see the Fed hiking rates and this will almost certainly drive gold into the triple figures  which means that unless costs somehow fall Newmont Mining could be facing losses 
Now  recall that Newmont Mining was the best EPS performer in 2015 out of the top 10 GDX holdings  If a titan of the gold mining industry  that faces much lower borrowing costs than many  will be near certain to lose money if gold falls into the triple figures  then how vulnerable is the rest of the sector 
With long term gold prices likely to be lower than expected and costs rising across the industry  we believe that the gold miners are heavily overbought at current levels  Further to this  it is likely that they were in fact overvalued before gold prices rallied  This means that once the short term spike in gold passes  the gold miners are likely to fall to new lows 
Trading arguments against holding gold stocks
The recent spike in gold and its miners  along with the calls from the bulls to back up the truck on  cheap  gold stocks  may tempt some into getting long the mining sector  We are not so easily convinced  These companies face increasing costs against falling revenue and downward revisions in the value of their assets  This means that the trade is not buying gold miners 
Even if one were bullish on gold  the trade would not be to buy gold mining companies  There exist a number of varied ETFs that offer direct long positions on gold that can be easily traded  GLD is single long gold  DGP is double long  and UGLD is triple long  This means that if one wanted a position that outperformed a gold long by triple  as miners did in the recent spike  then one could easily get that by buying UGLD  This trade would achieve the desired returns if the bullish view is correct without any of the risks involved with gold mining companies 
Suppose that one insisted on having long exposure to the gold mining sector  Buying gold stocks would still not be the best way to go in terms or risk reward dynamics  Consider Hecla Mining  whose debt yields over 17  a year  For a long position on the company s shares to outperform their bonds over a 5 year period  HL would have to more than double in value  Even in one of the best 5 year periods for gold  2007   2011  gold mining stocks did little more than double  How can one reasonably expect them to perform better than this in an environment where gold is a third lower and more likely to fall than rally 
This is not to mention that in the case that one s bullish view on gold stocks is wrong and the company starts to lose money  In this situation  the debt has first call on the company s assets  This means that your downside risks are much higher when holding the stock versus holding that same company s debt  Given that long debt exposure offers a considerably higher expected return and much lower potential losses  holding gold stocks has poor risk reward dynamics even if one insists on having long exposure 
Therefore  we recommend not holding any long exposure to shares of gold mining companies  It is our view that there is no reasonable situation in which long trades on these companies can offer positive risk reward dynamics  Long trades are simply not compensated well enough for the risks being taken 
What is the trade 
If not long  is the trade to get short  We believe the answer is yes  and that one can do so in an exceptionally attractive way  Double or triple short ETFs  such as DUST  are not our favoured vehicle here  The way these inverse vehicles move does not make them suitable for longer term investment in our view 
We also do not believe the right trade is to short the miners  or a long gold miners ETF such as GDX  outright  This type of trade involves unlimited potential risks  and although we believe the probability of these risks being realised is low  we would not be achieving our top goal of prudent risk management if we took on such a position 
It is our view that the best risk reward dynamics for any trade on the gold mining sector come via options  The versatility of options allow one to take a low and limited risk position with significant upside potential  We have used options to tailor positions to exactly fit our views on gold mining stocks and have issued these trades to our subscribers  If you wish to find out the exact details of these trades  please subscribe via either of the buttons below

189597,411113,NEM,OceanaGold s Epic Fundamentals,opinion,"With the gold mining sector s market dominating outperformance this year  investors are searching for the best of breed gold miners  The elite mid tier OceanaGold  OTC OCANF  is certainly among them  OceanaGold has truly epic fundamentals  combining super profitable low cost gold production with a solid balance sheet and great growth potential  Gold stock investors really need to seriously consider this gem for their portfolios 
OceanaGold likely derives its name from Oceania  a loose geographic region comprising the islands of the southwest Pacific Ocean  And given OceanaGold s operations in New Zealand and the Philippines  its name is quite apt  OceanaGold operates several gold mines  and recently acquired a great new gold project in South Carolina  While not widely known yet by American investors  OceanaGold eventually will be 
OceanaGold was incorporated in 2003 as last decade s mighty secular gold bull was gathering steam  The company started mining gold at the existing Macraes mine in southern New Zealand  which had been owned by OceanaGold s predecessor company  Though mining started at Macraes way back in 1990  it s still in production today thanks to a major underground expansion commissioned in 2008 
As New Zealand s largest producing gold mining operation  Macraes has generated great cash flows over the years  This mine along with other smaller operations in New Zealand put OceanaGold in a position to buy the Didipio project in the northern Philippines through a merger in 2006  Unfortunately the sharp gold plunge during 2008 s stock panic delayed development plans  Didipio was mothballed 
But as gold recovered strongly out of that stock panic to power to new highs in the subsequent years  OceanaGold starting building its new Philippines mine in 2011  Didipio was completed in late 2012  and this high grade gold copper mine has been instrumental in growing OceanaGold into the great company it is today  Didipio is one of the lowest cost gold mines in the world thanks to its big copper byproduct 
And despite the gold mining sector s dark times in recent years  OceanaGold never stopped expanding  Last summer OceanaGold bought Romarco Minerals and its incredible Haile gold project in South Carolina  That mine is under construction with commercial production scheduled to start in early 2017  Also late last year  OceanaGold bought the Waihi gold mine in northern New Zealand from Newmont Mining  N NEM  
Such aggressive expansion while gold and gold stocks slumped to brutal major new secular lows last year is incredibly impressive  It s been exceedingly difficult for the gold miners to raise capital  since banks want nothing to do with this industry and share prices have been bludgeoned to decade plus lows  OceanaGold s ability to actively buy into those fire sale prices resulted from its excellent operating cash flows 
This growth has given OceanaGold a well diversified portfolio of gold mining operations  Production from Macraes  Didipio  and Waihi runs around 150k ounces  140k ounces  and 120k ounces annually  The company has another minor mining operation nearing the end of its life  Reefton in central New Zealand  And of course that Haile project will really boost production when it comes online early next year 
All together all these operations made for a bang up year for OceanaGold in 2015  And that s high praise considering the average gold and HUI gold stock index levels last year were just  1159 and 146 3  In late January  OceanaGold reported producing 419 2k ounces of gold last year  along with 23 1k tonnes of copper  That kind of production puts OceanaGold squarely in the ranks of mid tier producerdom 
But it s not OceanaGold s production that makes it extraordinary  but its incredibly low costs thanks to Didipio s world class gold copper deposit  In 2015 OceanaGold reported cash costs of just  458 per ounce of gold sold  Cash costs include all the direct production costs of mining  including all digging  processing  and refining costs as well as mine level administration and taxes  Cash costs are a useful measure 
They are essentially an acid test for gold miners  showing how low the gold price could sink before cash flows from operations would be insufficient to keep mining gold  And with cash costs all the way down around  450  OceanaGold could ve survived a full blown gold apocalypse and been among the last companies standing  Even the most vociferous of the gold bears rarely forecast gold going much below  800 
But a far more important gold mining cost measure is all in sustaining costs  which were just introduced by the World Gold Council in June 2013  They are way more realistic as they include all costs that are necessary to maintain and replenish existing production levels  This includes direct cash costs  all the corporate level administration  exploration  mine development and construction  remediation  and reclamation 
All in sustaining costs effectively reveal how viable a gold mining company is as a sustainable going concern  And OceanaGold reported stunning AISC of just  709 per ouncesold in 2015  That is again among the lowest in the world thanks to that incredible Philippines mine  Because OceanaGold has such low costs  it can generate large operating cash flows from low gold prices that strained many of its peers 
OceanaGold has the honor of being included in the leading GDX Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF  N GDX   which contains the world s best gold miners  And per the latest data from all of GDX s component gold miners as of Q4 15  OceanaGold s cash costs and all in sustaining costs of  458 and  709 were way under the GDX averages of  587 and  836 per ounce  That s made OceanaGold very strong financially 
And this outperformance is expected to continue  OceanaGold expects 2016 gold production near midpoint levels of 405k ounces  at all in sustaining costs revolving around a  725 midpoint  So it will continue to generate large operating cash flows this year no matter what gold does  And as gold continues to mean revert higher in its overdue major new upleg  OceanaGold s cash generated will swell dramatically 
And OceanaGold has outstanding growth potential due to its Haile gold mine under construction now to start operations early next year  When OceanaGold bought Haile last year  that mine was expected to produce about 150k ounces of gold annually by 2017 at all in sustaining costs near  600 per ounce  So it fits right in with OceanaGold s other operations  The  856m paid will look like a steal as gold powers higher 
So next year or the year after if there are any unforeseen delays at Haile  OceanaGold stands to boost production by roughly 3 8ths despite older operations phasing out  Such big boosts in the mid tier gold mining realm are fairly rare  and make OceanaGold look even more attractive for investment  This truly is an extraordinary gold miner with epic fundamentals  which are readily evident in financial market terms too 
Despite OceanaGold s stock rocketing higher in early 2016  it s still trading at a reasonable trailing twelve month price to earnings ratio of 26 1x  That almost makes it a value play in addition to being a growth play  an irresistible combination  OceanaGold has also directly shared cash with shareholders in the past through dividends  and will almost certainly declare more in the future as operating cash flows soar 
On the financial statement front  OceanaGold is rock solid  At the end of 2015  it reported a hefty cash balance of  185m  Strong cash flows from operations last year of  171m helped build this impressive war chest  While long term liabilities of  269m are substantial  they aren t excessive relative to OceanaGold s cash flows even at 2015 s depressed gold prices  Last year this company earned  53m in accounting profits 
OceanaGold s amazingly profitable operations haven t been lost on investors and speculators  who have bid up this stock in recent years despite gold grinding down to major new secular lows  This chart looks at Oceanagold s  TO OGC  stock price as listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange  which is the easiest place for American investors to trade it  OGC TO s price action in blue is superimposed over gold s in red 

The last few years have been utterly miserable in the precious metals sector  with gold plunging in early 2013 before slumping to a 6 1 year secular low in mid December  Alternative investments led by gold were left for dead as extreme central bank easing by the Federal Reserve levitated US stock markets  That led to extreme market distortions sucking vast amounts of capital out of gold  obliterating gold stocks 
With gold so darned weak  that flagship HUI gold stock index was battered down to fundamentally absurd 13 5 year secular lows in mid January  I ve never seen a sector more hated  and can t imagine how one possibly could be  Considering that backdrop of brutal gold stock carnage through the greatest sentiment wasteland witnessed in modern history  OceanaGold s stock certainly should ve been sucked in 
And it was from time to time  with OGC TO plummeting 69 9  between October 2012 and June 2013 as the Fed s wildly unprecedented open ended QE3 campaign ramped up to full steam  Fed officials used QE3 s ambiguity to jawbone stock markets higher  draining capital from gold as prudent portfolio diversification was summarily abandoned  So gold plummeted 29 1  over this span  a record drop on some fronts 
But despite gold continuing to grind sideways to lower on balance out of its extreme mid 2013 lows courtesy of the Fed  OceanaGold s stock bottomed then and has been climbing higher on balance ever since  While the great majority of gold mining stocks slumped to horrific new secular lows in wretched downtrends that amplified gold s  OGC TO bucked that trend to rather remarkably power higher in recent years 
Such an uptrend in gold stocks given gold s terribly ugly technicals and hyper bearish sentiment is almost unthinkable  yet it s crystal clear on OceanaGold s chart  This uptrend began with a gargantuan 234 9  upleg in OGC TO between June 2013 and July 2014  While this stock generally mirrored gold s price action technically  gold only climbed 6 4  over that span  That made for truly staggering upside leverage 
Investors own gold stocks for one overwhelmingly dominant reason  because they amplify underlying moves in gold  As a sector  the gold stocks generally leverage gold on the order of 2x to 3x  For a 10  move in gold  the HUI index or GDX gold stock ETF will usually move 20  to 30   So seeing OGC TO achieve huge upside leverage during that initial post gold collapse upleg of 36 5x is utterly mind boggling 
And subsequent uplegs proved such great leverage wasn t an anomaly  As the entire gold mining sector sold off hard in late 2014  OceanaGold s stock plummeted 51 8   This represented 5 2x downside leverage to gold s 10 0  drop over that same span  But unlike most gold stocks which plunged to new lows  OGC TO bottomed far higher than in mid 2013 at its new secular uptrend s support in an amazing show of strength 
OceanaGold worked its magic again in its next mighty upleg between December 2014 and June 2015  OGC TO rocketed 76 7  higher over that 6 1 month span while gold actually slipped 0 1   That s a big testament to how impressed investors were with OceanaGold  as capital was hardly flowing into any of the gold stocks for much of that span  But OceanaGold s stock did get sucked into the sharp summer 2015 selloff 
Thanks to last July s record gold futures shorting attack hammering gold through support  the gold stock sector plunged to deep new lows in late 2015  OGC TO fell with its peers for a 40 8  loss compared to gold s 5 1  loss over that span  OceanaGold s amazing upside leverage to gold also made it vulnerable to serious downside leverage  While uptrend support didn t hold that time  OGC TO did still carve a higher low 
And OceanaGold s current massive upleg was born out of those very early October lows  The support failure was short lived as OGC TO rocketed back up into its strong counter sector uptrend within days  As of OGC TO s latest high last week  it has blasted 112 5  higher in 4 6 months compared to a 10 2  gold rally  That makes for more extraordinary upside leverage to gold of 11 0x  again almost unheard of 
The fact that OceanaGold s stock just regained levels seen in October 2012 before QE3 powerfully attests to this company s epic fundamentals  Back at that original late 2012 peak  gold was trading at  1728 while the HUI was way up at 502 5  Yet in early February when OGC TO regained those very levels  gold was way down at  1188 while the HUI languished at 145 6  OceanaGold s relative strength is astounding 
The only reason this company s stock was bid higher so consistently in recent years while the rest of this sector burned was OceanaGold s epic fundamentals  Investors and speculators generally didn t want to touch gold stocks with a ten foot pole  but they wisely made a rare exception for OceanaGold  Their buying resulted in one of the strongest recent years gold stock price charts you ll ever witness 
But despite OceanaGold s amazing stock performance  its rally is far from over  The entire gold stock sector is destined to mean revert radically higher from current levels  and OceanaGold will certainly amplify these coming massive gains  And fundamentally it s really easy to understand why  With its super low  709 all in sustaining costs  this company can earn profits of  491 per ounce at  1200 gold 
As gold itself continues mean reverting higher out of recent years  extreme central bank distortions  OceanaGold s profits will leverage those gains  This is easy to illustrate  Back in 2012 before the Fed s gross QE3 distortions devastated gold  this metal averaged  1669 that year  With QE s new buying and now the Fed s zero interest rate policy gone  gold should have no problem mean reverting to pre QE3 levels 
At  1669 gold  OceanaGold s current operations would earn a staggering  960 per ounce  That s a 95 5  increase in profitability from a 39 1  gold upleg from  1200  And as Haile comes on line next year and really ramps OceanaGold s production  its profits will soar proportionally  This company s fundamental prospects remain dazzling  so investors are going to continue buying on balance for a long time to come 
The bottom line is OceanaGold is a gem among gold miners with truly epic fundamentals  Thanks to its amazing young mine in the Philippines  OceanaGold s all in sustaining costs are among the lowest in the industry  They enable it to generate large operating cash flows which have been prudently used to expand operations  Thus OceanaGold has been able to grow recently while few other gold miners could 
Its major new mine purchased last year is coming online next year and should really boost production  Combine all this with a reasonable valuation  incredible stock performance in recent years totally defying sector weakness  and truly extreme upside leverage to gold  and it s hard to beat OceanaGold  This amazing mid tier gold miner is destined to eventually become a market darling among American investors ",2016-02-28,Adam Hamilton,https://www.investing.com/analysis/oceanagold’s-epic-fundamentals-200119708,200119708
189598,411114,NEM,China Embraces Reaganomics  The Gold Bull Is Back,opinion,"Chinese President Xi Jinping is about to tell millions of government workers   You re fired  
Reuters reported last week that China plans to lay off between five and six million state workers over the next two to three years  in an effort to curb overcapacity in what s being described as  zombie companies   businesses that are being kept alive on bank loans despite bleeding revenue  Close to two million of these layoffs will come from the coal industry alone 
The layoffs are part of a series of sweeping reforms that were announced ahead of the National People s Congress  NPC  meeting  Every year  close to 3 000 Chinese officials and executives from all over the country convene in Beijing to develop and assess the status of the country s Five Year Plan  In response to worldwide demands that China manage its slowing economy better  President Xi Jinping this year has proposed what he calls  supply side structural reform  
And if that sounds a little like Reaganomics  that s kind of the point 
Besides layoffs  Xi s plan includes tax cuts  deregulation and reductions in state spending economic policies you might expect to come from the desk of Reagan or Thatcher  We might also expect the results of these policies to be the same in China as in the U S  and United Kingdom in the 1980s  a boom in entrepreneurship and innovation 
These reforms come at a crucial time for China  whose manufacturing sector has been in contraction mode for a year now as the country s economy shifts toward domestic consumption  In February  China s purchasing manager s index  PMI  fell to 48 0 from 48 4 in January 
We closely follow government policy changes in China for a number of reasons  For one  its economy is the second largest in the world  and when based on purchasing power parity  PPP   its GDP is actually the largest  followed by the U S   India and Japan 
China s economy  then  has a huge effect on the rest of the world  touching everything from commodities demand to consumption 
In 2015  total retail sales in China touched a record  surpassing 30 trillion renminbi  or about  4 2 trillion  By 2020  sales are expected to climb to  6 4 trillion  representing 50 percent growth in as little as five years  This growth will  roughly equal a market 1 3 times the size of Germany or the United Kingdom   according to the World Economic Forum  WEF  
One of the main reasons for this surge in consumption is the staggering expansion of the country s middle class  In October  Credit Suisse reported that  for the first time  the size of China s middle class had exceeded that of America s middle class  109 million to 92 million  As incomes rise  so too does demand for durable and luxury goods  vehicles  air travel  energy and more 
But middle income families aren t the only ones growing in number  The WEF estimates that by 2020  upper middle income and affluent households will account for 30 percent of China s urban households  up from only 7 percent in 2010 
Gold s Back in a Bull Market at the BMO 25th Metals and Mining Conference Last week I returned from sunny Florida  where I had been attending the BMO Metals and Mining Conference  widely regarded as the best in the business  Sentiment toward gold was very optimistic  as I told Kitco News  Daniela Cambone in last week s edition of Gold Game Film 
The yellow metal is 2016 s best performing asset class so far  having climbed more than 19 percent  It just had its strongest February since 1975  What s more  gold appears as though it s back in a bull market  often defined as a 20 percent gain from a recent trough 
Short term  though  it s way overbought  so a correction at this point would be healthy 
Follow the Money  Follow the Gold Flows
At the BMO Conference  I had the pleasure of meeting and speaking with my friend Pierre Lassonde cofounder of Franco Nevada  NYSE FNV   and company CEO David Harquail  Pierre told me that for every  1 billion that flows into the SPDR Gold Trust  NYSE GLD   the price of gold rises approximately  30 per ounce  Since the beginning of the year  we ve seen about  9 3 billion flow into the GLD  During the same period  gold has risen 20 percent from its six year low of  1 049 60 per ounce on December 17 to end Friday trading at  1 259 25 
The first breakout signal occurred on December 31  2015  when money started to flow into gold  and the second important signal was when gold flows surpassed the 200 day  or 10 month  average  on February 1  2016  Since the beginning of the year  gold has surged 
Like bullion  gold miners had a particularly gainful February  its best since 1998  The NYSE ARCA Gold Miners Index  GDM  rose an impressive 38 7 percent  compared to the 0 4 percent the S P 500 Index lost in February  Year to date  production leaders Goldcorp  NYSE GG   Newmont Mining  NYSE NEM  and Barrick  NYSE ABX  which has recently lowered its debt to equity ratio are thriving with prices pushing higher 
Gold is surging right now for a number of reasons  many of which I ve covered in the last few weeks  including   and other components of the Fear Trade 
Global growth concerns have also spooked many investors  driving them into gold s arms  Last week we learned that the global PMI fell pretty dramatically to a neutral 50 0 reading in February  down from 50 9 in January  Anything below 50 0 indicates manufacturing deterioration  and while I hope we don t cross into that territory  the PMI has been trending downward over the last two years  We haven t seen sub 50 readings since 2012 
As I ve discussed many times before  we use PMIs to help forecast global manufacturing conditions three to six months out   I ve likened the economic indicator to the  with GDP serving as your rearview mirror   That the PMI remains below its three month moving average doesn t bode well for commodities or energy in the short term  The weakness underscores the need for global economies to reform their tax systems and relax regulations  as China is attempting to do 
Comparing Countries  Compliance Complexity The TMF Group  a professional services firm  just released its annual  which ranks countries according to the complexity of their business compliance standards  As you might expect  dominating the top 10 most complex governments are those found in South America  including Brazil  Bolivia  Colombia and  at number one  Argentina 
Colombia climbed or fell  depending on your perspective 18 spots  from 21 to three  mainly due to the  its government rolled out last year courtesy of its socialist finance minister  Mauricio C rdenas Santa Maria  The South American country is now in the process of raising its income tax incrementally  from 40 percent this year to 43 percent in 2018  and with the agreement of other countries  it may now also tax the wealth its citizens hold in other jurisdictions  very similar to FATCA  or the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act  here in the U S   
For the third consecutive year  Argentina ranks as the world s most complex country in terms of business compliance  Back in November I wrote about the election of free market advocate Mauricio Macri  expressing my hopes that the new president can bring significant reforms to the country s business infrastructure and eliminate corruption  I m still encouraged  but as we all know  political change is fraught with challenges and can take some time  
It s a shame that Argentina  Colombia  Brazil and many other resource rich countries in South America can t move more quickly to eliminate the roadblocks that stand in the way of growth and prosperity  Brazil  which is on course for its worst recession in over a century  shrank 3 8 percent in 2015  the largest decline since 1990  and its central bank expects it to shrink a further 3 45 percent this year 
Reform would benefit not just their own capital markets but the world economy as a whole  South America represents about 10 percent of the global economy  meaning a 1 or 2 percent rise or fall in GDP could have a significant effect on world GDP

Of course  stocks will  as they always do  regress to some sensible level of revaluation  just as shall Gold catch up to currency devaluation  But with specific respect to the Fed  what deserves far more scrutiny is not its disposition as to the level of interest rates  but rather to its growing angst within  some FedWatchers going so far as to use the  R  word  Revolt  Dissent amongst ranks has reinvented many an entity throughout human history  and any organizational uncertainty over the Fed  which would further foster lack of credibility ahead  in turn would become for Gold quite the incentive for price to go  per our favourite technical expression  upside gonzo nutz  Why  Fed Chair Yellen s remarks this past Tuesday before the Economic Club of New York saw Gold  and everything else ex dollar  soar  14 oz  in a mere 20 minutes  continue that rate of climb and Gold would make an new All Time High above 1923 in a mere 16 hours 
Gonzo or otherwise   tis so far so good  understatement  for Gold in 2016  Yes  Gold recently ran afoul of the 1240 1280 resistance zone  yet still closed mildly higher for the week in settling yesterday  Friday  at 1224  So as we below go to the weekly bars  again note the green arrow mid chart  it marks the 1190s level which as we d previously noted is the  visible  area traders are eying do some more buying  And the way Gold is technically trending near term  we wouldn t bet against a re test of that area  But you know what they say about markets  when  tis so obvious that a specific level ought trade     it doesn t 

Moreover  were the 1190s not be revisited for the  Back Up The Truck  bunch  then obviously we d know that  the bottom is in    i e  1045 of last 03 December   Sad to say  however  that despite Gold s superb start to 2016  now only two   twas three  of our four criteria are in place for determining if that low is in place   Tis because the 300 day moving average is once again heading   albeit mildly  lower  Here are the criteria and their chart 
  The weekly parabolic trend ought be Long   tis    Price ought be above the 300 day moving average   tis    The 300 day moving average itself ought be rising   tisn t    Price ought trade at least one full week clear above 1280  hasn t 

As for those near term technicals  here next is the two panel graphic  wherein on the left across Gold s daily bars for the past three months we ve now got the  Baby Blues     that day by day measure of 21 day linear regression trend consistency    in deep dive  But given the plunging dots  price s resilience remains stout  And if it seems to you that the 1220s have been getting a lot of action of late  Gold s 10 day Market Profile on the right confirms your notion  1223 being the most commonly traded price over the past 10 sessions 

 Course with March having slipped past   tis once again time to go year over year with Gold and several of its most notable equities kin  We ve again changed up the mix per the prudent guidance of an illustrious reader  thank you THR   in bringing back Market Vectors Gold Miners  NYSE GDX   the prominent exchange traded fund of the Gold miners   having in the spirit of the beginning of baseball season put HUI  the Gold Bugs Index  on waivers  Remaining in the mix are Newmont Mining Corporation  NYSE NEM   Goldcorp Inc  NYSE GG   Franco Nevada Corporation  NYSE FNV   and Global X Silver Miners  NYSE SIL   the popular exchange traded fund of the Silver miners   As for 2016 to date  Gold may be leading the BEGOS Markets  15 4   but FNV   33 5      BANG 

Meanwhile  how  bout all that excitement on the economic front  Lending growth in the Eurozone is growing at its best pace in five years  nothing like  forced  lending to mitigate your depository s sub zero interest rate  And actually   tis not all that great  The Zone s confidence in the economy fell yet again last month  Speaking of sentiment   tis quite the corporate worry over in Japan  the Nikkei falling some 3 6  just yesterday  Then in the Year of the Monkey  S P on Thursday cut its rating for China s credit from stable to negative as financial and economic risks are on the increase  
So fortunately  we must be rockin  StateSide  a young sounding Top of the Hour radio news broadcaster gleefully reporting the 216 000  jobs   not  payrolls   increase in March  But her tone quickly went to one of confusion  stating in her next sentence that the rate of unemployment went up   the producer then immediately cueing the advertisement cluster   Yes  Miss  we re all confused 

What was it about a week back how Wells Capital Management s Jim Paulsen referred to stocks as being in a  bunny market   In our neck of the woods  bears eat bunnies for breakfast  Nuff said 
As again we slide into a new month  here s our strata defined Gold Structure chart in monthly bars 

So in calling it a wrap for this week   tis no April Fools  joke this  here in the Principality of California  His Serene Highness Prince Jerry is poised to put pen to parchment in the new week in signing a  15 hr  minimum wage proclamation  From the  Old Geezer Dept    back when the US money supply as measured by M2 was  1 76 trillion  vs  today s  12 61 trillion   with MBA in hand  I excitedly accepted a position in the Barclays Bank corporate lending unit here in San Francisco for a sparkling  27 000 yr  I was rich  But now let s do the math  the new  15 hr  minimum wage x 8 hours per day    120 day x 252 workdays per year    30 240 yr  To be sure  the currency debasement over those years has been nothing short of massive  but that wage  especially for the services provided  still seems like a lot of dough to me  A  30k yr  minimum wage ll buy you two one ounce Gold coins per month  Pretty good work if you can get it

189601,411117,NEM,Surging Mining Stocks Point To Big Move Ahead In Gold And Silver,opinion,"Spring has sprung for precious metals mining stocks  The HUI gold stocks index surged 6 2  on Monday to close at a 14 month high and today brings even more gains  The HUI chart shows a strong base was built from last summer through this January  and from that base a new bull market has begun 

Industry major Barrick Gold  NYSE ABX  has seen its share price more than double year to date  leading precious metals mining equities as a group to become by far the top performing sector of 2016  As the bull market matures  we can expect leadership to switch from the majors to the mid tier producers  then on down to the junior explorers 
Eventually  the stocks will get ahead of their underlying fundamentals  as is always the case in momentum driven markets  Investors will then find greater value and stability in the physical metals  Physical precious metals will at some point take center stage and outperform the miners 
For now  the miners are taking the lead and blazing a path higher for the metals markets  Gold mining stocks often serve as a leading indicator for gold prices 
Of course  on any given day  the share prices of miners can move based on business or market peculiarities that are wholly unrelated to spot gold  But when gold equities trend upward in a significant way  as they have so far this year  we can infer that some big money investors are betting on a big recovery in gold prices  It s the gold price  after all  that is the biggest factor in most miners  prospects for realizing profits 
But it would be a huge mistake for investors to treat gold silver mining  streaming  and exploration companies as if they were proxies for the metals themselves  Physical precious metals are an entirely separate asset class  A gold or silver coin can t go bankrupt  A mining company can go bust for any number of reasons   poor management  an environmental disaster  a credit crisis  etc  Money Metals columnist David Smith has detailed all the risks for our readers 
Historically  investors in mining companies have suffered through extreme booms and busts with little on net to show for the punishment they ve endured  In fact  gold stocks have vastly underperformed gold spot prices over the past couple decades  Gold prices trade more than three times higher today than they did 20 years ago  Yet the HUI  despite its recent run up  actually trades slightly lower today than it did back in April 1996 
Let s consider a recent 10 year period  From 2006 through the end of 2015  10 full calendar years   gold gained 104   Gold prices finished 2015 well below their 2011 highs  But if you bought in 2006  you still made money  If you bought a basket of gold stocks  in 2006  you lost money   most of it  in fact  From 2006 through 2015  the HUI shed a whopping 60  of its value  Ouch 
Those who bought gold stocks as a proxy for gold learned a tough lesson  During favorable up cycles for gold mining equities  they can potentially deliver outsized gains compared to gold itself  But during unfavorable periods  the downside for the stocks is much more severe than it is for the bullion 
Only the metal itself has a long term track record of maintaining purchasing power 
Only precious metals in physical form are money 
Only gold  silver  and other hard assets serve as hedges against the risks inherent in the financial system 
That s not to say that mining stocks don t have a place in a diversified investment portfolio  They can certainly deliver big returns when market conditions are favorable  Some of the majors  such as Barrick  Goldcorp  NYSE GG   and Newmont  NYSE NEM   even pay small dividends 
But do you buy into mining stocks now  after a lot of these names have already doubled off their lows  given the sector s track record of producing more disappointment than profits  It s a question you as an investor will have to answer for yourself  taking into consideration your own objectives and risk tolerance 
If you re looking for an undervalued investment that has similar upside potential as mining stocks but less downside risk  plus all the attributes of a tangible attributes of a hard asset  then consider physical silver 
The silver market appears to be gaining momentum  but spot prices remain well below their highs from last year  The gold silver price ratio remains elevated at 79 1  As recently as 2011  gold sold for 32 times the price of silver  and historically it has often sold for 16 times or even as low as 10 times the silver price 
What will cause the spread between gold and silver to narrow  Most likely a big move upward in silver prices  The silver market opened this morning just above  16 00 oz  surpassing its high mark for the year  After being compressed for many months within a trading range  the silver market now sits like a coiled spring on the verge of breaking out 

Opportunities to buy major breakouts into new bull markets don t come along often  If you regret missing the big rally this year in the miners  now s your chance to catch the better part of what could be an equally impressive follow up bull run in silver ",2016-04-12,Stefan Gleason,https://www.investing.com/analysis/surging-mining-stocks-point-to-big-move-ahead-in-gold-and-silver-200124851,200124851
189602,411118,NEM,4 Stocks To Watch Today  FPRX  MDVN  OCUL  WB,opinion,"It was a difficult day on Wall Street  and I m wondering if some of the earnings reports  gap downs  and a late  bad close could acerbate it into something worse here  I think we re due  The question is  did we get any downside follow through  Some of the Nasdaq 100 generals  along with many others  were lower after hours  so Friday may be a difficult session  particularly just before the weekend  There are still some stocks that we follow that are acting well  so let s take a look at some of those

189619,411135,NEM,Why Gold Is Undervalued,opinion,"The market price of gold would be considerably higher if it wasn t for the massive stock dilution and debt in the gold mining industry  Basically  the gold mining industry issued billions of new shares and debt to help replace production and to compensate for rising costs  Thus  investors of gold mining stocks got raped so the market could enjoy an artificially lower gold price 
Nothing like Free Market Capitalism at work 
Top 5 Gold Producers  Production vs Shares
If we look at the data from the top five gold producers since 2000  we can see a very interesting trend  In 2000  these top gold producers  Barrick Gold Corporation  N ABX   Newmont Mining Corporation  N NEM   Anglogold Ashanti Ltd  N AU   GoldFields and Goldcorp Inc  N GG   had 1 39 billion shares outstanding  while their total production was 23 6 million ounces  Moz  

Now compare that to year ending 2014  where combined production for the group declined to 20 9 Moz while total outstanding shares increased to a staggering 3 65 billion  shown in the chart as 3 652 million shares   Since 2000  these top five gold companies increased their shares total shares by 2 2 billion while total production declined by 2 7 Moz 
This next chart shows the increase of outstanding shares for each gold mining company 

 GG  GoldCorp  GFI  GoldFields  ABX  Barrick  NEM  Newmont  AU  AngloGold 
Here is a breakdown for the increase in shares for each since 2000 
Barrick    769 million shares
GoldCorp    657 million shares
GoldFields    332 million shares
Newmont    332 million shares
AngloGold    191 million shares
What has taken place in the top gold mining industry is a simple  profits alone could not fund new projects  replacement production  or increased costs  so the industry raped shareholder value  Here s another way to look at this wonderful phenomenon 
If we compare total annual gold production versus outstanding shares  this is the result 

In 2000  these top five gold companies averaged 59 2 shares for each ounce of gold produced  However  in 2014 this increased nearly three times to 174 7 shares per gold ounce produced  Which means  stock investors got hoodwinked into financing the gold mining industry as profits alone were unable to do so 
And if you think that is bad   it get s even worse 
Top Gold Companies Increased Debt To Fund Production
Not only did these gold mining companies issue a lot more shares to fund their operations   they also added a lot of debt 

As we can see in the chart above  total debt  liabilities  for these top gold companies was  7 2 billion in 2000 compared to a staggering  58 5 billion in 2014  If we apply simple math we have the following   
Top 5 Gold Companies Debt per oz of gold produced 
2000    305 debt  gold oz produced
2014    2 800 debt  gold oz produced
What a change   aye   These top gold producers held just  305 in debt for each ounce of gold they produced in 2000  however this skyrocketed to  2 800 of debt per ounce in 2014  That s a lot of debt 
Imagine the real cost to produce gold if these top mining companies did not issue 2 2 billion more shares or increase their debt more than eight times over the same time period  Thus  the market price of gold is artificially lower due to massive share dilution and colossal debt 
Investors purchasing gold  and silver  will be handsomely rewarded when the public finally realizes that they are holding onto debts masquerading as assets  This is when the true store of wealth value of gold and silver are realized ",2015-12-31,Steve St. Angelo,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold-undervalued-due-to-massive-stock-dilution---debt-378244,378244
189620,411136,NEM,Out With The Gold And In With The  Stock Market  Screw,opinion,"That title pretty much sizes up where we are in transiting to the new year  As was the case in 2013 and 2014  Gold throughout 2015 continued to be outed  disparaged and impugned  we now see 2016 as the year the general equities markets get screwed  This new dawn shall remind us that the stock market is hardly a savings account  and with a little luck  Gold might just gain back that which it richly deserves   thank you Aretha    R E S P E C T   Find out what it means to me as we re to be interviewed next Saturday  09 January on Toronto s 50 000 watt flamethrower  Talk Radio AM640 in the 1 00pm EST hour  Check your local Internet listings and click on the word  Listen   Out with the old  S P 500  and in with the new  Gold   Sounds good to me 
 Look  meanwhile is the operative word as we go to 2015 s carnage in displaying the BEGOS Markets Standings and comparing them with the Dollar Index    which despite increasing in M2 supply by 6 3   from  11 66 trillion to  12 39 trillion     nonetheless managed to increase in value by 9 0   from 90 640 to 98 760   a perception sufficiently warped to warrant The Buck as the eighth wonder of the world  the more there are  the more they re worth  Might as well take your Economics 101 textbook and toss it  Worthless 

 But mmb  what you call  the EuroCurrencies  went down by almost the same amount    
Thank you  Squire  in enhancing the essence here  for quantitative easing has added to monetary supplies both across the Pond and the Pacific  The point is  we ve merely bow wow currencies playing off of one another  their only common denominator being their supplies increasing  indeed many fold so in recent decades  And the craziest part of it is  in having just updated the Gold Scoreboard s data  with a tip of the cap to the World Gold Council  as to accounting for tonnage  the Gold supply since 1980 still has not quite doubled  Price therefore ought be through the roof by now   or at least at our Scoreboard s valuation level of  2 522 oz    And that s not counting    when it comes    the  overshoot    Twill 
As for  undershoot   in and amongst one s festive feastings this past week  did you happen to catch Chicago s Purchasing Managers Index   Twas a horribly contractive 42 9  the worst reading since the very depths of the Black Swan in  08  09  What is it about which we ve been musing as regards the Federal Reserve Bank   To raise and then rescind      Perhaps to QE   For here s the Baro  you see 

And yet  we read that  Higher Rates Will Dominate Markets in 2016   Really  The Federal Open Market Committee s next squirm session is 26 27 January  Perhaps into their private inner sanctum they ought invite as a guest speaker International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde  not only does the IMF see the 2016 s global economic growth as disappointing  but beyond into the  medium term   their outlook is deteriorating  One wonders if StateSide economic optics  not the reality  are so good  that the balance of the world will simply move over here  Come on in  for oxymoronically  our borders are always open 
What s not open is the red dotted border delineating the parabolic Short trend as we next see in the chart of Gold s weekly bars  That said  Gold continues the appearance of putting in a basing pattern  last week s missive showed prior similar patterns over the last three years as having all led to rallies of better than 100 points  which were same to again kick in here  we sense would take us back up into the 1200s 

In keeping with the year over year theme  here are the percentage tracks through 2015 of Gold along with some of its key kinship   Tis interesting how they fall into two groups  in the  not too bad  division with losses ranging from  5  to  10  are Big Daddy Newmont Mining  N NEM   the royalty company Franco Nevada  N FNV   and Gold itself  in  the really bad  division with losses ranging from  32  to  38  are the Gold Bugs Index  HUI   the exchange traded fund Global X Silver Miners  N SIL   and Big Loser Goldcorp  N GG    Course  as is the wont of Precious Metals equities  upon Gold eventually getting materially up off the mat  we ought see  em in  the super soaring  division 

Moving nearer term  we ve next a couple of dual panel graphics  beginning with Gold  for which on the left are its daily bars for the last three months along with the presently stalled  Baby Blues  in their measure of 21 day linear regression trend consistency  whilst on the right is the 10 day Market Profile  As noted earlier  the appearance of price s basing  left  continues  however  twould be put to the test should the denoted 1054 trading supporter  right  bust 

As for Sister Silver  her  Baby Blues   left  appear as in gallop of late  but per her Market Profile  right   she s lying low in the saddle  Either way  she s certainly got a hitch in her giddy up   

So to the sobering sight of the Big Picture  Here s our characterized chart of Gold s structure  that one character near the bottom persisting to appear as pleased as punch  He ll be given his due screw  in due course 

And speaking of screw  per the title s cue   tis our view to maintain one s value  Remember the S P s fallout of further than  50  in  01  02  Or its even faster failure by more than  50  in  08  09  Recall in a recent missive our noting that the S P cannot rationally go any higher than  tis  2015 proved that 
The level of earnings suggest the S P  ought be  half    at best    its present level of 2044   Course  the debasement of currencies suggests Gold  ought be  double    at least    its present level of 1061  Means regression can be both butt ugly and a beautiful thing  And 2016 is ripe for regression  down for the S P and up for Gold  Write it down  Write as well to your money manager  inquiring as to the type of stock market downside insurance that has already been put in place for you   i e  inverse exchange traded funds  put options  short futures positions   or if instead they ll just worry about it  if it happens  and join the panicking fray  given that misery loves company

189621,411137,NEM,Yen  US Stagflation Push Gold Higher,opinion,"The US dollar has begun 2016  by staging a horrific technical meltdown against the Japanese yen 

That s a five year chart of the US dollar versus the Japanese yen  The main uptrend line has just been smashed 
Ominously  there s also a large head and shoulders top pattern in play  Major FOREX players often base their COMEX gold trades on the action of the dollar against the yen  and the current situation indicates a massive rally in gold may be about to begin 

That s the eight hour bars gold chart  and it looks superb 
A week ago  I suggested gold needed to stage a modest but immediate decline  to form the right shoulder of a double headed inverse head and shoulders bottom pattern 
That technical event occurred  on cue   and now the price has staged a tentative upside breakout above the down sloping neckline  Against the background of the dollar s horrific action against the yen  gold has staged a  gangbuster  start to 2016 
Gold typically sells off into each US jobs report  and the next one is scheduled for release this Friday  at 8 30AM 
Between today and Friday  traders and investors alike should be confident buyers of any softness in the gold price  It s also possible that the FOREX traders ignore the US jobs report  and keep their focus on the dollar versus the yen price action  In that case  there may not be any traditional sell off going into this jobs report  but a continuation of the rally after the report is released 

One of the most important fundamental events of 2016 in the gold market is the launch of the Shanghai Gold Exchange  SGE  gold benchmark 
The launch could occur in April  and it s possible that India cuts its gold import duty around the same time  This is very bullish for gold 

While gold  the mightiest of metals  is off to a flying start for 2016  things are certainly looking  less than rosy   for the US stock market  The Dow is fighting to hold the key 17 000  line in the sand  zone  I think it will lose that battle  and lose it badly 
A meltdown appears to be imminent  and many institutional investors base their decisions for the year  on how the US stock market performs during the first week of trading 
I predicted that Janet Yellen would raise rates in December  and that gold would rally and the Dow would tremble  That s exactly what is happening  More rate hikes are coming  Here s why 
The US government has not reduced its debt  and seems uninterested in doing so  even with ridiculously low interest rates  The Fed gave the US government more than enough rope to hang itself  It kept rates low and engaged in a bizarre QE program  for an extended period of time 
Now  the Fed has raised rates  and it will keep raising them until the US government shows a willingness to get its financial house in order  The small business private sector has nothing to fear from higher rates  In fact  higher rates are probably going to create a bank lending boom in this part of the private sector  while the public sector goes into its greatest debt crisis in history 
Larger companies that trade on the NYSE will be affected by higher rates  That s because the stock buyback boom fueled by low interest loans is finished now  Corporate price earnings ratios were kept at moderate levels by these buybacks  and so the ratios may begin to rise quite quickly  That could cause a panic amongst stock market money managers 

Janet Yellen has repeatedly suggested that she sees signs that inflation will rise over the medium term  but GDP growth will remain sluggish 
That s a recipe for stagflation  and if banks begin moving money out of the Fed and into the private sector  the rising velocity of the US money supply could turn that stagflation into a major concern 

When stagflation appears  the risk on asset of choice is gold and silver stocks  Newmont Mining  N NEM  began the trading year with a great upside breakout  Volume increased  and that s healthy technical action 
Newmont is a  must own  investment vehicle  for any seniors oriented gold stock investor  Rather than vainly trying to call  final bottoms  and  new bull markets  for this great stock  investors can use my unique pyramid generator to systemically allocate capital into it  That ensures solid participation when the stock rallies  and keeps a reasonable amount of  dry powder   It s a win win approach to investing 

For investors who like the idea of buying a senior gold stock production company at junior prices  Harmony Gold Mining  N HMY  is ideal  The company has gold reserves in excess of 40 million ounces  and calls its Papua New Guinea joint venture with Newcrest a  game changer  
At about one dollar a share  even after staging a 100  rally  this stock is ideally priced for investors who like making money  South Africa is home to some of the world s largest reserves  and even moderately higher gold prices can turn quality miners into  cash cows   for the next several decades  South Africa s currency has declined  chopping costs for miners  and the country is a BRICS member  which bodes well for long term gold supply deals with China  Russia  and India 
I m a buyer of Harmony on every ten cent decline  I don t want to miss a single entry point  and I invite all Western gold stock enthusiasts to take a closer look at this dynamic company 
In 2016  the Iran Saudi tensions  the SGE benchmark launch  US stagflation  an India import duty chop  and a potential US government debt crisis are all very positive factors for gold and silver bullion  and related mining stocks

189622,411138,NEM,Gold Leading The Pack Through January,opinion,"Four trading weeks of the new year are now officially in the books  and as much as gold may feel lackluster to many of you   tis had but one losing week of the four  Indeed from the year s low  1061  to its high  1128  is a 6  pop in price  and as we ll below see in the BEGOS Market Standings  now that we re through January 2016  gold is leading the pack  5 4  for the year 
Still  if it doesn t really feel all that great to you  then you ve come a long way Baby  for this is why we oft say that change is an illusion whereas price is the truth  And per yesterday s  Friday s  settling out the month of January at 1118  let s face it  gold s price stinks  especially as our mathematics of tonnage supply versus StateSide currency debasement equate to a price right now of 2529  The upside row remains an ever so long one through which to hoe  but with all that we know   tis the only logical direction in which gold ought go  That said  here are the standings a month in 

Now if you think back to our final missive of last year  26 Dec   we d graphically portrayed gold as in the process of making a basing pattern    albeit within its multi year downtrend    very similar to four such prior basing patterns since 2013  all of which led to rallies well exceeding 100 points  such that this current one could well place gold back up into the 1200s  That would bode well for our 2016 target of gold reaching the upper 1200s  as we ve 11 months still in the year s balance  Not to ignore that markets are hardly unidirectional  but as we turn to gold s weekly bars and parabolic trends  this rightmost up move from December appears quite purposeful  with price this past week reaching its highest level  1128  since last 03 November  practically a three month high 

Turning the tables in putting in not just a three month low  but seemingly en route to a three year low is our tried and true Econ Baro  its present level is the lowest reading since 14 June 2013   on which day the S P 500 settled at 1627  today  tis 1940 despite decelerating growth in earnings     hint hint  nudge nudge  elbow elbow   And with all eyes on the Federal Open Market Committee this past week  pre meeting we enjoyed this headline from the venerable news institution Time   Does the Fed Have the Guts to Raise Rates    Course  I think all of us knew they d be stuck this time  round  the expected  do nothing  Policy Statement of 27 January paraphrasingly rife with  well yes  but no  still maybe   In fact  the real eye opener of the week was the Conference Board s reading on January Consumer Confidence  in month where the S P 500 was off at one point by better than 11   the confidence reading  98 1  was a four month high  Really   By golly Ethel  our savin s  er gettin  creamed  but I gots me confidence       That s nice Stan     Then come yesterday was our first look at Q4 Gross Domestic Product   0 7    Twas the third weakest reading in the past two years  As Reuters put it ahead of the data release   U S  economic growth likely braked sharply in the fourth quarter     Braked indeed  for as the Economic Barometer has displayed throughout   tis breaking 

Specific to the stock market itself  the current Dead Cat Bounce got some additional life  and notably so yesterday with the S P  2 5   its best up day since 08 September   as money poured into U S  assets upon the Bank of Japan moving a current deposits account interest rate to  0 1   From Switzerland to Sweden and now to Japan  contagious  isn t it  Indeed   twas the Dollar Index s best day in almost six weeks  Money into stocks  money into Treasuries     and money into gold as well  That s not supposed to happen  right  Quite a week there for the Land of the Rising Sun  Why even their economy minister Akira  Alarmi  Amari resigned   allegedly for under handed doings   his leaving a bit of a calamity  understatement  for Prime Minister Shinzo  Don t Go   Abe 
Meanwhile back on the Continent  the European Union is working with the Italian banking community towards selling off non performing loan portfolios   Does anyone recall the  Black Swan    Whilst across the Channel  the UK s Chancellor of the Exchequer George  n e Gideon Oliver  Osborne notes the potential for economically  bumpy times ahead  given the stumbling global business environment  Are we surprised  No 
Again turning to gold  along with several of the precious metals equities   tis ever so bumpy for the latter group as we see here via these year over year daily percentage tracks  HUI being the Gold Bugs Index  NEM being Newmont Mining  N NEM   N GG being Goldcorp  N FNV being Franco Nevada  and N SIL being the Global X Silver Miners exchanged traded fund  Albeit FNV s being a bit less robust most recently as earnings guesstimates are cast about  note the rightmost upthrust of the equities in general 

Below for the metals themselves  here first we ve gold  the daily bars of the last three months on the left with the baby blue dots of 21 day linear regression trend consistency lurching along to the upside  whilst in the 10 day Market Profile on the right we see price  1118  nicely tucked in above the broadest support beam  1117  in the stack 

And second for Sister Silver  her Baby Blues  left  have leapt upward with price finally breaking above many a hum drum week spent either side of 14  thus she s finally made it above center in the Profile  right  with 14 50 as overhead trading resistance 

This of course being a month end edition of The Gold Update  we tell it like it is via the following gold structure with our defined pricing zones  This graphic has moved from being displayed as gold by the week to gold by the month  but the  Song Remains The Same    Led Zeppelin   73   gold still stuck in this broad picture  Down Below   again with our year s goal just to get up into the upper 1200s  au sous sol  

Thus we ve January 2016 already filed away  Extrapolating gold s rise year to date using daily linear regression would put the price at 1627 on 31 December 2016  or repeating January s BEGOS leading percentage performance of  5 4  for 11 more months would bring us to 1998  How annoying  tis that gold shan t rise in a straight line  Neither can the StateSide payrolls data due next Friday  05 February    twill be the Grand Finale of a week replete with incoming Econ Data  into which the Econ Baro shall unfold  whilst one stays the course with one s gold ",2016-01-31,Mark Mead Baillie,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold-leading-the-pack-through-january-382458,382458

The first thing I heard when I got in the business  not from my mentor  was bulls make money  bears make money  and pigs get slaughtered  I m here to tell you I was a pig  And I strongly believe the only way to make long term returns in our business that are superior is by being a pig  I think diversification and all the stuff they re teaching at business school today is probably the most misguided concept everywhere  And if you look at all the great investors that are as different as Warren Buffett  Carl Icahn  Ken Langone  they tend to be very  very concentrated bets  They see something  they bet it  and they bet the ranch on it  And that s kind of the way my philosophy evolved  which was if you see   only maybe one or two times a year do you see something that really  really excites you  The mistake I d say 98  of money managers and individuals make is they feel like they got to be playing in a bunch of stuff  And if you really see it  put all your eggs in one basket and then watch the basket very carefully   Stan Druckenmiller

The way Druck generated 30  average annual returns over a period of decades was by being a pig  by putting all his eggs in one basket and watching it very carefully  Considering he may be the most successful money manager alive  you may be curious to learn what Druck is buying today 
Well  you re in luck  Druck s latest  shows that he is currently backing up the truck and loading up on gold  In the second quarter  he bought over  300 million worth making it his single largest position  He now has more than 20  of his portfolio allocated to the SPDR Gold Trust  ARCA GLD   This position is more than twice as large as his next largest holding 
Clearly  Druck feels  as I do  that it s time to get greedy in the gold market

189643,411159,NEM,Are There Any Ethical Investments In Metals And Mining ,opinion,"A significant development in recent years has been the rise of so called ethical investment funds  Every defined contribution pension plan has a small group of members who want their fund s investments to reflect their own ethical values  even if no 2 investors are likely to totally agree on what constitutes ethical and what doesn t 
Take the case of gold  there are numerous cases of environmental devastation linked to gold mining  very often linked to  but not restricted to  poisoning of water and soil with arsenic and mercury used in the extraction process 
Hello  Newmont
Yet firms such as Newmont Mining  N NEM   which has been repeatedly accused of such failures still makes it onto the Dow Jones Sustainability Index  So  if the major miners like Newmont  Rio Tinto  L RIO  and so on cannot be considered as ethical companies in part because of their size  influence over third party certification reports and legal clout whenever a protest is raised  what about smaller  artisanal miners who single source and have to work more closely with organizations such as Fairtrade and Fairmined 
According to Fairtrade International  about 100 million people worldwide earn a living from artisanal and small scale mining  Although artisanal miners produce only about 10  of the world s gold each year  they make up about 90  of the workforce in gold mining  providing important financial support for their local communities 
Artisanal  Free Range Mining
Those that work with organizations like Fairtrade are also encouraged to not use chemicals but to develop chemical free gravimetric methods for gold recovery  but most are also too small to appear on the NYSE or FTSE 
So  if not miners then  moving down the supply chain  what about refiners  Does a recycling company constitute a truly ethical metals community investment  In the case of gold  recycling already accounts for a third of the global supply and as only 9  of consumption goes into must have applications like electronics and medical equipment  much of the product from mined sources goes into jewellery and  sustained by the financial community  our longstanding belief system that there is something intrinsically valuable about the yellow metal 
Ethically Refined 
If the value to the global community of what the firm produces is any consideration  in our determination of ethical or not  then maybe refiners should feature more highly than miners 
It could be argued that metals that have high recycling rates  such as aluminum  silver  gold  the PGMs and even steel  have a lower environmental impact than those that tend to be consumed and lost at the end of life 
Often the energy use in recycling is a fraction of refining from ore  Should aluminum then be considered as an ethical metal in spite of the mind boggling amount of energy and associated greenhouse gases involved in its original refining process  simply because it has such a high recycling rate  Should electric arc furnace steel producers be favored from an investment standpoint over those going the blast furnace route 
It challenges the concept of what is an ethical investment  Certainly there are miners  refiners  recyclers and processors that operate in ways that do not exploit workers or host countries  launder money or fund corrupt regimes  but all mining has some environmental impact just as virtually all economic activity has some environmental impact 
Rather than shun the metals community in its various forms  ethical investors should embrace the least bad  those that maintain the highest standards and lending support to their share price may just help encourage the laggards to raise their game

189682,411198,NEM,Gold Miners Poised For Spectacular Recovery,opinion,"Everyone knows that this has been a devastating bear market for the gold mining sector  If you have followed our work you know that it is the second worst cyclical bear market in at least 80 years  Obviously  gold mining stocks have been crushed  Then they became cheaper  then cheaper and then really cheap  Yet we may not realize just how cheap this sector has become both in nominal and relative terms 
Below we plot the Barron s Gold Mining Index  BGMI  against gold  The BGMI dates back to 1938  The ratio recently touched its lowest level in at least 77 years  There might not be anyone alive today who has seen gold stocks this cheap relative to Gold 
The next chart plots the price to cash flow valuation for senior gold miners  Twice in the past two years it touched a low of about 5    this is even lower than during the secular bottom of 2000 when senior miners traded at 6x 7x cash flow 
Gold stocks are also historically cheap relative to book value  A year or so ago I posted a chart from Datastream  a product of Thomson Reuters that showed gold stocks trading at their lowest book value since at least 1980  You can view that   Here s  that shows the price to book ratio for the 10 largest miners  It is unsourced but shows price to book value at the lowest levels since at least 1993 
These spectacularly low valuations have resulted from arguably the second worst bear market ever  The updated bear analog chart is below 

Could gold mining stocks get even cheaper in the weeks or months ahead  It s certainly possible  but only in the scenario where gold trades to new lows  Even then  there s no guarantee that the various gold miner indices will make new lows 
While we lack data that precedes 1980  my guess is that the gold mining stocks relative to cash flow and book value are trading at valuations not seen since 1960  a secular bottom  or even earlier  In the year 2000  the gold stocks were at the end of their worst cyclical bear market in history  and worst secular bear  and were trading at a 24 year low  Valuations recently surpassed  to the downside  where they were at that epic low 
In any event  the gold mining sector is primed for what should be a spectacular recovery  A big rise in margins earnings and valuations is the one two punch that causes markets to rally substantially following a major bottom  Margins are starting to recover as evidenced by Newmont Mining s  NYSE NEM  earnings report  Miners have worked to cut costs and are now getting a boost from lower energy prices and weak local currencies 
All that remains is for metals prices to turnaround ",2015-04-24,"Jordan Roy-Byrne, CMT",https://www.investing.com/analysis/are-gold-stocks-the-cheapest-ever-249562,249562
189683,411199,NEM,What Newmont Just Did Could Be A Game Changer For Gold Miners,opinion,"The past few years have been brutal for the gold miners  most of which brought it on themselves by starting new  high cost mines just in time for the metal s price to crater  The resulting write downs and operating losses have made this without question the most unloved sector in the whole market 
The consensus among analysts has been that most miners  costs are so structurally sticky that only slight reductions will be possible  making the industry a financial basket case until gold starts rising again 
Then Newmont Mining Corporation  NYSE NEM   the second biggest gold miner    Among other startling numbers  its all in sustaining costs to produce one ounce of gold fell nearly 18 percent to  849 and its earnings rose by either 50  or 89  year over year  depending on the definition of profit being used  analysts were predicting a slight earnings decline   Free cash flow  meanwhile  soared to  344 million from the year earlier  52 million 
Over the next week or two  these results will get a thorough exam from analysts  and if they hold up they ll change the game for miners  Specifically  if it s possible to take this much out of costs without resorting to scams like high grading  where the miner uses up the best ore to goose near term results at the cost of future earnings  or fiddling with the timing of revenues and expenses  then other miners may be able to generate some pleasant surprises in coming quarters as well  And suddenly this is a happy  outperforming industry 
One indicator that this may be the case is insider buying  From Acting Man s Pater Tenebrarum 
In spite of the gold price weakening once again this week and coming dangerously close to breaking an important support zone  gold investors have actually reason to take heart  Readers may recall what we wrote in our most recent update on gold about gold mining margins 
 The market has not yet really given any credit to the fact that mining margins are improving due to strength in the real price of gold  Management boards of gold companies may be coming around to a different view though   after all  they are acutely aware that the real gold price is the only thing that counts with respect to their margins  
As data from our friends at INK Research in Canada  a highly recommended service  show  gold mining managers are indeed  acutely aware  of their improving profit margins  Insiders of several major and mid tier gold mining companies have embarked on a buying spree  Here is Barrick Gold  NYSE ABX  as an example 
 Recent insider activity at Barrick Gold  the green crosses denote purchases 
To put a few concrete numbers to this  On March 27  ABX chairman John L  Thornton bought 360 000 shares in the open market  In early March  four different board members acquired 23 200  10 200  3 200 and 30 750 shares respectively  amounts are rounded   also in the open market  It is nothing special when insiders are selling   it does however mean something when they are buying  especially when they are buying in size and seemingly without concern for short term price gyrations  Note here that the gold sector is really standing out in this respect  In most other market sectors  insiders are bailing out as fast as they can ",2015-04-26,John Rubino,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/if-other-gold-miners-can-do-what-newmont-just-did,-look-out-249598",249598
189684,411200,NEM,Gold Stocks Have Bottomed Relative To Gold,opinion,"As we penn this article gold is trading below  1180 oz and set to close at its lowest level in six weeks  Gold is less than 2  from its weekly low of  1158  It is fairly close to another technical breakdown  However  the gold mining stocks appear to be bucking the trend and showing increasing relative strength  It appears likely that the stocks have bottomed relative to the metal and maybe so in nominal terms 
Below we plot various gold miner indices against Gold  We essentially plot the juniors and large caps from both the US and Canada against  ARCA GLD   Not only have these ratios increased in recent months but they have increased in the past few weeks as gold has declined from  1220 down below  1180 
That is a very important signal of relative strength 

The price action in nominal terms would have been far more encouraging if the miners had closed near their weekly highs  The weekly candle charts for  ARCA GDX  and  ARCA GDXJ  are below  The miners are up for the week but failed to hold the majority of the gains  GDX touched  20 90  which is 7  from its 80 week moving average  If it could reach that resistance it would mark the third test in the past ten months  after previously no tests in two years   That would be a strong signal of a transition from a bear market to a bull market 

The reasons for the gold miners  relative strength are unlikely to be temporary  Sure oil has rebounded but its price remains well below the  100 barrel it averaged throughout 2011 to 2014  That is helping miners  In addition  local currency weakness has been a boon  Even though the USD index has stalled out  the gold price against foreign currencies is 20  above its December 2013 low  That helps miners operating outside of the US with some costs denominated in local currencies  Other factors to consider include the strength in the two largest gold miners  NYSE Newmont  and  NYSE Barrick  and the fact that gold stocks recently were potentially the cheapest in history 
The gold miners can continue to show relative strength but they may not rip to the upside until gold cooperates  A weekly close below  1150 oz could accelerate gold s final breakdown  On the other hand  a weekly close above  1220 would be bullish  I would actually prefer the former as it would give us real clarity to the end of the bear market and it would give us a final chance to buy miners before they explode to the upside  Consider learning more about our premium service including our current favorite junior miners  which we expect to outperform in the second half of 2015 ",2015-05-01,"Jordan Roy-Byrne, CMT",https://www.investing.com/analysis/more-evidence-gold-stocks-have-bottomed-relative-to-gold-250352,250352
189686,411202,NEM,This Serial Underperformer May Be Ready To Rip,opinion,"U S  based gold producer Newmont Mining Corporation  NYSE NEM  has been a serial underperformer in recent years with shares falling more than 70  from its late 2011 all time high to its December 2014 low  However  things may be on the verge of turning around for Newmont investors 
The stock has carved out a very clear and broad based head   shoulders bottom during the last year 

A breakout above the  27 50 resistance level should target the open gap from April 2013 up at  35 04  What s even more interesting about the recent strength in NEM is that sell side analysts remain fairly neutral on the name with the majority of price targets remaining between  26  30 share  This sell side  pessimism  is actually a bullish phenomenon given that a chart breakout will likely result in a series of late upgrades that should serve to further catalyze the rally

189687,411203,NEM,Why This Gold Bear Market Is Different,opinion,"Earlier this week  I had the pleasure to appear on Jim Puplava s Financial Sense Newshour radio program and discuss the state of the gold market  Along with my peers John Doody of the Gold Stock Analyst and Ross Hansen of Northwest Territorial Mint  I shared my thoughts on how we arrived in the current bear market  what factors might help us get out of it and the role real interest rates play in prices  Below I ve highlighted a few of my responses to Jim s questions  Q  Let s begin with the bear market that began in 2011  Two questions I d like you to answer  Number one  What do you believe caused it  Number two  Do you think this is cyclical or a secular bear market  A  As I often say  two factors drive gold  the Love Trade and the Fear Trade  In 1997 and 1998  the bottom of the emerging market meltdown took place  Four years later  we saw China and Asia starting to take off and GDP per capita rise  This is an important factor in this whole run up that I would characterize as the Love Trade  A strong correlation is rising GDP per capita  and in China  India and the Middle East  they buy gold and many gifts of love  We saw the Fear Trade starting to take place after 9 11  The biggest factor behind the Fear Trade is negative real interest rates  So when you had both negative real interest rates and rising GDP per capita in the emerging countries you had gold demand going to record numbers  At the very peak of 2011  the dollar had just been basically downgraded by Moody s and we had negative interest rates on a 10 year government bond  It was a record negative real rate of return  like in the  70s  You saw this spending from the Fear Trade  but this Love Trade was in negative real interest rates  Since then  the U S  has gone positive  But we re seeing that in Europe  gold is taking off in euro terms  and in Japan it s taking off in yen terms  They re running at negative real interest rates the way we were on a relative basis up to 2011  Q  So would you define this bear market as a cyclical bear market  a correction in a long term trend  or would you define it as secular very much in the way that we experienced the price of gold between  let s say  the 1980s and 1990s  A  I think that we re wrestling with something else  When we look at the other basic metals  what drives the demand for iron  copper  anything that makes steel  It s fiscal policies  Huge infrastructure spending and fiscal policies  What s happened since 2011 and after the crash of 2008 but particularly in 2011 is that when the G20 central bankers get together  they don t talk about trade  It s all about tax and regulation  They have to keep interest rates low to try to compete  to try to get exports up  to drive their economies  That is a big difference on the need for all these commodities  and it seems to have ended the bull market  Until we get global fiscal policies up and increase infrastructure building  then I have to turn around and look the other way  and say it s going to take a while  I do think that gold is going through a bear market  A lot of it has to do more with the central bankers and everything they try to do to discredit gold as an asset class  at the same time try to keep interest rates low to keep economic activity going strong  That s been a much different factor in driving the price of gold  The other thing that s been fascinating is this shift of gold from North America to Switzerland to China  The Chinese have a strategy for the renminbi  Not only do they have 200 million people buying gold on a monthly program throughout their banking system  but the government is buying gold because it needs to back the renminbi to make it a world class currency of trade  Q  Explain two things  one  why we never saw the hyper inflation that people thought we were going to see with the massive amounts of quantitative easing  QE   and two  investor preferences changing from hard assets into stocks  A  Well first of all  a lot of money didn t really go directly into the economy  We never had a huge spike in credit supply in 2011   12   13  Only in  14 did we start to see it really pick up  We never got this big inflation some expected because the money is so difficult  outside of getting a car loan or an extension on a house  Even Ben Bernanke  after he left the Federal Reserve  had trouble refinancing his house following his own procedures  It s extremely onerous to get a loan  I think the biggest part is to follow the money  And where is the money going  It s showing up in stocks  When I look at gold stocks  it s amazing to see that the indexes are down since 2011  but a basket of the royalty companies is positive  So why is money finding its way to them  What are the factors driving that  Well  not only do they have free cash flow  but they also have a higher profit margin and they ve been raising their dividends  Franco Nevada again just raised its dividend  Since 2011  the dividend yield on Franco Nevada and Royal Gold has been higher than a 5 year government bond and many times higher than a 10 year government bond  So money all of a sudden starts going for that yield and growth  Q  What s happened to the industry since the downturn began in 2011  A  Well  when you take a look at the big run we had until 2006  we had very strong cash flow returns on invested capital  We had expanding free cash flow  And then a lot of the mining companies lost their focus on growth on a per share basis  They kept doing these acquisitions  which made a company go from   1 billion to  2 billion in revenue   However  the cost of that meant that there was less gold per share in production and there were less reserves per share  You had this run up in the cost for equipment  for exploration  for development  The result was you had seven majors lose their CEOs  And in the junior to mid cap size  you probably had another 20 in which management was thrown out  The new management is much more focused on capital returns  They have to be  Otherwise they get criticized  That will hold a lot of these managements accountable  and I think that s very healthy  And now it s starting to show up that the returns on capital are improving for several of these companies  Q  What would you be doing with money right now if you were to be in the gold market  How much would you put in the gold market  How would you have that money invested  A  I ve always advocated 10 percent and rebalance every year  Five percent would go into gold bullion  coins  gold jewelry you travel around the world and you can buy gorgeous gold jewelry at basically no mark up compared to the mark up on Fifth Avenue  The other 5 percent is in gold stocks  and if it s a basket of these royalty companies  I think you ll do well over time  and you rebalance  If not  then you go to an active manager  like we have  Q  Explain your caution in terms of gold in the percentage you recommend  A  I ve always looked at gold as being a hedge from the imbalance of government policies  Having that 10 percent weighting and rebalancing every year might help protect your overall portfolio  There are many studies going back 30 years that show that rebalancing helps  It s also advisable to put half your money in dividend paying blue chip stocks that are increasing their revenue  When there are great years in the stock market  people often take some profits  And when gold s down  as it is now  it might be time to put money in gold and gold equities

189707,411223,NEM,Gold  Pigs  PIIGS  Bye Bye Baro     And QE IV,opinion,"Obviously pigs can fly  One need only glance up at the S P 500 s essentially correction less track over the past six years to seem  em soarin  high on pure porker power  As if a jumbo jet that can endlessly fly without requisite fuel  the pigs have provenly so done without requisite earnings  made evident by the Index having tripled since its March 2009 low with the price earnings ratio more than doubling since then   Bob Shiller s  CAPE  version going from 13 3x to 27 5x and our  live  version more than tripling from 11 6x to 35 4x  
But then I forget that in the new market paradigm of recent years  earnings growth is no longer requisite for pigs to fly high  Here s a quintessential example of why  a FinMedia radio report credited yesterday s  Friday s  stock market rise with not just the temporary EuroDebt reprieve for Greece   one of the so called PIIGS   but moreover that a certain high profile company s reporting of weaker quarterly earnings nonetheless beat estimates  That is the key  see  And in turn  Gold is the  screwee   Oh mercy me 
And lest we forget  there s the Economic Barometer   or at least what s left of it   From its recent peak 46 trading days ago on 15 December   the S P then being at 1990   the Econ Baro s cascade down through yesterday is the largest plunge over the same number of days since those ending 21 June 2012  during which time the S P dropped better than 107 points    and following which on 13 September 2012 came the announcement of Quantitative Easing III  But this time  round with an identical Econ Baro 46 day plunge  the S P has instead risen 120 points  And prior to 2012  there s been just one other period  since compiling the Econ Baro data all the way back from 1998  that we ve seen such a same magnitude  46 day plunge   
 During the 2008 credit crisis  mmb  
Exactly right  Squire  when rather than pigs flying high   twas instead The Black Swan  Fairly scary  what 
So maybe  just maybe  the Econ Baro as we see below going  bye bye  is swinging that which is the pendulum of the Federal Reserve Bank s Federal Open Market Committee from considering a rate rise to instead providing the next round of QE   They just don t realize it yet  for they are a  behind the curve  bunch   But based on the FOMC s Minutes released this past Wednesday of the 27 28 January meeting  the members may well have taken a peek at the traditionally market leading Econ Baro  which since such meeting has dropped into ever faster free fall 
 To raise  or not to raise  that is the question  Perchance to QE  

And the double entendre of using the roman numeral  IV  for the next QE is nothing short of perfect  should it continue that the economy find itself in hospital on an IV  For the present however  if anything needs an IV right now  tis Gold  its having been forced to give up the parabolic Long trend as we see below in the year over year weekly bars graphic  the rightmost red dot putting the Short trend into play 

Indeed  twas just four weeks ago that we d gotten all wound up about Gold s having cleared the 1240 1280 resistance zone  depicted by the purple lines  and were this to be a relatively average year  the voyage back up to good old Base Camp 1377 looked to be very viable   Course  still  tis  given all the pricing support shown in the above chart though the Nov 14   Jan 14 stretch  And unless the stock market is now rising because it stealthily already sees QE IV a comin   its extreme over valuation at some point shall cause the S P to crack  its negative correlation to Gold in turn shifting the yellow metal up into high gear  But as it now stands  the S P continues to get the bids whilst Gold remains on the skids  Here month over month are the percentage tracks of Gold vs  the S P  including  at the request of a highly valued reader   Newmont Mining  NYSE NEM  s bucking Gold s most recent struggles  the arguably  mother of all miners  indeed year to date being  35    the bulk of which came during January  

Still  one cannot underestimate the uplifting equities effect of another QE  Remember that hot ABBA hit from 1979 entitled  Gimme  Gimme  Gimme  
This FinMedia piece from the past week puts  Gimmie QE  in perfect perspective   German investor confidence rose to the highest level in a year in February  buoyed by the imminent arrival of fresh central bank stimulus    i e   We don t need no stinkin  earnings   
And again  what of the EuroZone s ongoing cohesion given the state of its PIIGS  Yes  Greece as noted has been given four months to sort out its bailout woes  but were it to fail so do  German finance minister Wolfgang  The Sly Guy  Sch uble says that  alas  Hellas shan t receive further funding  That in turn ought make it the first of the heavily indebted PIIGS dominoes to fall  albeit Greece is quite small  its GDP at  242B is comparable to Apple s total assets of  231B   and given a market capitalization currently of  754B  perhaps Tim Cook could simply arrange to buy Greece and thereby establish it as their Eastern Hemisphere node of operations     just a thought   The balance of the PIIGS brethren are ostensibly doing a bit better  but at the end of the day  debt begets debt  just look at our side of the pond   debt begets debasement  debasement depletes wealth  and aren t you lucky you ve held onto your Gold    
Most recently Gold has swung from being technically overbought to now having become technically oversold  at least by these like three month measures in the next two panel graphic  On the left is our classic measure of Gold vis   vis its smooth pearly value line borne of price movement relative to same in the primary BEGOS Markets  Bond   Euro  Gold  Oil  S P   Beneath the chart in the oscillator  price less value   the current level of  50 points is typically as low as Gold reaches below value  barring strong selling which we re simply not seeing this time  round  On the right is our measure of Gold vis   vis its Market Magnet  which is the 10 day contract volume weighted price average  1225   clearly by its oscillator  price less Magnet   price cannot stray too far from its magnet  hence the name   such that the current  22 level suggests some snap back upward is in order 

Now to this next two panel portrayal  This time on the left we ve the last three months of Gold s daily bars along with the  Baby Blues  that record 21 day linear regression trend consistency  the blue dots essentially reaching as low as they can go  further price deterioration would find them from this point crawling across the floor  but given the more volatile swinging in price these days  again a move back northward would seem more likely  Then on the right we ve Gold s 10 day Market Profile   the data from which is used to construct the Market Magnet that we just viewed   the labeled apices are those prices seeing the heaviest contract volume and thus represent trading support and resistance levels  Gold twice tested 1197 this past week  on Wednesday and Friday   scampering back above 1200 on both occasions  Indeed  Gold has not settled but one day in the 1100s so far this year  that being on its first trading day  02 January   similarly  it has settled but one day in the 1300s  22 January  

Given there not having been strong volume conviction in Gold s pulling back during these last several weeks   tis time for the tide to flow  rather than ebb  toward regaining some upside ground  In fact for those of you scoring at home  Gold s  expected weekly trading range  is currently 46 points  thus were the enusing week s low to hold right here around 1200  we may find the high in turn to come in right around the base of the 1240 1280 resistance zone  Which leads us to the first of these three quick hits as we call it week 
1  Incoming Econ Data  next week brings up a substantive  back loaded  stint of it including our second look at Q4 GDP  estimates have it closer to being just 2  versus the initial 2 6  reading issued back on 30 January  which in turn was basically half of the 5 0  final reporting for Q3  Thus we are potentially about to see a swing in a single quarter s growth from 5  down to 2   that s a 60  growth reduction

189708,411224,NEM,A Glimmer Of Hope For Long Suffering Gold Bulls,opinion,"As most of you who ve followed me over the years already know  I m not really expecting a final three year cycle low in the CRB  the commodities Index  until later in the year  However  there are a few signs popping up that could be indicating that a 3 year cycle low is going to come earlier than expected  And by earlier I mean it may have already occurred 
First I want to talk a little bit about oil  I think everyone knows by now that the fundamentals for oil are completely broken  There is simply too much supply  and price will never be able to rise by any significant amount anytime in the near future  I m starting to see outrageous predictions of  20 oil  However  that is exactly the kind of sentiment I would expect to see at a three year cycle low 
Moving on to some long term charts  you can see that the CRB has reached the kind of oversold levels indicative of a major three year cycle low  By some measures the CRB is more oversold than either of the last two major cyclical bottoms in 2009 and 2012 

Clearly the main driver forcing commodities lower is that the dollar has been in a seven year bull market  However  seven years is just about a normal duration for a dollar bull  and as you can see in the chart below  the dollar has retraced 50  of the previous decline  which is coincidentally the same retracement that the previous bull accomplished prior to a bear market  Note the extreme overbought conditions on the monthly chart  With interest rates at virtually 0  and little incentive to raise them in the near future  one has to wonder how much upside is left in this bull 

The last thing that anyone is expecting right now would be for the dollar s three year cycle to top in a left translated fashion on month 10  I think everyone is expecting the dollar and euro to go to par sometime this year  as am I   I just wonder if it might do the exact opposite and catch everyone on the wrong side of the boat 

And yes I know  my expectation has been for a counter trend move early in the year followed by one more drop into a three year cycle low in the summer or early fall  And that does still remain the most likely scenario 

However  the mining stocks  and energy stocks  have not been behaving like they usually do during an intermediate degree decline  and that has me wondering if gold didn t possibly make a final bottom back in November  and is leading the CRB s 3 year cycle low by a couple of months  just like it did in 2009  As a matter of fact  the weekly chart of the gold bugs index  the HUI  is exhibiting a number of bullish patterns 
Notice how the recent correction has formed as a bull flag instead of the usual close back below the 10 week moving average and acceleration downward that we typically see during an intermediate degree correction  As a matter of fact  the miners tacked on 4  this week and closed back above the 10 week moving average  Several of the majors like Newmont  NYSE NEM  and Barrick Gold  NYSE ABX  have broken out to new highs  That is a bit unusual during an intermediate degree decline  Usually  once the mining stocks lose the 10 week moving average  it doesn t get recovered again until after a final intermediate bottom forms  Also notice that the recent low held support at 180 

I think this coming week is going to go a long way towards clearing up whether we are just looking at a weak bounce out of a daily cycle low  to be followed by another leg lower  or whether gold may have just printed a slightly shortened intermediate cycle low  I ll explain in a minute   If the HUI can close strongly above 200 by next Friday and survive the employment report I m going to start leaning in favor of the short ICL scenario 

Now let me explain what I m looking at as it pertains to gold and the possible short ICL  To begin with  my preferred scenario is still the bearish one where gold rallies just far enough to break its cycle trend line and then continues down into an ICL in the normal timing band for that event  still 5 6 weeks away  
In this scenario resistance in the 1250 ish zone would turn gold back down  That 1250 zone is going to be an important milepost this week  If gold makes it through that level then the short ICL scenario is going to gain a lot of traction 

Now for the bullish scenario  As most of you know  in order to confirm an ICL an asset has to break its intermediate trend line  Surprisingly  gold did that  at least marginally  this week  Granted  this could mean that the intermediate decline has only just begun and after a weak bounce gold will continue down into a final ICL in the normal timing band for that event  complete with a bloodbath phase  Or  it could be that gold dipped just far enough to complete the broken trend line requirement  and then formed a shortened intermediate cycle low 

This could turn out to be the case as the dollar starts to move down into its own intermediate cycle low in the weeks ahead  If gold resumes its normal inverse relationship with the dollar  then it could be that gold printed a short ICL and the low probability bullish scenario will come to fruition 

So  this coming week I want to see how gold handles resistance at  1250  and how quickly it gets there  If gold were to reach that  1250 level by Tuesday or Wednesday it would increase the odds of breaking through that resistance zone  But even more important  I want to see how the miners perform in the coming week  If the miners end the week with another 5 to 7  gain  and survive the employment report  that is indicative of a new intermediate cycle rally beginning  rather than a counter trend bounce in an overall intermediate decline 
A word of caution  I don t want to get everyone s hopes up too much  and definitely do not start buying call options willy nilly  as the bear scenario is still by far the most likely outcome  Shortened ICL s are rare  but they do happen from time to time  That being said  the miners are not acting like they have previously  during intermediate declines  And that warrants at least a small bit of cautious optimism  Like I said  a small glimmer of hope for the long suffering gold bulls ",2015-03-01,Gary Savage,https://www.investing.com/analysis/a-glimmer-of-hope-243442,243442
189709,411225,NEM,Rate Hikes  Bullish For Gold Stocks,opinion,"The latest US jobs report has stunned most analysts  with its dramatic weakness  Most investors in the Western gold community are nervous about rate hikes and this report supposedly gives the average gold investor a little breathing room 
I beg to differ  In the current situation  rate hikes are not bearish for gold prices  They re bullish  and here s why 
The Western commercial banks are sitting on huge reserves of cash  They built those during the Fed s QE program  Money supply increased  but velocity decreased  because low rates hinder bank profits  That created deflation 
Deflation has continued  because the banks have no incentive to loan out their enormous cash reserves  but I think Janet Yellen plans to change that situation 
Many economists think potential rate hikes are a result of the Fed responding to  strong US growth   There s no question that the US is in an upcycle  but productivity is at 1930s levels in the private sector  and much lower in the huge government sector  It s important to understand the difference between economic recovery  and a simple upcycle  The US is experiencing the latter 
Some analysts think rates will rise simply because the Fed needs the ability to cut rates in the next down turn 
I think both of these rate hike views are 100  wrong  Janet Yellen is not a hawk  She s a dove  and doves seek higher inflation  The only sure way to create higher inflation is to increase the velocity of the money supply 
That velocity can only be achieved  realistically  through an increase in bank loan activity  Bank loans will only increase if the banks can make large profits from them  The bottom line  Rate hikes are coming  but the main purpose of them is to increase money supply velocity 
During a system risk event  money managers rush to T bonds and gold bullion  as they did when the Fed implemented QE1 during the 2008 meltdown 
In contrast  when inflation is created without system risk  money managers tend to focus on  gold stocks 

Analysts at CNBC have a slightly different view of rate hikes than I do  but they are correctly focused on wage price inflation 
Unknown to these mainstream analysts  the elephant in the inflationary room  is the giant  QE money ball  that the banks are sitting on  When rates rise  the banks will likely begin a gargantuan lending spree  Rather than tempering inflation  Janet s rate hikes should exponentially accelerate it 
As that happens  I expect institutional money managers to reduce US stock and bond market positions  and purchase gold stocks 

That s the daily chart for Barrick Gold  NYSE ABX   and it looks superb 
Most investors are focused on the  1220 area for bullion  but I think the Barrick chart is now the lead indicator for the entire precious metals market 
Newmont Mining Corporation  NYSE NEM  lead the first rally of 2015 for gold stocks  but Barrick is now poised to take the leadership baton  and lead most gold stocks and bullion  to higher prices 
Watch the  13 30 area on that Barrick chart very carefully  A move above that level could ignite a powerful rally in ETFs like  ARCA GDX    NYSE SIL  and  ARCA GDXJ  
Gold stock enthusiasts should book light profits in Barrick at  13   14   15   16  and  17  They can use my unique pyramid generator to do that systematically 

That s the daily gold chart  If Barrick can surge above  13 30  I think gold will quickly rise to  1255  and maybe to  1300 

That s the hourly bars chart  A hedge in the yard needs to be pruned  Likewise  some gold market profits need to be booked on rallies  So  I sold a bit of gold at  1217  as it rallied towards overhead HSR  horizontal support and resistance  in the  1220 area 
Gold s short term softness could continue today  It may trade down to about  1203  and perhaps to  1195  Regardless  as the rally in gold stocks accelerates  I expect gold to successfully move above  1223  and rise to my next profit booking targets at  1240 and  1255 
Silver tends to outperform gold during rallies  Do silver stocks tend to outperform gold stocks  I don t think so  In my experience  silver stocks tend to perform about as well as gold stocks do during metals sector rallies 
Simply put  investors who like gold should own gold stocks  Investors who like silver should own silver stocks  It s not a question of one asset outperforming another  so much as it is about personal feelings for gold or silver 

That s the daily chart for Global X Silver Miners  NYSE SIL   the silver stocks ETF  The blue downtrend line is now support  My suggestion is to book light profits on trading positions at  9 27   9 67   10 33  and  10 82  Use Barrick s price action as a key lead indicator for silver stocks  and be prepared for rate hikes to create a shocking rise in money velocity  and inflation

189722,411238,NEM,Gold Miners Look Ready To Jump,opinion,"Gold has been one of the year s most hated commodities  Gold is also viewed by many as a currency  After all  gold cannot be printed or created by the click of a button like most fiat currencies  For the first time in a long time  the leading gold mining stocks are looking primed for a sharp move higher 
Below  5 reasons why gold mining stocks look poised for a major rally in the near term 

The leading gold mining stock stages a sharp upside reversal day on October 8th  2014  The Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF  ARCA GDX  surged higher on 114 million shares after making a fresh three year low  When high volume reversal days occur from new multi year lows it is a bullish technical chart formation  An upside reversal in the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF tells the chart reader that someone wanted gold down there and indicates conviction buying  This pattern will generally lead to near term upside 
It should be note that gold and gold mining stocks have been trading inversely to the USD JPY currency pair  As the USD JPY sells off or pulls back this should benefit the precious metals and the gold mining sector  Recently  the USD JPY has pulled back from the  110 00 level to  107 33  Traders and investors should note that gold has started to rally as this currency pair has sold off  Please remember  the USD JPY has been the carry trade that has fueled the U S  equity market since early 2012 
Many of the leading gold mining companies have to hedge their bets as a gold producer  In other words  the leading gold mining companies are often shorting gold  betting against gold  to protect themselves in a declining gold market  Should the leading gold mining companies start to close out those hedging positions it could actually inflate the price of gold in the near term  Remember  in 2010 and 2011 there were very few gold mining companies hedging their bets as gold was soaring to new all time highs 
Should consolidation start to take place in the industry group it should lead to higher prices for the leading gold mining stocks  Recently  the leading gold company Newmont Mining Corporation  NYSE NEM  was in talks to be bought out by Barrick Gold Corporation  NYSE ABX   but talks stalled out  With such cheap money still available in the market place it only makes sense that gold mining companies would be looking to merge and consolidate  Traders can easily see how well the airline stocks have done once they consolidated that industry group 
Foreign countries such as China and India are reportedly buying tonnes of gold  It should be noted that China and India are two of the largest countries in the world  Each country has a population of more than one billion people  This one fact alone could keep a bid in gold for quite a while  It should also be noted that the recent weakness in the European Union and the downgrade of France could have people running for a tangible currency ",2014-10-13,Nicholas Santiago,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold-miners-look-ready-to-jump-228888,228888
189723,411239,NEM,Don t Be Spooked by Market Volatility   Opportunity is Still Knocking ,opinion,"One of the greatest fears this October possibly the most volatile month of the year has been the correlation between the S P 500 Index s ascent in the first three quarters of the year and the possible ramifications of the end of quantitative easing  QE    It s well known that Japan and Singapore have been buying their countries  blue chip stocks with their excessive money printing  Today  about 1 8 percent of the Japanese market is owned by the Bank of Japan  American investors fear the Federal Reserve might do the same and take away the punch bowl  so to speak  As you can see  the S P 500 Index has been rising in tandem with government securities  and it s uncertain what will happen when QE ends   The Ebola epidemic has also contributed toward moving the needle to the fear side of the spectrum and driven investors to seek shelter not in gold necessarily but in so called  Ebola stocks   For every negative  as tragic as they often are  there is a positive  When a major hurricane hits Florida  for instance  insurance stocks fall while real estate stocks rise  The deadly Ebola virus  on top of an aging demographic  has helped make health care and biotechnology pop this year  The Daily Reckoning s  in fact  calls this rally  the biggest biotech market ever   Possibly  Before we get too excited  let s look at the numbers  Over the last 10 years  the S P 500 Biotechnology Index has had a rolling 12 month percentage change of  23  As of this writing  the index is up 32 percent  meaning it s up by only 1 3 standard deviation  In other words  biotech is behaving approximately within its expected range  Gold bullion  over the same period  has had a percentage change of  19 not so dramatically different from biotech and is down by 1 3 standard deviation  Again  this is  normal  behavior  As you can see  biotech corrected and then rallied firmly into the sell zone  Seventy percent of the time  it s normal for the asset class to rise and fall one standard deviation  As I always say  each asset class has had its own DNA of volatility over the last 10 years  Knowing this helps you  of how they perform  Even health care and biotech companies not actively working toward finding treatments and vaccines for the virus seem to have incidentally benefited from the rally  California based Gilead Sciences Inc  NASDAQ GILD  and New Jersey based Celgene Corporation  NASDAQ CELG   for instance both of which we own in our All American Equity Fund and Holmes Macro Trends Fund and were named by Motley Fool as two of the four most important stocks of the last 16 years have hit all time highs  Gilead Sciences concentrates mostly on drug therapies for HIV and hepatitis B  while Celgene conducts similar work for cancer and inflammatory disorders    And it s not just American health care stocks that are doing well  We ve been impressed lately with the performance of the Stock Exchange of Thailand Health Care Index and Bangkok Dusit Medical Services  Thailand s largest private hospital operator  which we hold in our  Both the index and the equity have excelled year to date  delivering 57 percent

1 310 to  1 190  It soon rebounded in the days leading up to Diwali  Gold stocks  on the other hand  have yet to recover  Since the end of August  the ARCA Gold BUGS has plunged 25 percent to lows we haven t seen since April 2005  The Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF  ARCA GDXJ  has lost nearly 30 percent  the Philadelphia Gold and Silver Index  XAU   25 percent  On a few occasions  that in the last 30 years  the XAU has never experienced a losing streak of more than three years  As of this writing  it s lost close to 17 percent  with only two months left  The cards are definitely stacked against the XAU  but I remain optimistic it can continue the trend     Many investors are understandably concerned that mining companies in West Africa will suffer because of Ebola  Several

189724,411240,NEM,Flash Crash In The Goldies,opinion,"After a relatively placid afternoon of oscillating in the  19 70  19 90 range  the  1 trading vehicle for gold producers  the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF  ARCA GDX   experienced a  flash crash  during the final minute of yesterday s trading session 


5 million shares traded during the final minute of yesterday s session which included  which saw price fall as low as  17 72  
This  flash crash  was clearly a GDX specific event because none of the major components of this exchange traded fund  Barrick Gold  NYSE ABX   Goldcorp  NYSE GG   Newmont Mining  NYSE NEM   etc   experienced anything even close to the volume and price action in GDX  In after hours trading GDX has already recovered almost all of its flash crash losses 

Whoever executed the 1 25 million share order in the 2 second burst cost themselves roughly  800 000 by my calculations  While these  flash crashes  have become rather commonplace in the current market environment  the fact that it occurred during the final minute of trading makes it a bit more unusual  It will be interesting to see if any additional information comes out regarding this odd trade ",2014-12-04,Tommy Humphreys,https://www.investing.com/analysis/flash-crash-in-the-goldies-234607,234607
189725,411241,NEM,Oil s Plunge Helps Miners  Earnings,opinion,"The massive decline in the price of crude oil turns out to be a significant net positive for multinational miners  Not only are the lower oil costs a huge positive on the costs side  but the resulting currency moves  big drops in AUD USD and CAD USD  also turn out to benefit miners whose revenue comes in US Dollars and primary expenses are paid in Australian Canadian dollars or other currency that has depreciated against the US dollar  there are many  
As can be seen by the following slide from Newmont Mining Corporation  NYSE NEM  and an investor presentation from Rio Tinto  NYSE RIO   these companies are saving a tremendous amount on the cost side  which flows right into higher free cash flow  FCF  

Newmont will have roughly an additional  140 million in FCF during 2015 if oil stays around  60 barrel  everything else remaining the same   Newmont also benefits from a weaker Australian dollar  A   as it is a US based company with Australian mining operations  roughly a  100 million per year currency benefit from the drop in the A    

Considering that RIO is forecasting 330 million tonnes of iron ore production during 2015  this translates to roughly  500 million in cost savings 
RIO is also gaining a large currency benefit from the weaker Australian and Canadian dollars 

At current currency exchanges rates  AUD USD  83 and CAD USD  87  RIO stands to accrue an additional   560 million annual earnings benefit  
In summary  the pressure on the commodities space is definitely a headwind facing global miners  However  the greatly reduced energy costs and currency benefits serve to cushion the blow for miners with operations in countries with weakening currencies  Australia  Canada  Mexico  etc    Now all the Copper Gold miners want for Christmas is a resumption of the metals bull market

189730,411246,NEM,4 Reasons  1200 Is Significant For Gold,opinion,"Gold posted an impressive one day gain on Friday and is once again closely gravitating to the  1200 oz level 

The  1200 level holds significance for a number of reasons as we enter the final 3 trading sessions of 2014 
The 2013 closing price for gold was  1204 80   whenever a market is ending near the flat line for the year it often serves as a magnet for price  we saw this in the S P 500 at the end of 2011  
There is a huge volume by price bar at the  1200 level which highlights how much volume has been traded around this level during the past several months 
The 50 day simple moving average  SMA  and recent downtrend came in just shy of  1200 on Friday   a push above  1200 early this coming week would break the recent downtrend and a close above the 50 day SMA would be the first annual close above this key daily moving average since 2010 
 1200 is a sensitive all in cost level for many gold producers with   NYSE NEM  going so far as to link its dividend payouts to gold prices averaging above  1200 oz 

The final 3 trading days of 2014 should be very interesting for gold investors and traders  the final few days of the calendar year have not been kind to the yellow metal in recent years  however  January offers very strong seasonality for gold ",2014-12-27,Tommy Humphreys,https://www.investing.com/analysis/4-reasons-$1200-is-significant-for-gold-236866,236866
189750,411266,NEM,The Gold Projects You Want To Own Now ,opinion,"Joe Mazumdar is the Director of Research and a Senior Mining Analyst at  here in Vancouver  He has a particularly interesting perspective on the mining sector  having spent the majority of his early years at large companies including  Mount Isa Mines  Australia   Rio Tinto  NYSE RIO   Argentina   Phelps Dodge  Phoenix  USA  and Newmont Mining Corporation  NYSE NEM   Denver  CO  where his last position was as the Director of Strategic Planning  Joe has been a sell side analyst for over four years now  with Haywood Securities for 3 years prior to Canaccord  
I had a chance to sit down with him recently in Canaccord Genuity s downtown Vancouver offices 
The GDXJ Index 
Joe was keen to speak to me about the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners  ARCA GDXJ  Index which has become somewhat well known in the investment community for benchmarking the performance of junior precious metals equities 
The GDXJ  Joe tells me  is an ETF whose objective is to replicate the performance of the Market Vector s Junior Gold Miner s Index  The Index is composed of junior mining companies whose flagship assets derive their value from precious metals  86  gold  14  silver  and where the majority are considered producers   70   
The majority  80  by weight  of the companies within the GDXJ are Canadian listed and have a market cap below CAD 1 billion  Only 15  of the companies fall below the CAD 200 million market cap level  The flagship assets of the companies held within the GDXJ are primarily located in the Americas  55    with the next important geographic centers being Asia Pacific  24   and West Africa  15   
GDXJ provides the most realistic measure of performance for the junior gold space  currently  
 It  the GDXJ index  is the best proxy as it s liquid  rebalances quarterly and is geopolitically diversified   the senior analyst explains 

Joe benchmarks his precious metals picks  which include  Asanko Gold  Castle Mountain Resources  Dalradian Resources  Golden Queen  Goldrock Mining  Midway Gold  Orezone  Roxgold  among others  against the GDXJ and looks for companies that can provide asymmetrical returns 
 We look for names that do at least as well as the benchmark on good days but outperform the benchmark on bad ones   says Joe 
He says the stories that offer the best asymmetrical beta  returns relative to changes in gold price  are funded  permitted  near term producers because they have a floor value that reduces the possibility of them going to zero 
While Joe likes names with asymmetrical betas  he was quick to decipher between betas and leverage 
 The company s beta to gold is the actual percentage change in the stock relative to a 1  change in the gold price  whereas leverage is more theoretical   Joe explains   Leverage to gold is the change in the valuation in a changing gold price environment  
There are companies that provide leverage as an  out of the money  option on the gold price because they have the liquidity to deliver a high beta  Those without the liquidity do not offer the beta despite having projects with high gold leverage 
The issue with some companies that have high betas is that the underlying project may not attract financing due to its marginal economics or a red flag  permitting  geopolitical  remote  among others  
The asymmetry is derived by selecting the companies with capable management teams with relevant experience to advance their higher quality projects that are proximal to infrastructure with low execution and technical risk 
 We are seeing the generalist funds playing the high beta gold names  and even the far out of the money options which offer the highest betas  in order to gain alpha like returns in the short term versus trading physical gold   Joe tells me   They tend to be attracted to liquidity and geography over management  execution and technical risk  
In his opinion  the gold space is in worse condition than it would appear if you look at the GDXJ or the select high beta gold names 
 Where some these names are trading and the price level they can get financed at  if they could mind you  may be at different ends of the spectrum   Mr  Mazumdar said 
Equity investors can t foot the entire bill on most of these development stories and because the state of the capital markets has left many skeptical  equity investors are unwilling to invest unless the rest of the financing picture is in place 
Value Metrics 
When reading sell side research  some people look at target prices as a sure thing  while others completely ignore the reading altogether however  Joe and his team at Canaccord Genuity try to be intelligent with their assumptions on how they value a company 
 We look at risk adjusted returns at source  which means we make assumptions about each individual asset s risk profile  We look at both exogenous  commodity  geopolitical  and endogenous  execution  technical  permitting  among others  risks  
 We adjust our discount rate for each project to account for the exogenous risks and apply a Price to Net Present Value  P NPV  multiple to account for the endogenous risks  We also discount the corporate G A at a lower discount rate than the project as there is less risk the company s management will pay themselves  
 Price to net asset value is a result of our sum of the parts risk adjusted valuation versus the current prices  not something we apply   he says 
Joe believes that since many of the gold mining projects they follow tend to have shorter lives that they can t be valued as  going concerns   Instead  Joe prefers the application of a discounted cash flow model 
 Most mines aren t a  going concern  over 15 years  so applying a 10x the current year s cash flow implies one believes that the current gold price and production will remain the same for the next 10 years  even though the mine may only have a 6 year mine life   he tells me 
M A 
It is currently a buyer s market where the buyers have no sense of urgency due to the hangover of writedowns related to dilutive transactions during the peak of the last cycle  as well as the fact that potential suitors are not being asked to grow but rather to provide returns on the their investments 
 We see the M A bid now as very suitor specific  some may want to add an inexpensive growth option  others may make an opportunistic bid due to current market conditions on low risk or high quality assets while still others see the opportunity to make a synergistic acquisition for the  low hanging fruit    Joe explains 
Joe tells me synergistic transactions include Sulliden and Rio Alto as well as the Asanko and PMI Gold combination 
He says that some companies have been active in M A with respect to acquiring inexpensive growth options and high quality assets 
 Osisko s Canadian Malartic mine represented an asset so valuable to companies with the means right now that they could not afford to pass it up   Joe explains 
Opportunity Knocks Twice in the Junior Sector 


A recent report by Joe and his team highlights the important differences in two key junctions in a junior miner s life cycle  the exploration to discovery phase and the development to production phase  Both of these transition periods accrete value differently and hence attract different investors 
You have the early stage exploration concept that is based on geological theories  hopefully   The goal here is to accrete value from concept to discovery  Investors here are long term and more risk tolerant  Their investment is not unlike a lottery ticket based on hopefully good science 
After the discovery is made  you have a period in which the hype subsides and share prices decline with less liquidity 
During this period  if the project is worthy  a new management team is often needed  one with development experience  mining engineers  that can delineate an economic operation from the initial discovery 
Once a plan is in place for the development of the project  a new set of investors come in  These are more risk averse investors who are seeking cash flows 
 As the development team  you have a project that you believe can be built  but now you have to go convince this new group of more risk averse investors that you can permit it  build it and operate it   he explains 
The transition from speculative investor to risk averse investors drives the change required in management from exploration geologist to mine builders 
Joe thinks companies such as Asanko Gold  Golden Queen Mining  Midway  Roxgold have all transitioned their teams from explorationists to mine developers well  These companies have the teams in place to actually develop and operate their assets  so a takeover is not necessarily the endgame for them 
Dumb Money 
Given Mr  Mazumdar s experience working for Newmont s strategy team  I wanted to get his response to the statement that senior mining companies are  dumb money  because they constantly sell at lows and buy at peaks 
 Gold companies in the last cycle were valued on their ability to show growth  the larger the production profile   4 Moz per year  the more ounces required to not only replete their annual reserves but to show a 4 5  compound annual growth rate  The amount of ounces required were beyond the capacity of their project pipeline  such that these ounces were acquired via M A transactions where accretion was measured by production growth and on an NAV basis but where returns or paybacks were not considered as highly  
 Investors at the time weren t looking for returns  they were looking for ounces   he tells me 
Joe claims that in a rising gold price environment a lot of these transactions may have ended up being successful  but as the gold price fell the premium paid made these acquisitions dilutive and led to many writedowns 
He believes that only 2 3rds of most of these seniors  production profiles are viable in the current price environment and many of the projects in their respective pipelines are currently marginal 
He believes the largest a company can viably sustain itself may be at the 3 to 4 million ounces per year mark 
Once a company gets above that level  the geological challenges of finding and replacing this production level  make it difficult to sustain forcing a company to make acquisitions that are not always accretive 
What He Likes 
Mr  Mazumdar currently sees the most value in the development arena  He prefers deposits that are economic today but also provide a call option on a bigger deposit that would make sense in a rising gold price environment when companies will be able to finance larger capital projects 
Joe covers Orezone  TO ORE  which is developing a two phase project called Bombore in Burkina Faso 
This is an example of the type of project he likes  The first phase is a 2 million ounce oxide  heap leach project that is financeable in the current environment 
Below that  the deposit hosts another 3 million ounce sulphide deposit  the call option  
Below is a video which highlights the Bombore deposit 

Mazumdary likes stories where a lot of the question marks around viability are already answered 
Other names Joe covers include 
Asanko Gold  TO AKG   Castle Mountain Mining  TO CMM  Dalradian Resources  TO DNA  Golden Queen Mining  TO GQM  Goldrock Mines  TO GRM  Midway Gold  AMEX MDW  Roxgold  TO ROG  Rubicon Minerals  TO RMX

189752,411268,NEM,For Gold Miners September Was A Month To Forget,opinion,"With one day left in the month  September is shaping up to be the worst monthly performance for the senior gold miners  both the Market Vectors Gold Miners Fund  ARCA GDX  and HUI are down roughly 18 5  for the month  since the dreadful month of June 2013 
HUI Gold Bugs Index  Monthly 

The gold miners are down 5 weeks in a row and the sector appears to be bottomless  However  until the December lows are taken out  the recent action can still be interpreted as taking place within the context of a large bottoming pattern 

Should the December lows get taken out  we could be in store for a brutal trip down to the 2008 financial crisis lows 
It is interesting to ponder the incredible  boom   bust  cycle which the gold mining sector has experienced during the last six years  The 2008 crash in the mining space turned out to be a brief panic which resulted in a V bottom and the sector would eventually go on to make historic highs during 2011 as the gold price reached nearly  2 000  Considering that gold fell below  700 during the 2008 market crash  it would be hard to fathom the sector returning to the depths of the 2008 crash lows  The fact that as objective market observers we are forced to consider such a possibility simply helps to illustrate just how bleak sentiment on the gold mining space is currently 
A slide from a recent Barrick Gold  NYSE ABX   helps to illustrate how the senior gold producers are finally beginning to get a grasp on costs and turn the tide in the other direction 

This means that the recent extreme selling in the sector is an indication that investors have little confidence in the future direction of the gold price and that many in fact are betting on the  to come true  While gold may very well face some uphill sledding in the near term  a slide from a recent Newmont Mining  NYSE NEM  investor presentation exhibits a decline in mine supply beginning next year and leading to a total supply deficit in 2017 onward 

The short term outlook is undeniably murky for the gold space  however  astute investors would be wise to look to the future with a calm  calculated gaze and appreciate that current valuations across the space indicate a high degree of pessimism that is quite likely unwarranted ",2014-09-30,Tommy Humphreys,https://www.investing.com/analysis/for-gold-miners-september-was-a-month-to-forget-227412,227412
189773,411289,NEM,Gold Standard Ventures Consolidates Southern Carlin Trend District,opinion,"All serious gold investors know the Carlin Trend of Nevada is one of the most prolific gold producing regions of the world  Is it possible that there is an undiscovered district  not just a deposit  within that region that was missed by the majors  Jon Awde  CEO of Gold Standard Ventures  discusses how spectacular drill results have guided Gold Standard Ventures to focus on creating the southernmost mining district of the Carlin Trend the Railroad Pinion District  At more than 40 square miles  the district is large enough to potentially sustain a mid sized producer  In this interview with The Gold Report  Awde describes the unique challenges of proving up a series of deposits that are in the shadow of the majors and for the first time all combined under one company in a single mining district 
The Gold Report  The event that launched Gold Standard Ventures Corp   AMEX GSV  NYSE  into the limelight was the spectacular drill results of the high grade and long interval at the Railroad project in Nevada  That was about two years ago  Since then  what have you learned about the deposit and how has the company evolved to take advantage of the situation 
Jon Awde  The intercepts that you are referring to were quite spectacular  In 2012  we had four wide and high grade holes  At that time it was called the Railroad project  It s recently been renamed the Railroad Pinion project  Two of the better holes had 164 meters  164m  of 3 38 grams per ton  3 38 g t  and 124m of 4 05 g t  One of those holes included a high grade intercept of 42 7m of 9 4 g t  That was a blind discovery and opened up this target  Since then  we have drilled at least 30 more holes into that target 
What have we learned  The deposit has complex geology  The deposit is open ended  Both of those attributes describe a typical Carlin system  and they apply to the Railroad  Pinion project  Late last year we discovered a new lower breccia zone that appears to be the flat lying collapse breccias that occur in an idealized North Carlin system  These are all characteristics that historically have represented a very large  robust Carlin system 
TGR  What was the depth from surface to the high grade intervals  One of the many attractions of Carlin style mines is that many are near surface 
 JA  The depth of those specific holes was about 160 meters  We have found shallower portions of the deposit to the southwest  where we see mineralization starting at about 90 to 100 meters  If you look at other operating mines in the Carlin Trend  there are many that operate with similar depths to ore from surface 
TGR  Haven t the majors locked up all the Carlin Trend  Is there any room left for new big discoveries 
 JA   Yes  absolutely  sometimes districts can remain underexplored because of complex land ownership issues or stacked royalties both were the case at Railroad Pinion  The Carlin Trend is the most prolific gold belt in the Western Hemisphere  The majority of the current production from the Carlin comes from the northern end of the trend  Gold Standard Ventures Railroad Pinion District is in the southern portion of the Carlin Trend  immediately south of Newmont Mining Corp  s  NYSE NEM  Rain District 
Our chief geologist  Dave Mathewson  when he worked for Newmont  tried to get a toehold in the Railroad Pinion District for years  Ultimately  his efforts were not successful  The land package was owned by various interests that could not work out a deal to advance exploration in the district  In the meantime  the majors developed several operating mines on the northern portions of the Carlin Trend and let this area sit under or unexplored 
Times change and we were highly opportunistic and diligent in working out terms with new owners in the area to move forward with exploration  In fact  the Railroad Pinion District wasn t really explored with modern exploration techniques until we got to it  Gold Standard Ventures was the first company to do controlled source audio frequency magneto tellurics  CSAMT  and gravity surveys at the district level  We were also the first to do soil sampling and geologic mapping across the entire Railroad Pinion District 
TGR  What are some of the things you have found that indicate that Railroad Pinion is the southernmost district in the Carlin 
 JA  One distinctive feature of Carlin style deposits is the presence of collapse breccias along major west northwest trending fault zones  We discovered two such features at our North Bullion deposit  That is just the beginning  as we are getting a better handle on the structural controls to the geology  It s wide open and complex geology  Just when you think you have these Carlin systems figured out  they throw you a curve ball  Our team of exploration geologists  including Dave Mathewson  Mac Jackson and Steve Koehler  has been phenomenally successful in Nevada with several discoveries to their credit  The team has the expertise to model and interpret the new data that we have been able to obtain by consolidating these projects into one district  Such a districtwide view simply hasn t been possible in the past  while we are prioritizing three targets this year  the district remains target rich and highly prospective 
TGR  Who are the significant players in the Carlin Trend 
 JA  Most of the Carlin Trend is controlled and operated by Barrick Gold Corp   NYSE ABX  and Newmont  In the northern part of the Carlin Trend is the Richmond Dome  which has the Goldstrike  Leeville and Meikle mines  Moving farther south down the trend is the Maggie Creek Dome  which is controlled and owned by Newmont  That s the massive Gold Quarry deposit  Next is the Mike deposit  Further south is the Rain District  which is primarily owned by Newmont  although the majority of the Saddle deposit is owned by Premier Gold Mines Ltd   TO PG   Then within the Rain District is the Emigrant mine that Newmont put into production a couple of years ago  That is a near surface  run of mine heap leach operation that is generating good cash flow for Newmont  A good portion of the Emigrant deposit was discovered by Dave Mathewson of Gold Standard Ventures 
The most southerly district of the Carlin Trend is the Railroad Pinion District  With the recently closed Pinion acquisition  Gold Standard Ventures now controls almost 40 square miles of wholly owned ground in the district  Each of the main districts in the Carlin Trend are all centered on a large dome or intrusive pluton  Gold Standard Ventures now controls the entire  fourth window   which represents the area where one of these large domes come close to surface and is most available for exploration and mining  see illustration below  

TGR  How does an exploration company cope with the tough gold market of the past two years even though Gold Standard Ventures had great exploration success and blue sky potential 
 JA  The overall market tone for the last two years for anything to do with gold has been dreadful  Then as you go down the food chain from producer to developer to junior to junior explorer  it s been tougher and tougher to raise capital  The capital market environment for exploration stories is still very challenging  You re right  this is a very large district scale opportunity and it s daunting because it is a target rich environment  We re seeing a lot of the same or similar characteristics that you need to see to host a district  It is a challenge to have multiple target opportunities  Every month we gain more knowledge about the district  and it validates our thinking that we do have a district in the Carlin Trend akin to the larger  robust districts in the northern part of the trend 
But to answer your question  how are we coping  We re focusing on building a district  The acquisition of Pinion completes our land consolidation  We started almost four years ago with 12 square miles  We have now almost quadrupled the size of the land package to nearly 40 square miles  We have narrowed in on three main targets  North Bullion  Pinion and Bald Mountain  Bald Mountain and Pinion are two oxide targets while North Bullion is a classic Carlin sediment hosted refractory gold system 
To cope with the volatile gold market  it helps to have supportive shareholders  We have several shareholders who have been with us for a long time  We have been able to get a couple of large U S  institutions to support us  We have a very large shareholder in Toronto  FCMI  led by Albert Friedberg  It owns about 15  of the company  FCMI came in after some early exploration success  but before our high grade discovery at North Bullion  In August 2013 we were able to get a 5  investment from a mining company 
TGR  You did a recent deal to round out your land package with the acquisition of Bald Mountain  Can you just give us a few high points about that transaction and specifically what you re going to be doing next at Bald Mountain 
 JA  The acquisition of Pinion closed in early March  As a part of the deal to acquire the interest that we didn t own at Pinion  we entered into an agreement with Scorpio Gold Corp   TO SGN  to purchase approximately 16  of one section  This is important because approximately 300 meters away was a drill hole that we announced in early October  where we hit 56m of 1 47 g t gold  It was all oxide with an underlying copper zone  Our exploration team is very excited about this target 
Approximately 300 meters away from that drill hole  there was a section of land that we did not have complete ownership  In fact  we owned about 84  of it  To prevent a future royalty issue  we elected to purchase the remainder of the land  Based on our geochemistry and soils analysis  our team strongly believes that the target was heading in the direction of that boundary 
In order to drill the highest probability portion of that target  we needed to wrap up the land ownership issue  Now that we ve closed on that land acquisition  we have the whole district under one roof for the first time ever  This is a big accomplishment because of the multiple owners of surface  mineral and water rights that we ve had to deal with to get this far  It wasn t easy  but we have made the investment in consolidating the land package  Now we can properly go after the Bald Mountain target  We are going to get a reverse circulation  RC  rig in there in late June or early July after the exploration program of phase 1 at Pinion is complete 
TGR  What should investors be looking for in news flow for near term or longer term 
 JA  First  in early May we started the phase 1 drilling program at the Pinion Deposit  It is a 15 hole program designed to do a couple of things  First and foremost  we want to make the historical resource NI 43 101 compliant  We also want to test a few targets that are just outside of the historical resource 
Second  we are looking forward to drilling Bald Mountain  The target is highly prospective and should begin drilling by early July 
The third task the company will be working on is to go back to North Bullion and make that resource NI 43 101 compliant  which will take about another 8 to 10 holes  An exploration company with a near term oxide development asset like Pinion is attractive  It complements our other exploration that is targeting much larger  blue sky deposits 
Across all the targets  the data supports our plan to explore and build this district  The data validates our investment in building the land package we have worked out with multiple owners of surface  mineral and water rights  The structural interpretation that we ve done on the Bald Mountain target has helped us get a better understanding of the potential of the district  Building on the results at Bald Mountain from this January  we have opened up a new prospective west northwest direction of that target  Expect more drill results from all these targets this year 
TGR  Is a preliminary economic assessment  PEA  on the horizon 
 JA  Yes  The PEA will happen at some point after the initial resource at Pinion  The initial drill program will concentrate on making the historical resource NI 43 101 compliant  However  given we think there is a lot of exploration upside  a second drill program will be designed to test its potential  Therefore  we will have to figure out how to incorporate the right level of data into the PEA 
We have a large amount of data that we have to work into the initial resource  For example  we have 90   of all the cuttings and chips from substantially more than 300 reverse circulation holes  We thought we were going to receive two core holes and instead received 12  At least 40  of the core from those 12 holes was not assayed  Many of the holes were shallow and bottomed in mineralization  Plus  we have a massive geochem data set  Resolving all the historical and modern data into a comprehensive resource is a large undertaking 
TGR  What are the three reasons an investor should take a look at Gold Standard Ventures 
 JA  First  we re in the Carlin Trend  It s one of the best exploration and mining jurisdictions in the world  Nevada has great infrastructure  clear and transparent mining code  and is very supportive of exploration development and mining  We have an entire district in the Carlin Trend locked up for the first time ever 
Second  we have three exciting targets  two of them oxide  one of them refractory  This provides us with a combination of near term and long term mining potential 
Last  we have a phenomenal world class exploration team you typically would not find in a junior  Our exploration staff is complemented by an excellent board and advisory team with a lot of merger and acquisition and capital market experience 
Putting all of those characteristics into a junior is a rare and unique opportunity 
TGR  Thanks for taking the time to talk to us 
 JA  It has been a pleasure

189789,411305,NEM,What Will It Take And How Long For Gold Mining Stocks To Recover  ,opinion,The period ending in 2010 was one of the most explosive episodes of growth for the gold mining industry  but the aftermath has been bleak  Gold is down  500 in 2013 alone  The GDX  which tracks the performance of an index of gold mining companies  declined by over 48  in that same period Steve Todoruk  a Senior Investment Executive at Sprott Global Resource Investments Ltd   says the major mining companies are starting to clean up their acts and run more efficient operations  but the turnaround could take time Senior mining companies are in the dog house with investors and shareholders right now  Making the necessary changes is a difficult task that takes quite a bit of time  If you are invested in junior exploration stocks  make sure your companies have enough cash to weather the storm for at least the next year   ideally  the next two  They should have enough money to cover their overhead  with sufficient additional cash to continue advancing their projects forward Historically  when metal prices are low  big mining companies tighten their belts to reduce costs  Typically  the first thing they do to cut costs is also the most ill advised  they lay off their geologists and cut their exploration budgets  This is biting off the hand that feeds them  These companies need geologists working to find the next new deposits so they can replace current reserves as they run out  Finding or discovering your own new deposit is cheaper than buying a discovery from someone else  You pay multiples to buy another company s deposit because they took on the high level of risk in exploration The current downturn in metal prices  however  is very unusual  I have not experienced anything similar in my career  Barrick Gold Corp    the largest gold mining company in the world  has just announced 100 layoffs from their head offices in Toronto  Canada  Barrick has very few geologists in their head office  which means they are disposing of a large number of their accountants  lawyers  receptionists and other employees In another example  Newmont Mining Corp   the second largest gold mining company  recently announced layoffs of 33  of their corporate staff in the Denver  Colorado head office The majors are also laying off non essential and duplicate staff at their producing mines in order to cut costs  and they are becoming better at controlling the costs of parts and equipment  Previously  they regularly paid too generously for parts and equipment without contacting multiple providers or seeking to reduce the cost  Of course  they can only save so much doing this  maybe 3 7  of overall costs  but it is an additional step towards improving the bottom line A number of the big mining companies are also giving up on unprofitable endeavors Last week  Kinross Gold Corp  walked away from its Fruta del Norte gold deposit in Ecuador   one of the most coveted large high grade gold deposits in the world   because the government of Ecuador made the mine unprofitable through excessive demands for taxes Smaller mining companies are starting to scale back plans for new mines  Some are going to stop construction altogether  Atna Resources Ltd  in Nevada  for instance  as they are running out of money  and lower gold prices make the economics of running the mine less attractive  Indeed  while gold has plummeted  construction and other mining costs have stayed the same I believe it could take the majors 6 to 12 months to show that they have successfully implemented measures to strengthen their businesses  At that point or later  the juniors should start to turn the corner  There are several companies in the current market that have cash  either on hand at their bank or through a major mining company as a joint venture partner with deep pockets  These are the companies that can keep steadily advancing their projects  and be attractive for acquisitions once the health of the majors improves  If you are comfortable enough betting on a strong turnaround somewhere past this slump  you may want to be invested in companies that fit this bill ,2013-07-08,Commodity Trade Mantra,https://www.investing.com/analysis/what-will-it-take-and-how-long-for-gold-mining-stocks-to-recover-174462,174462

189792,411308,NEM,Stephan Bogner On The Rise Of A Euro Sino Russian Superpower,opinion,"Stephan Bogner  mining analyst with Rockstone Research and CEO of Elementum International  views the crisis in Crimea as the beginning of a larger global power shift east of the Atlantic  In this interview with The Mining Report  Bogner details what these shifting power dynamics will mean for the commodities market  And take heed gold and silver may continue to make gains  but uranium  potash and rare earths are the true wave of the future 
The Mining Report  In his recent interview with The Gold Report   Robert Cohen said that now that Crimea has joined Russia  the crisis in Ukraine has run its course  which is why the price of gold has dropped  As a European mining analyst  do you agree with Cohen s assertion 
Stephan Bogner  In my view  high level Wall Street players are orchestrating the gold price drop as a means of making people believe everything is in order again  They re attempting to convey that the crisis premium has been deducted from the gold price after its rise in the wake of the Crimea crisis  but I wouldn t bet on that 
Remember when gold rose from  300 ounce   300 oz  to almost  400 oz in 2002 2003 due to the widely propagated Iraq War premium  When the war was over in early 2003  the price fell back to  320 oz  People used the same argument then  the gold price is dropping because the crisis is over  In a few months  the price rose to  500 oz for no reason the experts could explain 
Don t bet on TV experts and commentaries  Bet on your gut feeling  especially when it s getting quiet and experts are going silent 
TMR  What is the general sentiment among the Germans regarding the situation in Ukraine 
SB  According to large polls in Germany  most Germans think that not only Russia  but the Ukrainian government  the EU and the U S  all have made mistakes and share the blame  and that the crisis is not our business and we shouldn t get too involved  One out of two Germans thinks that we should only use diplomatic measures and only every fourth German thinks that sanctions against Russia would be appropriate  That said  I doubt most Germans know what the full consequences that sanctions against Russia would bring us 
TMR  It seems the west is unwilling to do much to help Ukraine  apart from sanctions against Russia  Is this emblematic of a power shift from west to east 
SB  According to these polls  75  of Germans distrust Putin and at the same time think that he is  clever and strong   but more than 60  of Germans doubt that Obama can solve this conflict  The traditional thinking that sees Russia as mainly negative and the U S  as mainly positive is breaking apart  The NSA scandal and George W  Bush laid the foundation for the anti American impulses that are on the sharp rise again  Vladimir Putin s power and influence have shifted the balance of power from west to east  although we are too proud to fully admit that 
European politicians should know that sanctions against Russia would be useless and counterproductive  to say the least  Germany and especially other European countries are far too dependent on Russian gas supplies and other commodities to threaten Russia with sanctions  We must acknowledge our fault in deciding to abandon all nuclear power plants in Germany  as we are now paying the price for our energy dependence  Putin must be doubling over with laughter about the proposed sanctions  because he s smart enough to understand that the threat of sanctions is merely chest beating  as we attempt to convince our own citizens that we still have some influence 
Europe should try to get on the same page with Russia  I believe this can evolve to be a good thing  as Europe and Russia can become a happy new superpower  especially as we partner more with China  I rather want to see Europe team up with Russia and China to replace U S  dollar based transactions with what I envision as a gold backed monetary system 
Russia can benefit immensely being strategically positioned in the heart of both and sitting on vast amounts of natural resources that can be fed to Europe and China  Ultimately  I see Russian  European and Chinese economies flourishing  while the U S  inflates itself and becomes dependent on this new superpower 
I believe that Russia will successfully merge with Ukraine  I also believe that this crisis was the beginning of currency and commodity wars that may escalate  After years of depreciating commodity and gold prices  during which the smart accumulated as much as possible  the tide is turning and higher prices are on the forefront 
TMR  How will an alliance of this magnitude and the prospect of currency and commodity wars impact the U S  economy 
SB  Russia may already be quietly backing away from the dollar  In late 2013  Russia held some  138 billion   138B  in U S  treasuries a fair amount  yet dwarfed by the more than  1 trillion in reserves held by both China and Japan 
Russia is not in a position to take down the U S  bond market on its own  yet it may have a significant impact when it decides to sell  Russia will have good reason to sell U S  debt and U S  stocks  and possibly pursue other means of impacting the globalized capital markets  if the U S  continues to act so aggressively  Sales by Russia also could trigger others into selling  If the U S  imposes sanctions against Russia  Chinese officials may start to get the notion that they are too dependent on the dollar  which could lead China to sell U S  treasuries 
On the other hand  it would be good for the U S  in the long run if foreign countries dumped their U S  treasuries and turned away from the dollar  The U S  economy is too dependent on foreigners buying its debt  I am certain that Russia  and maybe China  are already reducing their exposure to U S  debt and are ready to shoot back aggressively with massive selloffs if the U S  goes far out on a limb  This would bring about a falling dollar and a rising gold price  I would rather bet on that than anything else 
TMR  And how will that affect the price of gold 
SB  In the short term  the gold price can fall due to manipulation  but in the mid  to long term  betting on gold is a sure thing because Russia and China are betting on gold as well  They both know that the fiat system hates gold and they know that once the gold market has dried up or if the U S  threatens them  they can let the gold price explode 
TMR  Iraq bought 36 metric tons of gold recently  valued at  1 6B  the biggest gold purchase by a sovereign power in three years  Is this part of the shift that you are talking about 
SB  Yes  I believe so 
TMR  After a strong start this year  the gold price is seeing diminishing support above  1 300 oz  Is the bull simply resting or has the bear returned  What would you say to an investor who is still uneasy after a three year bear market in gold equities and to a lesser extent gold itself 
SB  I would say don t worry  Be happy with gold and silver  Their times will come  as certainly as there is an  amen  at church 
TMR  Where is gold safer  in your mattress or in the bank 
SB  That is the question that high level players on Wall Street want you to think about  The orchestrated bear market has become a self fulfilling prophecy  with China and Russia probably also manipulating the gold price to the downside as they are all purchasing from people who are asking themselves this question people who are selling or are no longer buying 
In the end  only the brave will be among the winners those who never doubted that such a question is nothing but a trap to steal your gold and silver and attempt to force a bear market 
TMR  Which gold and precious metals equities are you following at Rockstone Research 
SB  I like Klondex Mines Ltd   KDX TO   because it was able to acquire the Midas mine and mill from Newmont Mining Corporation  NYSE NEM   This gives Klondex a competitive edge in Nevada that the market has not yet fully understood  The company s management team is among the best in the entire industry and I expect a steady increase in output from now on 
You want to hold high grade gold in your portfolio in difficult market times  Nevada is the best place in the world to explore and mine for gold  That is also why I like Gold Standard Ventures Corp  AMEX GSV   Dave Mathewson  the former Newmont chief geologist  knows that there are elephant sized gold deposits in excess of 20 million ounces  20 Moz  on the company s district sized property  The latest Pinion acquisition adds tremendous size and potential for large gold deposits to be discovered in the next months and years 
Keep Novagold Resources Inc   AMEX NG  on your radar as well  Once gold prices pick up  this company will be ready to either advance its Donlin property into a mine or be taken out  I also highly recommend Columbus Gold Corporation  CGT V  and have no doubt of its success  The management team is determined to bring this highly prospective deposit in production just when I anticipate gold prices will have recovered substantially  It s all about timing and Columbus is one of the few gold development companies that is right on track 
I m very bullish on gold and silver in general  However  these markets are among the most manipulated and thus are riskier  especially now  when it is unclear if the market is in recovery mode or if further selloffs may cause the gold price to fall to  1 000 oz  Nonetheless  I follow a few precious metals companies because I like them fundamentally 
TMR  What about silver equities 
SB  I admire IMPACT Silver Corp   IPT V  for having a management team that knows how to overcome the current depressed state of the market  It will prosper above average once markets have recovered 
The same applies to Santacruz Silver Mining Ltd   SCZ V   The company has brought Rosario into production with low capital expense  capex  and sound profit margins during bad market conditions  hence Santacruz will prosper nicely when silver prices are on the rise 
Golden Arrow Resources Corporation  GRG V  has already identified a silver resource greater than 100 Moz  and I m positive that will increase 
But really  I m far more bullish on uranium  potash and rare earths at the moment  To me  they have virtually no downside risk now and are more likely to rise from today s rock bottom prices than gold and silver  For example  the entire junior  and senior uranium market is anticipating the beginning of a strong upswing in uranium prices from the current rock bottom level where it has been holding for quite some time now 
TMR  What is the case for uranium 
SB  I think uranium has one of the best outlooks of all commodity markets right now and my favorite explorer is Lakeland Resources Inc   LK TSX V  
The Lakeland stock has more than doubled since December and other major uranium companies have been on the rise since late 2013 as well  Denison Mines Corp   DML TSX  DNN NYSE MKT  is up 30   Cameco Corp   CCO TSX  CCJ NYSE  is up 40   Fission Uranium Corp   FCU TSX V  is up 60  
TMR  Isn t this trend largely based on the Athabasca Basin area play and Fission s success with a new type of uranium deposit there 
SB  Of course  Fission has more than tripled its stock price because of its discovery of an amazing deposit  The price increases for Denison  which isn t successfully exploring anything  and for Cameco  a large senior mining company  demonstrates that the entire market is already anticipating a move up in uranium prices  I would argue 
TMR  Do you follow other uranium plays 
SB  I m pretty much focused only on the Athabasca Basin  I wouldn t want to look in any other jurisdiction than Canada for political and jurisdiction reasons 
I m looking more at companies with the potential to become the next Fission  Lakeland  with its large portfolio and strategy of forging joint venture  JV  partnerships  is unparalleled in the Athabasca Basin  It will have one of the largest drilling programs in the entire Athabasca Basin in 2014 
TMR  Any other names you would like to mention 
SB  Novx21 Inc  NOV V  has patented a clean platinum group metals  PGM  recovery technology that can be implemented anywhere  The technology uses little energy and creates no pollution  It has a low capex  offers a quick payback and has a gross margin in excess of 30  
In the U S  and Canada alone  more than 12 million  12M  catalytic converters are recycled every year  Worldwide  there are some 50M used cars  but only half of their catalytic converters are recycled  Today  PGMs are usually recovered using capital intensive smelters  These smelters employ a lot of energy to melt metals between 1 500 3 000 degrees Celsius  generating a lot of pollution 
The NovX21 pilot plant in Qu bec has been running in an outstanding manner for two years now  making this a great investment opportunity with limited risks  Its process will become the gold standard for PGM recycling 
TMR  Most investors consider rare earth elements  REE  an afterthought at this point  What are you seeing 
SB  The REE exploration and mining space is probably the most difficult commodity market for investors to understand  Yet  I believe that once the market understands how to evaluate an REE deposit  the few really promising REE stocks will appreciate in an outstanding manner  In December 2013  we published two articles on REEs  and named Commerce Resources Corp   CCE V  as our favorite in the REE space  That stock has more than doubled since December 
Most REE prices have already hit bottom and are beginning to recover  An upswing in market prices would lift many REE stocks strongly  However  there are few promising development projects and my research explains how to find them 
TMR  Does Commerce have the capital needed to be at the right stage once prices start to rebound 
SB  No  but it doesn t need to  because it took out most of the risk already  It is in the prefeasibility stage  The company is looking for a partner that is capital strong before it takes the next risks and brings the Ashram project into production  I have no doubt at all that Commerce will find a partner and that Ashram will be among the next development projects to be put into production 
TMR  Zimtu Capital Corp   ZC TSX V  holds a significant position in Commerce  Will Zimtu be able to help Commerce get the money it needs to advance its projects 
SB  Well  Zimtu has been backing up Commerce with the right people ever since 
TMR  Zimtu is up about 40  year to date  Is there much upside left 
SB  Oh yes  Many of its core holdings have more than doubled year to date  For example  Commerce Resources has doubled and Western Potash Corp   WPX TSX V  has more than doubled year to date 
Zimtu is one of my overall top picks if the mining market recovers  Its share ownership and diversified investment portfolio offer unparalleled upside to a wide variety of commodities  including potash  uranium  REEs  tantalum and niobium  copper  zinc  graphite and gold  The company consistently adds new positions and commodities through property transactions  as well as creating publicly listed companies  And Zimtu is probably the only publicly traded company in which investors can participate in the company building process as it is a second to none prospect generator that is all about people 
Zimtu has been in this business for more than a decade and has established a reputation that is paying off now  Zimtu s share structure is so tight  with only 11M shares in the market and no warrants outstanding  that its stock is poised to move up in an unparalleled fashion  Management has been very diligent in structuring this company and its shareholder base  I believe that its stock will thrive once the market understands that Zimtu is not only about its core investment holdings but more about future transactions as that is where tremendous value is created and when shareholder value is maximized as no other company in the resource space is capable of doing such on a regular basis 
Zimtu has share holdings in more than 40 publicly traded companies and numerous private companies that are on the verge of going public  Kapuskasing Gold Corp   OLA TSX V  is a good recent example  Zimtu already holds some 2 5M shares and 1M warrants  with an exercise price of  0 10 until 2019  This kind of transaction  made at the earliest possible moment  is when the most upside can be achieved with little downside risk  Kapuskasing s stock was halted at  0 07 in late February and resumed a few days ago  trading 1M shares as high as  0 18 
The company acquired the Borden North and Rollo properties near Chapleau in Ontario  The Borden North Property is on the southern flank of the Kapuskasing structural zone  approximately 50 kilometers northeast of Probe Mines Limited s  PRB TSX V  Borden gold deposit  which was discovered in 2010 and hosts a multimillion ounce gold zone  The Probe exploration team  along with prospector Mike Tremblay  was the recipient of the Ontario Prospector Association s  2013 Ontario Prospector Award  for the Borden gold discovery  Mr  Tremblay joined the advisory board of Kapuskasing Gold after it acquired these two properties  As you see  Zimtu is all about people and creating opportunities 
Zimtu also created Pasinex Resources Ltd   PSE CNX  and holds around 10M shares trading at   0 05 right now  Imagine the impact on Zimtu if a stock like Pasinex takes off  The outlook for Pasinex turned from bad to fabulous a few weeks ago  as this company holds high grade zinc properties in Turkey that can be put into production fairly quickly because its joint venture partner is the Turkish mining company  Akmetal AS  As you may know  exploration companies active in Turkey had a really tough time recently  as all exploration projects were forced to be put on hold due to a decree by the Government of Turkey denying any exploration permits  Just a few weeks ago  the Turkish Government issued more than 50 000 exploration permits  Thus  the devalued share prices of exploration companies active in Turkey are likely to recover now  no matter what the gold price or overall commodity market may do  These are the stories to follow as individual market conditions have created opportunities with limited downside risk and rosy outlooks 
TMR  Do you have one final thought on this commodities environment 
SB  Think of commodities prices like a rubber ball floating on water the deeper you push the ball down into the water  the higher it s going to jump when it finally surfaces 
TMR  Thanks for your time  Stephan

189793,411309,NEM,Oliver Gross  Gold  Silver  And Gold Companies Likely To Soar,opinion,"The bottom is in  declares Oliver Gross of Der Rohstoff Anleger  The Resource Investor   and the bulls are ready to charge  In this interview with   Gross says that the woefully undervalued juniors will exploit their leverage advantage  with best in class companies gaining as much as 500  to 1 000  or more  And he lists more than a dozen gold  silver and copper companies most likely to soar 
The Gold Report  Gold has fallen in the second half of March  Why 
Oliver Gross  I think it s a correction after the strong rally since December  And the situation in Ukraine has quieted down  We ve also seen a strong uptrend since the beginning of 2014 and now it feels like a healthy consolidation 
TGR  Since December  we ve had a very significant rise in gold equities  What is the cause  Gold rising from  1 180 ounce   1 180 oz   Or is it a cyclical change 
OG  It s a combination of bottom building in the gold price and the end of the bear market  which resulted in one of the heaviest selloffs ever  The gold equities  NYSE Arca Gold BUGS Index  HUI   to gold price ratio hit a multidigit low in 2013  HUI Gold   We have a solid double bottom formation in the gold price in place and the end of the selling pressure from the gold exchange traded funds  ETFs  and exchange traded products 
We also see continuous strength in the physical gold market  especially the huge buying power from China  now the world s largest gold consumer and producer  And you can assume that China isn t a speculator regarding its aggressive purchases  but rather a prudent long term investor  Maybe it has already developed a gold backed yuan currency model that could be the new world currency 
The first quarter is always very important for equities  More and more market players have now realized the tremendous performance potential in gold mining stocks and joined the recent rally 
HUI Gold Ratio  1996 2014 
TGR  The NYSE Arca Gold BUGS Index has risen even as the broader market has been shaky  What do you make of that 
OG  It wasn t a surprise  as valuations in the gold mining sector were not far from complete depressions  In addition  the gold producers have reformed after the big selloff in their equities  We have noted a significant change in business philosophy and a newfound drive to create a more robust and sustainable business model  The gold producers have successfully changed their focus from growth at any cost to maximization of profitability  growth in capital efficiency and real shareholder value 
The gold producers  income margins at price levels around  1 300 oz are still extremely slim  So there is a fantastic leverage in place  and with higher gold prices  the margins are going to explode  With a new gold bull market  which could lead to gold prices far above  2 000 oz in the next two to three years  we might see new  all time highs in the NYSE Arca Gold BUGS Index  But I believe the next bull market rally will be more specific and focused on the best in class stocks 
TGR  Could we see the broader equities markets taking substantial losses  even as precious metal stocks increase in price 
OG  That would make sense  as we have had a very strong bull market in the broad equity markets and a very tough bear market in precious metals and other mining stocks 
TGR  The Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners  GDXJ MX  has risen significantly higher than the majors  Does this surprise you 
OG  The Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF fell from an all time high of nearly 180 points at the end of 2010 to a historic all time low of only 29 points at the end of 2013  So its strong rally didn t surprise me  Most important has been the astonishing rise of trading volume  This is the key in every turning point  The juniors  with their low valuations  usually have far higher leverage  and that is the reason why we see even more volatility in both directions 

It s a very good sign that the juniors have outperformed the majors  as appetite for risk in the junior mining space is essential  We have seen a strong increase in financings and financing volumes in the junior gold equities market during Q1 14  That s a very healthy development 
TGR  There was a significant drop across the board in gold and silver equities in March  Was this mere profit taking  or have we reached an intermediate plateau 
OG  It really feels that we have seen the bottom now  and the bottom building process always takes some time  The next few years will be a very attractive period to invest in high quality resource companies 
TGR  How do you determine the price buy limits for the stocks you recommend  In other words  why are stocks good buys at one price and not another 
OG  When it comes to choosing mining stocks  I put a strong emphasis on deep research and fundamental analysis  This is crucial in a market where more than 80  of all junior mining companies will ultimately fail  It s all about quality and investors always have to be very  very picky in selecting picks that could become their favorites 
After my thorough due diligence and conversations with managements and fund managers  I select my favorites  which I buy for the middle to long term  The other crucial factor is timing  For instance  you could have invested in the best of class companies from 2011 2013  and it wouldn t have made any difference  as the whole sector was punished  But when the timing is right  which seems to be now  it doesn t matter if an investor buys a great junior mining company at  1 or  1 50 share 
TGR  What are the specific criteria you seek in your research and analysis 
OG  I seek experienced and excellent management teams with strong track records and large networks  companies with healthy cash balances  solid financing outlooks and tight share structures with patient and successful investors  and projects that are decent sized  attractive and well located with exploration and expansion potential  projects that are economic even in low metal price environments  Aggressive project development schedules are also very important  I also want to see strong and clear ambitions 
TGR  What gold companies come to mind in this respect 
OG  Columbus Gold Corporation  CGT V  is led by very smart and prudent people  Most are well versed geologists and genuine resource experts  Additionally  they have experienced financial experts and a strong network of investors and supporters  Columbus is developing one of the most promising early stage gold projects in South America  the Paul Isnard project in French Guiana 
Paul Isnard already contains a 5  million ounce  5  Moz  deposit  Exploration potential is outstanding  The resource contains a higher grade ore body with decent grades of about 2 grams ton  2 g t  gold  The whole deposit is very flat and the continuity and quality of gold mineralization are favorable  There is still a lot of work to be done  but I see solid potential for a large scale  very profitable gold mining operation 
Columbus  management acted to avoid heavy dilution yet develop its project on a fast track by making a deal with the Russian company Nord Gold NV  NORDNq LSE   one of the top 20 gold producers worldwide  It speaks for itself that four substantial gold companies are already involved in Paul Isnard  Nordgold and its well capitalized project partner  the French producer Auplata S A   ALAUP PA   mid cap producer IAMGold Corporation  IAG  and Sandstorm Gold  ARCA SAND   which bought a lucrative net smelter return last year 
TGR  What else do you like in that region 
OG  In Guyana  there is Sandspring Resources Ltd  SSP V  and its Toroparu project  which has 10 Moz gold and decent copper credits  I have tracked this company for years and decided to recommend it after its agreement with Silver Wheaton Corp   SLW TSX  SLW NYSE   This is a game changer  I hear that Silver Wheaton selected Sandspring over 50 other juniors with decent gold assets 
The overall economics of Toroparu project are pretty good  with a solid return on investment  It has great support from the Guyana government  With the Silver Wheaton agreement  Sandspring now has the funds to reach the feasibility stage  I also like the company s high insider holdings  more than 25   This is a perfect leverage play for me at its current valuation  as it will benefit greatly from what we expect will be a significant upturn in the gold price 
TGR  What other regions do you like in South America 
OG  I like the Antioquia Department in northwest Colombia  which is still widely underexplored  This is home to Continental Gold Ltd  CNL TO  Buritic  project  one of the world s best  It already boasts 6  Moz of over 10 g t gold and will soon publish a new resource estimate  I believe it will ultimately contain 10  Moz  This could be a huge cash cow 
Continental Gold has a great management team with a fantastic track record  including CEO Ari Sussman and Chairman Robert Allen  the company s largest shareholder  In December 2012  Continental raised CA 86 3 million  CA 86 3M   a truly outstanding amount for a junior gold company  This financing avoided dilution and enabled one of the largest gold exploration programs in South America  With a current cash balance of more than CA 100M  the company is perfectly positioned to bring Buritic  to feasibility and the final milestones in the permitting process 
TGR  Do you like any other companies in Antioquia 
OG  Not far from Buritic   Red Eagle Mining Corporation  RD V  has found a lucrative  5  g t gold ore body at its Santa Rosa project  Its key deposit  San Ramon  has very attractive economic numbers  even at lower gold price levels  and a fantastic return on investment  Also  there is great infrastructure access  which leads to positive cost reductions  Red Eagle is on track to reach feasibility this year  It also has great exploration and expansion potential at its huge flagship property 
What really makes this special is the low capital expense  capex  of about CA 85M  Financing shouldn t be a problem  as Red Eagle is backed by two financially sound  strategic investors that own more than 30  of the company  The first is Liberty Metals   Mining Holdings LLC  which is a daughter company of the insurance giant Liberty Mutual of Boston  The second largest shareholder  after management  is Appian Natural Resources Fund L P   a new mining focused fund that is led by two successful former J P  Morgan bankers 
Red Eagle s CEO  Ian Slater  is a smart and talented manager who has put together an amazing team that is doing fine community work in Colombia 
TGR  This is a stock that is trading at only  0 335 share 
OG  Absolutely great leverage there  It did its IPO at  1 25 
TGR  Do you like any gold companies in Brazil 
OG  Brazil Resources Inc   BRI V   Its genius chairman is Amir Adnani  the mastermind behind Uranium Energy Corp  AMEX UEC   Brazil Resources is his new darling  and he has huge ambitions  The company has a strong team of resource experts and well connected finance people  as well as an excellent share structure and shareholder structure  It is backed by the Brasilinvest crew  which has attracted funds of more than  16 billion   16B  since its establishment 
Other prominent investors and backers of Brazil Resources are the Casey Group and Sprott  So it s a pretty good sign that most of the outstanding shares are in strong and highly qualitative hands 
Brazil Resources owns a huge and promising land package of gold mining concessions in Brazil  including a multimillion ounce gold resource with plenty of exploration potential 
In addition  the company holds a highly interesting land package next to Fission Uranium Corp s  FCU V  Patterson Lake South discovery in Saskatchewan  This project is in a lucrative joint venture with a uranium major  AREVA SA  AREVA EPA   so it could be a very profitable offtake 
One my friends from Vancouver is a strong supporter of this story  Mr  Gianni Kovacevic is a great investor with a huge network and the chief editor of The MEDAP Letter  which has Brazil Resources in its resource portfolio 
With Brazil Resources we have a great team  very attractive projects  sufficient funds  first class investors and a strong schedule  These are the fundamentals I want to see in a junior gold story 
TGR  You mentioned ambitious management  Which other teams come to mind 
OG  Two gold juniors I follow closely are True Gold Mining  RVREF PK  and Pilot Gold Inc   PLG TO   Both companies are led by the masterminds of Fronteer Gold  which was acquired by Newmont Mining Corporation  NYSE NEM  in a  2 3B deal  The former president and CEO of Fronteer is Mark O Dea  one of the most skilled managers in global junior mining  He is now the executive chairman of True Gold and the chairman of Pilot  Both companies are backed by first class strategic investors and mining companies and have great financials  I really like the business philosophy and the strong ambitions of the stunning head management here 
TGR  What can you say specifically about these companies and their projects 
OG  True Gold is developing in Burkina Faso one of the most promising and profitable gold projects worldwide  Karma  It is already approaching mine financing and the start of construction  In gold mining today  it s all about margin  and True Gold owns a margin leader with district sized potential 
Pilot Gold has had a very impressive gold discovery at its Kinsley Mountain project in Nevada this year  This could be a world class gold deposit comparable to Fronteer s Long Canyon deposit  In Turkey  the company is developing the huge TV Tower project  which is in a joint venture with resource giant Teck Resources Ltd   TCK TSX  TCK NYSE   TV Tower seems to contain several decent gold  silver and copper deposits and has great development and exploration potential 
TGR  Do you like any other African companies 
OG  My favorite among the major gold producers is Randgold Resources  RRS LSE   And I have a Buy rating on explorer Legend Gold Corp  LGN V   which has just joint ventured with Randgold in an amazing land package below the biggest gold mine in Mali 
TGR  And elsewhere in the world 
OG  I have a Buy rating for junior producer Timmins Gold Corp   TMM TO   Its San Francisco gold mine in Mexico is one of the lowest cost producers in the world  And I have a Buy rating for developer Dalradian Resources Inc  DNA TO  in Northern Ireland  Its Curraghinalt project is one of the highest grade gold projects in the world 
TGR  You favor very few silver companies as compared to gold  Why 
OG  When things get serious  gold is the best storage of wealth and the best protection against turbulence  Silver s role will always be a combination of industrial metal and investment asset  And most silver supply comes from base metal mines as a byproduct  so its producers don t really care about the silver price 
Moreover  the silver market is extremely tight and thus even more so than gold subject to manipulation by the likes of J P  Morgan  Goldman Sachs  HSBC and other influential players in the paper markets  I try to play the trends regarding the gold silver ratio  which remains extremely high  If this trend reverses  I will buy more silver and silver mining stocks 
TGR  It sounds as if you are sympathetic to the manipulation argument made by the Gold Anti Trust Action Committee  GATA  
OG  COMEX is the biggest gold exchange in the world and has by far the most influence on daily and short term gold prices  J P  Morgan and the others I mentioned are the biggest players in COMEX  and we can assume they have the biggest influence on daily and short term gold prices  Facts don t lie  J P  Morgan and other big financial players control more than 80  of all precious metals derivatives and you can assume that these influential players always know about the crucial positioning at the COMEX 
It seems that these players are always doing the opposite of what they say publicly  For example  Goldman published a gold report in 2013 in front of the huge selloff  It made more than  500M in this selloff  then turned around and reinvested heavily in gold  So it also made millions in the recent gold price recovery  Goldman has recently invested more than  80M in the SPDR Gold Trust ETF  We can assume that Goldman and J P  Morgan are  in fact  long on gold  That also demonstrates to me that the gold price bottom is in 

TGR  Which silver companies are you keen on 
OG  I like two  The first is Wildcat Silver Corpo  WLDVF PK   It is led by Richard Warke  the man behind the glorious Ventana Gold story  which was bought out for  1 56B in 2011 
The company is developing the Hemosa project in Arizona  which has the potential to be the only large manganese producer in the U S   as well as one of the largest silver producers in North America 
Hermosa will reach the feasibility stage this year  Its economics are solid  and it should be a big cash cow  considering the next bull market and anticipated higher silver prices  Insiders own more than 30  of Wildcat  The company has also attracted Silver Wheaton as a strategic investor  Wildcat offers one of the best leverages on the silver price in a portfolio  Its valuation is far below  0 50 per silver ounce 
TGR  And the second is 
OG  Santacruz Silver  SZSMF PK   This could be another First Majestic Silver Corp  NYSE AG   Santacruz already achieved production at its Rosario mine in Mexico and has a tremendous portfolio of promising Mexican projects  I think Santacruz has the right people to succeed 
TGR  Which companies stand out in the junior copper sector 
OG  I like two in Arizona and one in Nevada  My favorite is Augusta Resource Corporation  A5R DE  and its world class Rosemont copper project near Tucson  Richard Warke is a director  Augusta is currently in a takeover battle with its largest shareholder  HudBay Minerals Inc   HBM TSX  HBM NYSE   I believe that Augusta is worth more and remains a Hold recommendation  Mostly likely  a higher takeover price will be reached  When Rosemont gets its final construction permit this should happen in Q2 14 it will lead to a lucrative revaluation 
TGR  What s the other in Arizona 
OG  Curis Resources  PCCRF PK  and its Florence copper project  Like Augusta  Curis is in the final phase of the permitting process  I see excellent potential here for a revaluation after it gets its final permit  Florence will be a highly profitable copper mine with strong investment returns and an attractive and financeable mine capex  This story is led by the successful Hunter Dickinson Inc  mining crew  and the company has a very tight share structure 
Curis is employing a revolutionary in situ production method at Florence  It did its homework thoroughly and had great samples from BHP Billiton Ltd   BHP NYSE  BHPLF OTCPK   one of the former operators  Especially interesting is the recent strategic investment by major copper producer Taseko Mines Ltd   TKO TSX  TGB NYSE MKT   So Curis is a promising potential takeover target 
TGR  What s your Nevada copper pick 
OG  Nevada Copper Corp   NCU TO  and its Pumpkin Hollow project  In view of its last cash balance  its overall valuation is extremely low its enterprise value is really choked right now  But with the strong support of its largest shareholder  Pala Investments  it will be able  in my opinion  to put the first phase of its project into production  There is also tremendous development and expansion potential here 
TGR  Do you think that the recent downturn in gold equities might scare off investors who have become gun shy since 2011 
OG  The last three to five years in gold  especially junior mining  have been really traumatic and unnerving for investors  I really hope  however  that they will not be unduly influenced by the high volatility in these markets and sell after a 30  or 50  rally when there s potential for a 300  to 1 000  rally 
We have just seen the bottom  The cyclical nature of this market should lead to gains in best in class mining stocks of 500  to 1 000  and more  Investors must be not only long term ambitious but also patient

189794,411310,NEM,3 Metrics To Identify Superstar Investments,opinion,"Etienne Moshevich  editor of Alphastox com  looks at three things before he decides to get excited about a company  people  projects and structure  In this interview with The Mining Report  Moshevich explains his ground up approach to evaluating junior resource companies and names the names that are set to rake in the profits 
The Mining Report  Alphastox com follows junior equities in everything from gold  silver and diamonds to uranium  oil and gas  Why did you choose those particular market segments 
Etienne Moshevich  If you invested wisely and at the right time meaning in companies that have the right management teams  the right projects and the right capital structure there s a lot of upside in those segments  Every day I come to work  there s a new opportunity for me to relay to my subscribers 
TMR  Alphastox com is part of the larger Transcend Resource Group  How do you remain independent in your coverage 
EM  I m totally open in terms of my disclosure for every company I feature 
If I think a company offers good growth opportunity  I want to feature it  to help it build a track record  I m very open about whether I ve been paid  whether I own stock and at what price or if I m just looking at becoming an investor  I often feature companies that don t pay me or that are not Transcend clients 
TMR  In a recent research report you wrote that the junior mining sector is  not where it was in 2009  but it s definitely getting better   What makes you think that 
EM  In the last three months  more money has poured into the junior markets than in all of 2013  A lot more financings are being done  Banks are starting to raise money for exploration and development plays  Investors see that the game is back on  the institutional side is showing more interest 
The retail side is starting to follow along  You see transactions like Goldcorp Inc  NYSE GG  bid to take over Osisko Mining Corporation  OSK TO   You see Yamana Gold Inc  NYSE AUY  buying 50  of Osisko s assets  People see quality assets getting the recognition they deserve  and the market is reacting 
TMR  You ve written about mitigating risk in the junior resources market  How can investors reduce risk in their resource portfolio 
EM  To lower risk  number one  you have to diversify  Out of the 10 junior listed companies one invests in  some lose market share  and a couple may stay even  but you really hope one makes it big hopefully big enough to pay off all the other losses and then some  That s the name of the game 
However  the amount of capital needed to invest in several companies at the same time can pose a problem  Second  many retail investors don t have the necessary expertise to invest in the right company at the right price  That is why investors would greatly benefit by investing in a public vehicle that has the right management team to intelligently invest their capital  Zimtu Capital Corp   ZC TSX V  is a perfect example of this  By investing in one entity like a Zimtu Capital  you not only gain exposure to a number of different companies and decrease your risk  but you are also investing in an undervalued company where its asset value is worth more than its current market cap 
Which brings me to my next point  Invest in companies that are fundamentally sound companies that have cash in the bank  companies that are trading below cash or asset value and companies with the right structure  With the right capital structure  if the company were to make a real discovery  investors will get the appreciation and the valuation they deserve  Bottom line  you need to invest in companies with sound assets  whether that be cash or a project with real assets that can be objectively valued 
TMR  How do you determine which companies fit that profile 
EM  I look first at capital structure  even before looking at the people and the project  Oftentimes  companies with great management and great projects don t get the valuation they deserve because there s too much stock out there 
I need to know where 70 80  of the stock is before deciding to get involved in the deal  If you have investors with similar mindsets all rowing the boat in the same direction  you have a higher chance of success 
When it comes to people  I look at track records  I look for success  not just one discovery  but multiple successes 
TMR  How much do you like to see owned by the management team 
EM  I need to see at least 10  management ownership  If it s not good enough for management  how can it be good enough for others to invest in 
I make sure management is writing a check at the same level that I m writing a check  that management is buying stock in the market and putting it out on its Canadian Insider reports 
TMR  How do you react if management starts selling 
EM  I don t come to any conclusions right away  I speak with the CEO and get his reasons for the sale  then decide whether I m positive about the sale or not  Often  management will sell some stock  but will come back into the private placement if the company is doing one  I m fine with that 
Generally however  I try to make sure that a lot of the management stock is tied up so it can t be sold easily  If management sells into the market  no matter what the reason  the market will react negatively  It damages confidence  You can t blame the market for that 
TMR  Let s turn to your thesis for the oil and gas sector for 2014 and beyond 
EM  Oil and gas prices are going higher  I see a narrowing spread between West Texas Intermediate  WTI  and Brent  Canadian companies are now paying for their operations in Canadian dollars  but are getting paid back in U S  dollars  Geopolitical issues are creating higher demand for North American supply  The gloom and doom that hung over the sector due to worries over Canadian oil and gas production are fading  These are all positive signs 
Given increased demand for natural gas  I see those prices stabilizing in 2014 
TMR  Which companies do you follow in the oil and gas space 
EM  Crocotta Energy Inc   CTA TO  is one  It s about a  350 million   350M  market cap company that does about 10 000 barrels oil equivalent per day  10 Mboe d   The company is targeting its Edson play in Alberta and the Montney play out of British Columbia  Crocotta is taking a conservative approach to growth  going after stable and proven fields 
Jagercor Energy Corp   EM CNSX  JAMTF OTC  is basically a shell company right now  it has no asset  However  I invested in its last private placement at  0 20 share because I m betting on the management team  The company is run by Matias Bullrich  He spent 11 years at Morgan Stanley structuring energy deals in Argentina  which is where Jagercor is looking for an asset  I m betting on Bullrich and CEO Edgardo Russo  an ex YPF guy  to pick a good asset and get it financed 
Two years ago  no one in the oil and gas sector was bullish on Argentina because of the YPF SA  YPF NYSE  expropriation  Today  a lot more positive sentiment and capital are going into the country  Chevron Corporation  NYSE CVX   Royal Dutch Shell A  RDSa  and Wintershall Holding GmbH are paying between  7 5 10K acre  Yesterday  YPF and Chevron signed an agreement to invest  15 billion   15B  over 35 years  That s giving more confidence to the space 
TMR  Jagercor dropped 7  in one day in early April  Is volatility like that common with these stocks 
EM  Yes  If you re looking at it as a penny stock  that means the stock went down two pennies from  0 27 to  0 25 share  That might not seem like a lot  but yes it is 7 5   Investors need to be aware that penny stocks are risky  Your portfolio can go up 10 50  or down 70 80  in a day  You have to be patient 
TMR  Are there any other oil and gas companies you want to discuss 
EM  I follow Cub Energy Inc  KUB V   which has assets in Ukraine  The company is doing about 1 800 boe d  Mikhail Afendikov  its president and CEO  has lots of experience in the region  The company just announced that it is drilling its O 11 development well  Cub owns 30  of that well 
TMR  KUB Gas LLC owns the other 70   What s the relationship with KUB Gas 
EM  KUB Gas is Cub Energy s subsidiary  Cub Energy has a 30  ownership interest in KUB Gas 
TMR  This story is really about the netbacks isn t it 
EM  Yes  Cub s netbacks are very high  something I look for when evaluating oil and gas companies 
Two other companies I follow  in totally different jurisdictions  are Taipan Resources Inc  TPN V  and High North Resources Ltd   HN V  
I took a position in Taipan s latest financing at  0 36 share  The company has assets in East Africa  Africa Oil Corp  AOI V  got a massive valuation for its discovery in the same area  If Taipan does the same  the market will react and move the stock a lot higher 
High North is targeting its Montney wells in Alberta  The company just closed about  8 5M on a convertible debenture led by GMP Capital Inc  High North is doing about 350 bbl d now  We saw great results from its first two Montney wells and I expect more from the third well that it is drilling now  President and CEO Collin Soares has been very successful with privately held companies  He has the right people in place to guide High North on the public side 
TMR  Is it easier for companies to get financing through private placements  given that capital is more difficult to come by these days 
EM  Definitely  Sentiment is becoming more positive  Investors are more willing to put money into the right deals  Companies are more able to raise money without having to restructure  But both retail investors and the investment banks are a lot pickier in terms of which deals they decide to raise money for  That weeds out a lot of the deals that should not be in the game in the first place 
TMR  Uranium is another energy play getting fresh attention  Is that just about Fission Uranium Corp s   FCU V  big discovery in the Athabasca Basin or is this a larger story 
EM  In the long term  the outlook for uranium is positive  and the discovery that Fission and Alpha Exploration Inc   AEX TSX V  made in the Athabasca Basin is huge  There were only three big winners in 2013 for investors  in terms of penny stocks going to multiple dollars  Zenyatta Ventures Ltd   ZEN V  went from  0 30 to  5 share  Alpha went from  0 20 to over  7 50 share and Fission from  0 20 0 30 to close to  2 share  When investors saw that two of the three big winners were in the uranium space  they started moving there 
TMR  Beyond the discovery itself  it was about the discovery being a different deposit model in a structure thought to be barren of uranium mineralization  This could be a game changer  no 
EM  I agree  it opens a lot of doors  People forget that Fission was spun out of Strathmore Minerals Corp   STM TSX  STHJF OTCQX   Fission is exploring assets that Strathmore had not  This gives people hope that the majors may have overlooked properties and that a junior could leap to being a developer and vastly expand its market cap 
TMR  What other companies operating in the basin could benefit from this renewed interest 
EM  Skyharbour Resources Ltd   SYH V  is one  It s run by Jordan Trimble  When the company got into the uranium sector  it syndicated with a few partners  Now  it s the largest landholder around Fission s discovery  Skyharbor is fully funded for this program 
TMR  To some investors  Jordan Trimble might seem rather young  What would you say to them 
EM  He is young  but I d much rather invest with somebody who s willing to work and market his company every single day  I don t care how old somebody is  Skyharbor stock more than tripled from  0 04 to  0 14 share over the last year  so he has made his investors substantial profits  All that matters are the returns  and Jordan Trimble has delivered them so far 
I judge people on track record and what they can bring to the table  He is an extremely hard worker  He brought a lot of contacts from the market side into the business when he stepped in as president and CEO  He s always willing to tell his story  nonstop 
Trimble has the right team in place  Skyharbour has the right advisors helping run the field and exploration programs  people like Thomas Drolet  Rick Kusmirski  who ran JNR Resources Inc   JNN TSX V  JNRRF OTCPK   and Jim Pettit  the CEO of Bayfield Ventures Corp   BYV TSX V   These are successful people  Any successful company needs one guy who knows the geology and the project inside out  and can lead a drill program  You need guys with capital markets experience and capital markets contacts  Jordan brings those contacts to the table 
TMR  Skyharbour just acquired 60  of the Mann Lake uranium project  What do you make of that 
EM  I think Skyharbour got a great project at a cheap price  for  15 000 and 1M shares  It offers investors a nice bonus property  Mann Lake gives Skyharbour another chance to make a discovery in the basin 
TMR  What other companies do you follow in the Athabasca Basin 
EM  Lakeland Resources Inc   LK TSX V  has done extremely well for investors  going from  0 10 share to a high of  0 295 in January 
Lakeland s President and CEO is Jonathan Armes  He has great support for financing and market from Dave Hodge and Ryan Fletcher of Zimtu Capital  one of Lakeland s largest shareholders  It may take some time  but we see Lakeland rewarding shareholders over the next three to six months  Recently  Lakeland did an option with Declan Resources inc  LAN V   another company that I ve talked about and whose stock I own  Declan has an option to earn up to 70  of Lakeland s Gibbon s Creek project by incurring  6 5M of staged exploration expenditures 
Lakeland has a great model and a very tight share structure  At Gibbon s Creek  for example  Declan is committed to spending about  1 25M in the first year  Declan brings a great team to the table  as well with David Miller as their new CEO  Miller used to run Strathmore Minerals  bought by Energy Fuels in late 2013   Altogether  both Lakeland and Declan have built a solid asset base and large scale presence in the Basin  Lakeland is well funded  having recently closed an oversubscribed  2 8M private placement and can continue to build its asset base and advance its projects by exploration  joint ventures  and options  Look for Declan to follow suit shortly 
TMR  Moving on to copper  prices have hovered around  3 pound   3 lb  since early March  Where do you think the price is headed 
EM  I think copper prices are going to stabilize and then could increase over the next 12 18 months 
One reason is China  I think China s demand will rise  Chinese utilities account for around 40  of Chinese copper demand  The State Grid Corporation of China  SGSC  provides power to 80  of the world s second largest economy  SGSC recently reported it would boost its annual investment to more than  60B  That sort of increase in capital investment should firm up or increase prices 
The second reason is supply  A number of weather issues  strikes and scheduled maintenance at major facilities flattened the growth in copper production  A hold on supply should increase the price 
TMR  Are you following any copper stories 
EM  I am  One is Kombat Copper Inc  KBT V   The company has the right guys in place to take the project to the next level  It just brought Justin Reed on as chairman  He is the president of Sulliden Gold Corporation Ltd  SUE TO  and used to be the head of mining and metals at National Bank Financial  He brings a lot of capital market experience and contacts on the Street  Kombat s president and CEO Bill Nielsen  formerly vice president of exploration at Nevsun Resources Ltd   AMEX NSU   was there when that company made its big discovery on the Bisha Gold volcanogenic massive sulfide deposit 
The project in Namibia is very good  This month  Kombat will release an initial resource report  followed by a preliminary economic assessment  The initial resource will come from a historic  past producing mine  The existing infrastructure will cut down on a lot of the cost 
TMR  Kombat owns an 80  interest in five mining licenses and five exclusive prospecting licenses  Who owns the other 20  
EM  It varies from project to project 
TMR  What is Kombat s core focus 
EM  It will be on the Kombat mine  the past producing  underground copper mine I mentioned  Over 54 years  it produced 12 million tonnes  12 Mmt  of ore between 2 5 3  copper  Kombat hopes to prove there s a lot more there 
If Kombat can show an initial resource of 2 Mmt grading at 2 5   the company could be looking at a market cap a lot greater than where it currently stands at  16 17M  That doesn t even take into consideration the tailings 
In its presentation  the company estimates it has 17 400 tonnes  At  6 500 per tonne  that pencils out to more than  110M  If you assume 60  recovery  that s  68M going to Kombat 
TMR  How soon could it be in production 
EM  Probably 18 to 24 months 
TMR  Any other copper names 
EM  Freyja Resources Inc   FRA TSX V  is trying to take its Las Cristinas copper project in Mexico into production  The company just raised money on the debt and equity side  The next step is to turn the company into a small scale producer and generate real cash flow 
Alain Lambert is its chairman  He wants to fund further exploration work with the cash flow the company generates from its production  which I like  Too many companies keep going back to the public markets to raise more equity and dilute their structure 
TMR  What do you think of Mexico as a copper jurisdiction 
EM  I like it  Mexico has very rich copper resources and high grades  Some districts are favorable to mining  It drives a lot of the Mexican economy 
TMR  Do you follow any precious metals stories 
EM  Definitely  Ascot Resources Ltd   AOT V  just released an NI 43 101 resource of 2 85 Moz at just over 1 gram per ton  1 g t  Indicated on its Premier Dilworth project near Stewart  British Columbia  not far from Pretium Resources Inc   PVG  project 
Ascot s management team is second to none  John Toffan is the CEO  He ran Westfield Securities  He took Delaware Resources from  0 30 to  26 share  by discovering gold in the Steward area  Then he started Stikine Resources Ltd   the Eskay Creek discovery that went from  0 10 to  75 share  Even better  John has brought Bob Evans  Stikine s CFO and many of Stikine s biggest backers to Ascot 
Ascot is close to a  95M market cap  In addition to its Premier project  Ascot has a gravel pit filled with 66 Mmt of gravel  That s important because liquid Natural Gas plants use a lot of gravel  Ascot s Swamp Point gravel deposit could be one of the cheapest deposits around  Several LNG plants in the area are exploring a deal with Ascot  At  4 50 t  66 Mmt is worth  300M  That s a significant cash injection 
The company also has the Mt  Margaret project in Washington state  That is a 523 Mmt  NI 43 101 non compliant historic resource from Duval Corp in 1980  Ascot has the Bureau of Land Management permits and will hopefully be developing that resource later this year 
I ve also been looking at Source Exploration Corp  SOP V   It just announced 97 meters  97m  of 2 7 g t gold equivalent ounces at its Las Minas project in Mexico  The results are very promising  These are shallow holes  It won t take a lot of money  The company drilled more than 22 holes on  320K  With such low all in costs  Ascot will be able to generate incredible results 
David Baker  who s now the chairman of Source Exploration  accumulated his stock in Source in the market while he was still at Goldbrook Ventures Inc  The moment he sold Goldbrook for  100M to a Chinese group  he fell in love with Las Minas and decided that Source Exploration would be his next venture 
TomaGold Coporation  LOT V  is one of the first companies I featured on Alphastox com  The company completed a  17 5M joint venture with IAMGold Corporation  IAG  recently  IAMGOLD is now heading up TomaGold s Monster Lake project  having to spend  17 5M to acquire a 50  stake  Toma drilled a hole that hit over 237 g t on its Monster Lake Project a couple of years ago  and the stock ran to  0 96  IAMGOLD values the Monster Lake asset at  35M and the company now has a  10M market cap and the program is just starting up again  This is a very exciting time for TomaGold  David Grondin  Toma s CEO  is extremely hard working and always works to add value for his shareholders  One way or another  I believe in Toma and the potential of its assets and more importantly  the team which surrounds it 
TMR  One more 
EM  Sure  Great Bear Resources Ltd   GBR TSX V  is looking to potentially develop a 2 Moz NI 43 101 non compliant exploration target first drilled by Newmont Mining Corporation  NYSE NEM  and Bhp Billiton  BBL  Ltd  in the late 1980 s  The company has a very tight share structure  with about 17M shares out  It has about  1 1M cash in its treasury  It hopes to get its exploration permit in May or June and assess its drilling options then 
Atna Resources Ltd   ATN TO  is another cyanide heap leach producer in the same county  California once posed a lot of environmental hurdles for mining  That is changing because the state is not doing very well financially 
TMR  It may be changing  but not quickly enough for the appetite of most investors 
EM  Previously  many projects couldn t even get exploration permits because of the environmental lobbyists  That has changed  there are active mining operations in the area today 
TMR  That s a positive outlook on an unexpected topic to end our conversation  Etienne  thanks for your time and insights

189807,411323,NEM,Gold Miners Fall  But Remain Out Of The Ditch,opinion,This morning  the leading gold mining stocks are declining at the start of the trading session  This important sector can be followed by viewing the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF  GDX   Today  the GDX is trading lower by 0 50 cents to  28 59 a share  It is important to note that GDX is still trading above its recent low of  26 24 which was made on May 20  2013  Should the GDX rally from this current level there is still a good chance that the upside gap fill level at  32 22 could still be a possible target  The key for the GDX is to remain above the recent low of  26 24 on a daily chart closing basis  Should price fall below that key low then there could be much further downside in the cards for the GDX  Day traders can watch for intra day support around the  28 40  and  27 90 levels  Some leading gold mining stocks that are trading slightly lower today include  Randgold Resources Limited  GOLD   Goldcorp Inc   GG   Yamana Gold  Inc   AUY  and Newmont Mining Corporation  NEM   All of these leading gold mining stocks will remain very volatile due to all of the global currency fluctuation that is occurring at this time ,2013-06-11,Nicholas Santiago,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold-miners-fall,-but-remain-out-of-the-ditch-170882",170882
189808,411324,NEM,Roger Wiegand  A Brand New World For Gold,opinion,The quant who produces Trader Tracks newsletter tells The Gold Report that the technical charts project a brightening future for precious metals  Technical market analyst Roger Wiegand tracks annual trading cycles while keeping an expert eye on potentially disruptive world events  He is a stickler for fundamentals  though  when it comes to picking out the best juniors for safe bets in a cash poor industry   The Gold Report  In early 2012  Roger  you predicted that the price of gold would rise to over  2 000 ounce   2 000 oz  during the year  But as the overall stock market increased in value  the yellow metal went in the opposite direction  What happened   Roger Wiegand  Two things happened  First  the last gold peak almost made it  It went to  1 923 oz  and that was a technical and fundamental top  Then it sold down  The other thing that happened is that the U S  Treasury intentionally sold gold to protect the stock and bond markets  Treasury feared that if gold ran up too high too quickly  people would dump securities en masse   We are in the seasonal cycle when many markets go sideways  We have seen the selloff at the end of last week  A triple bottom is extremely bullish  The snap back in the price going long could be impressive   TGR  What factors are keeping gold down in the near term   RW  Gold is taking a pounding since the big bullion banks have full control and they have to cover their radical short positions taken at the behest of the FOMC and U S  Treasury to preserve the fiat markets  Briefly  they kept the gold market under control to prevent a runaway for the FOMC and are now using TARP bank capital and derivative dollars to drive gold to the basement  Next  they are accumulating all the gold bullion they can to preserve their wealth in the forthcoming legendary crash  In addition  they get to buy it on the cheap as the dumb money is in full exit in fear   Also  China  South Korea and Japan have problems and each central bank is dealing American bonds  Recently  China sold American paper through its own markets in order to offload Treasury bonds for currency  All kinds of problems are looming in China  some experts claim that China s export trade numbers are only half of what was actually reported  South Korea is clearly weakening  and Japan is experiencing an emergency  causing it to stimulate at twice Mr  Bernanke s rate  That is simply unsustainable  Japan is the Achilles heel of the whole financial system  If the yen runs away  it s a disaster   What does that mean for gold  Starting in August  the price will likely rise until the end of September  Then harsh political and economic factors will create serious problems in the global markets  I m calling for a 50  correction in the U S  stock markets in Q4 13   TGR  In your June 6 newsletter  you said that we are on the verge of a brand new world   RW  The brand new world is imminent because the lessons of 2008 were not learned  The banks are doing the same bad things they were doing before the crash  only worse  The derivative markets are larger now than they were back then  A huge number of student loans might well be written off  And the real estate market is doing a rerun  Incredible  People with foreclosures who may not be qualified for a new mortgage are receiving Federal Housing Authority insured loans in a desperate effort to try to prop up the home loan industry  which is a major sector of the U S  economy   We are in a depression  not a recession  The real numbers for unemployment in the U S  are 25   They were 25  in the 1930s  In Spain  54  of the workers under age 25 are unemployed  The down the hill slide is global and in slow motion  People still believe a lot of media nonsense  but this market simply has not corrected  The ultimate jobs program will be a new war   TGR  Where do you think a war will break out  Roger   RW  Iraq is cranking up for another round  War is on the agenda in Turkey  Libya has bad problems  not to mention the horror that is Syria  China is beating a war drum  but that s just talk  North Korea is not capable of going to war  But more wars over energy resources will continue to break out in the Middle East   War creates jobs  World War II ended the Depression of the 1930s  I don t think there will be a nuclear war  but three or four conventional wars can go on simultaneously  hire a lot of people  square away the economy and get things righted in the bond market   TGR  Given such a dismal scenario  how will that affect the price of bullion and shares in gold mining firms   RW  In the short term  gold and silver shares will follow the futures and cash markets  We are still in a corrective phase  which can last for another six weeks  But once gold and silver start to climb  the shares will follow  It s a big mistake right now for people to unload shares in good junior companies just because the stock has been beaten down  The companies with good fundamentals and enough cash to sustain operations for the next two to three years are going to do better  Look for good management with a project next door to a senior that is going to buy out reserves  Cash starved greenfield juniors out in the middle of nowhere with no senior around to buy them out will not make it  It is like the salmon going upstream some fish fall by the streamside  some make it home to nest   TGR  What technical tools do you use to analyze the future of gold   RW  I look at the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF  GDXJ   which is the Index for the juniors group  Right now  the graph of that technical tool looks like an upside down head and shoulders  and that s very bullish  It is going to take a few more weeks for the junior stocks to pick up steam  TGR  Do you have any junior names that meet your criteria for success   RW  Watch California Gold Mining Inc   CGM TSX V  at  0 08 share  The company has top management from Northern Gold Mining Inc   NGM TSX V   It is located in a region with gold mining activity historically  Six mines are in various stages at that location  California Gold Mining stock had a low of  0 03 and a high of  0 24 share  Technically  we add the high and low and divide by two and find a 50  retracement  That is half of  0 27 or almost  0 14  The company has money and it has strong backers   One of the standards out there that has been very good to our readers for the last four years is Timmins Gold Corp   TGD   It is a steady play  always on the upswing  When the futures and the cash markets rise  Timmons runs alongside  The near term price is between  2 50 and  2 75 share  We re looking at  2 85 to  3 share in the next 30 60 days  roughly   We have followed Canasil Resources Inc   CLZ TSX V  for years  It is trading around  0 055 share  Rounding to  0 06  we are looking at  0 125 as a goal within 90 days  A key point with Canasil is it is primarily a silver exploring company in northern Mexico  Its partner is MAG Silver Corp   MVG   and the two companies just signed a partnership agreement  expanding a major project with an injection of several million dollars  MAG Silver has a lot of capital  MAG Silver s Peter Megaw is one of the top geologists in the business  He told me that the company plans to build a 100 million ounce silver reserve and make it as big as the biggest of the precious metal mines in Mexico  So far  it is doing exactly that  Canasil also has some wonderful projects in British Columbia that just got permits   At Trader Tracks  we like Santacruz Silver Mining Ltd   SCZ TSX V  at CA 1 15 share  We are looking for a 50  retracement back to CA 1 75 share   And there is Gold Standard Ventures Corp   GSV  in Nevada  right next door to Newmont Mining Corp   NEM NYSE   The chief geologist for Newmont has done the exploratory work and the results look good  The firm s shares have big support by some very wealthy investors and are going up  The price was down to CA 0 50 share in May  and it is at CA 0 67 today  Gold Standard Ventures is the perfect example of a company that is building good reserves next door to a senior that  in my opinion  is going to buy it out   One of our old favorites is Hecla Mining Co   HL   Today  it is at  2 79 share  The company went through a spate of problems during the last three years  But after settling a lawsuit with the Environmental Protection Agency  it expanded the Lucky Friday mine in Idaho  It bought out Rio Tinto Plc s  RIO NYSE  RIO ASX  partnership shares there  It now totally owns the Greens Creek project on Admiralty Island in Alaska  which has a silver life of 50 years  That island mine was running on electricity generators  and now it is connected by wire to the mainland  Hecla has been busy with a gold mine in northern Mexico in an area that is very rich  with four seniors operating in the region  We are looking for a high of  4 88 share in three to six months  Hecla s stock likes to go to  8 or  9 share  and then retreat on a correction   TGR  Roger  can you tell us what kind of technical information you look at to come up with your recommendations   RW  I am mainly a chartist and a technician  but one cannot neglect the fundamentals  particularly considering the state of political economy in the world  First off  does a firm have good management  Is it located in an area that s politically reliable  Does it have expertise in engineering and geology  Then  we look at valuations   Remember  if you want to find gold or silver  go where the old mines have been prolific  Just because a lot of ore has been pulled out successfully does not mean that there is not more there to be mined  California Gold is a perfect example  The two big mines that Hecla runs in Idaho and Alaska are examples  The old mines in northern Mexico are loaded with silver  First Majestic Silver Corp   AG  is an intermediate size miner in Mexico that has done exceedingly well  Its stock is lofty in price  but the company continues to prove its way down the road and make money by expanding the business   After assessing the fundamentals  we examine the technical side with a long range chart of 5 or 10 years  Then we narrow it down to a one year chart  We next narrow it down to the cycles  Historically  gold and silver do very well between Nov  1 through April  From May through mid August  everything slows down  The annual fall rallies start the second or third week of August and run until the middle of October  Traders and investors in gold and silver know that the two big contracts in Q4 for gold and silver are the December futures  and they expire in November   TGR  The futures explain the cycles   RW  Yes  August gold is not that big a deal  December is the really big one for gold  In silver  March is the big one  July is less important  September is big because it s in the middle of the peak season going higher  The other big cycle for silver is December  So keep these cycles in mind when trading and investing  Those are the times of year a trader or investor with average experience can profit from quantification  Chart the time of year when prices consistently bottom out and then start to rise   TGR  Any junior names for us outside of North America   RW  We follow Global Minerals Ltd   CTG TSX V  in Slovakia  It has great reserves  It is a previously exploited  proven mine  Slovakia is a business friendly  Westernized country with all the big auto and consumer companies operating there  Global Minerals had a dewatering project that went on for about eight months  The pumping is completed  and the engineers and geologists are working at the 3 000 foot level  doing the exploratory work for the next move   TGR  Do you own stock in Global Minerals   RW  I trade futures and commodities  Because I recommend stocks for the Trader Tracks newsletter  ethically I cannot buy them  That breaks my heart  sometimes  because I ve seen some dandies that I knew were going to do well  But I personally trade futures in gold  silver  currencies  the energy sector and grains   TGR  Any parting advice  Roger   RW  Please have patience  gold investors  Some analysts are predicting crazy numbers  like  900 oz  Not me   TGR  Thanks  Roger   Roger Wiegand aka Traderrog produces Trader Tracks newsletter to

189810,411326,NEM,Gold Gets Crushed Again,opinion,Friday was volatile  and when the dust settled  gold was crushed again   Friday s decline of 3 1  in gold  GLD  brought the precious metal s yearly decline to more than 25  as it has fallen from the  1650 oz level to Friday s close of  1212  The sell off this time was due to the strong monthly jobs report which led to a spike in interest rates  a spike in the U S  dollar  UUP  and more conviction that the Federal Reserve would end it s easy money policies sooner rather than later  On a technical basis  gold  IAU  is locked in a strong bear market  however  is reaching oversold levels  So a great debate is now breaking out over whether now is the time to buy or is the twelve year bull market over and lower prices still lie ahead Bulls make several viable arguments 1  Gold is a good way to diversify portfolios 2  The cost of the metal is nearing or below the cost of production and so miners will soon stop production which will crimp supplies and hike demand 3  Gold has always been seen as a store of value in the age of fiat currencies 4  Demand continues from India and China in the retail sector and from several central banks around the world Bears  on the other hand  point out that we re in a new world now that the Federal Reserve appears ready to cut back on its asset buying program 1  Interest rates will rise which is negative for gold 2  The dollar will rise which is negative for gold 3  If the U S  economy continues to improve  there will be less demand for a  flight to safety  trade 4  With still relatively weak employment and economic growth  inflation is likely to remain low and so precious metals lose their luster as an inflation hedge Many hedge funds have been on the wrong side of the recent declines in gold and institutional selling has added to the magnitude of the recent rout in bullion and other commodities  Producers have also been hurt by the recent decline with Barrick Gold Crop   ABX  the biggest producer of gold in the world  losing 6  on Friday and Newmont Mining   NEM  a member of the S P 500   SPY  falling 4 3  For now  it appears that gold prices could head still lower as the Federal Reserve unwinds its quantitative easing programs and the price hasn t yet fallen below the cost of production Gold bears can consider the following ETFs PowerShares DB Short Gold ETN  DGZ  This ETN tracks the inverse daily performance of the Deutsche Bank Optimum Yield Gold Excess Return Index and uses a single gold futures contract ProShares UltraShort Gold  GLL  This leveraged ETF is designed to produce 200  the inverse of the daily performance of gold bullion Gold bulls can think about these ETFs SPDR Gold Shares  GLD  This ETF tracks the price of gold bullion and is the world s largest gold ETF ProShares Ultra Gold  UGL  A leveraged gold ETF designed to deliver 2X the price of the underlying price of gold bullion Of course  leveraged ETFs come with their own caveats and cautions and so investors need to understand how these work before venturing into these volatile waters Bottom line  Speculators and investors  bull and bear alike  will be watching for opportunity in the fast moving world of gold bullion  Investors with a contrarian streak and long term time horizon could start to see value at current levels and perhaps try to  catch the falling knife  while technicians see still lower prices ahead  While the future direction of gold  particularly over the short term  remains cloudy  the  barbarous relic  will always fascinate investors  and this fast moving market will provide ongoing opportunities for nimble traders with well thought out trading and risk management strategies Disclaimer  The content included herein is for educational and informational purposes only  and readers agree to Wall Street Sector Selector s     and  before accessing or using this or any other publication by Wall Street Sector Selector or Ridgeline Media Group  LLC ,2013-07-07,John Nyaradi,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold-gets-crushed-again-174307,174307
189811,411327,NEM,Are You Looking For Miners In Nevada ,opinion,Investment Thesis We will see some price consolidation before the next bull market in gold starts again  Nevada could fuel the  junior  mining sector  with some interesting new discoveries going forward Background Gold stocks are in bear market territory  but we think it s only temporary  The price of gold crossed the  1 900 mark per ounce in 2011  fueled by fears in the financial markets and the general belief that gold was a safe haven  Last October  gold was changing hands for  1 754 per ounce  Since then  however  the price of gold has fallen hard  weakening dramatically in recent weeks   click to enlarge  The Gloom and Doom scenario would take us to the  700  900 range for gold  Personally we don t think this will happen and we firmly believe trading will be above the  1100 level  Gold Constraints Gold is viewed as a hedge against rapid inflation and against the collapse of the banking system  an event that would be expected to have deflationary expectations  That gives gold bugs an each way bet and also makes it hard to interpret the signal being sent by a rise  or fall  in the gold price  It does not help that gold has no cashflows  This makes it very difficult to put a value on the metal in the way that one can suggest a stock with a price earnings ratio of 50 looks overpriced  It also allows for a wide range of forecasts  Standard Chartered says the superbull case is for  4869 an ounce by 2020  Tim Lee of pi Economics  a monetarist  is going for  700 in 12 months  time  One common criteria that value investors are looking for is cash flow and which companies have the ability to be self sustainable  Keep a close eye on emerging gold and silver producers in mining friendly jurisdictions looking to increase production  resource growth and of free cash flow  With that said  the place investors can look for buying opportunities is the U S  The state of Nevada is such an area which could turn the coin and reap the fruits going forward  Nevada Gold mining in Nevada is a major industry  and one of the largest sources of gold in the world  Nevada currently produces 82  of all the gold mined in the United States  over six million ounces in 2007  Almost all the gold in Nevada comes from large open pit mining and cyanide heap leaching recovery  The state is host to minerals including gold  silver  copper  precious opal and diatomite  with particular focus on precious metals  Nevada is also the leading producer of barite and gypsum in the country  Major gold mines in the area include the Goldstrike Mine owned by Barrick  ABX   the Coeur Rochester Mine owned by Coeur D Alene Mines  CDE WT   and the Twin Creeks Mine owned by Newmont Mining  NEM   These mines contribute to the state s overall gold production which accounts for 87  of the country s gold production  Nevada s deep investments in gold mining means it is the third largest gold producer in the world after South America and Australia  Nevada has a strong mining history  dating back to 1849 when gold was first discovered near Dayton  This initial discovery led prospectors to silver in the Comstock Lode  which made Virginia City  Nevada  one of the most famous boomtowns in the country s history  The Comstock Lode  for instance  produced 8 6 million troy ounces  267 tonnes  of gold through 1959  and the Eureka district produced 1 2 million troy ounces  37 3 tonnes   Since these initial discoveries  mining has played an integral part in Nevada s economy  directly and indirectly employing thousands of people  In 2011  the natural resources and mining sector created 500 new jobs and  as of December 2011  there were 12 900 jobs in the sector  In February 2012 the Nevada Mining Association s informal survey found that the industry will create between 1 200 and 1 500 new jobs this year  Every year Nevada mining provided approximately US 100 million in state tax revenue  The  Nevada  Candidates Barrick Gold Barrick Gold Corp   ABX  is the gold industry leader  The company operates mines and advanced exploration and development projects on four continents  and holds large land positions on some of the most prolific and prospective mineral trends  Coeur Mining Coeur Mining  Inc   CDE  is a large primary silver producer with growing gold production with assets in the United States  Mexico  Bolivia  Argentina and Australia  Coeur also owns strategic minority shareholdings in eight silver and gold development companies in North and South America  The Palmarejo mine in Mexico  San Bartolom  mine in Bolivia and Rochester mine in Nevada all produce silver and gold in dor  form  Coeur s Kensington gold mine in Alaska produces gold concentrate and the Endeavor mine in Australia produces a concentrate that contains silver  In 2013  Coeur expects to produce between 18 0 and 19 5 million ounces of silver and between 250 000 and 265 000 ounces of gold  Newmont Mining Newmont Mining Corporation  NEM  is primarily a gold producer  with significant assets or operations in the United States  Australia  Peru  Indonesia  Ghana  New Zealand and Mexico  Founded in 1921 and publicly traded since 1925  Newmont is one of the world s largest gold producers and is the only gold company included in the S P 500 Index and Fortune 500  Headquartered near Denver  Colorado  the company has around 40 000 employees and contractors worldwide  Allied Nevada Gold Corp  Allied Nevada  ANV  is a US based gold mining and exploration company  which operates its wholly owned Hycroft gold mine located near Winnemucca  Nevada  The company also owns more than 100 advanced and early stage exploration properties located throughout the State of Nevada  The company s focus is on internal growth strategies  including the development of the Hycroft mine from a run of mine heap leach operation to a world class  large scale heap leach a milling operation  This will be accomplished through a logically staged growth plan involving the acceleration of the current mining rate for the heap leach operation  which is currently underway  construction of a gyratory crushing system expected to be completed mid 2013 and construction of a milling facility to treat sulfide material  Pershing Gold An emerging producer in Nevada is Pershing Gold Corporation  PGLC   This newly formed gold exploration and development company purchased the Relief Canyon Mine in Nevada in August 2011  The company bought the mine at a very low price out of bankruptcy  Relief Canyon Gold Mine produced gold intermittently since 1984  but was abandoned when the parent company ran into financial problems  Pershing has bought some land around the mine and is preparing to resume drilling and expanding the mine with a goal of production in early 2014  if not sooner  The company is also debt free and they have obtained almost all of the permits necessary to go back into production  While the Pershing has not yet released detailed preliminary for the Relief Canyon project  CEO Alfers stated that the economics appear to be robust  Relief Canyon is highly attractive with initial annual production of 50k gold equivalent ounces  ramping up to 100k ounces  Pershing s Relief Canyon mine alone has an all in costs estimation of  750  775 per ounce  This may just be the beginning of major institutions becoming aware of this emerging Nevada producer  Smart money is already invested  The largest shareholder in addition to Coeur Mining is Phillip Frost  Mr  Frost made his fortune by selling drug manufacturer Ivax to Teva Pharmaceuticals for  7 6 billion in 2005  He is also a successful investor in Opka Health  OPK  and Muscle Pharm Corp   MSLP OB   Final Note There s a compelling reason for investors to hold gold in their portfolios  Prices should start to stabilize once there s a significant reduction in supply as miners cut back  Some miners may hold   depending on their cash flow situation   some production and inventory for a while just to see what happens  Other miners will start to close down some of the more costly mines  spend less on exploration and invest less in general  We think Nevada will be the place to be the coming years   click to enlarge Main Risk  Profitability Problems Gold falling below  1 200 an ounce is certainly at the level where miners  especially the smaller ones  will face profitability issues  According to industry experts  the total cost of production varies between  1 000 and  1 200 an ounce depending on the scale of a miner s

189838,411354,NEM,Gold Mining Margins 3,opinion,Gold mining is a very tough business  Not only is it highly capital intensive and chock full of environmental risks  its revenues are entirely at the mercy of a volatile commodity  It requires some serious mettle to succeed mining gold But despite super high barriers to entry and the countless risk factors that come with mining  the world needs gold  and somebody s got to produce it  And believe it or not  a lot of money can be made in this business At a high level  gold mining is like any other business  Produce your product at costs less than what you sell it for  and you ought to prosper  And the wider that spread  the more you prosper  But unlike most other business  the  what you sell it for  is an uncontrollable variable that can violently move in either direction For gold miners the dangling carrot is a rising gold price  And naturally the best of times ought to occur over the course of a bull market for the metal  Gold has of course been party to one heck of a bull run over the last decade or so  with its price soaring by a staggering 638  from its 2001 low to 2011 high  Given this kind of gain  many gold miners have easily chomped that carrot on the way to big gains of their own And gold miners  represented by gold stocks  have indeed had quite a run over gold s secular bull  As measured by the venerable HUI gold stock index  the gold stocks have leveraged gold s gains by greater than two to one to their own 2011 highs Unfortunately even though gold stocks have sported some of the best gains of the 2000s  they ve always resided in somewhat of a stealth sector that has captured little mainstream attention  And typically any mainstream attention they do get is critical  with one of the biggest critiques being their perceived inability to make money I ve long scratched my head at this assertion  And fortunately it hasn t really mattered given how much money gold stocks have made us and our newsletter subscribers here at Zeal  But since I m an inquisitive guy  I put this assertion to the test  From a simple ground floor perspective  is there a way to show that the gold miners at least have the opportunity to turn a profit  Because if they do  the good ones will do so Basic MetricsIn order to begin to answer this question I like to look at one of the most basic financial metrics  gross margin  Gross margin is calculated by subtracting cost of goods sold from revenue  and then dividing that tally by revenue  In its simplest sense  gross margin represents the percent of revenue a miner retains after incurring operating costs  The higher the margin  the more the miner retains on each dollar of revenue  Check out the bull to date average gross margins for the gold miners  For gold miners gross margin is quite easy to calculate  Their cost of goods sold is called cash operating costs  reported on a per ounce basis  These cash costs are essentially the cumulative direct input costs of mining an ounce of gold  Labor  energy  and consumables are typically the largest costs  And they combine for a dollar amount that is hopefully much less than the price of gold  For the purposes of this exercise  I use the cash costs of the stocks that comprise the HUI  These globally diversified miners are the biggest and best in the world  and account for over a third of the total mined supply  While certainly not all encompassing  it is a fair representation of the industry as a whole  For simplicity s sake I use the simple average cash costs of the HUI s primary gold miners all the way back to 2001  red bars   the first year of gold s secular bull  This average cash cost is then scrubbed up against the average daily gold price each year  blue bars   And with these two numbers I m able to calculate gross margin  yellow  and the associated spread  white   First and foremost we see the price of gold consistently rising year after year  a delicious trend for the mining companies  If they can control their costs  they should be rolling in the dough  But as you can see  cost control has certainly been a challenge for the miners  Amazingly back in 2001 the miners were producing their gold at cash operating costs of only  176 per ounce  Now this seems incredibly low today  but when you consider that the average price of gold that year was only  272  there wasn t much wiggle room if the miners wanted a shot at making money  most gold miners were not profitable in the late years of gold s preceding bear and the first few years of the existing bull   Over the first five years of gold s bull market  cash costs rose by a staggering 43  to  253  In any other industry costs rising this sharply would spell disaster  a recipe for going out of business  For gold miners though  this rise in costs was outpaced by a corresponding 63  rise in the price they could sell their underlying product for  And this led to a growth in gross margins to the 40   range  which is quite impressive  In 2006 cash costs saw an anomalous year of stability  But in 2007 they fell back into trend with a sharp ascent higher  In fact  over the last six years gold miners  cash operating costs have risen by an annual average of 19   2012 s average cash cost of  719 is a crazy 184  higher than 2006  Put into a different light  2012 s cash costs are over  100 higher than 2006 s gold price  And they re a staggering four fold what they were at the beginning of the bull  Again  costs rising at this rate of ascent would have spelled doom for most industries  Thankfully also beginning in 2006 gold s price really started to take off  And over the same period where cash costs rose by 184   the price of gold rose by 176   And led by gold s big rise in 2006   36   by far the largest bull to date annual rise   precedent was set for an increase in average gross margins to the 50   range  Yes  cash costs are rising sharply  And I discuss the many reasons for this  intentional unintentional low grading and huge increases in input costs among the bigger reasons  in a   But as you can see  gross margins are not being pinched given the offset of rising gold prices  Overall these robust margins and widening spreads show that the gold miners do in fact have the opportunity to turn a profit  But even though 2012 s average gross margin of 57  was close to the best we ve seen in this entire bull market  the vast throngs of haters just don t seem to care  As hardened contrarians we ve grown accustomed to unrighteous gold stock bashing  And even though most of the criticism slung our way is emotionally based  fundamentals and performance be damned  there is some criticism that s perhaps justified  And it is based on the notion that costs outside of cash operating costs greatly diminish what is represented by conventional gross margins  Provocatively while conventional cash costs cover the mine level operating costs of producing an ounce of gold  they don t actually cover the all in total costs of producing that same ounce  Even though cash costs are effective for peer to peer comparisons and they do paint a picture of potential profitability  I ll be the first to admit they are a window dressed non GAAP performance measure that doesn t necessarily tell the entire story  Though I personally still don t have a problem using cash operating costs as a legitimate performance measure  this metric s criticism has prompted some revolutionary changes in the way gold miners will report on their costs in the very near future  And these changes are the product of an initiative set forth by the members of the World Gold Council that will hopefully silence the critics while also bringing positive exposure to gold stocks  The members of the WGC are none other than the gold miners themselves  including the majority of those that comprise the HUI  And I wouldn t be able to describe this initiative better than Goldcorp CEO Chuck Jeannes does in his company s 2012 annual report   The traditional measure of cash costs is not a realistic view  To produce an ounce of gold  we not only incur operating costs  but we spend sustaining capital at the sites  we spend G A to keep the lights on  and we spend dollars to explore  to sustain our future  If you put all those together  that s an all in sustaining cash cost  It s a much more transparent and accurate way of judging the real costs of getting an ounce of gold out of the ground   Ultimately all in sustaining cash costs will give investors a much more accurate snapshot of the full costs of producing gold from existing operations  And from what I gather  the WGC is looking to finalize a standard before the end of 2013  Interestingly even though things are not set in stone  nor has it been universally adopted across the industry  we got a taste of what all in sustaining cash costs would look like via a handful of miners  including Barrick Gold  Newmont Mining  and Goldcorp  either voluntarily reporting it in 2012 and or projecting what it will be in 2013  And among the seven major miners that divulged these figures  the average all in sustaining cash costs came out to  1046  Indeed this all in figure is quite a bit higher than the more conventional cash operating cost figure  to the tune of  45   And this obviously greatly pinches the margins if these costs are inserted in place of what s conventionally used  But considering where the price of gold s been  is this all in figure really that scary  No  not really  If I used this all in cash cost figure with 2012 s average gold price  gross margins would still have come in at 37   This is a margin that is still well higher than most other industries  Wall Street darling Apple just reported its gross margins at 38  in the first quarter  And based on the  of the gold stocks these days  the miners are showing that these robust margins do in fact translate to positive earnings  Astonishingly the collective price to earnings ratio of the HUI was 11 6x as of the end of April  Now gold stocks have never been known to be value plays  but this insanely low P E ratio represents the cheapest these stocks have ever been  It is well less than half their average P E ratio over the last half dozen years  and incredibly nearly half the current collective P E ratio of the S P 500  21 0x   I never thought these words would come out of my mouth  but gold stocks are currently value plays  When this highly scrutinized sector gets its feet held to the fire  it delivers on margin and earnings  And while it s certainly not popular to laud the virtues of gold stocks during a time when they are universally loathed  this sector s strong structural fundamentals sets it up to continue to deliver down the road  And interestingly miners  fast rising costs somewhat support these fundamentals  As silly as it sounds  higher production costs can actually serve as a backstop for gold s price  The closer the gold price gets to costs  the more of a squeeze the miners will see on margin  And if they re squeezed enough  production will be cut  And not only will squeezed margins cut production  there will be less to go around for new project capex  If new project capex is neglected for long enough  new production from next generation mines will fall behind the depletion rate  Now if gold demand plummets  this supply pressure wouldn t be a problem  But if demand remains high as it is today  it wouldn t take long for economic forces to bring prices back up to levels that make gold amenable to profitable mining  Overall it ll be interesting to see if how 2013 s gold price action affects mine production  So far we re on track to see the first year over year decline of the average gold price in this bull market  And if costs continue to rise  which they are expected to  margins will definitely be thinner  Will this lead to lower output and subdued pipeline development  Time will certainly tell  But given gold s stout  and the fact that it is wildly oversold  we re due for a strong back half of 2013 that ought to put gross margins back in line with trend  And this will do great things for the mining companies and their respective stocks  That s right  as crazy as it sounds we re believers in gold stocks  It s no doubt been a brutally tough market for them lately  but their carnage offers one of the best  ever seen in this bull  Join us at Zeal to find out how resolute contrarians are playing these markets  By  to our acclaimed  and or  newsletters you ll get exclusive market perspective that s rewarded our subscribers with average annualized realized gains of  33 9  on all our stock trades recommended since 2001  The bottom line is despite their bad reputation  the gold miners have consistently been able to deliver some of the highest gross margins seen in the markets  Even though they ve had trouble controlling their costs  gold s rising price continues to give them a nice spread to work with  And the gold miners are trying to get on mainstream investors  radars by offering up more transparency on the cost side of things with a brand new metric  all in sustaining cash costs  While this performance measure will certainly pinch conventional gross margins  the miners should still have plenty of play ,2013-05-05,Scott

189875,411391,NEM,Mike Berry s New Secret For Finding Winners  Optionality,opinion,You will not find it in the dictionary  but a company s  optionality  the condition of having choices signals its chances of success  according to Dr  Michael Berry in a Gold Report interview  Berry  a respected financial media editor  talks about junior mining firms in Nevada and Mexico that display optionality and sustainability in a market stuck in the mire   The Gold Report  Dr  Berry  the market for junior mining stories is confusing and unpredictable  You have a Ph D  in investment theory and decades of experience  Can you explain to our readers why precious metals equities are underperforming the benchmark indexes   Michael Berry  As you know  market cycles are sometimes long  Right now  the junior market is in a risk off mode  There probably is no other class of stock as risky as junior mining stocks   In addition  most juniors do a poor job of managing their sustainability  of getting enough money in the treasury and making it work for them  Consequently  they run out of capital  This situation is likely to last for another year or two   TGR  Despite being in a risk off market  is money coming back into the market as a whole   MB  There is a lot of money on the sidelines  but significant problems remain in the market  What cash is returning to the market is not finding its way into the juniors   Advisers suggest buying large caps and dividend payers and so forth  But even companies such as Goldcorp Inc   G TSX  GG NYSE    a great company with lots of cash and cash flow   is trading for  33 share and a recent dividend increase   TGR  Does Goldcorp offer a lot of value at  33 share   MB  Yes  for two reasons  One  it is undervalued relative to gold and silver prices and has 67 million ounces  67 Moz  of gold reserves  Two  it produces a very nice  recently increased dividend   Gold is still cheap at over  1 600 ounce   1 600 oz   The dollar got a little bit stronger recently and gold  in dollars  took another tumble  But I cannot believe the dollar will continue to strengthen  When the dollar falls  gold will go up   TGR  Over the course of 2012  the gold price increased by 6 2   Should we expect similar performance in 2013   MB  I would think so  I expect both gold and silver to appreciate this year  However  there is a disconnect between commodity prices and share prices  especially in the exploration space   TGR  Do you see any meaningful rebound in the mining sector in 2013   MB  That is a tough question to answer  Last month at the Vancouver Cambridge House Symposium  I sensed that we may be at a bottom  but we may stay there for quite a while   You have to buy into these market bottoms  Look for companies that can sustain themselves  If you can put together a few good companies now  good defined by our 10 discovery factors  and hold them  one or two years is a likely timeframe for a rebound   TGR  So  the rebound may lift select stories   MB  Yes  and that relates to the discovery hypothesis   Gold Standard Ventures Corp   GSV TSX V  GDVXF OTCQX  is one example of a junior with a wonderful discovery  The stock has been beaten down  but is holding near  1 share  There are a number of companies whose stocks have held their value  Another example is Midway Gold Corp   MDW TSX V  MDW NYSE MKT    Other junior mining stocks are trading for pennies  I have a fund manager friend who buys these stocks  He says that the stock prices in his mining portfolio do not add up to a dollar because the prices are so low  This is true across the market   Through the end of January  the top decile of junior miners  as selected independently by the Crowd  was down 16  over the past four months  The worst stocks  those in decile 10  were down 30   Almost all of the juniors have been taken out to the woodshed   TGR  At the Cambridge House Conference your presentation was entitled   The Leavening of the American Quality of Life   You discussed the impact on global investors of raising America s debt ceiling  What do investors need to know from that presentation   MB  Bottom line  increased taxes in the U S  will affect business  There will be very low growth in gross domestic product  maybe even negative growth  We might even have another recession  There will be a wealth transfer from one segment of the economy  the president s top 1   to another  There will be more government intervention in the marketplace   TGR  Will we see a double dip recession   MB  I think that is likely  The Federal Reserve Bank is spending  85 billion   85B  a month buying up paper  That is not working  Officially  we have 7 9  unemployment  but it is actually much higher and underemployment is higher still  We have headwinds in student loan default possibility  Housing seems to be turning up a bit   TGR  Do you pay much attention to the Dollar Index   MB  Absolutely  Every country is devaluing its currency and trying to inflate its way out  The U S  will do it too   It is very appropriate to follow the dollar  because as the dollar weakens  a lot of commodities   which are priced in dollars   will have to go up in value  You can see it in copper already due to increased demand  Analysts are talking about  4 pound copper now   TGR  The Dollar Index is roughly at 80 right now  In 2011  it dipped below 75  Could we return to that by the end of 2013   MB  Yes  I think we could  Keep in mind that we are in the beginning of a mercantilist war being fought in the currency markets  The U S  is not going to promote a strong dollar  Currency strength is always relative in a dirty float world  Washington wants to see the dollar fall relative to the basket of other currencies  You cannot print this much money without having an impact on the value of the currency  I think we could see 75 again   TGR  Despite a string of dismal responses to my questions so far  you seem to be an upbeat guy  Can you give us a few positive thoughts or themes   MB  Overall  I am positive  I am not happy with what is happening in the U S   but that is a political issue and I only have one vote   Globally  there is a convergence of lifestyles  I  and many others  have written about this concept of lifestyle convergence at length  I have called it a quality of life secular trend  I think this convergence is very positive   However  the U S  might not lead that convergence  In Vancouver  I talked about the leavening or the regression of the quality of life in the U  S  In emerging countries  with a combined population of 6B people  the quality of life will improve  As the quality of life improves  infrastructure is built out  You need more and better food  potable water  fertilizer  metals and energy   The U S  and the Western countries will not lead us out of this mess  it will be the tremendous growth in quality of life in the rest of the world  Hand in hand within the next decade  the dollar must lose its reserve currency status   TGR  In a recent edition of Morning Notes  you wrote   After studying the junior markets and brainstorming strategies to generate returns  we have come to believe in the theme of optionality   What is optionality   MB  Basically  optionality is about a company having choices  or options  Most companies do have choices  Options should always convey value to shareholders  The trick is to pick the companies that have multiple  good choices and know how and when to exercise their options   For example  International Enexco Ltd   IEC TSX V  IEXCF OTCQX  I6E FSE  has the Contact copper deposit  a massive project in northeastern Nevada  not far from Twin Falls  Idaho  It also owns 30  of the potentially rich Mann Lake uranium deposit in Saskatchewan  Canada  Its partners in Saskatchewan include Cameco Corp   CCO TSX  CCJ NYSE  and AREVA SA  AREVA EPA   Enexco has the option to be valued on its uranium or on its copper or both  The most likely scenario in my opinion  is that the company shares will get a boost from discoveries in the uranium project   TGR  Drill results at Mann Lake are encouraging  Enexco is deciding whether to exercise its option to earn a greater interest there  What do you think will happen   MB  Two holes at Mann Lake have hit what I would call discovery grade uranium   I would think Enexco would benefit from its uranium option  Enexco has a good chance to create value by staying in that joint venture and increasing its participation   TGR  Do you think Enexco could spin out the uranium asset   MB  It depends  in part  on how the copper resource expands at the Contact deposit  I think it is likely Enexco will be bought out of its position and spin the copper out into another vehicle  I do not think it will take long   TGR  Does Enexco have enough cash to develop both assets simultaneously   MB  Denison Mines Corp   DML TSX  DNN NYSE MKT  bought  1 8 million   1 8M  into Enexco   That takes care of the drill program  and while the stock does not trade a lot  it is a  0 55 stock  So  yes  I think the company can sustain itself   TGR  Many of the companies you write about operate in Nevada  some in Mexico  Can you tell us more about them   MB  From Vancouver  we went to visit Quaterra Resources Inc  s  QTA TSX V  QMM NYSE MKT  Yerington project  Pershing Gold Corp   PGLC OTCBB  and NuLegacy Gold Corp   NUG TSX V   There are a lot of discoveries in the goldfields of Nevada and many more junior gold explorers are setting up operations   Nevada has a great mining culture and geology  I prefer a good property in Nevada as opposed to Mali or South Africa   These are the companies that will pop back first  If we get any move in gold  exploration plays in Nevada will revert in price first  They are very cheap right now  I could probably name 20 of them  Gold Standard Ventures is well known  It owns 100  of the Railroad project  19 000 acres close by Elko  It is an advance stage project in the Carlin Trend   TGR  Gold Standard expanded its gold envelope along the North Bullion Fault Zone at Railroad  but elsewhere on the property  an intersect recently returned silver copper molybdenum mineralization  What should we read into that   MB  I do not think we need to read anything into it  Gold Standard needs to focus on drilling out the gold resource  not get distracted by another discovery hole  If Gold Standard focuses on Railroad and develops something bankable  then Newmont Mining Corp   NEM NYSE  or Barrick Gold Corp   ABX TSX  ABX NYSE  or another major will take the company out   TGR  Unlike other juniors  Gold Standard s share price seems to follow drill results   MB  Yes  Gold Standard had great drill results at Railroad  more than 64 meters  64m  of 4 25 grams ton  4 25 g t  gold  That is a great discovery hole  The company found 160m of almost 3 5 g t gold  That does not happen often   I think the stock is a tremendous buy at a currently  1 share price  Gold Standard s person on site  Dave Mathewson is ex Newmont and is considered one of Nevada s great exploration geologists  The company has a district scale system developing  I think the stock will be much higher in a few years   TGR  Who else is active in the U S    MB  Terraco Gold Corp   TEN TSX V  is trying to find its mission in life  Does it want to be a royalty company or a gold mining company  Its Moonlight project in Nevada needs more drilling  Looking at the trend there  going from Pershing s Relief Canyon at the bottom  past Coeur d Alene Mines Corp  s  CDM TSX  CDE NYSE  Rochester mine and Midway Gold s Spring Valley property  Moonlight  is almost certain to be mineralized  However  Terraco has pulled back on Moonlight   It also has about 1 Moz of gold in Idaho at the Almaden project  The company is testing the metallurgy there  Some of the gold is encapsulated in silica  With the current gold price  Almaden remains a valuable project   Then there is the royalty Terraco has on the Spring Valley joint venture between Barrick Gold and Midway  No matter how you value that  it is worth about  60M  That definitely represents optionality because it could be sold tomorrow  It is very liquid  This is indeed an option that Terraco can exercise  And even if the property cannot be sold  Terraco s royalty could be sold to a number of players   TGR  What did Terraco pay for Spring Valley   MB  It paid  20M for the royalty  Now Todd Hilditch and his board have to decide if it is going to be a royalty or mining company  Either way  there is so much value there that I would buy the stock and sit on it   TGR  Will Almaden be a simple open pit  heap leach operation   MB  Yes  it will be open pit  but not necessarily simple because of the metallurgy  Charlie Sulfrian  the chief geologist  is working on upgrading it now  The resource is probably over 1 g t  and there is 1 Moz  Even at 600 000 700 000 ounces  600 700 Koz   it will be very valuable   The source of the gold has not been found yet  so that will require more drilling  Terraco might monetize its royalty and go after more discoveries at both the Moonlight project and Almaden   TGR  Is that the strategy you would take   MB  Yes  I think a company has to be in either the royalty business or the exploration development business  not both   TGR  Golden Predator Corp   which just changed its name to Americas Bullion Royalty Corp   AMB TSX   has certainly chosen that path   MB  I think the company found that  aside from this being a very difficult market  you cannot be on both sides  That is why I appreciate what Steve Alfers has done over at Pershing Gold   Steve Alfers knows more of the history of Nevada gold and has done more deals in Nevada gold than anyone I know  When I first saw Relief Canyon years ago  it was a mess  checkerboarded by Newmont and others  Steve pulled it together  Pershing now has 538 Koz Measured and Indicated and close to 700 Koz Inferred  That Relief Canyon resource will only get bigger  Pershing has three pits on its property and has deals with Newmont to explore its properties   Pershing also owns 24  of Valor Gold Corp   VGLD OTCBB   which has the Red Rock property in the Battle Mountain Trend  Money is coming into that project as well another example of optionality  Art Leger is heading up the discovery drilling on Red Rock  There is a lot of excitement there as well   There is not a lot of downside to what Steve Alfers has done with Pershing  The stock moved from  0 30 share to  0 51 share  I think it will move again   TGR  Would you say that s another example of optionality   MB  Absolutely  Steve has some great geologists and a fully permitted heap leach plant  He also has one of the world s wealthiest investors backing him  Dr  Phil Frost  a life sciences guru  owns a significant percentage of Pershing Gold   There are 300M shares out  which is not a real positive  Right now  it trades on the OTC Pink  but I expect to see Pershing listed on the NASDAQ or the NYSE Market   TGR  Not on the TSX Venture Exchange or Toronto Stock Exchange   MB  Eventually  but I expect a U S  listing first   TGR  Any other Nevada names   MB  NuLegacy has several projects  The company has a deal with Barrick on the Red Hill project  a Carlin type deposit  There are some good drill holes and discovery holes  Barrick can come in and claw back to 70   but the stock is really cheap now  NuLegacy also has the Wood Hills project  on the Pequop Trend  The company has a 70  earn in agreement with AuEx Ventures Inc   REN TSX V    TGR  Looking to the south  what names do you like in Mexico   MB  There are lots of great silver projects in Mexico  For example  Quaterra Resources owns 50  of the Nieves project  It is a 110 Moz  open pittable silver mine  Because it is monetizable  optionally offers Quaterra some liquidity  Goldcorp owns 8  of Quaterra and it funds exploration of the 20 other projects Quaterra is exploring in Mexico   Then there is Geologix Explorations Inc   GIX TSX  GIXEF OTCQX   Its gold copper project  Tepal  is located in Michoac n state  The gold equivalent  when you add in the copper  is about 4 Moz now  and there may be closer to 2 Moz gold and 1 billion pounds copper  The company is trading for nothing  I worry a little bit about sustainability  but it has a great deposit   TGR  Will stories like Geologix get a bump now that copper demand is ticking up   MB  On the whole  I do not think people realize Geologix has 800 million pounds or more of copper  That story needs to get out   No company gets a bump unless it has good investor relations  One of our 10 factors for the Discovery Scoreboard is how a company presents itself to the market  Does the company explain its optionality  I think a lot depends upon on how active a company is and how good it is at dealing with the market   TGR  Do you have any parting thoughts   MB  The companies we have talked about may be the first sign that this terrible junior market is turning around  There is a lot more action now in Mexico  Nevada  even British Columbia  The money has to start to flow  when that happens  these companies will really take off in the capital markets   It is important to analyze companies to understand their degree of sustainability  It is difficult to be a contrarian  but this is the time and this is the market where a good contrarian strategy will generate tremendous wealth over the next couple of years  In other words  buy and hold   TGR  Dr  Berry  thanks for your time and your insights   From

189876,411392,NEM,Striking A Balance With Zinc Investments,opinion,Stock picking can be an exercise in compromise  and investors who wait for a perfect zinc mining project could be sitting on the sidelines and missing out on profits  Advanced zinc projects close to infrastructure are limited  and with zinc supply contracting in 2013  new operations are emerging both within and outside of established districts  Matthew O Keefe  mining analyst with Mackie Research  talks with The Metals Report about his criteria for choosing investments in the zinc small cap space and explains why he s sometimes willing to make concessions  The Metals Report  What s your forecast for the upper range of zinc prices in 2013 and the first half of 2014  Matthew O Keefe  I think we re going to start to see a reversal in the fundamentals that should start to drive the price of zinc up  Some major mine closures are coming in North America  so the supply side is going to be a little tighter  Xstrata Plc s  XTA L  Brunswick  12 mine in New Brunswick  a fairly large operation producing around 275 000 tons per year  is closing this month and Perseverance  another Xstrata mine located in Quebec is also slated to close this year  removing another 228 000 tons from the supply  Zinc inventories have already begun to flatten and drop a little  a trend we expect will continue next year when two other large mines are expected to close  Lisheen in Ireland and Iscaycruz in Peru  We have a 2013 zinc target of  1 per pound   1 lb   In 2014  we re moving it up to  1 20 lb  citing this drop in inventories as a price increase catalyst  We re keeping our long term price pretty low at  0 95 lb  TMR  What are zinc s key uses  MO  Zinc is primarily used to galvanize steel to prevent it from rusting and as an alloying metal in manufacturing  so it s related to the construction and automotive industries  In that respect  it is one of the key economic metals and strongly correlated to global economic growth  TMR  Geologically speaking  why is lead often associated with zinc  MO  Lead and zinc commonly occur together as part of the ore forming process  Most lead zinc deposits occur in volcanogenic massive sulfide  VMS  deposits  a common type of deposit initially formed on the ocean floor  Chemically  the lead  and zinc forming minerals behave quite similarly  so under the same conditions they generally precipitate out at the same time  TMR  What are the essentials of your investment thesis for lead zinc plays in the small cap space  MO  I like the small cap space because in addition to commodity exposure  you see value creation as the company passes development milestones  I look for advanced projects that are close to infrastructure and that carry manageable risk  Does it also have a good resource with decent byproducts  A good management team  Reasonable access to capital  Those are the main criteria  TMR  Let s get into your coverage universe  You recently traveled to Foran Mining Corp  s  FOM TO  McIlvenna Bay zinc copper gold silver project in Saskatchewan  What were two or three takeaways from your trip  MO  The trip to McIlvenna Bay reinforced the reasons I liked the project in the first place its location and access to not just regular infrastructure like roads and power but to mining specific infrastructure  McIlvenna Bay is just 60 kilometers from Flin Flon  a major mining center where HudBay Minerals Inc   HBM TSX  HBM NYSE  has the bulk of its operations  including an operating zinc smelter  And the town has rail  allowing concentrate to be shipped globally  We traveled by road all the way to the site in just over an hour with no problems  With this abundance of infrastructure  Foran has the luxury of being able to focus on building a mine and a mill without having to deal with the permitting issues and capital cost escalations commonly associated with basic infrastructure development  The McIlvenna Bay resource is attractive  with total resources of over 20 million tonnes  20 Mt  containing 1 8 billion pounds of zinc and over 500 million pounds of copper  It s actually two resources  one that is copper rich and another that is zinc rich  Multiple metals allow for some diversification  which is good for appealing to multiple groups for both funding and sales  The management has a good understanding of that and I was very impressed  I also like the exploration potential  That deposit is still quite open and the area is quite prospective  The company has a drill program on its neighboring Balsam property  so we should see some results from that in the next few weeks  TMR  You have said that you can t have zinc in your copper concentrate or copper in your zinc concentrate  Is there an easy solution for that issue  MO  Clean concentrates are the most saleable  You pay a penalty if there is zinc in your copper concentrate or vice versa  but there are ways to produce cleaner concentrate  What helps at McIlvenna Bay is that the copper and zinc are in two discrete zones a brecciated copper zone butted up against a massive sulfide zone and they are visually distinctive  which makes mining easier  The overlapping zone isn t that big  There will be a bit of contamination  but it s manageable  Foran s main challenge will be developing its mine plan and the plant design needs to accommodate two types of ore  This may mean Foran would need multiple processing circuits  TMR  Could that raise capital expenditures  MO  When there are multiple circuits  there will be higher capex costs  but for this type of operation it s minor  especially compared to infrastructure costs  which it won t have to deal with  TMR  Foran has about  9 million   9M  in cash  but that s not enough to get a feasibility study done  When will the company have to go back to the market for more money  MO  Foran is looking at doing a scoping study later in the year that will be based on an updated resource  It s funded for this work but if it wants to move to the prefeasibility stage  it would need to raise money toward the end of the year  TMR  Other small cap companies operating in this area have joint ventures with HudBay Minerals  which operates the 777 Smelter in Flin Flon  but Foran does not have a relationship with HudBay  Do you know why  MO  At present  there is no ownership interest or partnership between the two companies and there is no reason for that right now  Foran is well financed  with a very strong and supportive shareholder base  Pierre Lassonde  former president of Newmont Mining Corp   NEM NYSE   is a big shareholder  Plus  Foran has a pretty credible management team  so it s well liked by the institutional investors on the street  Having said that  the companies do talk and HudBay seems to know a lot about what s going on at Foran  Presumably it s keeping a close eye on it  TMR  What are some other primary zinc deposits in Canada that companies are developing  MO  We cover Trevali Mining Corp   TV TSX  TREVF OTCQX   which is a very advanced near term producer with several zinc assets in New Brunswick  New Brunswick has been a zinc and base metal mining camp for a long time  Trevali s principal asset there is its Halfmile mine  which shipped ore to the Brunswick  12 mill for treatment last year  That proved too expensive  so Trevali recently purchased an existing mill and mine nearby called Caribou that it s currently refurbishing  Once complete  Trevali will be able to ship ore from its Halfmile mine to Caribou for processing  It also plans to bring the adjoining Caribou mine into production for additional feed  So what I see in Trevali is a growing producer and new dominant player in the New Brunswick camp  It hasn t started production yet  which is one reason why the stock s been flat  I think folks are waiting to see its Santander mine in Peru start up later this month  which will mark its transition to producer status  Trevali will be the next junior pure play zinc producer  which the market has lacked since Breakwater Resources Ltd  and Farallon Mining Ltd  were taken out by Nyrstar  NYR BSE  in 2011  I m excited about Trevali Mining  and I think the price right now offers a good buying opportunity  TMR  What is another company you cover in the zinc space  MO  Rathdowney Resources Ltd   RTH TSX V  is an earlier stage company that is developing a zinc project in southern Poland  near Krakow  in a district that s been mining zinc for around 100 years  It has a large land position hosting a Mississippi Valley type deposit  which is a carbonate hosted zinc deposit  It s beautiful to find these deposits because they lie flat and have nice  coarse  simple metallurgy and are generally easy to mine  This is an established district  so the infrastructure and labor is in place  From an investment perspective  it s about growing the resource  It has already outlined a 20 Mt resource and it could double that fairly easily  What we also like is that strategically  it s very well located  A state owned company owns an adjacent mine and mill called Pomorzany  as well as a smelter  The mine only has about a year left and the whole complex is being sold  So there s an opportunity for these entities to get together  be it through a partnership  takeover or merger  That could change Rathdowney from pure exploration to a fast to production story  TMR  It s also part of the Hunter Dickinson group  which has backed a number of successful small cap junior mining companies over the years  I can t imagine Hunter Dickinson going to Poland if it didn t believe this could handsomely pay off  MO  I agree  I cover a couple of Hunter Dickinson names  and it generally picks good assets  Sometimes it gets into difficult situations  like Northern Dynasty Minerals Ltd  s  NDM TSX  NAK NYSE MKT  Pebble project up in Alaska great deposit  challenging politics  But Hunter Dickinson has good resources and a long track record of dealing with more challenging political environments  You can t be afraid of these things because you can t move the asset  You ve got to go where the assets are  But you also have to balance that risk  Poland s not a bad place to do business  and as I mentioned  Rathdowney s asset is located in an old zinc district  So we see the company s risk as relatively low  TMR  Any others you want to talk about  MO  Chieftain Metals Inc   CFB TSX  has a VMS polymetallic deposit called Tulsequah Chief in British Columbia that s quite rich  It s about one third gold and silver  one third copper and one third zinc  The project is well advanced and the company recently released a very positive feasibility study  It has to build a 128 kilometer access road to build the project and truck the concentrate out  but it has full permits to build that road  It has also lined up tentative financing through a Memorandum of Understanding with China CAMC Engineering Co  That deal should advance over the next few months  Chieftain is a relatively new company and doesn t get the institutional attention you might otherwise expect  but it s a name worth looking at  TMR  But how does it fit into your stock picking curriculum when it doesn t have access to established infrastructure  MO  Sometimes you ve got to make concessions remember it s about balancing risk  This one didn t have ideal infrastructure  but it has other things going for it  The deposit itself is very high grade  so the economics work  even if the company has to spend  100M on the road  Its capex is actually quite reasonable at about  450M  Tulsequah Chief is a preexisting mine that was operated by Cominco back in the 1950s  so much of the mine is already built  The company has to rebuild the mill  but it s a relatively small  very high grade project  which is why the capex is so low  There s still risk  of course  It needs to get all its operating permits  it needs to build the thing  and it still needs to finalize its financing  TMR  Do you have any more zinc names you d like to discuss  MO  Yes  Canadian Zinc Corp   CZN TSX  CZICF OTCQB  is another advanced developer  Again  you can bash me over the head for the fact it s not close to infrastructure  Its Prairie Creek project is located in the western Northwest Territories  but the beauty with this one is that it s already built  there is a mine and a mill  It was built by the Hunt Brothers in the 1980s for the silver because it s a high grade zinc lead silver deposit but the Hunt Brothers shut it down within months of completion when silver prices crashed  I visited the site  and the mill is still in excellent shape  For the past 10 years  the company has been working on the permitting and environmental side  as well as plans for upgrading the mine and mill  The key catalyst is for the company to receive its primary water permit that will allow the discharge of treated water back into the environment  It s a sensitive topic because the mine is within the Nahanni National Park drainage area  so its work is under a lot more scrutiny  Canadian Zinc is expecting the draft of that permit to be issued later this quarter  Once awarded  it is effectively cleared to complete the mine and bring it into production  which could be as early as 2015  TMR  As far as an offtake agreement goes  who are the potential suitors there  MO  I believe Canadian Zinc has been talking to metal traders and various Chinese groups  There s mercury in the concentrate  and this adds a little bit of hassle  but it s saleable  It has to negotiate a good price  but there are smelters and metals traders who would be happy to take its concentrates  TMR  To conclude  would you go as far as to say we re coming into an era of prolonged zinc price stability  MO  I don t think we re coming into price stability for anything in the world right now  Anything that s related to the stock market is volatile  Everyone s doing very short term trading  You get stability with patient  long term investors  That s not the world we re in anymore  If you have a longer view and think that the worst of the economic crisis is over  then it s an excellent time for zinc  I think its day is coming   is managing director of mining research at Mackie Research Capital Corp  O Keefe was recently selected as

189877,411393,NEM, Kwong Mun Achong Low  Repositioning Into Royalties For Richer Returns,opinion,Royalty plays may have once been strictly the domain of larger companies  but smaller names are shifting gears to enter the space  Can the smaller players make the numbers work for their shareholders  Kwong Mun Achong Low  an analyst with Jennings Capital  believes they can  Achong Low tells The Gold Report about which juniors are making the leap into royalties  The Gold Report  Kwong  investors have transferred billions of dollars from fixed income mutual funds into equity funds during the past few months  The mainstream media is calling it the  great rotation   Do you expect that movement to result in higher bids for precious metals and mining equities  Kwong Mun Achong Low  There s some credence to it because some corporations have strengthening balance sheets and improving profits  Also  the Volatility Index  VIX  is at a five year low and equities tend to outperform when volatility is low  I think that more capital will come back to equities and by extension some precious metals names will see benefits  TGR  Will that capital reach all the way down to the junior mining equities  KAL  Not all junior mining companies  Investors are very selective right now  looking for quality  TGR  You re following a handful of development stage stories with near term cash flow and some relatively small cap producers  What time frame does  near term  imply  KAL  Mostly 6 12 months  I look for companies that are fully financed to get to production and cash flow  For example  Santacruz Silver Mining Ltd   SCZ TSX V   a near term silver producer in Mexico  is supposed to be in commercial production within the next few months  It just completed a  40 million   40M  financing to help finance this and future projects  It could grow from about 500 000 ounces  500 Koz  silver this year to more than 5 million ounces year  5 Moz year  by 2015  There s lots of good growth there with the potential for a rerating that miners entering full scale production typically enjoy  TGR  Santacruz Silver is conducting a 7 000 meter  7 000m  drill program that s targeting the southeast and northwest zones of its Rosario project in Mexico  You hypothesized that given the continuity of the trend of mineralization  the drill program could increase the Measured and Indicated resource by 60  to about 16 1 Moz silver equivalent  What gives you the confidence to make that bold claim  KAL  When I was at the site  I was able to look at some of the cross sections of its recent drilling and detailed models of the current resource  The ore body seems continuous and as the company steps out drilling from the defined 500m of strike to explore the full 2 5 kilometers of potential  I expect the deposit to expand incrementally  As such  I don t think my estimate seems that aggressive  It s an extrapolation of what could be found within the year  TGR  Would you consider Santacruz a high grade project  KAL  I would  The company has three main projects that it s focusing on and exploring  All of them have silver grade of at least 100 grams per tonne  100 g t   which is rare in the silver space for the junior market  It s definitely a benchmark grade that I look for when I m considering how viable a project could be  TGR  It s supposed to reach commercial production in the first quarter  Is it on track  KAL  It is on track  It s been commissioning the mill for the past couple of months  It should be placing ore into the mill soon  Soon after that there should be some commercial production  If it slips  I don t think it will slip by much  TGR  Tell us more about what you look for in a company  KAL  Company management first and foremost  Has it done this thing before and does it have the experience  Second would be the asset  It s best if there s scarcity value attached to the asset such as the highest grade  best production profiles for the capital expenditure  capex   and if it is close to infrastructure  Lastly would be political jurisdiction  My preferences would be for the tried and true regions like Ontario or Nevada  After  I branch off into two categories  Who could be taken out and who could actually get into production on their own  TGR  Newsletter writer  recently  that as many as 500 junior mining companies could be forced off the TSX Venture Exchange this year  Do you believe that estimate is reasonable  Would that ultimately be healthy for the sector  KAL  I think that it should be that many  but whether that will come to fruition is another story because it s in the exchange s best interests to keep as many companies listed as possible  However  there definitely needs to be a purge  Investors are so jaded that they don t even want to hear anything when you call them with a good quality name  There s too much noise out there  If the companies that should be leaving the market actually left  investors could put some faith and money into what was left  TGR  There are lots of pretenders in the junior mining equity space that are frustrating investors  Some projects under development are going nowhere and everyone but the investors seem to know that  Who can investors trust  KAL  It s a fair question for the times we re in  I can only speak for myself  I try to follow strict guidelines  Before I pick up coverage  a company has to pass the management  asset and jurisdiction tests that I mentioned earlier  It also has to make sense on a fundamental basis  Is it actually worth how much it s trading in the market  I do a fully financed model accounting for all the dilution and financings that a company has to do  I make sure it is still reasonable on a discounted cash flow basis  TGR  Let s talk about some of the companies that make that cut  Some of them have a sizable capex to reach production  but at least one of those names doesn t have the cash to build a mine  Are these companies valued strictly on their potential as takeover targets  KAL  That does factor in  but even though some don t have the cash to fully finance their capex  it s reasonable to consider other sources  like project debt  royalties and streams  and monetizing of non core assets  For example  Probe Mines Limited  PRB TSX V  should be coming out with a preliminary economic assessment  PEA  in the next few months  I am assuming  450M capex and  depending on if some warrants come in over the next few months  it could have as much as  50M in cash with some assets that still could be monetized such as the chromite asset in the James Bay area  It could also raise some debt  which would give it a fair chance of getting to production on its own accord  in our view  TGR  Who is going to buy that chromite asset  It s not as if Cliffs Natural Resources Inc   CLF NYSE  is buying up chromite plays any more  And Noront Resources Ltd   NOT TSX V  doesn t have a lot of spare cash these days  KAL  There are very few players who might buy it  so it wouldn t be near term  Cliffs is still progressing its chromite development  As Cliffs progresses  Probe Mines  asset will become more valuable because of its proximity to Cliffs  assets  TGR  It is one of the few properties Cliffs doesn t own  You also believe that Probe Mines could be a takeover target based largely on the takeovers of Prodigy Gold Inc   which had the Magino gold project  and Trelawney Resources Inc   which had the Cote Lake gold project  Probe s Borden project is a similar size  but is it a mineable deposit  KAL  I believe so  but we ll have to wait for the PEA to shed more light on it  Notably the deposit comes to surface  which benefits open pit mining  and there have not been any red flags from the preliminary metallurgical studies  The resource is substantial  Apart from the 4 3 Moz deposit at about 1 g t grade  Probe has a higher grade core that could be more economically robust  It has 2 3 Moz gold at 1 7 g t  An open pit with those grades means it may not cost as much to reach a certain level of production because the mill doesn t have to be as big to get there  For the first five years of production  I m assuming it can get 250 Koz gold at cash costs of  500 ounce   500 oz  with start up in 2017  TGR  Where else can investors find near term cash flow  KAL  Minera IRL Ltd   IRL TSX  MIRL LSE  MIRL BVL  already produces about 25 Koz gold every year  but it also has a bigger flagship project in Peru that it wants to bring on line  That project s capex is about  180M  which is a bit of a tall order because its market cap is a fraction of that  However  it could use the cash flow from its producing mine or take on some project debt to help get this flagship project into production  TGR  Minera is cheap compared to its junior producing peers  with an enterprise value of  40 oz versus a median average of  79 oz  What accounts for that gap  KAL  Investors are factoring in the financing risk of putting all its ounces into production  Some of those ounces are at the secondary asset in Argentina  which does have some political risk around it  The company is working on bringing in a joint venture partner based in Argentina that can help advance the project and completely decouple that risk from its Peruvian assets  If that political risk is mitigated  it has a higher likelihood of financing its other ounces into production  TGR  Should investors be more excited about Minera s Don Nicolas or Ollachea project  KAL  Ollachea  because it is in Peru and just started underground drilling to grow the resource  Minera has completed its exploration tunnel and is advancing the project  That said  investors could be excited about Don Nicolas as well since it is in Santa Cruz province  one of the more mining friendly jurisdictions in Argentina  It s next to Goldcorp Inc  s  G TSX  GG NYSE  and Yamana Gold Inc s   YRI TSX  AUY NYSE  YAU LSE  development projects so it has the right address  TGR  Could it help change investor sentiment about Argentina if Minera gets Don Nicolas into production  KAL  It could take a lot more than that  Goldcorp is having so much trouble if a senior is having so much difficulty then you know it s a pretty tough environment  Inflation is still rampant in the country at around 20   which can force capex up  Goldcorp has nearly doubled the capex on its project to well over  1 billion  That is why we feel it is so important for Minera to find an Argentina based JV partner  TGR  Are there any other companies that could get to production on their own  KAL  Solitario Exploration   Royalty Corp   SLR TSX  in Nevada has an open pit heap leach project on a past producing mine that could back into production for only  75M  It would end up producing about 63 Koz gold year at  575 oz  which we see as one of the more robust and more advanced development projects in Nevada currently  I expect it to get the permits in the first half of 2014  with production in 2015  TGR  What accounts for the  royalty  in Solitario s name  KAL  Its royalty is on a zinc project in Peru  where it owns a 30  fully carried interest on Bongar   a high grade underground zinc project  The majority joint venture partner is Brazil based Votorantim Metais  one of the largest zinc producers in the world  TGR  Royalty plays were once strictly the domain of larger companies  but smaller names in this space have entered that arena over the last few years  Can the smaller players make the numbers work as far as royalties go  KAL  We have seen a couple of them come to the forefront recently  One is Premier Royalty Inc   NSR TSX   which recently did a deal to acquire some smaller scale royalties from Yamana Gold that an intermediate or major likely wouldn t be interested in  TGR  They d be immaterial to a larger company  KAL  Yes  but they re still enough to build a smaller company  The majors are taking note because Sandstorm Gold Ltd   SSL TSX  acquired 60  of Premier Royalty specifically to keep an eye on the junior space  TGR  Why didn t Sandstorm just buy it outright  KAL  I think it wants to focus on larger royalty deals and allow a separate management team to look at the junior space  Also  their majority position prevents anyone else from buying Premier Royalty outright so there is no rush  TGR  Are there other companies with a royalty angle that you find appealing  KAL  Treasury Metals Inc   TML TSX  also has a producing royalty on Goldgroup Mining Inc  s  GGA TSX  Cerro Colorado mine in Mexico that provides annual revenue on the order of  1M  However  Treasury s main focus is on its Goliath gold project in northwestern Ontario  just outside the town of Dryden  The capex is about  90M and it could get to 80 Koz year at about  700 oz cash costs  The mine would start with an open pit with mill feed over 3 g t gold  Its recent PEA showed an after tax internal rate of return of more than 30  at  1 375 oz gold  TGR  Does Treasury Metals have the cash to develop that site  I heard it was having some trouble raising cash  KAL  I expect investors are looking at the PEA and wanting more  Treasury Metals is drilling in through a parallel zone that could lower the overall strip ratio and by extension the cash costs of the project  As the company goes straight to feasibility by the end of this year  investors will start to see that the economics are improving  I believe investors will then start to put some money behind it  TGR  Are there similar plays out there that you re following  KAL  I just launched coverage on Americas Bullion Royalty Corp   AMB TSX   formerly known as Golden Predator Corp  The company has had a royalty portfolio for a while  but it only just shifted its focus onto it  It s no wonder why  Americas Bullion has one of the highest quality royalty portfolios out there of the juniors  in our view  It has good operators  Barrick Gold Corp   ABX TSX  ABX NYSE  and Midway Gold Corp   MDW TSX V  MDW NYSE MKT   which is ex Newmont Mining Corp   NEM NYSE  management  These royalties are located in Nevada  which mitigates political risk and all the royalties could be paid in kind  which avoids currency risk  TGR  How does a junior explorer that s looking for precious metals deposits in the Yukon all of a sudden become a royalty play  KAL  There s still some promise that the Yukon could get some mines into production there are some success cases there but it s not an easy operating environment  Americas Bullion decided that it could not be stagnant in the current market environment  The company has to adapt to what investors are looking at right now  It s easier for investors to look at royalty companies over producers  especially given their outperformance by such a wide margin over the last few years  It is a change in focus for Americas Bullion  but it s a good change that s better suited to a market environment where investors want less risk and lower capex  TGR  When are we going to see Americas Bullion generating cash flow  KAL  Some of its major royalties start to produce in 2014  It could have as much as  6M in revenue in 2015  and double that by 2017  all with wide operating margins as is the case in the royalty space  TGR  Do you believe more companies will make the move into royalties  KAL  I believe so  There are a number of junior royalty companies out there  but they have one off assets or may not be in production for many years  I could see some consolidation in the space to gain some sort of critical mass  TGR  What size is the sweet spot for projects right now  KAL  I think anywhere from 100 300 Koz year for gold with capex under  600M  TGR  Thanks  Kwong  for your insights   is a mining analyst with Jennings Capital with a

189879,411395,NEM,The Week In The US   Spring Break,opinion,Surveys  national and regional  send contradictory signals  yet it is too early to say whether they point to consolidation or the first signs of a slowdown  Employment figures tend to support the second analysis  But a singler month is not enough to draw a trend The ISM index for the manufacturing sector was released early in the week  After rising for three consecutive months  from 49 9 in November to 54 2 in February  the index dropped 2 9 points in March  a much sharper decline than expected  Production and new orders  the components1 that had increased the most between November and February  were also the ones that fell sharpest in March  The production component is now slightly lower than it was four months ago  by 0 9 points to 52 2   and the new orders component is slightly higher  by 0 3 points to 51 4   The composite index remains 1 4 points higher than November s low  thanks solely to inventories and employment Since 2010  the United States has followed a jagged growth profile  starting each year on a promising note followed by a slowdown in the spring or summer months before rebounding again in late autumn  At the most recent press conference following the FOMC meeting of 19 and 20 March  Ben Bernanke mentioned the risk of the U S  economy experiencing a similar seasonal trend We find it difficult to announce a slowdown based solely on a single month  Survey data must always be put into perspective  even those of the ISM  The regional surveys are not all sending out the same signals  such as the Chicago area  where the automobile industry predominates  Of the twelve regional Feds  five conduct surveys of manufacturing activity in their district  The New York and Philadelphia Feds are the first to publish their results  which we use to construct our North East Manufacturing  NEM  index  As shown in chart 1  our NEM index moves exactly in line with the weighted sum of all the other regional data2  which illustrates the great diversity of manufacturing in this area of the United States  Chart 1 also highlights the divergence between national ISM and the regional surveys  after rebounding more rapidly than the regional indexes  the ISM index has only corrected its excessive optimism to rejoin the level of confidence suggested at the regional level The decline in the ISM non manufacturing index lends greater credibility to the scenario of a spring slowdown  The composite index declined 1 6 points  but remains comfortably above the 50 threshold  at 54 4   Its components have followed very different trends from those in the manufacturing sector survey  production held steady at 56 5 in March  compared to 56 9 in February  but employment declined sharply to 53 3  from 57 2   As a whole  the economy seems to have marked a pause in March  as shown by the 1 7 points decline in our M N index  the weighted sum of data from the two ISM surveys   The quarterly average points to stabilisation at a strong level  with the M N index rising to 54 9 in Q1 2013 from 54 5 in Q4 2012  This supports our growth forecast for the first part of the year   3 3  at an annualised quarterly rate  In 2010  the spring slowdown was due to the emergence of the eurozone s sovereign debt crisis  In 2011  it was caused by the combination of surging oil prices following the Arab Spring  and global supply chain disruptions triggered by the Fukushima disaster  In 2012  the abrupt slowdown in job creations strained the momentum of disposable income  resulting in slower growth of household consumption We are back again at the job market situation  U S  export prospects do not seem to be suffering much from the European recession  New export orders are one of the more upbeat components of the ISM surveys  while low inflation continues to boost disposable income  Once again  employment is key if consumer spending is to maintain its momentum  To that matter  the March labour market report was a huge disappointment  with a marked slowdown in job creations  88k versus a 3 month average of 212k as of February   a deceleration in wage growth  at  1 8  y y  after an average of  2 1  over the previous three months  another fall in the labour participation ratio  to 63 3   the lowest since 1979  and a lengthening of the duration of unemployment  the median duration came up to 18 1 week  However  the whole report is not bad  The unemployment rate once more declined to 7 6   from 7 7  in February and 7 9  in January  and the number of persons intentionally leaving their jobs  which is usually a sign of confidence in their ability to find a new and better position in a short period of time  But the ultimate reassuring point is that the index of aggregate hours worked increased by 3 5   3 month annualised rate   This index is a rather good proxy of economic growth  meaning that activity did not stall in March BY Alexandra

189895,411411,NEM,Henk Krasenberg  35 Mining Stocks with Potential ,opinion,Henk Krasenberg  founder of the European Gold Centre  is back from the INDABA Mining Conference in South Africa with plenty to report  He has seen a sea change in mining in Africa over the last few years  countries are growing more confident and have a greater awareness of mining s potential  In this interview with The Gold Report  Krasenberg provides a European perspective on a whole slew of miners working in Africa  as well as in all corners of the world  The Gold Report  Where s the rally for gold  Henk Krasenberg  The general investment public is not in the right mood for resource stocks  Those who own them are not happy with their performance  and those who don t own them are not convinced that they should own them  Only 2  of all investment capital is in gold  other metals and related vehicles  I believe that gold is not as high as most people think  I relate it to the all time high of  850 ounce   850 oz  in 1980 and if you correct that to today s standards  that would equal  2 400 2 500 oz  So we are well below the real historical high  Further  the market for resource shares has not been very stimulating  Resource shares are greatly undervalued in my opinion  That surprises me  Several producers are reporting record production and record earnings and project further increases for the next few years  Also  the results that exploration companies report are generally very encouraging  TGR  A lot of people would say that the market pretty much has these companies right where they should be  Why do you believe they are undervalued  HK  If you talk about production companies  what is not reflected in their prices is their potential  Of course  that doesn t count for everybody  It is very difficult for the major companies to achieve substantial increases in their production  but several of the emerging and midtier producers are looking at a great future  TGR  When the rally does happen  how high could that percentage get  HK  That depends a lot on the nature of the frenzy that gives reason for a rally and whether the institutions will come in the regular investment capital of pension funds and insurance companies  regular shareholding companies  If gold investment moves from 2  to 4  of the total investments  we are talking about a lot of new capital coming to the market  TGR  You recently attended the annual INDABA Mining Conference in Cape Town  South Africa  What were two or three takeaways from that conference  HK  I was impressed with the confidence that people have in the future  So many things are happening in Africa that are different from even just five years ago  I noticed that the governments of the presenting countries show more dedication and a more realistic and constructive attitude  it seems that they are now viewing mining more as a blessing than as a curse  They seem to be more aware of their potential and the possible benefits  The countries expressed awareness of and willingness about the need to work together with the companies  Also remarkable were the questions that people asked about the risk of resources being nationalized and about indigenization  Countries want their local investors to have a certain percentage of ownership  but they often do not have money to pay for it  In Zimbabwe  for example  it is all paper deals  Kenya wants to apply a rule that 35  of every company should be owned by national people  If they indeed pay for that  it could also be a positive factor  All the companies need money for their progress  so if they can raise 35  of their requirements within those countries  that would be welcome  Also remarkable was that newer countries are coming into the game  after Tanzania  Burkina Faso  Mali and Guinea  Eritrea  Ethiopia and Mauritania have joined the ranks of mining countries  Now  former mining nations like Zambia  Liberia  Sierra Leone and Zimbabwe are re emerging and a new generation of countries that you hardly ever thought of for their resource potential  like Mozambique  Gabon  Senegal  Uganda and Malawi  were at the conference  Some were mainly known for diamonds  but now they are also working on gold  copper and other metals  TGR  So mostly Central and West Africa  HK  There weren t too many countries presenting from the eastern part  but in the second half of last year  I wrote a report on East Africa  and I think that is a much underexplored area  Interesting things are happening there too  but not yet as widely as in West Africa  TGR  You note in a recent edition of your GOLDVIEW newsletter that developing countries are buying a lot more gold than developed nations  Is that reflective of growing global fear about U S  and Europe economic stability  HK  The developing countries never were in a position to be able to buy gold  Now they are doing better and are getting some money  and they see all this turmoil in the world  They finally have reached the point that they can afford to buy gold  so they will  Most of the countries that used to have big gold reserves have sold part of their gold  and in most cases that happened at a time when the gold price had not even started its real rise  If you sold gold at  250 400 oz in the past  as did the U K   the Netherlands and Canada  it is not easy to be buying it at  1 600 1 700 oz  It would take a lot of courage  and I am sure that they would receive push back from the public  Despite the current setback of the gold price  I think there may come a time when they will seriously regret not having bought it back at  1 600 oz  This may very well be the last opportunity to buy it at these levels  TGR  Germany recently announced that it wanted to repatriate part of the gold that it has in foreign banks  What did you make of that announcement and that it s not going to fully happen until 2020  HK  I m puzzled that not more people are concerned about this because most of the foreign gold is with the Federal Reserve in New York  First there was a 30 year deal  and now it is to take them seven years to deliver that gold to Germany  That scares me because what does that mean  Is the gold not there  as some people believe  But the seven year stretch most probably suggests or indicates that they used the gold  which was deposited by the central banks  to lend it out and or to secure loans  Some people say gold is the only asset without a liability  True  if you buy gold with your own money  but not with a loan  If it indeed turns out that the Fed has put all kinds of obligations on the foreign gold  we have a serious problem  If this scenario is true  the Fed has every reason not to let the gold price move up to over  2 000 oz because sooner or later it has to cover its possible shortfall  TGR  What about some of the recent rhetoric from Mario Draghi  the head of the European Central Bank  HK  People like him cannot say what they think  They are in a political function  They have a responsibility toward the nations  to the public  They have to lie  to put it bluntly  and they do  They will never say they don t have the gold or they don t have enough gold or they used it  If it ever comes out that not all the gold is where we think it is  we could see crazy days with gold prices of  10 000 oz   20 000 oz or whatever  TGR  What are you seeing for a trading range for gold in 2013  HK  I m confident that we will see higher prices  It does not take that much to get it over  1 700 oz  although what happened in the last two weeks with the gold price may make us wonder  But if you ask me whether it will be  2 000 oz   3 000 oz or  5 000 oz  that will largely depend on the situations that arise  There are enough ghosts in the closet  TGR  Gold went up 6 2  in 2012  Do you think it will beat that percentage in 2013  HK  It doesn t take much to beat that  TGR  Where does that leave silver  HK  The fact that there is already not enough silver to make the coins that people want tells me a lot  On the other hand  nobody seems to panic  I think silver has extra potential because there is an actual shortage looming while the demand for silver coins and other uses is strong  But the old dogma is still valid  If and when gold jumps  silver will jump too  TGR  Were people particularly bullish on platinum  perhaps copper  HK  Not surprisingly  copper was widely mentioned at the conference because China has a large appetite for it  Copper is not a glamorous metal but a daily necessity  One presenter on platinum said mining platinum is tough  It s so different from gold  It is a hard business to be in  At the moment  platinum is struggling  There may be a very significant shortage in platinum  in particular because of lower output of the mines in South Africa  Zimbabwe could benefit from that situation  TGR  Tell us the difference between the average European precious metals investor and one from North America  HK  North American investors are much more opportunistic  They have a better and longer history of metals and even more of mining than Europeans have  In North America it is easier to meet people who have invested in resources  When North American investors have gold shares and they hear that uranium is hot  they jump easily into uranium and then into tantalum  graphite  graphene  and so on  They follow the trend  Here in Europe only the fairly sophisticated or adventurous investors will do so  Once we commit  we tend to stick with it  We take a longer term approach  TGR  What are some European mining stories  HK  We have over 300 companies that are active in the European resources  and we never hear about them  The media hardly ever talk about them  Most people don t even know we have an industry like that  Even in investment circles information is scarce  When the European Union is talking about resources  about mining  they are talking about industrial minerals like cement and stone  that is what they call their mining industry  If the industry will move forward and we will have more production stories  they will be more appealing to the people  There are a few companies now producing gold in Sweden  Nordic Mines AB  NOMI ST  NOM OSLO  is producing nicely  In Spain we have Orvana Minerals Corp   ORV TSX   which just became a client of mine  Astur Gold Corp   AST TSX V  is relaunching its mine in Asturias  Spain  Global Minerals Ltd   CTG TSX V  DPF FSE  is reviving a former copper silver producer in Slovakia and aims to become the first real silver producer in Europe  TGR  AsturGold is trying to bring the Salave gold project back into production  Where is it on that path  HK  It has had some hurdles  There are environmental protests  The company recently made some changes in its plans because it is pretty close to the sea  Rather than producing the gold itself with the use of cyanide  it has decided to make a concentrate and send it to a smelter  That has taken the wind out of the sails of the environmentalists and the government officials  Now the government has issued its latest list of requirements  which is still an extensive list  The company has to comply with about 30 points  and CEO Cary Pinkowski is confident that he can meet those  A good example of how the production of crushed ore and concentrates could work is Excellon Resources Inc   EXN TSX  in Mexico  I have always said that it was the most profitable trucking company because it crushed the ore and shipped it to a smelter  and it got the money back  That was a fairly nice and clean operation  Now Excellon is adding its own mill  TGR  As far as Global Minerals goes  do you think the share price will get an uptick with the recent increase in copper prices  HK  It will be a contributing factor but I think Global Mineral s share price will be more dependent on the company s continuous drilling and testing and coming closer to a production decision  The impact of the silver prices will be greater than that of copper  TGR  Is the financing in place now to bring Strieborn  into production  HK  It is on its way  I think that there are good possibilities to get the financing in Europe  TGR  What s happening with Orvana  HK  Orvana is an interesting company  Its CEO  Bill Williams  is also producing in Bolivia  He says   I don t explore  I only find mines   It s different from the typical exploration company that turns into a production company after a long period of exploration  TGR  France has joined with the Malian army to drive Muslim extremists out of the country s northern territory  Has this changed your view of Mali or perhaps even West Africa as a jurisdiction in which to invest  HK  Not really  because there s always a basis for conflict within African countries  But in Mali  when forces both from outside Africa and inside Africa teamed up  things started to be solved  Mali was at INDABA  When I asked  the representatives shrugged their shoulders and said they will solve it  Mining and exploration in the artisanal way is a mode of daily life more than anywhere else  so I m not concerned that much  TGR  Are there any West African plays that remain compelling to you  HK  Gold Fields Ltd   GFI   African Rainbow Minerals Ltd   ARI JSE   Randgold Resources Ltd   GOLD NASDAQ  RRS LSE   Resolute Mining Ltd   RSG ASX  and Endeavour Mining Corp   EDV TSX  EVR ASX  made excellent presentations at the conference  Tembo Gold Corp   TEM TSX V  TBGPF OTCQX  has been achieving very nice drill results recently  CEO David Scott was walking around with a big smile on his face  It had almost 23 grams per ton  g t  gold over 15 meters  15m  from 299m down hole  TGR  How would you compare that to similar plays  such as when Barrick Gold Corp   ABX TSX  ABX NYSE  discovered Bulyanhulu  HK  David Scott is convinced that Tembo Gold is on to something similar  and it is pretty much adjacent to African Barrick Gold Plc s  ABG L  Bulyanhulu  TGR  Any others  HK  I like my client New Dawn Mining Corp   ND TSX  in Zimbabwe  It is busy with indigenization and is producing 35 000 oz  35 Koz  and expecting to bring it up to over 100 Koz in the next two years provided that a better sentiment toward Zimbabwe develops  which would make raising money easier  Centamin Plc  CEE TSX  CNT ASX  CEY LSE  is successfully producing gold in Egypt  I was impressed with the management  I met my former client Helio Resource Corp   HRC TSX V  when I was in Tanzania and Namibia  It has open pit and underground potential  Another company that I like is in Burkina Faso  It s an Australian company  Ampella Mining Ltd   AMX ASX   The man in charge of that project is very knowledgeable  has a lot of experience in Africa and only has the responsibility of bringing the project forward and into production  Other corporate duties are being taken care of at the company s head office in Australia  African Gold Group Inc   AGG TSX V  is also a former client  It is selling off its interest in Ghana to Newmont Mining Corp   NEM NYSE   so it gets a nice amount of cash and will continue to focus on Mali  Merrex Gold Inc   MXI TSX V  MXGIF OTCQX  is also in Mali and has a joint venture with IAMGOLD Corp   IMG TSX  IAG NYSE   It has been doing well  Castle Peak Mining Ltd   CAP TSX V  is a typical example of a company that had good drill results  and it became public at  0 35 share not too long ago  Shares are selling at  0 06 share despite good results and good management  I ve always liked Sunridge Gold Corp   SGC TSX V   it used to have a connection with Nevsun Resources Ltd   NSU TSX  NSU NYSE MKT   Teranga Gold Corp   TGZ TSX  TGZ ASX  looks very interesting  Premier African Minerals Ltd   PREM LSE  is in Zimbabwe and Togo  I didn t even know Togo had any minerals  but there s quite some mineralization there  so I m looking into those new areas  For instance  Liberia used to have political problems  but it s quiet now  It used to be famous for its diamonds  Now it s looking into gold and other minerals  and there are several companies active in Liberia  I am looking at Amlib Holdings Plc  privately held   a very interesting situation  and some other companies  TGR  Why haven t those companies that have had solid  if not record  years had better share price performance  HK  In a market that is struggling and depressed  it s not easy to do well despite good results  but if you look at their share prices  they haven t done badly  They are all selling at levels not too far below their former highs  Argonaut Gold Inc   AR TSX   Aurcana Corporation  AUN TSX V  AUNFF OTCQX   Great Panther Silver Ltd   GPR TSX  GPL NYSE MKT   Scorpio Gold Corp   SGN TSX V   SilverCrest Mines Inc   SVL TSX V  SVLC NYSE MKT  and Timmins Gold Corp   TMM TSX  TGD NYSE MKT  are all doing great and are looking at even better results in the next few years  SilverCrest has remarkable growth potential  it will be doubling its production in the next three years  Argonaut Gold is digesting the recent takeover of the Magino mine in Ontario  which upon coming to production can double its current output  Argonaut Gold just had warrants converted  and has over  117 million   117M  in the treasury  so it is well financed  Timmins Gold is on the right track  The potential at its one project is great and it has the cash flow to do it  Also Great Panther  which was struggling a little bit  had a great fourth quarter last year  TGR  Argonaut s stated goal on the website is to produce 300 500 Koz gold over the next few years  but it s currently producing about 120 140 Koz  Magino is going to add to the production profile  but it s not going to get Argonaut there on its own  HK  Argonaut has more than Magino such as San Antonio  El Castillo and La Colorado  It is undertaking to define the potential of the Magino because it would like to see the mine happen first the company just acquired it  It would like to find out whether it is as big as the former management said it was  Do not underestimate Argonaut s management  it is a pretty serious and determined team  I like the team and I think it will succeed in reaching its goal  TGR  Great Panther produced 454 Koz in Q4 12 versus 371 Koz in Q3 12  Can investors realistically expect it to continue that kind of growth  HK  Great Panther has been having some problems with maintaining its cost and production levels  However  the fourth quarter was a nice sign  I have great admiration for Great Panther  Bob Archer is a great entrepreneur and a very intelligent operator  He s the kind of CEO that investors like to see  TGR  And Scorpio Gold  HK  CEO Peter Hawley is a modest but very intelligent and reliable person  I believe that Nevada will

189904,411420,NEM,Alka Singh  Distinguish Precious Metal  Haves  From The  Have Nots ,opinion,With gold and silver prices expected to be heading higher in 2013  investors will need to decide how to allocate funds to both hedge their bets and still make room for upside potential  In this interview with The Gold Report  Alka Singh of the independent research firm Mine2Capital tells investors how to distinguish the  Haves  from the  Have Nots  and the  Wannabes  and names companies with upside potential  The Gold Report  When you last  with The Gold Report in late May  gold was hitting its first bottom of 2012  just over  1 570 ounce  oz   after apparently breaking a multiyear uptrend around the end of March  Silver bottomed about a month later just under  26 oz  While both prices are higher as we speak  2012 has been pretty much a sideways year  What are you predicting for 2013  in light of world economic and political developments over the past six months  Alka Singh  Gold is trading over  1 700 oz again and silver is over  32 oz  I believe this trend will continue in the short to medium term with higher prices for both metals in 2013 as the global economic crisis will take at least a couple of years to be resolved  Gold has a unique characteristic  and the price of gold tends to increase both during an inflationary period as well as when there is deflation  I don t see gold or silver prices coming off from where they are right now  TGR  Do you have any target figures in mind  or any specific catalysts that you think could cause a big breakout  AS  Almost every country in Europe  as well as the U S   is heavily debt laden  and the countries are all trying to manage the debt crisis by printing more money  When that happens  gold prices will continue to increase  With Obama winning the election  the quantitative easing will continue  which will be very positive for gold in 2013  In terms of target prices  I think gold will move closer to  1 900 oz  if not  2 000 oz next year  and silver will be north of  35 oz  TGR  Shouldn t silver have better leverage than gold  It has in the past  AS  Basically  silver is poor man s gold  and silver prices have historically followed gold prices  However  silver has more leverage  as you mentioned  than gold  Historically the gold silver price ratio has been about 25 27 1  In recent times  we have seen the gold silver ratio around 50 1  so it s almost doubled  We don t expect gold prices to fall  so the only way to bring that ratio back to the historical average ratio is to have silver prices go competitively higher than gold prices  TGR  The disconnect between metals prices and mining shares continues to frustrate investors looking for a turnaround  What do you think it will take to close this performance gap  AS  If I had to pick a timeline  I would say in early 2013 we should start seeing the gap close  Gold equities have not kept up with the gold prices due to the volatility in the stock market  Investors are still very afraid of the stock market and the economy and don t know what to do  This fear is the reason why the equities have not performed as well as the metals  The other big problem facing mining companies is that costs have been going up at a higher rate than metals prices  so profit margins have been squeezed  We saw operating costs increase for many of the large gold producers including Barrick Gold Corp   ABX TSX  ABX NYSE   Kinross  K TSX  KGC NYSE   IAMGOLD Corp   IMG TSX  IAG NYSE  and Newmont Mining Corp   NEM NYSE   We have also seen capital costs go up by 50 100  for the projects  That  together with the volatility in the stock market  has caused the equities to not keep up with metals prices  For the gap to actually narrow  the companies have to make sure that the capital expenditure guidance they are giving to the market can actually be achieved  Until they are able to lower their costs and increase their profit margins  it will be very difficult for the gap to narrow  because it s easier for investors to buy gold bullion and exchange traded funds and get the entire price appreciation  rather than buying the equities and facing all the operational and technical risks  I think that in 2013 that gap should start coming down  although I can t say with certainty that it will close  That s because the operational issues have been going on for over a year now  TGR  It seems as if there has been negative leverage for the mining shares versus the positive leverage that people used to expect  AS  That is absolutely correct  Until the companies and the managements of the companies start controlling their costs and start giving better guidance to the market  equities will underperform the commodities  Also  investors are now focusing more on dividends and cash flows than on growth  so management of the mining companies need to realize this and change their strategies accordingly  TGR  Unlike in the past  when rising metals prices floated all stocks  it now seems that resource companies are increasingly being divided into what I would call the  haves   the  have nots  and the  wannabes   Most investors are focusing on the haves  which are successful producers  and to a lesser extent on the wannabes that are smaller  but hoping to survive and grow  The vast majority  however  fall into the have not category  that might hit on something or not survive  How is this influencing your investment choices at this point  AS  The reason why investors are focusing on the companies that are haves is because they are usually large cap companies that are already producers  which means that they are highly liquid and cash flow positive  In a volatile market like this  investors do look for liquidity  When they get into a stock  they want to know that they are able to get out of it when they want to get out  The have not category is one that performs very well when gold prices are increasing substantially and are expected to continue doing so  because the option value of their assets increases  During the times when gold prices are flat or the market volatility is high  we don t see these kinds of companies doing well  which is why you don t see investors buying companies in the have not category at this time  The companies and equities that have been hit a lot are the ones that are in the wannabe category  These companies have good assets and good management teams  however  they are about three to five years away from being cash flow positive  That means that they have assets that are either in the prefeasibility or the feasibility stage and it will take them at least two years to build a mine and be cash flow positive  They are suffering right now because when investors are afraid  they choose to invest in companies with positive cash flows  rather than companies that will be in production in two to three years  Wannabe companies are where investors should have the highest potential returns because they are now trading below their net asset values  As they are only about 12 36 months away from production  their stock prices should increase faster  Companies in this sector really have the most upside potential  if metals prices continue to increase and investors  risk appetite improves  TGR  Maybe we can talk a little bit about specific companies that you re currently focusing on and what s going on with their exploration and development activities  Certainly  a lot of action is taking place in Mexico and Latin America  What s your view on what s going on there  AS  A lot of companies are actually focusing on exploration in Mexico and Latin America because these countries are supposedly politically safe areas  With what we have seen happen in some countries in West Africa  investors are afraid of investing in much of Africa now other than  say  Ghana or perhaps Burkina Faso  We have seen a coup in Mali and some issues in Egypt and in West Africa as well as East Africa  Companies are actually focusing more on Latin and North America  Investors are ready to pay a good premium for companies with assets in Canada  U S   Mexico  Chile  Brazil or Guyana because of the lower political risks  I want to talk about a few companies that we think are really solid  One of them is Atacama Pacific Gold Corp   ATM TSX V   The Cerro Maricunga project in Chile has approximately 4 5 million ounces  Moz    Currently  it is going through a preliminary economic assessment  PEA   the results of which are expected to be announced before the end of this year  I like the Cerro Maricunga gold project as it is all oxide associated ore  and the metallurgy for oxide is much easier and cheaper than for sulphide ore  I like the management team as well  and the insiders own 40  of the stock  That s my favorite name right now  TGR  Would this be a low grade  open pit operation  AS  Cerro Maricunga will be a low grade  open pit operation  The mineralization starts at surface and continues to over 500 meters in depth  Atacama will have a big open pit operation at Cerro Maricunga  I also like Volta Resources Inc   VTR TSX   The company has the Kiaka project in Burkina Faso  It has over 5 Moz of NI 43 101 compliant total gold resources  The company just put out its prefeasibility study and is now in the feasibility stage with those results to be announced in Q2 13  We like Kiaka because it s a big  low grade  bulk tonnage deposit  There are very few deposits in the world that have over 5 Moz  and this falls in that category  We like the management of Volta and think that Kiaka will become a mine over the next three to four years  TGR  Most people have never heard of Burkina Faso  How politically stable is it  AS  Burkina Faso is a democracy  very similar to Ghana  It did have some labor issues earlier this year  but those have all been resolved  IAMGOLD  SEMAFO Inc   SMF TSX  SMF OMX   High River Gold Mines Ltd   HRG TSX  and Avocet Mining Plc  AVM LSE  have operating gold mines in Burkina Faso  There are six producing gold mines in Burkina Faso right now  I think it s actually a politically safer jurisdiction than many of the other African countries  TGR  What else do you like  AS  In the silver space  I would like to mention Levon Resources Ltd   LVN TSX V  L09 FSE  LVNVF OTC   The stock has been beaten up a lot  just like every junior  Levon has over 455 Moz silver in politically safe Mexico and over  55 million in the bank  It has a deposit called Cordero  which is a Pe asquito look alike deposit  With all the market volatility going on  the company has stopped drilling recently  but this is going to be another huge operation  Newmont owns about 11  of Levon  I really like Levon because of the silver exposure and the fact that it is one of the largest undeveloped silver projects in the world  There are not that many companies with good  undeveloped silver deposits in the world  and Levon is one of them  TGR  Levon has been around for many  many years  AS  That is correct  TGR  Are there any other ones in Mexico or other places in South America that you d like to talk about  AS  I like Brazil Resources Inc   BRI TSX V  BRIZF OTCQX   which is obviously in Brazil  It just closed a deal about a month and a half ago with Luna Gold Corp   LGC TSX V   where it bought Luna Gold s Cachoeira project  The project has about 667 000 oz  667 Koz  of gold and is expected to announce that it is getting into a PEA at Cachoeira  I think the company will be looking at other acquisitions as well  It s a good company with a management team that has a lot of experience in Latin America  The stock hasn t performed very well  just like the other juniors  but I think that it s a good company to hold  TGR  Where is that trading these days  AS  Brazil Resources is trading at  1 06 share and I have a 12 month target price of  1 45  I would also like to mention Timmins Gold Corp   TMM TSX V  TGD NYSE MKT   Timmins Gold has been ramping up production in Mexico  I don t cover it officially  but I really like the management team and the San Francisco gold mine in the Sonora State of Mexico that they operate  It s a nice  small operation  producing over 100 Koz gold at a low cost  I think that it has a lot of exploration upside as well and I like it a lot  TGR  In general  what s your overall assessment of the metals situation these days  What do you think that investors ought to be doing to hopefully make some reasonable money in the coming year or at least protect their downside  AS  If investors are risk averse  I think that they should just stick with large cap liquid names  like the large producers  which will probably pay dividends and have an upside when gold prices go up  Investors who have some risk appetite should choose among some of these smaller companies with good management teams and good assets in not very politically risky jurisdictions where projects could be in production over the next two to three years  Those will have the most upside over the next year  TGR  That sounds both reasonably conservative and  hopefully  optimistic thinking  We ll have to see what happens with the metals markets and if they can drag these stocks along with them  Thanks for speaking with us today  Alka  AS  I hope for the same  Thanks for having me   started her career as a

189912,411428,NEM,How Gold Miners Can Leverage The Price Of Gold,opinion,Gazing into their crystal balls last week  Wall Street firms interpreted differing futures for gold next year  Morgan Stanley awarded gold the  best commodity for 2013  while Goldman Sachs called the end of the metal s hot streak  After seeing 11 consecutive years of positive performance from gold  one needs to be wary of research analysts  price forecasts  as they have consistently underestimated the shifting dynamics driving the precious metal higher  Take a look at analysts  annual predictions of gold prices  which is  a telling picture   CEO Nick Holland of Gold Fields told the crowd at a mining conference last summer  From 2006 through 2011  Bloomberg s contributing analysts have forecasted that future gold prices would be lower   The analysts who keep telling us the gold price is going down have been wrong seven years out of seven  That s a remarkable track record   says Holland It is worth keeping gold s DNA of volatility in mind as the day to day price of gold naturally fluctuates  of course  Based on 10 years of data as of September 30  2012  over any 20 days  there is a 7 percent chance of a 10 percent change in the gold price  Swings have historically been more frequent for gold equities  moving 10 percent up or down about 30 percent of the time over the same time frame  The upside to gold stocks is that investors historically have received a 2 to 1 leverage by owning gold equities instead of the commodity  U S  Global s Portfolio Manager Brian Hicks reminded The Gold Report readers of this fact during an extensive conversation that he and Portfolio Manager Ralph Aldis had with Brian Sylvester  The muscle that gold miners can use to increase their  multiplier effect  for shareholders is three fold  grow production volume  expand margins or optimize capital  explained Holland   You want to keep showing that you can increase the return on the mine and that you can increase the cash flow available for shareholders at a particular gold price   In recent years  gold mining companies have been facing the dilemma of trying to grow their production profile while also depleting their current resource base  As  in a recent podcast  no miner wants to show investors that their production profile is in decline  so there has been a huge push to grow gold production  However  this  growth for growth s sake  mind frame has resulted in a congested intersection of projects in the pipeline  Take a look at the chart that National Bank Financial  NBF  put together showing an  unprecedented wave  of projects that mining companies are planning over the next decade  Each dot represents either a gold and precious metals project or a base metals and iron ore project  The bigger the dot  the larger the estimated cost of the project  The 2006 through 2010 construction history benchmarks the engineering and construction industry s capacity to build new mines  Relative to the size and number of new projects in the pipeline  the current pool of expertise to build these projects is quite limited  NBF s mining analysts indicate that about 30 projects can be completed in a two year time frame  The critical shortage of technically skilled people has been driving up the cost of projects and resources   Mines that used to cost  2 billion only a few years ago  now cost  5 billion   and the beneficiaries of these projects have not been shareholders  but contractors  employees  consultants  governments and equipment suppliers  says Stifel Nicolaus  George Topping  a well respected analyst with years of experience in capital markets  In his research   Don t Build It And They Will Come   he analyzed the projects that four senior miners  Barrick  ABX   Goldcorp  GG   Kinross  KGC  and Newmont  NEM   have in the pipeline  looking at the capital expenditures  cash costs and internal rates of return to determine whether he thought the projects should be continued or deferred  Of the 14 he looked at  only five projects were worth pursuing  in his view  Instead of spending the money on these projects   senior producers would be able to pay higher dividends  say yielding 5 percent at current prices   according to Stifel  A monthly or quarterly dividend program shows that gold miners have a pulse and are taking disciplined action in paying back some of their capital  The Fairytale Land of Cash Costs The other factor that has been hurting gold miners is the outdated use of a cash costs measure which doesn t reflect the true costs of mining  In the Mineweb podcast  Ralph and I discussed these  cash cost fairytales   with Ralph pointing out that only governments believe gold miners have seen a windfall profit from the rising price of gold  He says   You ve got to thank your cash cost marketing for basically taxing 50 percent of your gains away in the form of taxes when the government has risked no capital on the project and not borne any of the risks during the construction of the project   Research indicates that an  all in cost  is much more indicative of the true cost of mining  as it takes into consideration operating costs  sustaining capital  construction capital discovery costs  and overhead tax along with acceptable profit  For example  CIBC s research calculates that a sustainable number for mining an ounce of gold would be  1 700  These factors highlight the importance of active management  as gold companies that are successful at executing what they ve articulated to the public should be more effective at leveraging the price of gold  In addition  as Brian explains to The Gold Report   The precious metals market is surprisingly inefficient   meaning that active investors should be able to take advantage of dislocations in the market  Disclosure  U S  Global Investors  Inc  is an investment management firm specializing in gold  natural resources  emerging markets and global infrastructure

189914,411430,NEM,Mark Lackey  Golden Mining Opportunities In West Africa,opinion,Gold has been produced in Africa for thousands of years in places like Ghana and neighboring countries whose names have changed over the centuries  One thing that has not changed is that there s still a huge amount of gold to be found and mined in West Africa  That s what Mark Lackey likes about the area and in this interview with The Gold Report  he talks about companies that are or will be producing significant amounts of the world s prized metal  The Gold Report  When you last  with The Gold Report this past March  gold had just dropped from its first peak of the year  from  1 781 ounce  oz  at the end of February to  1 660 oz in a matter of three weeks  Now it s looking for support at  1 700 oz  The trading range you predicted for 2012 looks good in retrospect  What are you projecting from here  Mark Lackey  I m looking at a range from  1 680 oz to  1 850 oz  and moving up over the year so that by December I am expecting to see the gold price at  1 850 oz  TGR  But you don t see a big breakout past  2 000 oz that some people are predicting  ML  It s possible  but for the gold price to go much higher than  1 850 oz there needs to be a good reason  such as a big decline in the value of the U S  dollar or major gold buying by central banks  While I expect the dollar will weaken somewhat in 2013  I don t expect a huge decline  Over the next few years we ll get above  2 000 oz  but probably not in 2013  TGR  What do you see as the market drivers for gold at this time  ML  Significant trade and fiscal deficits remain in the United States and the country is continuing to use quantitative easing  which tends to lower the value of the U S  dollar  Investors are going to look at the U S  dollar and the euro and decide that there are other financial options they would rather own  Some investors will buy gold as an investment alternative to paper currencies  In addition  I believe that jewelry demand will continue to increase as a result of the growing middle class in Indonesia  China and India  Those are the demand factors that will move the price of gold higher in the short run  We also anticipate that some of the gold projects that are expected to begin production in 2013 will be delayed due to regulatory and permitting issues and this will lower the supply of gold on the world market and therefore push up the price of gold  TGR  What s the next concern that might become the focus for precious metals investors  ML  I don t think Europe s problems have gone away after allocating over  300 billion to Greece  We cannot count on Europe to have the kind of economic growth it once did  but as long as it doesn t crater dramatically  there s still going to be demand for gold and other commodities  I m looking at a modest recession in Europe in 2013  I do think the Spanish banking system will be bailed out but as long as Spain s sovereign debt doesn t have to be bailed out  Europe will muddle through  TGR  Despite the relative strength of gold over the past year  the performance of gold stocks has been pretty disappointing  When and how is the turnaround coming  ML  If you look at the performance of the gold markets  the one area where we ve actually made some good returns was in the mid cap gold producers and near term producers that did rally with the price of gold  The problem for many of the larger producers was that they didn t reach the production numbers that they had forecast and their production costs were also above what they had planned  Thus their earnings and cash flows were below expectations and this resulted in share prices that did not follow the rising gold price  There are a number of smaller gold companies that do not have much cash left on the balance sheet and found it difficult to raise money in this past year so this prevents these companies from moving their projects forward  The Toronto Venture market has declined from a level of 2 450 in April 2011 to 1 200 at end of 2012  so it is not surprising that many junior mining companies have had a difficult time trying to attract new financing  Many of those companies saw significant declines in their share prices especially at the end of 2012 as they were hit by tax loss selling  We believe that there will be share price appreciation in 2013 for those junior gold companies that still have money  or can raise it  and have good projects  We expect that with gold prices going higher in 2013  investors will be buying the well run junior companies  especially those that may have declined or lagged behind in 2012 due to the overall market conditions  TGR  Where do you see the best opportunities for investors in gold stocks these days  ML  We look at three or four factors when we try to make a decision on a gold company  We like to see an experienced management team with a project or projects in a jurisdiction that does not have significant political risk  We also look for companies that have a mining friendly terrain and have access to transportation  power and water  We prefer the companies to be producers or near term gold producers  We are concentrating  as we mentioned earlier  on mid cap and junior companies that have cash in the treasury and are also looking for those companies that are potential takeover candidates  My company  CHF Investor Relations  has several clients in gold  TGR  Last time you talked mainly about companies active in Africa  We know there is lots of potential there  but it seems that there s also been some unrest lately that might cause concerns for some investors  How does the current picture look to you  ML  The gold opportunities tend to concentrate in West Africa  where three of the four countries  Senegal  Ghana and Burkina Faso  are quite stable by anybody s standards and have had no problems with political unrest or indigenization of resources  In Mali  the problem is with the Tuareg rebels and Islamists in northern Mali  The mining companies are in southern Mali  hundreds of miles away  Last month the UN Security Council voted to have 3 300 African troops sent to Mali to remove the rebels from the northern part of the country  The mining employees who we have talked to in Mali have told us that their mining operations have not been impacted  either in production or exploration  by the problems in the north  There have been problems in other parts of Africa  but we have been watching West African projects closely  CHF has no clients in West Africa  by the way  TGR  So what are some of the most interesting stories you re looking at now  ML  One we like is Teranga Gold Corp   TGZ TSX  TGZ ASX   which is in Senegal  Teranga says it will exit 2012 with production between 210 000 oz and 225 000 oz for the year and in the third quarter cash costs were down to  594 oz  The company has its own mill  which is the only one in Senegal  and Teranga also has the largest land position in the country  It has a strong balance sheet having cash equivalents of  31 2 million  M  at Nov  1  2012  and reported a record high third quarter profit of  21 3M  The company says it will eliminate its hedge book by August and will have increasing gold production along with lowering costs of production  Teranga will focus on producing the gold ounces that will provide the best returns  TGR  What else do you like in West Africa  ML  Another one we ve been looking at is Orezone Gold Corporation  ORE TSX   which is developing the Bombor  project  the largest undeveloped gold mine in Burkina Faso  It has a strong development team and large near surface tonnage  so it s going to be a relatively low cost producer  It has 2 million ounces  Moz  in oxide resources in the top 50 meters  and 80  of its resources are within the top 80 meters from surface  The property is close to the national highway and has nearby water  power and a large labor force  which should translate into reduced development and operating costs  TGR  Those are some pretty world class resources  ML  Orezone s recent NI 43 101 released in October 2012 contained 4 1 Moz of Indicated and 1 Moz of Inferred resources  This will be a significant gold producer in the next few years  TGR  Or possibly get taken out  ML  That s certainly possible  Given the increasing drilling activity and the increase in gold reserves in Burkina Faso  Senegal  Mali and Ghana  many major and mid size gold producers will be looking to acquire some of these companies  Orezone is one of the companies that could be taken over  TGR  What s been going on with some of the companies you talked about last March  ML  Riverstone Resources Inc   RVS TSX V  announced on Dec  19 that it had completed its takeover of Blue Gold Mining  This will add some very strong talent to an already very good management team working to advance the Karma project  its flagship play in Burkina Faso  Riverstone also has three additional properties  Recent drilling activity has been very good  This is another miner that we think will have production in the next few years  TGR  Was this a strategic merger  ML  Yes  I think the idea here was that if these two teams got together  they could make a much stronger company  Combining the management teams and their financial resources will  in our view  lower the execution risk of their projects and significantly improve the company s ability to finance itself in the future  TGR  What else do you have here  ML  We talked about Channel Resources Ltd   CHU TSX V   which has the Tanlouka property in Burkina Faso  We like Channel as it could become a mid term producer of approximately 100 000 oz by 2018  The present Indicated and Inferred estimate at Mankarga 5 is 1 2 Moz  Channel has some other excellent exploration targets and we believe that the projects at Manesse and Tanwaka have the potential to host gold deposits similar to Mankarga 5  The additional exploration could eventually define a resource above the 2 Moz level  This exploration team has done an excellent job as it has been successful in defining a major gold resource  We like these oxide deposits for their metallurgical properties  since it usually means that the deposits can be mined at a low strip ratio  TGR  What else looks interesting  ML  The next one is African Gold Group Inc   AGG TSX V   the company is developing the Kobada property in southwest Mali  We think African Gold can begin production in 2015  and by 2017 we are projecting annual production of 125 000 oz of gold  One of the big advantages in this part of the world is the highly oxidized rock  which is relatively cheap to mine and mill and also lies close to the surface  It has other exploration opportunities with the large sulfide resources below the oxide layers  which can significantly increase reserves  In addition to the Kobada property  the company has other promising exploration targets at Gossokorodji  Diaban and Foroko North  African Gold has been in Mali for years and has personnel who have developed other gold mines in Mali  TGR  What s next on your list  ML  Volta Resources Inc   VTR TSX  is a company that has really moved forward  having nine exploration projects  It is currently transitioning itself from explorer to producer in Burkina Faso  at present to converting its flagship asset  the Kiaka gold project  into a producing gold mine  The present NI 43 101 contains 4 1 Moz in the Measured and Indicated categories  and 1 Moz in the Inferred category  Given the size of the resource  I would think that  down the road  Volta could be a potential takeover candidate  Given its excellent resources and  21M in cash and no debt  Volta will have no concerns about having to raise money anytime soon  That s a significant plus in this market  TGR  What else do you have  ML  A lot of people know Pelangio Exploration Inc   PX TSX V  because  going back in its history  it developed the Detour Lake Gold Mine in northern Ontario and that ended up becoming a big winner for shareholders  It now has two properties in Ghana where it has completed some drilling that has recently started to show some interesting results  Its Manfo property lies between the Ahafo mine  which is operated by Newmont Mining Corporation  NEM NYSE   and Kinross Gold Corp  s  K TSX  KGC NYSE  Chirano mine  You would think Pelangio has a good chance of being on strike with the producers on either side  If it can continue to do more drilling and produce more similar results  we might see some pretty interesting resource estimates come about for this project  Pelangio also has another very good property  the Obuasi property in Ghana  located adjacent to AngloGold Ashanti Ltd  s  AU NYSE  ANG JSE  AGG ASX  Obuasi mine  which has already produced 30 Moz of gold  This is an interesting play because of management s extremely successful track record and because it has added a number of individuals to the management team who have significant experience with mining operations in Ghana  We ll have to follow and see how the drilling results go  but certainly it is a very interesting play with major upside potential  TGR  That s another one to keep an eye on  ML  The last one I ve got in Africa is Roxgold Inc   ROG TSX V   which had a proxy battle last summer  Ultimately a deal was completed and I give credit to Oliver Lennox King and Rick Mazur  Mazur was the executive handling the restructuring and then left when it was done  They put together a strong board and a good management team  This is important because I ve seen these sorts of proxy battles in the past that ended up destroying some companies  Roxgold is presently developing three mining properties in Burkina Faso  The company is advancing a high grade gold discovery at its flagship property at Yaramoko  At the 55 Zone there is an initial resource estimate of 354 000 oz of gold  that graded 17 8 grams ton  g t  in the Indicated category and 306 000 oz of gold that graded 7 7 g t in the Inferred category  These grade are not typical in Burkina Faso where most projects are big volume but low grade  The company has raised  65M to date  so it s well capitalized for its 2013 drilling program  If the company can continue to increase its high grade tonnage  it will certainly be a takeover candidate  TGR  Do you have any wildcard plays anywhere that people might be interested in  either in precious metals or otherwise  ML  We ve been looking at a number of zinc plays and probably our favorite right now is Chieftain Metals Inc   CFB TSX   which has properties in northern British Columbia  We like this one because  first of all  it has a very experienced management team  which is critical to understanding the metallurgy and the mining in northwestern B C  Second  with all the zinc mines that are going to close in the next few years  taking millions of pounds out of production  we believe there s going to be an upward move in the price for zinc  certainly by 2014 2015  Chieftain has recently completed a financing and it should be publishing its feasibility study later this month  Within a couple of years we think that the zinc price will increase up to  1 40 a pound  That makes a number of zinc plays attractive  especially Chieftain  given its potential to become a zinc producer  TGR  Where do we go from here  and how should our readers be positioning themselves for what lies ahead in 2013  ML  As I said  CHF has a number of clients in gold  some low cost producers  too  but generally speaking  in the gold sector  we would concentrate primarily on jurisdictions we like  West Africa has a lot of advantages compared to some of the more traditional mining areas  One factor is that it is easier to get mining permits compared to some of the jurisdictions in North and South America  West Africa is also flat and dry  has water  power  transportation and a good labor force  In addition  we want experienced management teams that have experience in the jurisdictions where they are exploring  TGR  Thanks for the ideas and updates  Mark  and we ll

189924,411440,NEM,The Original Bottom Fisher Finds High Risk And Reward In Nevada,opinion,Forget about juggling a basket of country risk in places like South Africa and South America  For his money  newsletter writer John Kaiser would rather take a chance on explorers in his own backyard of the western U S   based on millions of years of geology and some exciting new discovery methods  In this exclusive interview with The Gold Report  Kaiser outlines the trends  and the juniors staking their claims  in Nevada  The Gold Report  John  2012 has been a volatile year for junior equities  What is your thesis for diversifying your portfolio to both protect and possibly grow wealth in this market  John Kaiser  It s interesting that American households currently have bank deposits totaling  8 7 trillion  which is an all time record  and yet these deposits are earning less than 1   This illustrates the anxiety about where the general economy and equity markets are going  Given the risk that we could end up in a global recession next year that could possibly deteriorate into a depression down the road  it is understandable that the public wants to keep its capital secure  This could have very negative implications for the general equity markets  which are vulnerable to all sorts of disruptions  That is why I am recommending that cautious investors leave 90 95  of their portfolio in low yielding cash deposits and then shift the other 5 10  into a diversified portfolio of extremely high risk securities that could yield some big winners  The area that I think is going to be very prospective in the next few years is discovery exploration in the resource sector  where stocks can go up 10  20 or 30 times in response to a discovery  TGR  A lot of the resource sector used to be focused on South Africa  That s becoming riskier due to worker unrest  South America has had violence and nationalization threats  Are there still opportunities in relatively safe domestic markets like the U S   JK  I think we are ripe for a return of interest to the U S  mining exploration and development sector  It has been shunned to some degree because of long permitting cycles  even for exploration programs  The timeline can be even worse when it comes to putting a mine into production  Fueling this return will be a growing interest in raw material self sufficiency  of which the boom in shale oil and gas is an early example  In other parts of the world such as South Africa  erupting social tensions threaten the operations of major mines  In some countries  higher gold and copper prices are leading to resource nationalism  increased demands for royalties from governments that don t care if increased operating costs are whittling away profits  These countries are losing their attractiveness as a place for operating and developing mines  let alone exploring for new deposits  Others such as China impose export quotas that create two tier pricing systems that favor China based businesses  TGR  You recently toured the historic mining state of Nevada  What are the geological factors that make that basin attractive as gold and silver targets  What are the major trends there  How did they form  JK  Nevada is the second largest gold producing region in the world  Much of this comes from the north central part of Nevada where we have famous names like the Carlin Trend and the Battle Mountain Eureka Trend  This region has very unusual geology where old sedimentary rocks have thrust over each other  with an upper plate horizon consisting of fairly impermeable siltstones over a more permeable limestone lower plate sequence of rocks  This happened several hundred million years ago  Several subsequent waves of magmatism and folding occurred due to pressure from the west as island arcs crashed into Nevada and caused buckling of the entire land mass  The subduction slab underneath caused magmatic upwellings  which created igneous intrusions and doming  The result is a very complex geology that looks like a messed up sheet of bubble wrap  Then  about 40 million  M  years ago  the Pacific plate stopped crashing into the North American continent and the Farallon subduction slab started to founder  As this slab failed like a retreating Niagara Falls  it caused magmatic upwellings  According to a new theory proposed by University of Reno s John Muntean  this spawned gold rich vapors  also laden arsenic  antimony  thallium and mercury that penetrated crustal cracks  mixed with water and resulted in Carlin style gold deposits where upper plate capped lower plate rocks served as structural traps that soaked up the gold and its marker elements like a sponge  These deposits can be very large  deep and offer high gold grade  Only about half of Nevada s estimated gold bounty of more than 150 million ounces  Moz  has been found to date thanks to another subsequent event  The other half is hidden because about 15M years ago  the pressure on the continent ceased and Nevada stretched apart  causing long blocks of rock to rise or fall  which created our basin and range topography  Because the gold deposits already existed before this happened  some ended high  some ended deeper  With erosion  these basins filled  and now they are largely gravel covered  A new wave of exploration could be coming based on the bounty that remains to be found  TGR  What are some examples of explorers that are in a good position to find that bounty and how are they doing it  JK  The most obvious strategy is to look within the apparent trends of known deposits  This includes the Carlin Trend  the northern part of which is dominated by Newmont Mining Corp   NEM NYSE  and Barrick Gold Corp   ABX TSX  ABX NYSE   which own all the key land  At the southern end  Gold Standard Ventures Corp   GSV TSX V  GDVXF OTCQX  has the Railroad Gold project where it is using a clever reconstruction of the geology to home in on what it believes to be a significant Carlin style deposit  Within the Battle Mountain Eureka Trend is the more recently famous Cortez Trend  which started in the 1990s with the Pipeline discovery  which is now being mined by Barrick  Then  at the start of this century  Cortez Hills was discovered within a few miles of Pipeline  Now we re seeing that the Cortez Hills Trend is extending to the Gold Rush and Red Hill deposits  More than 7 Moz has been added to the 20 Moz at Cortez in addition to the 25 30 Moz at Pipeline  The juniors control most of the southern part of this trend  McEwen Mining Inc   MUX NYSE  MUX TSX  assembled a very large land package during the last decade and spent nearly  60M exploring without coming up with any significant  lower plate hosted  Carlin style deposits  which just shows you how difficult it can be  Now another round of companies is coming in to turn over the rocks in this historic area  NuLegacy Gold Corp   NUG TSX V  assembled several properties a couple years ago when everybody was in a funk about gold exploration and the company is now in the process of drilling what it calls the Red Hill property  This is a lower plate window  which is exposed  It has been drilled with shallow holes in the past that have intersected gold mineralization that is not rich enough to make a mine  but NuLegacy figures that if it follows that statigraphy deeper  it will find the richer and longer intersections needed to put together a deposit  Another company that is in the area is Carlin Gold Corp   CGD TSX V   which has just finished drilling a half dozen holes on its Cortez Summit  which is just to the east of the Gold Rush deposit  Again  a lot of this is blind drilling  It s expensive  In new target areas you don t really know what s happening in the third dimension  so your first round of drilling is all about just getting the geology to see where you are and then the geologists can start to think where the deposit would be  Rye Patch Gold Corp   RPM TSX V  RPMGF OTCQX  is another company that managed to pick up the Garden Gate Pass project when a company let it lapse  and it also optioned into the Patty project  which was part of the McEwen Mining project  It has a major drill program on the Garden Gate  where it is going to drill several deep core holes  It hopes that it hits the target mineralization  but the real goal is to understand how the geology behaves on trend with the main deposits  The same is true on the Patty project  where it has some gold mineralization from past drilling  but it is trying to sort out where the system is going  One of the new developments that just emerged this week is Nevada Exploration Inc  s  NGE TSX V  Grass Valley  Nevada  project  which was generated by an innovative technique called hydrogeochemistry that focuses on the gravel covered basins of Nevada  Groundwater is collected and tested for gold and all the various poisons  such as arsenic  antimony  thallium and mercury  which are normally associated with Carlin style deposits  Where tests show a gold in groundwater anomaly  geologists can take a closer look at the bedrock underneath  The interesting thing about the Grass Valley anomaly is that instead of striking northwest southeast as is the norm within the Cortez Trend  the Grass Valley anomaly strikes southwest northeast  This play is stunning because although it is within eyesight of the Cortez Hills deposit  it s in a geological setting where no one would think of wasting any money to explore  Yet  this new technique pointed to an anomaly that shows a 10  to 15 mile strike  a linear anomaly  likely associated with a hidden fault that appears to host an oxidizing gold deposit that is the source of the full set of Carlin style elements  McEwen Mining has elected to earn 70  by carrying the prospect generator 30  to a production decision  This is a high stakes play  which could make a big difference for McEwen Mining itself  which is also developing a number of smaller deposits in Mexico and at the southern end of the Cortez Trend  TGR  Unlike the Grass Valley project  the Gold Standard  NuLegacy  Carlin and Rye Patch projects are based on trends that are already known to exist because they are home to working mines  Is that correct  JK  Yes  They are looking for these lower plate windows within the primary trends where the mineralization is close enough to surface to be found and commercially exploited  TGR  Are we talking about open pit mines or are these deeper than that  JK  If they are near surface  they can be open pit mined  Cortez Hills is part open pit and part underground mine  Finding a new near surface deposit in the outcropping part of Nevada is going to be difficult  You need to look in an area where there s a very thin veneer of upper plate rocks and somebody correctly guesses that mineralized lower plate rocks are just beneath 50 100 meters  m  of waste rock that can be stripped off to allow an open pit mine  In the basins  where you re typically looking at 100m or more of gravel  it may be more difficult to create an open pit mine  so the targets need a richer high grade and size where you have 0 3 ounce or better gold mineralization to make underground mining profitable  Another issue is that the deeper you go  the more likely the mineralization will be refractory  which has a higher processing cost  TGR  A lot of these areas have been looked at before  maybe in the 1980s when the price of gold was less  Where are we in the current discovery cycle  How long do investors have to wait before some of these pay off  JK  The easy gold has already been found in Nevada  Now we have had a decade or so of fairly sophisticated exploration looking for lower plate windows  The next wave will require a very sophisticated search similar to what is happening at Rye Patch and NuLegacy  or a very innovative exploration strategy like hydrogeochemical sampling  The beauty of the latter is that it results in new discoveries such as Grass Valley where no one would have a prior geological reason to explore in the first place  An example of this is another project called Fletcher Junction that Nevada Exploration has optioned to a tiny junior called Spruce Ridge Resources Ltd   SHL TSX V  in the Walker Lane Trend in the western part of Nevada  It is in the Aurora district  which has produced about 4 or 5 Moz during its lifetime from gold and silver epithermal veins  In this case  we are looking at an area covered by a very young volcano  The lavas are not very thick  but they have covered a fairly large area  Nevada Exploration Inc  collected hydrogeochemical samples on the edges of this lava flow and found gold in the groundwater emanating from underneath this lava cap  It drilled some shallow  reverse circulation holes to confirm the depth of the bedrock several years ago  Now the farm in junior is bringing more expensive  angled core drilling designed to demonstrate what could be another Comstock Lode type system  Comstock  which produced 8 Moz gold and 200 Moz silver  was found because its veins were exposed in outcrop  The early prospectors could not see what was under the Aurora lava flow  and modern explorers had no reason to drill through the lava  Companies are moving back into old districts within the Walker Lane that were last explored in the 1980s  applying what they learned from the Ken Snyder mine in Northern Nevada that turned out to be a very high grade  bonanza type vein system and figuring out where to drill new holes  The Comstock  itself  was mined out during the 19th century  and now the lower grade material left behind is being put back into production as a heap leach gold mine  I see the Walker Lane undergoing a revival of exploration interest from the juniors  TGR  On the Cortez Trend  what are the juniors learning from what Newmont and Barrick are finding in their mining operations that will make finding the next one easier  JK  They have learned the structural and stratigraphic controls for this mineralization  Barrick will give a couple of important papers in the next 12 months about what makes the Cortez Hills system tick  Everyone is eager to learn the secrets because this helps them guide their own drilling  It s very rare that miners come up with a target using remote sensing methods such as geophysical surveys or geochemical surveys and then spear the primary deposit with the first few drill holes  With Pipeline  numerous holes were drilled before the primary deposit was found  and even then  it was found because NuLegacy s Roger Steininger drilled a condemnation hole twice as deep as he was supposed to for a heap leach pad for the smaller Gold Acres deposit  An understanding of the geology and the mineral controls can guide the exploration process  which literally is a feedback driven process of underground groping  That is why these are high risk endeavors and junior valuations are relatively low  That is also why you can get 10  20 and 30 fold price increases when an exploration discovery is made and the market recognizes it as the real thing  One way juniors can protect themselves is by always having a plan B ready to tackle if plan A starts to look as if it is not going to deliver the goods  TGR  It sounds as if that is what McEwen  NuLegacy and Rye Patch have  They all talk about a number of other targets on the map  JK  That s right  Rye Patch s big story right now is the Rochester litigation  Last year Coeur d Alene Mines Corp   CDM TSX  CDE NYSE  let all of its Bureau of Land Management claims lapse  Rye Patch noticed that these claims were open and staked them  covering a good part of the existing resource that Coeur d Alene had developed  If a judge agrees that even though Coeur d Alene didn t pay its fees  it doesn t matter because it has an established mine  it gets to keep it  If Coeur d Alene loses that case  it will have to do a deal with Rye Patch to acquire the claims  One way that this could end up being a win win for everybody is if Coeur d Alene buys Rye Patch s properties in the Oreana Trend  including the disputed claims  it would end up with a strategic land position that includes Lincoln Hill adjacent to Rochester  Either way  right now Rye Patch has a higher valuation than the typical junior undertaking grassroots exploration because it has this dual strategy of Oreana Trend Rochester while it is drilling deep holes in the Cortez Trend  hoping to find something that makes the company worth  1 or  2 billion  TGR  That takes us back to your thesis in the very beginning  If 10  of our portfolio is in the high risk exploration resource sector  how much could it return  JK  The way the junior exploration market works is we have these deep  cyclical troughs and high peaks  Right now  we are in a cyclical trough  There has been little appetite for discovery exploration in the past decade  The glass is half empty  No one expects any junior to get lucky  which is why we have very low valuations  If one of them makes a major discovery  say NuLegacy goes from  0 16 to  3 or  4 share  that s a 20 or 30 fold increase  So if you have a  10 000 diversified portfolio of 10 juniors while  90 000 sits in savings deposits  and one of the juniors on which you risked  1 000 goes up 20 fold because of a discovery  then your portfolio consists of  90 000 cash and  30 000 in high risk high reward juniors  in effect a 20  return on the entire  100 000 portfolio  If the discovery has been recognized as a substantial new development  then the market starts to look at these other juniors and says  wow  the glass is actually half full  and we get a market upswing where the tide lifts all the other boats as valuations of all companies in the area become more optimistic  Right now  valuations reflect deep pessimism  not just about the juniors themselves  but also about the overall global economic outlook  I know there are market cycles  such as in 2008 when we had a catastrophic decline that took down everything and severely hurt that 10  of my portfolio that s in extremely high risk stocks  However  that also produced very  very low valuations  So I simply rethought everything  I carved a bit of that 90  parked in cash earning nothing  which had become 98   reallocated it so that 10  was exposed to resource juniors bottom fished at extremely low bargain prices  Since Q1 11 we have had a similar decline  which is why I published a new bottom fish edition in July consisting of 100 of these high risk  high reward juniors  The trick is to make sure when your high risk portfolio blossoms in value that you restore capital back to the 90  of the cash portion of your portfolio  Thus if we get another meltdown that so many fear is imminent  my downside is restricted to 10   Because I avoid revenue producing companies I don t have to worry about things such as how many iPhones Apple is going to sell and what the latest patent lawsuit is going to do  I don t worry about anything but these little juniors and what their projects are  You do have to put some effort into understanding how the exploration sector works  Otherwise  you re just making random guesses  But it is possible to do this because we have all these resources now available on the Internet  TGR  Any final advice for investing in the western basin based on the trends you re seeing  JK  The key thing is to understand what the company thinks it s going to accomplish  If it simply tells you that it is going to find something big  give it a pass  If it shows you detailed diagrams of its various data sets and extrapolations of what it thinks is represented by the target  then you know that when it spends your money drilling that target  there is a chance that it will deliver something  Avoid the companies that do not have well developed and data supported targets  And finally  it s very entertaining to track these juniors in my portfolio  TGR  Thank you for your time  John  JK  Thank you  See the Visual Capitalist s infographic on mining in Nevada    a mining analyst with 25 plus years of experience

189925,411441,NEM,How Different Sector ETFs Are Reacting To Fiscal Cliff Fears,opinion,Many of us in the financial services industry expected the outcome of the election to be determined by Ohio alone  Perhaps surprisingly  while Ohio was close throughout the evening  there was never a need for recounting the  Buckeye State  ballots  President Obama had won the electoral votes needed without a single state showdown  While a protracted battle for control of the White House could have unhinged market participants  the possibility quickly gave way to the more pressing  fiscal cliff   The cessation of scores of tax breaks combined with automatic spending cuts can be credited with enormous selling pressure across the risk spectrum on 11 7 2012  Unlike election uncertainty  however  market watchers have been warning about the ramifications of a prolonged fiscal debate for months  In my 10 17 commentary  I identified  by the partisan divide on on tax extensions and budgetary belt tightening  As of yesterday though  investors have been running for the hills  Other than risk off bond choices  there s very little in the positive column  That said  it may be instructive to view how the different economic segments are faring  Indeed  not every stock ETF is down as much as the broader S P 500 SPDR Trust  SPY   Economic Sector ETFs Respond Differently To Fiscal Cliff Concerns As one might anticipate  most of the economically sensitive sectors have been getting hit the hardest  Energy  XLE   Industrials  XLI   Financials  XLF  and Technology  XLK  have taken the brunt of the risk off activity There are several areas that may represent pockets of opportunity  For example  few areas of the market have been ravaged more by weak domestic and weak global demand than Materials  XLB   Why  then  should this sector behave a bit like a non cyclical segment There are two possibilities  First  more and more folks believe in the probability of a resilient China  The more Chinese demand for  stuff   the better XLB performs  Indeed  the series of  higher lows  in September  October and November for the XLB SPY price ratio is a sign of relative strength in the materials arena There s another possibility  albeit a stealth one at that  President Obama s victory assures a continuation of the ultra easy monetary policy of the Federal Reserve   Note  Romney had talked about his opposition to Bernanke s electronic money printing   It follows that there are a number of gold metals miners in the S P Basic Materials Index like Newmont Mining  NEM   some of them were essentially flat on the trading session  as gold figures to benefit from Obama s second term  Last  but not least  Consumer Discretionary  XLY  showed signs of relative strength in the dramatic sell off as well  It may speak to the electorate s increasing consumption and increasing sentiment  It may also be ignoring revenue misses and poor earnings guidance going forward  but that s for another discussion  Market Vectors Retail  RTH  may offer a less volatile way to invest in the consumer  It is weighted equally between consumer defensive and cyclical consumer stationary and has a lower beta than XLY  And yet  RTH has outperformed XLY year to date  Disclosure  Gary Gordon  MS  CFP is the president of Pacific Park Financial  Inc   a Registered Investment Adviser with the SEC  Gary Gordon  Pacific Park Financial  Inc  and or its clients may hold positions in the ETFs  mutual funds  and or any investment asset mentioned above  The commentary does not constitute individualized investment advice  The opinions offered herein are not personalized recommendations to buy  sell or hold securities  At times  issuers of exchange traded products compensate Pacific Park Financial  Inc  or its subsidiaries for advertising at the ETF Expert web site  ETF Expert content is created independently of any advertising relationships ,2012-11-08,Gary Gordon,https://www.investing.com/analysis/how-different-sector-etfs-are-reacting-to-fiscal-cliff-fears-142795,142795
189932,411448,NEM,Why Junior Gold Stocks Are Still The Place To Be  Edward Karr,opinion,Edward Karr  CEO of Geneva based RAMPartners  favors a disciplined  patient and steady approach to investing in junior gold mining companies  In this exclusive interview with The Gold Report  Karr shares his thoughts on the European crisis  its effect on gold prices and some of his favorite junior gold mining companies  The Gold Report  Edward  because you re based in Switzerland  it would be interesting to get your perspective on the Eurozone s new rescue fund  the Eurozone Stability Mechanism  ESM   There is talk in the market that it could get a banking license  which would provide it access to European Central Bank  ECB  funds  aiding it in bailing out Spain and other economies  Do you believe that will happen  Edward Karr  The idea of the ESM actually getting a banking license was floated recently by ECB council member Ewald Nowotny  The question you have to ask is why would it want to give the ESM a banking license  The answer is leverage  The ESM right now has about  500 billion in it  large enough to handle Greece  But now bond yields in Spain have gone above the critical 7  level and banks in Spain and specific regions of Spain  such as Valencia  have asked for their own bailouts  meaning the whole house of cards is starting to tumble  With yields above 7   Spain has effectively gone over the event horizon of the financial black hole  A deflationary gravity and negative feedback loop is so strong that there is no return once you go over the event horizon  Next in line are two countries that are going to give the European governments and global central bankers nightmares Italy and France  The ESM is just not large enough to handle these bailouts in its current configuration  so it has to be increased  The ECB is looking to give the ESM a banking license so it could leverage up to handle some of these larger countries  TGR  Recently ECB President Mario Draghi said he would do  whatever it takes to support the euro   Your thoughts  EK  I believe the ECB will do this  I think that it is going to print and print and print  We re talking trillions and trillions of euros to bail out these countries  TGR  How does the ECB get around European law that prohibits it from undertaking liquidity measures  EK  First of all  there will be a big ruling coming in September from a German constitutional court about the ESM s legality  Nevertheless  there are a number of ways the Eurocrats can get around European law  The aforementioned banking license for the ESM will leverage it up  they can also change the law to allow the ECB to lend directly to banks  We re going to see creative solutions and we re going to see a lot more liquidity pumped into the system  TGR  That is what many economists believe the European economies need  What are your thoughts  EK  It s really a path of no return and it s going to be very difficult to change course  I don t believe that this is what the economies need  Printing money out of thin air is never positive  What is needed  in my opinion  is for a massive cut in government spending so it does not crowd out the free market  The solution is for government to get out of the way and let the private sector flourish  but that is not happening  TGR  The Bank for International Settlements is discussing the idea of reclassifying gold from a Tier 3 asset to a Tier 1 asset  That would mean that gold is valued at 100   How do you think that would affect the gold price  EK  It would be interesting if that does happen  Historically a bank s gold holdings under a Tier 3 classification have to be discounted 50  of the current market value  So a lot of commercial banks have little incentive to hold gold as an asset because they could only lend out half of it  If the Basel Committee does agree to let banks use gold as a Tier 1 capital  I think it could create substantial demand for physical bullion  That would be an important step toward gold s remonetization  having commercial banks and ultimately central banks hold a lot more gold as reserves on their balance sheets  More bank lending may have inflationary effects  too  which would give physical gold bullion a nice double whammy effect if this happens  TGR  Marshall Auerbach  an economist with Toronto based Pinetree Capital  wrote in a blog that central banks routinely take hedge positions against their underlying reserve assets but never report the derivative overlay  He writes   if the European national central bank  with 2 000 tons of gold in its vault  sells forward against that position  basically thereby eliminating it  it doesn t report the corresponding forward position  Consequently  it may be that the official institutions do not have the gold they report to hold on their balance sheets   Do you think that s happening and how would that news affect gold equities  EK  I think this has been happening for a long  long time  Groups like Gold Anti Trust Action Committee have done an excellent job documenting this fact  The major central banks around the world have entered into forward contracts to try and gain a slightly higher return on their physical holdings  If central banks were caught short and had to cover  it really could have the potential to send the gold price higher  And this would be a big positive for gold equities  TGR  Where do you see gold finishing this year  EK  I think that gold will end 2012 a little lower than the current levels today  So  I ll say  1 500 ounce  oz   TGR  Let s talk about fear  In the fall of 2011 you said   When people get scared  markets and stock prices get way out of line  That is when you need to have the courage to really step in and accumulate   Lately it s taking even more courage than it used to  to do just that  Did you expect the fall in the junior mining companies to be this steep  EK  Actually  no  I did not  It has been such a difficult last nine months with the junior mining sector  since January it has been straight downhill  And I personally don t believe we have even seen the panic stage yet  when there is a Lehman Brothers type moment  perhaps when a major international bank goes under  We haven t seen that yet  but we re getting close  When it does happen  that is when investors have to step up and accumulate more  TGR  Can you connect the dots between the instability in Europe and the different debt crises going on and what s happening in this sector and the lack of risk tolerance  EK  Not directly  but indirectly  Fear is approaching an all time high  Clients around the world  both individuals and institutions  want to hold on to cash  They want liquidity at all costs  That is hurting the junior mining sector overall  The second factor is that a lot of people after the 2008 financial crisis requested redemptions from some of the hedge funds  Some did redeem client shares and closed their doors while others did not  leaving customers anxious to get their funds back  Some of the funds that specialized in junior mining stocks are either out of business or they have redemptions  they re in liquidation and they ve been forced to sell  The final factor is that in this sector liquidity can dry up when the prices start to go down  It s a negative feedback loop  As soon as the prices start to go down due to fund liquidations  investors can see their positions go down 30   40   50   It s probably going to stay that way for a while until we get some sort of resolution of the crisis in Europe and then ultimately the United States  TGR  How does RAMPartners  which is a Swiss based investment management and investment banking firm  become interested in tiny mining equities operating in North America  EK  The usual way  We get lots of research reports  We get brokers that call us  We do our own analysis  We re constantly out there looking at different ideas  talking to people within the industry  attending trade shows and presentations  etc  We also go on site visits to see the projects themselves  For instance  I was recently in Nevada visiting several companies and seeing their operations  TGR  Overall  are you still accumulating in this environment  Are you still buying junior mining and junior mining explorer equities  EK  100  yes  Everything out there today really looks very  very attractive  This is a fantastic time to accumulate  This is also why in this industry  with its volatility  you always need a pretty high reserve of cash so you can go in and accumulate  One factor that a lot of people in this industry seem to overlook is the potential for declining energy prices in the future  The United States is currently undergoing an energy revolution  More and more oil and gas production is coming on line due to the unconventional shales  My view is that energy prices are going to continue to fall and we could see crude back to  50 a barrel  bbl   But  for the reasons we ve discussed before  I believe that gold will continue to hold firm at around  1 500 oz or higher and oil will go down to  50 bbl  making gold mining companies a good opportunity  TGR  Gas and diesel are two of the big input costs of the junior miners  EK  Yes  they are huge  TGR  You have management teams from different small cap resource companies coming into your office and pitching you on investing in their companies  What are some things you look for  EK  First  everything in life is run by human beings  You ve got to understand the management  I like to see people who are positive and passionate about what they do  I also like to see management with experience in the industry and a good track record  Finally  I like to see a management team that has invested its own money into the company  I like to see management have a very big equity stake in the company  These are all junior companies so I don t want to see management that is taking large cash salaries and having very high travel expenses and other things like that  Let them put the money in the ground  TGR  How has your approach changed since 2007  a period in which we ve been in and out of a recessionary economic environment  EK  We re not doing as many deals as we did in the past  During a big bull market  the rising tide lifts all boats  And with a big commodity super cycle  investors could invest in a lot of different companies and most likely the market would bail them out  That s just not the case anymore  We do a lot of research  We really get to know the management teams  We do onsite visits to most of the deals that we re involved in  We do fewer deals but have bigger positions and know the companies intimately  TGR  Do you believe this is something you re going to continue once the sector picks up again  EK  We re very opportunistic  if we see the whole sector picking up  if we really start to see investors deploying capital and we think it is sustainable through an economic recovery  then we might start deploying some more cash  Obviously  we d be looking at other opportunities at that point  But for now  we re going through a very  very challenging time both in the financial markets and in the junior side of the gold companies and explorers  That means that we have to keep some cash reserves out there in case any of our portfolio companies  for whatever reason  might need some money  TGR  Are you getting more favorable terms from these junior companies  EK  Without a doubt  Today  if you re an institution that actually has cash and has liquidity and is still writing checks and funding into the junior space  you can almost dictate the terms of your deals these days  That wasn t the case three or four years ago  But  you have to make sure that you use prudence and caution  don t overleverage and keep a lot of cash reserves because the juniors might come back to you for another round of financing  TGR  What advice would you give to an investor today seeking a private placement in a mining exploration company  EK  The most important thing is to do your homework  In this sector there could be a lot of lottery tickets but you should not approach this as a lottery  There are thousands of junior mining companies out there and this is not an easy sector in which to invest  Lots of companies are not going to make it  You ve got to make sure the company has solid management  a solid project and enough financing to execute  Then you look at the stock and its chart  See if you can get in at a very reasonable valuation  And  continue to know everything about that company  TGR  Could you tell our readers about some of the small cap stocks that your company holds and why you bought them  EK  Last time we spoke I had mentioned Pershing Gold Corp   PGLC OTCBB  and I m still very excited about that company  That s a Nevada exploration company moving into production shortly  I was recently in Nevada and visited its Relief Canyon mine and processing facility  I have to tell you  since leaving Franco Nevada Corp   FNV TSX  and taking the helm at Pershing  Steve Alfers has done a tremendous job of advancing the company  He s done a land deal with Newmont Mining Corp   NEM NYSE  and Victoria Gold Corp   VIT TSX V  that dramatically increased Pershing s land position  which is critical  The Pershing geologists can now go out and conduct their exploration programs based upon geology and not worry about prior claim boundaries  Pershing recently closed a private placement with Coeur d Alene Mines Corp   CDM TSX  CDE NYSE   Pershing s neighbor to the north and the largest silver producer in the United States  The investment by Coeur into Pershing is a real game changer  it shows that Pershing can pass serious institutional due diligence  I would also imagine that we ll be seeing more deals between Pershing and Coeur in the future  In addition  Pershing recently announced what looks like a new discovery  The company drilled a target at the Pershing Packard project located near its boundary with Coeur  The press release said that the deposit showed alteration and mineralization typically observed with other producing deposits in the area  I m really looking forward to the assay results when they come out  The real key with Pershing is its Relief Canyon Processing Facility  which is fully paid for  Add to that the recent Coeur financing and Pershing should be fully funded  in my opinion  to production  I estimate it is going to enter production toward the end of next year  And  I believe Pershing can produce 50 000 oz gold in 2014  the processing facility can easily be expanded to 100 000 oz a year  If we assume a cash cost of  700 oz as energy costs come down  and a  1 500 oz gold price  Pershing can potentially throw off  80 million  M  a year in cash flow and I think it will be able to produce for at least 10 years  If you use a pretty aggressive 10  discount rate  you still come up with about a  500M net present value  I think Pershing is one of the most exciting Nevada exploration and production plays I know  TGR  But there s no way to hold Pershing without actually holding Pershing  EK  But there is  Pershing acquired a company called Continental Resources Group Inc   CRGC OTCBB   which is basically now a tracking stock for Pershing Gold  The mathematics of the deal is that for every share of Continental Resources  investors will end up getting 0 8 shares of Pershing  So  there s a real arbitrage opportunity here for astute investors because Pershing Gold is trading today at approximately  0 37 share in the open market and Continental Resources is only trading at  0 22 share  It should be trading at  0 30 share  So by buying Continental Resources  you re actually getting Pershing shares at about a discount  That s a great sale  I ll buy that all day long  TGR  How long is that window going to remain open  EK  That s a good question  Pershing recently filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission  So the window will be just as long as it takes for that registration statement to go effective  Usually registration statements take anywhere from 30 to 60 days to become effective  I d imagine in the next two months Continental Resources shares will convert into Pershing Gold shares  So  the big opportunity will not last long  TGR  Can you give us one or two more names  EK  Here s another one in the same family  Pershing Gold recently spun off its exploration portfolio outside of Pershing County and rolled it into a new company called Valor Gold Corp   VGLD OTCBB   Pershing Gold is the largest shareholder of Valor Gold but Valor Gold is an independent company with some very interesting properties including Red Rock  which is located in the heart of the Battle Mountain Eureka Gold Trend  Barrick Gold Corp  s  ABX TSX  ABX NYSE  Pipeline and Cortez Hills deposits lie to the east  The McCoy Cove mine is just to the west and Newmont s Phoenix mine is to the north  This is big elephant country of world class deposits  All of the surrounding mines I ve just mentioned are at least 5 million ounces  Moz   The geology at Red Rock looks as if it may potentially host a major Carlin style deposit  The CEO  Art Leger  is a very experienced geologist and has led teams that have discovered millions of ounces of gold in his career  The real exciting thing with Valor Gold is that its 2011 drill program already found gold  It was a small amount  but could be a potential feeder zone that will lead the company to a major deposit  Valor is planning a follow on drill program this year following lots of geophysical work to pinpoint its targets  TGR  Anything else in Nevada that you like  EK  There s a bunch of companies that we like and own  I really like Gold Standard Ventures Corp   GSV TSX V  GDVXF OTCQX   Its vice president for exploration  Dave Mathewson  is one of the top geologists out there  He really has the tiger by the tail at Railroad  The company recently raised  20M on a financing at  2 share  making it well funded  Gold Standard Ventures is onto a major world class discovery  The question is how big does this thing get  And  in my opinion  when will it be taken out  TGR  As far as Nevada goes  is that something that you re specifically looking for  In the U S   there really isn t another mining district that compares to it but you have a number of companies in a very safe jurisdiction that are exploring for gold resources  Is that a part of your thesis  Would you be less likely  for example  to invest in a deposit in Argentina versus some company coming to you with a gold exploration project in Nevada  EK  Not necessarily  But there are several great reasons why we want to be in Nevada  Number one  stable political jurisdiction  I don t think the United States is going to nationalize the gold mines in Nevada tomorrow  Number two  there is the rule of law in Nevada  which some other jurisdictions don t have  Number three  the geology  There are very few areas in the world like Nevada that have the geological results to deliver major gold deposits  Number four  the infrastructure  The majors  like Barrick and Newmont  have billions and billions of dollars of infrastructure already invested in the state  That s fantastic for a junior exploration company because if it ends up finding a deposit  the odds are one of the majors is going to come in to take it out  Nevada has modern infrastructure such as roads  etc  It s a lot different when you discover 5 Moz way in the jungle of Brazil or the depths of Siberia or in western China  You d have to build a tremendous amount of infrastructure  We don t preclude ourselves from looking in any jurisdiction  But I really like Nevada as a jurisdiction and I think it has a lot of benefits for investors  TGR  Thanks so much for your insights  is the founder of RAMPartners S A   an investment management and investment

189937,411453,NEM,Markets Higher As Greek Pro Austerity Groups Clinch Coalition Deal ,opinion,ForecastStocks  The European debt contagion remains front and center  Greece and France are holding elections this weekend  and everyone is on  pins and needles  as to the outcomes  Spain and Italy bond yields are high and they are rising   a bearish circumstance  China remains on a growth deceleration curve  with growing concerns of a very hard landing   some estimates see only 7 0   Also  lest us not forget that US economic data is softening   surprising many  Collectively  we find all of this rather troubling as good news headlines are few and far between  which has led to increased selling pressure on rallies Strategy  The S P 500 remains above long term support at the 160  wma at 1190  which delineates bull bear markets  However  the 200 dma support zone at 1266 to 1278 turned prices higher into overhead resistance at 1340 to 1350   we ll expect this countertrend rally to fail sooner rather than later European markets are again modestly higher as today s Greece s pro austerity groups are about to clinch a coalition deal  While this is good news  the news over Greece is starting to wane quite a bit   and in the future we shall see Greece default on her debts  for they are just too onerous  There is no growth package the world can send Greece to help her out of her misery  it shall only prolong the inevitable Outside of Greece  the news is rather horrendous  Spain s auctioned off 12 month bills at 5 07   and 18 month notes at 5 11   This is a dangerous zone to be sure for Spain  and it is only going to get worse  One only need look at the lead chart on page 1 this morning and see that Spain s General Index has broken down out of a longer term  head and shoulders  pattern and has made a feeble attempt to rally in recent days with the rest of the world s capital markets  It failed yesterday in bearish key reversal fashion  and we ll now look for lower lows to develop in the days  weeks and months ahead  Greece showed a similar pattern  and we were laughed at when we said Greece would lose over 50  of her value from that point forward now many believe we have lost our collective mind by saying that Spain will lose 50  from her current levels  We fear for what the world shall look like if this were to occur  Also  we should note that the German ZEW index of investor sentiment fell at its fastest rate since October 1998 Yet  European equities are higher for our central bank saviors are waiting in the wings or are they Trading Strategy  The market is coming to focus upon today s and tomorrow s FOMC meeting and the statement thereafter  There are some such as SocGen who believes the Fed will provide  750 billion in stimulus   600 billion in QE 3 and  150 billion in  Operation Twist II   There are others that believe Operation Twist I will simply be extended into Operation Twist II  We stand with the latter  for there isn t ample evidence currently available for the Fed to become more aggressive as the current fire isn t that large  When the S P is roughly  6  off its highs  and when the 10 year note is at 1 59    those metrics don t  suggest a move by the Fed  Markets are working  and liquidity is ample  They will simply seek to move out on the duration curve by selling short term securities and buying long term securities with this being more of a technical move than a simulative move  That s our central banking call for today We are short the Russell 2000 Small Caps via TWM  and we see no reason to change our stance at this point  It is a starter position  and currently has a negative beta of  0 39  We expect to add another 10  to our position with the breakdown of certain hurdle rates such as the 1305 level in the S P 500  and then the 1265 level to add a final position  We don t want our beta to get any higher than   1 0 which would mean an aggressive short position equal to 100  of the Russell But having said this  we may soon choose to add a long precious metals or mining positions as the case may be  The miners are finally showing outperformance characteristics  but we are looking for gold to breakout above the  1662 level before doing so  And when we do get long these stocks   we ll stick with the more well known and high volume Barrick s  ABX  and Newmont Mining s  NEM  of the world  with perhaps a small ETF position in the junior gold miners  GDXJ  to add just a bit more alpha to the position  For now  we are content on the sidelines ,2012-06-19,Richard Rhodes,https://www.investing.com/analysis/markets-higher-as-greek-pro-austerity-groups-clinch-coalition-deal-127013,127013

189939,411455,NEM,Follow The Majors To Find Investment Prospects  Brent Cook Interview,opinion,Taking part in the Cambridge World Resource Investment Conference  geologist and minerals maven Brent Cook  who also serves as Exploration Insights president  CEO  publisher and author  said he found more investors there looking for reasons to sell than to buy  In this exclusive interview with The Gold Report  he suggests that those who postpone buying decisions for too long risk missing the boat on some real  gems   Finding gems in the garbage takes serious due diligence  he advises investors to evaluate potential juniors the same way the majors do when they re hunting for companies whose assets will help replenish their dwindling reserves    The Gold Report  The Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF  GDXJ  hit a low on May 16  and some pundits and speakers at the Cambridge World Resource Investment Conference earlier this month said they felt we d hit the bottom  You are dubious  though  In your June 10 Exploration Insights  you wrote    China continues to slow  Korea and Japan even more so  India looks to be hitting a wall  and Europe is in a slow motion disaster  The copper price is declining as are iron ore and base metals in the world that  overall  seems to be deleveraging  with consumption declining  More succinctly  as my Uncle Coyote puts it   They re all just swirling  round the drain   Would you share more about your general impressions of investing in mining stocks in this market    Brent Cook  I don t typically guess bottoms or play with technical charts  I just look at what I ve seen happen and make what is hopefully an educated guess as to what is coming  Over the past two years  in excess of  10 billion  B  has come into the junior resource sector via the Venture Exchange alone  During that time  we ve seen more than 300 new companies listed and probably 3 000 financings  Despite the mad rush of money into the sector  not much of it has actually produced returns as measured by the GDXJ  the junior miner index    So what I see happening here as part of the global deleveraging is the people who jumped into the junior miners without looking are now jumping out without looking  They jumped into companies that had resources without digging deep enough to see that they have other issues that complicate the value of those resources  In my opinion  they were willingly led astray by banking analysts touting questionable resource estimates and economic assessments  A lot of money has been lost in the process  and until that works its way out of the system  I think it gets uglier    TGR  Investors who have been burned are skittish about getting back into the fire  BC  Indeed  If I were told some company s 8 million ounces  Moz  was going to be worth several billion dollars and then the stock falls by 75  when a prefeasibility study comes out showing it ain t  I would have to conclude that I had no idea what this industry was about nor do I have any business ever investing again  That said  there are certainly a few experienced funds in the industry that are still interested in investing and probably relishing the current disaster  eRetail money  which doesn t tend to be very selective  has been hit pretty hard  too  over the past year and a half  So I don t see where the new speculative money comes from   In fact  I see a lot more money exiting than entering as the volatility and chaos being played out in the real world of investing drives people to stuff their remaining cash under the bed where it s safest  Over the rest of this year  I think we ll see a lot more junior companies go out of business  hibernating or financing at prices highly dilutive to current shareholders  Junior companies with average or below average projects and management are in trouble and  keep this in mind  most projects are below average despite claims to the contrary    TGR  In a lot of your presentations  you juxtapose the very dramatic visual of the Carlin Trend s enormous gold pits with the idea that we are mining the equivalent of the entire Carlin Trend s production to date every year  You do the same visual using the Bingham Canyon Mine s massive open pit for copper  Considering what you just said about investing sentiment on the one hand and the need to find more ounces and pounds to meet demand on the other hand  there must be opportunities for the astute investor    BC  That s exactly right  and that s the second part of my presentation  I lay out the bad news  that a large percentage of these companies will go out of business because they don t have a chance in hell of finding anything of value and they can t finance  On the flip side  major mining companies are producing 19 million tons year copper and 83 Moz year gold  In order for a mining company to stay in business  it obviously needs to replace what it mined with new reserves  Fortunately for us  it can t do this internally and will need to buy whoever finds the reserves it needs  It s very  very difficult for them to replace that much  and it s getting even more difficult for a lot of reasons I go into detail about in my letter  For that reason  legitimate profitable deposits are going to command a serious premium  and people who own stocks in those early stage exploration companies that pull it off will make a lot of money  But there s no room at all for error because as suggested earlier  the dumb money has all gone to money heaven and I think it unlikely anyone will bail out mistakes in judgment    TGR  So investors who want the cream of the crop in terms of mining assets need clarity as to what those assets are  You ve talked about having to replace the equivalent production of a Carlin Trend every year to satisfy demand for gold  That s a mind boggling amount for anyone who knows how big the Carlin Trend is  Where are some of the areas the seniors expect to find so much gold to replenish their reserves    BC  Their first choice is to find a deposit near where they have operations  be that in Nevada  Peru  Brazil somewhere they re comfortable  Quinton Hennigh  a geologist who works with me  went into a lot of detail on this in the June 10 Exploration Insights and again in an interview The Gold Report published June 18  Because he used to review potential acquisitions for Newmont Mining Corp   NEM NYSE   he knows the process  Number one  companies are obviously looking for deposits that are profitable  A major mining company that looks at a junior s project doesn t just use the third party resource estimates and preliminary economic assessments  PEAs   The majors do the detail work themselves  You d be surprised how much their evaluations of a property differ from a third party s prepared for the seller    TGR  Are you saying that most juniors  PEAs are useless to seniors that are seriously doing due diligence on a junior company    BC  No  certainly not most  but a lot are not to the level a mining company needs to make a major investment decision  I ve seen too many studies that didn t quite match reality in costs  and particularly in resource estimates  In my view  too much sloppy work has been going on in terms of resource estimates  We also typically lose a lot of ounces of gold and pounds of copper when converting a resource to an actual mineable reserve  My point is that majors do their own due diligence and their analyses often come up with far less of a resource and valuation than the PEA would suggest    Think about all the companies that have announced massive resources out there  and then think about the fact that we re hardly seeing any acquisitions  That tells us they re looking at a lot more detail than the junior companies do and coming away unconvinced  It s not that the seniors aren t hunting  As I say  they have to replace 83 Moz year of gold production  That s not an easy task at any gold price    TGR  Does the slow rate of mergers and acquisitions also indicate that the majors are nervous about deploying their cash  Or that they re just being more diligent    BC  I think the latter  They go through a lot of detail  They have to weigh in the risk as well  As I mentioned  they re looking for something close to where they re operating  in a stable environment  something that doesn t have a huge capital expenditure with a low margin that s one of the big issues right now  Then political jurisdiction  social issues and the increasing government take all enter into the decision    TGR  Quinton outlined that location  location  location very clearly in Exploration Insights  He also talked about metallurgy and the importance of having accurate testing and assessment of what projects really will produce  and whether there s potential for higher production as time goes by  In terms of minimizing risk  he pointed out  too  that majors look at the state of the junior s infrastructure  Has it put in roads and power lines  Has it developed relationships with the locals that are positive and encouraging    BC  They need people  too  There is a real shortage of qualified people in the mining industry  So when they look at a project or a company to acquire  they look to see if they can get some good people with it  A friend of mine running a midsized Australian gold company recently told me of losing six months of production when two key underground miners were poached to work at the iron ore mines  So people are a key consideration to mining companies these days    TGR  With that whole mix of criteria as a backdrop in choosing companies  could we talk a little bit about some specific names    BC  I just completed a field trip to Gold Standard Ventures Corp  s  GSV V  project on the south end of the Carlin Trend  Its recent drilling suggests that it may be on to a significant deposit  a new one  That s certainly worth keeping an eye on  and as we all know  the Carlin Trend is one of the world s richest gold belts    TGR  With a market cap of  200 million  Gold Standard just started trading on the New York Stock Exchange on June 12  Is this stock overvalued at this point based on drilling results and such    BC  It s way overvalued  This is pure speculation  but I ll tell you  we bought it in Exploration Insights when the first big drill hole was announced and I still own it and I m not selling it because the risk reward is massive  A major high grade discovery on the Carlin Trend could be worth billions of dollars  I think Fronteer Gold Inc   FRG TO   sold its Carlin style Long Canyon gold deposit to Newmont for  2 3B    TGR  And obviously  you don t feel Newmont overpaid for Long Canyon    BC  No  I don t think so  If Gold Standard can find a significant deposit on the Carlin Trend  it would be worth a lot  Bear in mind  Goldcorp Inc   GG NYSE   Barrick Gold Corp   ABX NYSE  and Newmont are all active in the district that s where the guts of Barrick s and Newmont s operations are  Their roasters and autoclaves scattered around the state are desperate for ore  so capital and infrastructure costs there are considerably less than if you found a similar Carlin style deposit in the middle of nowhere  Miners are right there  roads are there  it s maybe an hour s drive from gas stations  brothels and a cold beer  What more could you want in a gold discovery    TGR  What about other companies in Nevada    BC  Rye Patch Gold Corp   RPM V  is interesting  We own that one as well  and bought it as soon as I saw that it had staked claims over what used to be part of Coeur d Alene Mines Corp  s  CDE NYSE  Rochester silver deposit in Nevada  This is basically a play on Coeur having to buy its claims back  That comes down to the General Mining Act of 1872  If the law holds true  Rye Patch owns those claims and Coeur  to continue its mining operations into the future  needs those claims  So there s a deal there somewhere  and I think that deal is going to be struck at above the current share price    TGR  It will be interesting to see how that gets resolved  Any others you want to talk about    BC  In central Idaho s old Yellow Pine District  up in the mountains east of McCall  Midas Gold Corp   MAX TO  consolidated the district and has been very successful in proving up gold  silver and antimony resources  It has a resource in excess of 6 Moz in all categories in three main deposits  grading almost 2 grams ton  open pittable  The antimony and silver scattered through it provides an extra byproduct  Permitting is likely to be a long endeavor  but probably doable  because of this area s long history in large scale mining operations  Midas is doing some intelligent things  environmentally speaking    This area is in the headwaters of one of the forks in the Salmon River  Salmon spawn in the river below  but can no longer get up the river because the old pit stopped them  So Midas plans to reroute the river so the salmon can continue up above the mine  Also  because the metallurgy is more complex  Midas probably will produce concentrate and may truck it to the Snake River Plain for processing  As a result  no cyanide will be used onsite    TGR  Have you stomped around on this property yet    BC  Not since Midas came in  I looked at it probably about 10 years ago as a consultant and in fact in my teens I used to run around Yellow Pine fishing and causing trouble  Another positive is that Midas is now led by Stephen Quin  who s been very successful growing and selling companies in the past including Miramar Mining Corp   which was sold to Newmont  and Sherwood Copper Corp   which was combined with Capstone Mining    TGR  What s Midas  next big step    BC  It is currently drilling now and working on its prefeasibility study  That s probably the next big thing    TGR  Mexico is a fantastic mining address despite what some consider jurisdictional risk  But again  we re seeing more and more discoveries there  surprising some but probably not you    BC  Mexico is a fantastic place to explore  although it has become more dangerous  particularly in the Sierra Madre  But it s still a great place to look  and there are areas that I have no problem going to  Almaden Minerals Ltd   AAU NYSE  is on the top of my list in Mexico  I like big  big geothermal or hydrothermal systems because they produce big deposits and big companies like big deposits and pay big bucks for them  Almaden s Ixtaca property in Puebla is a very large system  So far  the company has defined one zone that s looking pretty good  Almaden hasn t produced a resource estimate  but it certainly has good grade and  more importantly to me  the property has the potential of producing a very large precious metal deposit    In my view  Ixtaca is just a piece of what eventually will be found there  It s complicated  It s covered  so you re drilling blind  but that s a really interesting system run by a competent group of people  And with  25M in the bank  Almaden isn t going to be diluting us right away    TGR  What about other companies in Mexico    BC  Riverside Resources Inc   RRI TO  has a number of joint ventures with different groups on projects scattered in reasonably safe areas throughout Mexico  Riverside is one of the prospect generators that turns up ideas and brings somebody else in to spend the high risk dollars  If you consider studies by various groups showing that maybe one out of a thousand prospects actually turns into an economic deposit of some sort  it makes good sense to generate targets and then vend out the high risk  high cost part to somebody else  That way  as shareholders we maintain our piece of the business as opposed to losing it when the project gets drilled and probably fails    TGR  Almaden is also among your project generators  and isn t MAG Silver Corp   MVG NYSE  like that in some ways    BC  MAG Silver is different  MAG is drilling in tandem with Fresnillo Plc  FRES L  on the Juanicipio project  and just put out a solid PEA on that  It is also drilling its Cinco de Mayo project and ventured into one other project that it has been drilling as well  So  no  MAG Silver spends its own money  It is also earning in on its deal with Canasil Resources Inc   CLZ V  and has put out some decent results  although I haven t watched it closely  To me  it s all about the Juanicipio silver deposit and how and who develops it    TGR  Let s get back to your prospect generators    BC  In addition to Riverside and Almaden  we have Lara Exploration Ltd   LRA V   Virginia Mines Inc   VGQ TO  and Altius Minerals Corp   ALS V   A few weeks back  I reviewed the whole portfolio  and among those five companies we re involved in 88 potential discoveries  88 projects being drilled and worked by somebody else  A free ride on 88 chances of a discovery at minimal financial risk to us that s pretty good odds    TGR  Especially when you think about the brain trust that s behind those companies    BC  That is an important aspect  for sure    TGR  What other companies should we talk about    BC  Lydian International Ltd   LYD TO  has an oxidized gold deposit in Armenia  We ve owned this one since I visited a few years ago  It is now in the final stages of putting out a feasibility study that I think will show it s worth quite a bit  Lydian has advantages in that the cost of recovering oxidized gold is fairly low and with the deposit on a hill  the cost of mining also is fairly low  This will be the type of low cost operation I think a midtier company would be interested in taking over    TGR  Is the Armenian government supportive and a good partner    BC  Yes  The government has been very  very supportive and keen to bring in foreign development leading to jobs and taxes  I ve been there  been through the country and met government officials  Armenia is a great country to explore in desperate for development that will bring in some tax revenue  The government has been as helpful as you can imagine in expediting all the permits Lydian has needed  In fact  its contract with the government requires Lydian to advance the project at a certain pace    TGR  Lydian apparently is doing a lot of things socially in the community  which seems quite unusual for a junior company    BC  Precisely  That s one of the points Quinton made as well  When a major looks at a junior  if the company has the groundwork in place  the environmental studies out of the way  the social issues settled and the people on board who build schools  put up hospitals  support soccer teams  those sorts of things if the dirty work  as Quinton calls it  has been taken care of ahead of time  it s much easier for a major to acquire that company    TGR  Let s talk a little about other countries you like  You ve been to Colombia many times  We saw a swelling in investor interest in Colombia in 2010 and 2011  but not much progress in juniors advancing their projects there this year  What s behind that slowdown    BC  Geologic reality rarely matches the hype  Colombia is a well endowed gold province  That s both good and bad  It s good in that there certainly are some major deposits  Ventana Gold Corp   VEN TO  was taken over  Continental Gold Ltd   CNL TO  has made a great discovery and AngloGold Ashanti Ltd   AU NYSE  has made a few  On the other hand  there s so much gold in Colombia that everybody and their dog rushed in  staked a claim with a gold vein on it and raised money  But 99  of those gold veins will amount to nothing of any significance  That s the reality  People went there  took some samples  had some good grades and promoted it as if it were the next Ventana  when in fact that s not the case  Most of what will be found down in Colombia will be small veins or low grade  small porphyries    TGR  And the garimpeiros are doing their best to drag out a few ounces from those small veins and porphyries  A lot of artisanal mining persists in Colombia    BC  Exactly  Not geologically but in terms of gold distribution  it s not that different from the Yukon  We saw the same thing in the Yukon  with 200 companies going there and staking claims  each with a soil anomaly and a vein of some sort on it  But concentrating that geologically into something that makes a lot of money is a very rare situation  So we re seeing the reality in both the Yukon and Colombia that most of the gold will be of no economic significance  Gold doesn t sell for about  1 600 an ounce because it s easy to find    That said  Continental Gold and AngloGold Ashanti are working there  and I m certainly keeping an eye on Miranda Gold Corp   MAD V   which follows the joint venture model  The president of Miranda  Ken Cunningham  has a project ventured out to Red Eagle Mining Corp   RD V   has staked quite a few claims and it is in discussion with other groups to come in and work its projects    Red Eagle also has a big drill program going on its own property in San Ram n  a potentially interesting project that I m also watching  It has just completed two drill holes into the San Ramon vein  They are encouraging  but it s drilling along the whole strike length  so until we see a long section that provides an idea of what continuity looks like  we ll just keep watching    TGR  Do you have any parting thoughts you d like to add about investing in the market now  beyond the obvious need to be very  very careful in choosing the companies we invest in    BC  I think we re approaching an excellent time to be investing in this sector  It s down  People hate it  But there are some real gems out there  By identifying those companies or projects that really offer the potential to turn into a major discovery  something that a mining company will want to buy and put into production  I think a lot of money will be made on investments people make over the next six months  But as I pointed out  you must be very selective because no one s left to bail you out and you have no room for error  Due diligence is key  Talk to the people  Read the reports  Get outside advice from someone who knows what they are talking about  It s really important  After all  it s your money  do everything you can to improve the odds of success    TGR  Thank you  Brent       a world renowned exploration analyst and geologist  is the author of

GBP 1025 70 per ounce Gold rose by  24 40 in New York yesterday and closed up 1 5  at  1 622 80 oz   Silver surged to as high as  28 45 and ended with a gain of nearly 3  Gold has traded erratically overnight and this morning in Europe but is slightly lower than yesterday s close in New York Further impetus to higher prices may come from the ECB who are expected to cut interest rates to a record low tomorrow   continuing ultra loose monetary policy which should further weaken the euro Negative interest rates continue to penalise pensioners and savers in European countries and this will lead to further diversification into gold Financial markets are already starting to wonder about the solidity of last week s summit measures to tackle the euro zone crisis and soon they may question whether even looser monetary policies will help prevent recessions and sovereign defaults With Independence Day today  Happy July 4th to all our American followers  clients and friends   the ECB decision tomorrow and NFP on Friday  trading should be quite today but as we know illiquid markets can lead to outsized market moves We tend to try and avoid predictions in GoldCore as the future is largely unknowable and there are so many variables that drive market action that it is nigh impossible to predict the future price of any asset class However  our opinion has long been that over the long term all fiat currencies will depreciate and devalue against the finite currency that is gold For this reason we have long held that gold would reach its inflation adjusted high of  2 400 oz and silver its inflation adjusted high at  140 oz and the equivalent in euros  pounds and other fiat currencies Gold at just over  1 600 oz today remains 33  below its record nominal high in 1980 Silver

189941,411457,NEM,How To Minimize Risk And Increase Returns On Juniors  Joe Mazumdar,opinion,Joe Mazumdar  senior mining analyst at Vancouver s Haywood Securities  adheres to certain fundamental metrics when reviewing the pedigree of a junior firm  In this exclusive interview with The Gold Report  Mazumdar explains why some juniors are positioned to do better than some majors in the current geopolitical climate and he counsels pragmatism  the key to unlocking golden opportunities is locating firms with experienced management and adequate cash flow that can qualify for mixed source financing in the international context of uneven gold prices  He shares a few picks in that space  The Gold Report  Let s cut to the chase  Joe  With the stock prices of gold mining companies in free fall during the past year  why should gold investors stay the course  Joe Mazumdar  One of the underlying fundamentals driving the gold equity market is what investors believe about the future supply and demand for gold  With respect to supply  global gold production has grown at a compound annual growth rate  CAGR  of 3  over the past four years despite a 15  17  CAGR increase in the gold price over the same period  We note the risk of constraints on future production  which include the paucity of large deposits for majors to replete their reserve base  operating and capital cost escalation  skill set shortage and increasing geopolitical risk  not to mention the current financing environment  We ve seen the gold price in various currencies go up 5 18  since 2011  In the Brazilian real and Indian rupee it s been up as high as 30   Gold price appreciation has been problematic in countries such as India that traditionally support gold via physical demand due to high local prices  Consequently  a higher proportion of the physical gold demand has migrated to China  where the gold price appreciation has been more modest due to the strength of the currency  Overall  with gold fluctuating around US 1 550 1 600 ounce  oz   we re seeing net speculative positions reduced to the point that if we do have positive news on the gold front  such as another round of quantitative easing  there is a lot of room for these positions to rise and provide a significant lift to the gold price  Currently  long term investment demand for gold is being supported by exchange traded funds  For diversification purposes  gold is being purchased by central banks  In many emerging markets  the proportion allocated by central banks to gold is rather low compared to the Western countries  Therefore  the potential exists for sovereign nations to further diversify their reserve base into gold  Volatilities are down off of the highs of Q3 11 and closer to long term levels  Lower volatility would increase gold s appeal as a safe haven asset  TGR  What strategy should gold investors employ in an uncertain market  JM  If you think gold prices will continue to move sideways  you should lean toward dividend paying gold stocks  seniors to intermediate firms with low cash costs and a diversified asset base  predominantly in a low geopolitical risk jurisdiction  that are currently producing gold  If you think gold is headed up  then we advocate for leveraged plays  which come with a higher risk profile and include gold explorers  developers and junior producers  Notably  juniors are trading at betas to the gold price of 1 5 1 7  on an annualized basis  over the last quarter  TGR  How do high interest rates affect the price of gold as compared to currencies  JM  Interest rates vary globally as the global economy over the past few years has been running at two speeds  Western countries  which are combating anemic growth  have experienced protracted periods of low real interest rates  emerging markets are still battling inflationary pressures that have led them to maintain higher interest rates  Currently  risk averse investors seeking shelter from the sovereign debt crisis in Europe have sought out U S  bonds  in particular  pushing yields down while driving the U S  dollar higher  The higher U S  dollar has driven commodity prices lower in U S  dollar terms  Investor interest in low yield  safe haven assets lies in protecting their investments rather than seeking higher yields in riskier jurisdictions  Gold s ability to compete for a slice of the demand pie for safe haven assets will  I believe  be important over the near to medium term  TGR  What are the key indicators of a gold mining company in trouble the signs of a management that may not be able to weather the downturn in stock prices and restricted access to development capital  JM  In a nutshell  developers and explorers that are not producing cash flow are in danger  Important indicators to look for include the company s current cash position  the catalysts coming up and whether or not the firm has the cash to deliver the catalysts  Then we ask  Will the catalysts impact the stock positively  Where is the project located and what is the permitting environment  Are there social license to operate issues  Is there a technically savvy management team  Can the team convince the debt market that it can deliver on its execution plan  Management is the key to success for developers in the junior market  Possessing an in situ resource alone in the current environment may not be attractive unless there is a competent management team that has the capacity to get the project permitted and is technically competent enough to execute the development and production plan  These management teams can provide access to alternative financing streams  If the skill set of the current management team seeking to progress a development project lacks development and or operations experience  the stock is not going to go very far right now  Although we believe it s a buyer s market for development assets  we are seeing more acquisitions of producing assets  Well priced producing assets present less risk of permitting or social license to operate issues and capital cost escalation than a development project  TGR  When is it generally prudent to sell holdings in a troubled company  JM  Many believe the market will turn  and we believe it will  but the time frame is uncertain and in the long run we re all dead  Currently  we have noted the longer term investors are willing to increase positions in equities within their current portfolio but less willing to take on new names  Short term investors continue to pursue opportunities to reduce their position and sell into liquidity events such as a resource update or drill results  TGR  How do you find companies to recommend  JM  We lean toward companies with assets primarily in low geopolitical risk jurisdictions with infrastructure  Infrastructure is critical as it impacts capital  roads  power lines  transportation  remote camp  for example  and operating expenditures  diesel versus grid power  for example   The grade of a deposit may look great  but if it doesn t have power from a reliable grid and requires diesel  for example  it may only deliver weak margins and require higher capital expenditures  capex   Processing one gram of ore only works with inexpensive and reliable power such as in areas of Ontario and Quebec  If  however  the company needs to build a 100 kilometer power line  the capex quickly becomes unreasonable and is at risk to escalation  Once we narrow the jurisdiction  we seek the higher grade deposits with a similar mining method  open pit versus underground bulk versus underground selective  within the area  which provides ample cushion for potential cost over runs  A metallurgically simple ore body that can deliver recoveries in the 90s is desirable  We either seek companies that can provide assets that can generate a good margin with a manageable capital expenditure requirement or one with an asset that would provide a merger and acquisition  M A  target for a major to intermediate producer seeking to replete its reserve base  TGR  Are there any junior companies that you specifically favor at this time  JM  As mentioned  currently we are focused on the low geopolitical risk end of the spectrum  For the last two years  we have liked Midway Gold Corp   MDW TSX V  MDW NYSE A   The company has a joint venture option on a potential large open pit heap leach deposit known as Spring Valley in Nevada with Barrick Gold Corp   ABX TSX  ABX NYSE   It provides the investor exposure to a series of heap leach projects in Nevada  which the management team is seeking to develop  The capital expenditure is financeable and manageable  Midway s CEO is an ex Newmont Mining Corp   NEM NYSE  executive who has permitted and built many projects in the mining friendly jurisdiction of Nevada  Midway s Nevada assets are low grade  open pit  heap leach with low capex requirements  Its Pan project  according to our estimates  has the potential to generate 70 000 oz per year  70 Koz  at cash costs of over  700 oz  In the current gold price environment  the project can generate decent margins with a quick return due to the low capex requirements  US 110 million  M   Haywood estimate   It recently completed a financing  so its cash position   US 16M  should enable it to deliver the next round of catalysts  Once it gets its first mine into production  more avenues for future financing are opened  The company has a few catalysts coming up and will be announcing a resource update on its next open pit heap leach project  Gold Rock  in Q3 12  Note the Spring Valley gold project is currently being funded by its joint venture partner  Barrick Gold  Another company that fits our risk profile is Atna Resources Ltd   ATN TSX   The company operates a steady state  40 Koz open pit  heap leach project in southern California at cash costs of US 930 oz  It is currently developing a high grade  11 5 gram ton gold  Haywood estimate  underground project known as Pinson  a former open pit  heap leach operation  in the Getchell Trend of Nevada  The company is only required to permit the underground mining operation as it has negotiated deals with third parties to process its oxide and sulphide ore  It s a leveraged play with high cash costs  US 970 oz   low permitting risk and a management team with abundant development and production experience  Financing risk is low because Atna doesn t need a lot of money to start the development at Pinson  We believe that the Pinson project will be capable of delivering an annual production profile of 60 Koz over a 14 year mine life beginning in 2013  Atna also has a near term open pit heap leach project  with the most significant permits in hand  known as Reward in southwestern Nevada  We estimate that the project can generate revenue from an annual production of about 30 Koz at cash costs of US 700 800 oz in Nevada  In summary  the company has a multiple asset portfolio  a good management team  financeable projects  minimum permitting risk and lots of infrastructure  that s what we want to find in a junior firm  TGR  What about potentials for mergers and acquisitions among the juniors  JM  From an M A perspective  we like Midas Gold Corp   MAX TSX  in Idaho  We believe that majors should be seeking a critical mass  depending on existing infrastructure and proximity to current operations  of over 5 million ounces  Moz  in a low geopolitical risk jurisdiction  depending  of course  on their current geopolitical risk profiles  Midas has effectively consolidated the fractionated gold mining district of Stibnite Yellow Pine in central Idaho  The Stibnite Yellow Pine area that includes Midas  Golden Meadows project was mined back in the late 1800s early 1900s and up to the mid 1980s mid 1990s as heap leach projects  It s not pristine forest  Midas  Golden Meadows project is sitting on a global resource of more than 7 Moz concentrated in three deposits within a significant land package  There is  however  a protracted permitting timeline  this asset may not enter production until 2019 2020  The management team is top notch and very capable of executing the development plan  It has a significant treasury enabling it to deliver its near  to medium term catalysts including a scoping study by Q3 12  TGR  Let s talk about geopolitical risk  Is it increasing worldwide  JM  I believe that major gold corporations should be concerned  if they are not already  with their geopolitical risk profiles with respect to current and future production  They need to diversify whether it s the South African companies that need more assets outside of South Africa or other companies that have a bit too much of their production profiles based in high geopolitical risk jurisdictions  With all of the news about creeping nationalism  higher tax revenues  royalties  ownership and overall increasing geopolitical risk  firms need to mitigate the risk by investing more in increasing current production and reserves in lower geopolitical risk environments  The amount of global gold production in low geopolitical risk jurisdictions such as the U S   Canada  Australia  Chile and some Scandinavian countries is just below 30   TGR  Prodigy Gold Inc   PDG TSX V   a firm that you have previously talked about to The Gold Report  has enjoyed relative strength in its stock price during the last two years  Why  JM  Prodigy presents a low geopolitical risk play in northern Ontario  The company s Magino project is currently an open pit  bulk tonnage target where we are modeling a mineable resource of 3 25 Moz  The project is located proximal to infrastructure that was created to some extent by a currently depressed logging industry that has left in its wake a lot of available labor  TGR  Back to the majors  what cost benefits do senior companies generally use to assess the merit of repleting gold reserves  JM  In the end the acquirer should be convinced that the project is accretive on either a near term cash flow  CFPS  or longer term net asset value  NAVPS  per share basis  The recent trend in M A has been for production over development projects as the latter carries the risk of capital escalation  execution and permitting risk  among others  Hence  what appears to be accretive on a NAVPS basis one day may not be the next day  Previously there was a lot of pressure from the investment community to show growth  The problem is when you re producing at levels of 4 8 Moz  it s difficult to show 3 5  annual growth rates  Currently  the investing community has shifted its collective focus and reverted to production at steady state levels with dividends over concerns of escalating capex and delays with project development either organically or via acquisitions  Nonetheless  for majors a lot of ounces must be repleted on an annual basis just to maintain production levels  let alone grow them  I don t believe that any company wants to show a declining production profile to the market  TGR  What is happening with Orvana Minerals Corp   ORV TSX  JM  Orvana Minerals is in production and needs to get its operations to steady state levels  The company needs a few quarters to hit its targets and increase cash flow  It had technical issues with the startup at both of its operations and was punished in a downward trending equity environment  Investors were concerned about its working capital position as Don Mario  its Bolivian operation  failed to generate meaningful positive cash flow due to a slow commissioning due to the processing plant  The problem at the Don Mario operation has been an issue of recovery rates from treating oxide and transitional ore with the leach precipitation flotation  LPF  circuit  Orvana has adjusted its process flowsheet to stabilize the recovery rates  so that Don Mario does not drain its cash reserves  Also  the company had grade issues at its flagship project in northwestern Spain  El Valle Boin s Carl s  EVBC   Orvana needs to get the EVBC head grade up  This is a function of getting more road headers  mining instruments  into the high grade zones  The throughput is increasing as Orvana slowly gets its shaft into place and de bottlenecks the underground operation  Once the shaft is in place  the throughput should improve markedly and provide steady state head grades  The plant has been running very well  TGR  Do you have a target price for Orvana  JM  Our target on Orvana right now is  2 share  and it s trading just above  0 80 share  TGR  Are there other firms that you are focused on  JM  For Minera IRL Ltd   IRL TSX  MIRL LSE  MIRL BVL   we re at a  1 90 share target  Minera is a greatly discounted company  It has a small  open pit  heap leach project in Peru called Corihuarmi that is at well over 5 000 meters  an inhospitable environment with no pre existing infrastructure  In Peru  it s not easy to permit a heap leach project proximal to standing water but the management team has managed it  Since its commissioning  the Corihuarmi operation has exceeded expectations  There are a lot of socio political conflicts holding up mining ventures in Peru  such as at Newmont s US 4 8 billion Minas Conga project  to name one  Minera s management team is located in Peru and its CEO has a long history with majors like Newmont and Newcrest Mining Ltd   NCM ASX   The president of the company  Diego Benavides  is a member of the Benavides family a very well established local family with a rich mining history  At the Ollachea project  Minera spent months negotiating with the local community and a group of miners with divergent opinions on the project s development  Minera negotiated a 5  free carry to the community  without the help of the government  TGR  Given the geopolitical situation in Latin America and Haywood s concentration on junior mining company fundamentals  such as cash flow and existing production  how does a company like Seafield Resources Ltd   SFF TSX V  stack up either on its own or as a potential takeover  Do you have a target price for Seafield  JM  We monitor Seafield Resources within our Exploration Quarterly with no formal coverage  The company has a significant land package within a highly prospective region  the Mid Cauca Belt  for gold rich copper porphyries in Colombia  Colombia is a Latin American nation that has managed to avoid some of the negative mining related press emanating from others such as Bolivia  Venezuela  Argentina and Peru   We consider gold rich copper porphyries to be a sought after deposit type by majors due to the opportunity for scalable   5 Moz  gold deposits with significant co product copper revenues  Due to their size  these deposits would also require large capex upfront that would limit the number of potential developers  TGR  Any final thoughts on the market situation  JM  In the near term  financing constraints will continue to be an issue effectively restricting the volume of news flow from many junior mining equity plays  We anticipate that many will reduce their burn rates and push their catalysts back while re benchmarking expectations  But I still see opportunities for companies with well managed assets in low geopolitical risk jurisdictions that can produce near term cash flow to be financed  We note the trend toward more debt financing and away from traditional equity financing  If the capex is manageable  say  in the  100 200M range  other alternatives to finance the project may be available such as vendor financings  selling of royalty  streaming off byproducts  doing some debt and a smaller proportion of equity  We acknowledge that a junior developer with a large capex requirement  over  500M  may be difficult to finance in the current environment  TGR  Thank you for your time  Joe  JM  You are welcome   is a senior mining analyst

189943,411459,NEM,Weighing the Evidence of Oil and Gold Stocks,opinion,The MSCI Emerging Markets and the S P 500 indices have increased double digits since the beginning of the year  Investors should be thrilled  but instead of cheers  the only sounds the markets are hearing are crickets  Many have been asking  where are the investors Since January 1  another  12 billion left U S  stock mutual funds while about  100 billion went into bond funds  This continues a mutual fund outflow trend that has been ongoing for several months now After leading markets since the rebound began in 2009  natural resources and gold took a break while severely punished stocks saw a big bounce in the first quarter of 2012  Taking a look at the returns below  the S P Global Natural Resources Index rose only 4 percent and the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index  GDM  lost 9 percent As investment managers  we continuously weigh the evidence  dissecting macro factors in the market and comparing historical data  We believe this is the best way to find the next opportunity for our shareholders  Using history as our guide  we compared the performance of oil and gold companies against the results of the underlying commodities over the past three years West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude oil has seen a tremendous rise over the past three years  In April 2009  the price of oil was  46 per barrel  today  it s  104  The SIG Oil Exploration   Productions Index closely followed the rise of Texas tea from April 2009 until August 2011  That s when the disparity between oil and oil stocks began to gradually increase Over the past three years  the price of oil and the index have had an average ratio of 0 21  Currently  it s 0 26  That may not seem like a big difference but today s ratio represents a three year high and is a 3 13 standard deviation event  This means the divergence between oil and oil stocks is in  extreme territory  and  under normal assumptions  there is a 99 percent probability that the gap will close  Either the price of oil should come down or oil stocks go up  or a combination of both Gold and gold stocks are also experiencing extraordinary circumstances As we mentioned last week    with the trend accelerating recently  Below  you can see that for most of the last three years  gold stocks have outperformed gold  Recently  though  bullion has surpassed gold stocks while gold companies have significantly declined The price of bullion and the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index  GDM  have had a three year average ratio of 0 94  Similar to oil and oil stocks  the ratio is now 1 28  a 3 06 standard deviation event CIBC commented earlier this week on the extreme disparity  saying the minor drop in bullion compared with the huge drop in gold stocks suggests that  a massive oversold position for the equities has occurred in the last month   This is an  unprecedented  period for gold stocks  says CIBC Case Study  Newmont vs  Treasuries  Many American investors already have a stake in one of the world s largest gold producers but they may not be aware of it  As a member of the S P 500  you ve probably acquired shares of Newmont Mining  NEM  through a fund that tracks the broad index as it is the only gold company included in the index The company also boasts the highest dividend yield in the industry with an annualized dividend yield of nearly 3 percent  This is at least a percent higher than the 5  and 10 year Treasuries Through dividends  gold companies including Newmont make a commitment to return capital to shareholders  While gold stocks remain at depressed levels  dividends are especially attractive  as investors get  paid to wait  for shares to appreciate  We believe in thinking contrarian and keeping a close eye on historical trends to discover inflection points  as stocks tend to eventually revert to their means  For example  in March 2009  we noted significant changes signaling the market had hit rock bottom  following that time through the end of the first quarter  the S P 500 Index rose more than 100 percent Today s extreme divergence in oil and gold stocks and their underlying commodities presents a rare

189944,411460,NEM,This Major Disconnect Could Mean Big Profits For Gold Investors,opinion,Let s waste no time  Take a look at this chart   The black line is the Market Vectors Gold Miners  NYSE  GDX   an exchange traded fund  ETF  that holds shares of major gold miners such as Barrick Gold  NYSE  ABX   Newmont Mining  NYSE  NEM  and Goldcorp  NYSE  GG   The red line is the SPDR Gold Trust ETF  NYSE  GLD   which holds physical gold bullion and is meant to track the price of gold   One year ago  GDX was much higher in price relative to its current value  while GLD was lower  In fact  GLD is modestly up  compared to a year ago  by about 6   GDX is down some 25  during the same time period What are we to infer from this data  Well  it s one of two things  either GLD  meaning gold  is overvalued  or the miners  GDX  are lagging the price of bullion and are destined to return to some form of parity with the metal of all metals Before I pontificate further  let s look at another chart   This is a far more striking visual  Here we again have GLD s performance during the past year  but this time compared with the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF  NYSE  GDXJ   which holds shares of smaller gold miners  While GLD is up 6  during the past year  the juniors  GDXJ  are down a whopping 40   If you have traded these securities during the past few years  then you have to be impressed  But as much as some may want to quibble with my opinion  I do not think the story has changed much for gold  That s why I think GDX and GDXJ are undervalued    and likely to catch back up to gold quite soon    Gold prices will not go back to  250 per ounce  I don t think they will fall back to  1 000 per ounce again  either  I will be amazed if gold even manages to drift below  1500 00 per ounce    Why  you might ask    I call this my theory of finite wealth    If you ve ever read about the theory of finite energy  then you know the idea is that there is only so much energy to go around  The idea is that if a whole bunch of energy is expended in the summer  let s say during hurricane season  for example  then there will be less energy available in the winter  and moisture  to produce snow    With paper money  that fictional entry in the U S A  s massive computer system  there is the same effect  You can t create wealth  you can only create currency  The more you create  the less it is worth  The value of the money will  in terms of buying power  continue to decline  Real wealth cannot be created that way  The beneficiary of such money manufacturing is real assets  And despite what the naysayers believe  gold is the perfect arbiter of value    Many have claimed that gold is a relic because it has no use other than as money  Exactly    if it had any other use  then it would not be useful as money  Look at silver  It has industrial uses  It is not  just  a precious metal  As such  its price will fluctuate for many reasons other than monetary influences  It cannot be used exclusively as money  Gold can and will continue to be used for that very purpose    As such  it is not likely to lose much of its current value  On the contrary  it is more likely to resume its ascension to much higher valuations  Why again    Do you really think the European crisis is resolved  Wasn t it just announced that the United Kingdom entered into a double dip recession  Are we really certain that the U S  economy has turned the corner    Sure  Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke just raised its estimate for gross domestic product growth in the United States  but didn t they also say that they stand ready to  do whatever it takes  to ensure that this  recovery  continues  If the economy was really in recovery  would it really need the Fed to stand ready to artificially inflate it a little more    There are big changes heading our way  And the greatest fear is that no one knows what will truly be the end result  China and the other emerging markets are expected to not only continue to provide the best growth opportunities for investors  but to also continue to grow in prominence and influence on the world stage    The Currency Wars are here  And gold will be the beneficiary    Risk to Consider  Gold could decline  and mining stocks could fall further  The basis for this trade is the belief that gold has probably found a new support level  one to which the miners will adjust  If that support level proves to be lower than where it is  then mining stocks could also find lower levels  Buy GDX and GDXJ  Gold isn t going away  and the miners will likely eventually change course and catch up with bullion  Gold is here to stay  and if you want to be positioned properly for an uncertain future for the U S  Dollar and the other major currencies  then you should own the miners in addition to bullion by Steven P  Orlowski,2012-05-02,StreetAuthority,https://www.investing.com/analysis/this-major-disconnect-could-mean-big-profits-for-gold-investors-121862,121862
189945,411461,NEM,Get A Better Price On These Stocks Than the Pros ,opinion,These are heady times for the nation s top hedge fund managers  I ve conducted a deep review of the top 20 holdings of the nation s most famous fund managers  and the relative gains or losses since those holdings were acquired  The recent performance has been remarkable  More than 85  of their recent trades  according to recent 13 F filings  are currently profitable    Their stock picking prowess is surely in evidence  though it doesn t hurt that the Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJIA  has risen for seven straight months  Yet even these top managers make mistakes  Almost every one of them is holding a dud in their portfolio  The holding has slumped in value since they bought in  implying they were either flat wrong  or just premature  These managers are expected to update their holdings with fresh 13 F filings in the next two weeks  so it will be interesting to see whether they ve doubled down on these laggards  or are cutting their losses    For the rest of us  these laggards may point the way to value  Having the chance to buy stocks that are now quite cheaper could be a way to piggyback on these pros without overpaying  Here s a short list of losing picks among top fund managers    Running through this list  a clear theme emerges  Investments in natural resource stocks have proven ill timed  Newmont Mining  NYSE  NEM  and NovaGold Resources  NYSE  NR   for example  have been slumping along with other gold miners  though as my colleague Steve Orlowski recently noted those fund managers would be unwise to bail on them now    In a similar vein  Bridgewater Associates  Ray Dalio  arguably the hottest fund manager on the planet right now  has made a rare misstep with Peabody Energy  NYSE  BTU   He failed to foresee the slump in demand for coal  But at least for this coal miner  as I recently wrote  better days may lie ahead    For this bank  timing is everything  Roughly 15 months ago  the U S  economy appeared to be turning a corner Few suspected the European financial problems would evolve into a full blown crisis  With the clouds parting  Fairholme Capital s Bruce Berkowitz and Pershing Square s Bill Ackman loaded up on shares of Citigroup  NYSE  C  while it traded in the low to upper  40s  But a few months later  the economic skies grew cloudy again and this bank stock got absolutely crushed  briefly falling below  25    Shares have retraced about half of that loss  and at this point it looks like a solid value play  trading well below tangible book value  If Ackman and Berkowitz can hang on  then they may still see their investments move back up above the prices they paid  By my math  Citigroup could hit  50 or even  60 within a few years   That s why I hold it in my  100 000 Real Money Portfolio    Go with the best  If you like to follow the moves of leading hedge fund managers  then you should always keep an eye on the Baupost Group s Seth Klarman  I noted his impressive long term track record in this article    and more recently  my colleague Andy Obermuller took a fresh look at his most recent holdings    Tracking Klarman s moves can be especially profitable  as he tends to focus on off the radar stocks that often slump even further before finally gaining traction  And it s happening again  Right now  several of his picks are underwater  But if history is any guide  Klarman is not mistaken with these picks  just premature    Klarman is currently carrying a 15  to 20  loss in Novagold Resources  Allied Nevada Gold  NYSE  ANV  and Hewlett Packard  NYSE  HPQ   Watch out for his next moves in these holdings as the next round of 13 F filings are submitted in a few weeks    Risks to Consider  These pros may have decided to reduce or eliminate their exposure to these lagging picks in the first quarter  so keep an eye out for the 13 F filings before buying   Investors often tend to load up on stocks that the pros are buying  often paying more for shares than the investment gurus did  It s wise to track their moves  but even wiser to buy stocks for a price lower than what they paid  Any of the stocks I mention above are good starting points for further research  by David Sterman,2012-05-03,StreetAuthority,https://www.investing.com/analysis/get-a-better-price-on-these-stocks-than-the-pros-122076,122076

 EUR 1 264 79  and GBP 1 023 45 per ounce  Gold climbed  5 60 or 0 35  yesterday in New York and closed at  1 600 20 oz despite stock markets giving up early gains on misguided optimism regarding the Spanish  bailout     Gold fell initially in Asia before trading sideways and this range trading has continued in European trading     Gold edged higher Tuesday after hopes were dashed that Spain s bank bailout would be the panacea that would lead to alleviating the eurozone debt crisis  Gold is consolidating near  1 600 oz as investors are concerned that the sovereign debt of Spain will still be stretched to the breaking point and Greece s possible departure from the euro will unleash more instability in the region   The risk of contagion remains real and European finance officials have discussed limiting the size of withdrawals from ATM machines  imposing border checks and introducing eurozone capital controls as a worst case scenario should Athens decide to leave the euro   While the technicals are poor  the fundamentals remain sound with the eurozone debt crisis far from resolved  Indeed  the eurozone debt crisis will likely morph into the global debt crisis in the coming months when markets turn their attention to the Chinese property bubble and the poor fiscal position of Japan  the UK and the US   Market watchers are waiting for the Greek elections on June 17  and also the Group of 20 financial summit plus the US Fed s policy meeting next week   Turkiye Is Bankas  AS  Turkey s biggest bank by assets  plans to collect  1 billion of gold in its deposit accounts by the end of the year  citing deputy chief executive officer Erdal Aral As much as 5 000 metric tons of gold is stored  under the mattress  in Turkey  Aral said  according to the Istanbul based newspaper  Gold deposit accounts have surged to 13 6 billion liras   7 4 billion  from 3 1 billion liras within the past year  according to data released by the banking regulator  Aral was quoted as saying   Gold has always been seen as money and as a store of wealth in Turkey and now the country is leading the way with regards to the remonetisation of gold in the 21st Century  Turkey remained the world s number one minter of gold coins in 2011  There is an increasing tendency for gold bars to be retail investors  vehicle of choice   although gold coins still retain a majority market share   Turkish people can pay in gold in certain foreign exchange houses and most jewellers will accept gold as payment  Turkish banks are is now offering digital gold saving accounts   Turkey expanded its gold reserves by 29 7 metric tons in April  Turkey s bullion reserves climbed to 239 3 tons last month meaning that Turkey increased their gold reserves by 14  in April   The central bank on March 27 doubled the share of lira reserves banks can hold in gold to 20   saying it would provide 6 1 billion liras   3 3 billion  of extra liquidity   This addition   the WGC says   was the result of a policy change under which the central bank will now accept gold in reserve requirements from commercial banks to help the banks utilize their gold in managing their liquidity    Some analysts have suggested that the increase in Turkish gold reserves  as reported by the IMF  may actually be a form of  double accounting   Whereby the gold held in Turkish banks  clients  gold account is transferred from the local bank as a reserve to the central bank  from where it then figures as gold reserves   Besides massive domestic holdings and robust demand in Turkey  the country is also importing and then exporting huge quantities of gold into Iran and  Arab Spring  countries with some  1 2 billion of precious metals exported into Iran in April alone   Other News  Bloomberg     Gold Hinges on Emerging Markets  Not Inflation  Chart of the Day  Gold s prospects are less dependent on inflation than on demand from emerging markets  according to a study released last week    The chart of the day shows the relationship between gold and the U S  consumer price index since 1975  when futures on the metal began trading  The inflation gauge was set equal to the gold price as the period began    Assuming that gold moved in lockstep with the CPI  the implied price would be about  780 an ounce  according to Duke University Professor Campbell R  Harvey and his collaborator  Claude B  Erb  Yesterday s price on the Comex in New York   1 596 80 an ounce  was more than twice that number     If gold is an inflation hedge  then on average its real return should be zero   Erb and Harvey wrote  Instead  returns from 2000 through March of this year averaged 13 percent a year on an inflation adjusted basis   Emerging markets are in a position to sustain the surge  they wrote  because gold accounts for a smaller portion of central bank reserves in those nations than it does in the U S  and other developed countries    Brazil  Russia  India and China would have to increase their total holdings of the metal by 153 percent to match the Federal Reserve s investment as a percentage of gross domestic product  the report said    Erb is based in Los Angeles  and Harvey is based in

189953,411469,NEM,Australian Gold Production Drops in 2011,opinion,Recent data from the consulting firm Surbiton Associates in regard to Australian gold production for the year 2011 have failed to meet market expectations for average production  Last year Australia defended its position as second largest gold producing country after China  but in comparison with 2010 Australian gold production dropped by two tonnes  In 2011 Australian mining companies produced a total of 264 tonnes  8 5 million troy ounces  of gold  But commodity markets were expecting data to show an increase in gold production  Nevertheless  with rising gold prices at the global markets  despite this production decline most Australian mining companies have increased their profits   Production declined by 6  year on year in Q4  though in comparison with Q3  gold production dropped by just 1   Nevertheless  Australian mining companies have continued to make great profits with gains in the gold price  At a current gold price of  1 710 per troy ounce last year s total production of 264 tonnes amounts to US 13 5 billion  Last year China produced a total of 300 tonnes  America is the third largest producer Last year major mining companies announced that they would concentrate on extracting gold at greater depths  This might be one of the possible factors affecting Australian production data  Gains in the gold price relative to input costs have meant that extracting gold at greater depths has become more lucrative  In 2011 the Super Pit mine  operated by Barrick Gold and Newmont Mining  produced approximately 796 000 troy ounces of gold  while Newmont s Boddington mine produced a total of 742 000 troy ounces of gold  The Telfer mine  operated by Newcrest Mining  followed third with 554 779 troy ounces  Today Australia s ASX 200 fell by 0 24   with losses in energy and mining stocks  The liquidity flood triggered by central banks should continue having a positive effect on gold prices  This week international financial markets will once again focus their attention on Greece  Private lenders to Greece  which is on the verge of bankruptcy  are being requested to agree to the bond swap offered by the Greek government before March 12  According to the rules laid out in the latest bailout that was agreed last month  95  of bond holders are required to agree  Should this not be the case  Greece will not receive its second bailout package from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund  The Greek government warned its private bond investors that  if needed  it would force them to accept the bond swap  Major rating agencies such as   This could trigger a disorderly default and new turbulences at the capital markets  How the gold price would react to such developments remains to be seen  Some analysts predict that in the case of a Greek default many will look to gold as a safe haven  while the other half expects gold prices to fall as traders sell assets in order to raise cash ,2012-03-06,GoldMoney News Desk,https://www.investing.com/analysis/australian-gold-production-drops-in-2011-116099,116099
189954,411470,NEM,Gold or Dividends   Now You Can Have Both,opinion,There is a famous pending dispute between the dividend seekers and the gold bugs as to where riches lay  whether in companies with a proven long track record of distributing dividends back to their shareholders  or perhaps in the golden metal and its various mining companies The former group of fans claims that gold is not a productive asset  One ounce of gold will remain only one ounce of gold 5 or 10 years from now  whereas dividend paying companies will return all of your investment back to you  in the form of dividends  in the long haul The later group states that gold is the best hedge against the upcoming inflation and that the current price of gold is still way undervalued against all paper currencies What a decade for goldNow you no longer have to decide  You can choose both  because gold companies have joined the dividend paying sector You see  gold has witnessed a terrific bull market decade  And gold mining and exploration companies are currently recording exceptional profits  The following chart shows you the performance of gold over the past decade  And when profits surge  dividends usually follow  Various companies have either initiated a dividend distribution policy or simply increased their dividend payouts  Here are a few examples    Royal Gold  RGLD  manages and owns royalties and other related interests primarily on precious metals mines  with a specific focus on gold  The company has raised its dividends consistently over this past decade and has nearly doubled its dividend payout from  0 08 in 2009 to  0 15 as of early 2012    Yamana Gold  AUY   the Canadian based gold producer  has exploration properties in both South America and Mexico  The company s annualized dividend of   20 provides investors with a yield of 1 17       Newmont Mining Corp   NEM  is primarily engaged in the exploration and production of both gold and copper  At current prices  the stock is yielding 1 8  to its investors  One very interesting factor with Newmont is that its dividend is linked to the price of gold  I suspect that other companies will follow in the footsteps of Newmont because this specific link allows investors to benefit precisely in times of record profits for the company    But those companies are not the only ones  Take a look at the graph below to see how the dividend rate of increase for other companies from the gold sector which greatly benefited from the surge in the price of gold  Downside riskThe main risk associated with purchasing shares of gold companies is that the dividend does not properly compensate for the risk  First  the price of gold is an unknown parameter that can greatly affect the future divided and even eliminate it totally  Second  the current yield is just too low to provide any type of proper hedge against depreciation risk  So what s an investor to do Although various gold companies have become more attractive because of their dividends  I do not recommend purchasing their shares  at current yields and prices  The yields are simply not satisfactory enough In contrast to conventional long term investing  trading their shares is a highly profitable pursuit  In my next few articles  I will publish a series of lessons how to profitably trade equities  and gold stocks in particular  and make approximately 4  a week ,2012-03-13,Shmulik Karpf,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold-or-dividends...now-you-can-have-both-116729,116729
189955,411471,NEM,A Need for Updated Gold Stock Indices,opinion,The underperformance of gold stocks was a hot topic at PDAC and continues to dominate discussion in industry circles  As to why the sector is underperforming  we hear numerous reasons  The conspiracy crowd will claim manipulation or hedge fund shorting  More well reasoned thoughts include the struggle of large miners to adequately replace reserves and grow production and the continued issuance of shares  We believe one key reason is that the bull market is in the wall of worry phase and in this phase valuations compress as investors are nervous of among other things  another major correction  The HUI is trading at 15x trailing earnings and only 13x 2012 earnings  If the market returned to the historical average valuation of 28x earnings  then share prices would double  and that assumes present earnings   Yet  does the HUI or XAU even adequately represent the mining stock universe anymore   The HUI is the go to index for the sector but it is failing to represent precious metals equities as a whole  The HUI is currently trading at the same level as in November 2009  That means it has made no net progress in 27 months  In the same time period  Gold is up 42   GDXJ  the junior ETF is up only marginally  The CDNX is up only 15   I don t know about you but I can think of numerous companies that have performed fantastically in the same period  One problem is that these indices are being polluted by dramatic underperformance by certain companies which is not a reflection of gold stock fundamentals  Newmont Mining  which is a percentage of numerous indices  is at the same price as it was in 1996  Kinross Gold  Agnico Eagle and IAM Gold have fallen 40  or more in just the past six months  This performance has little to due with negative sector fundamentals  yet it has a negative effect on the index and can greatly distort a correct analysis of the gold stocks Being sick and tired of the HUI  XAU  GDX  and basically any of these indices  we decided to create our own  This equal weighted index includes 10 of the largest  best performing gold companies  It is up about 40  in that 27 month period  The index closed Friday at 80 and we see a confluence of support at 68  which is also the 38  retracement from the 2008 low to 2011 high  We ve relied on our own proprietary silver stock index for a while  SIL  the silver stock ETF  is not too bad but it is exposed to Hecla  HL   Pan American  PAAS   Silver Standard  SSRI  and Couer D Alene  These are four companies which have dramatically underperformed Silver in the past four years  Our index  shown below  contains 10 silver producers which are focused on growth  The underperformance of the mining stocks occurred in the 1970s and is occurring again  As we ve argued countless times  there is no historical record of the large mining stocks outperforming  Mining is an extremely difficult business and even more so the larger the firm  It is the law of numbers  It is difficult to grow from a large starting point  Smartly  large gold miners are starting to increase dividends  They aren t attracting growth investors so they decided to seek out value investors  This is a smart move  Nevertheless  as you can see from our indices  there are many companies that are actually outperforming  The market of precious metals equities is not limited to the HUI or XAU  There are hundreds and hundreds of other companies out there  Moreover  it is very important to note that the large miners did not go parabolic in the late 1970s  The Barron s Gold Mining Index performed well but actually performed better in the 1960s  The reason is because the last third of a bull market sees increasing speculation  It was the juniors and small cap miners which received the speculative interest  At some point the market will diverge and the smaller miners will outperform the large caps  This is why we are focused on the smaller companies which show value and excellent growth potential ,2012-03-13,"Jordan Roy-Byrne, CMT",https://www.investing.com/analysis/a-need-for-updated-gold-stock-indices-116844,116844

189958,411474,NEM,The Market Just Handed Investors 4 Major Bargain Opportunities   ,opinion,When it comes to money management styles  there is no consensus  Some investment pros look for stocks showing  relative strength   meaning they ve been trading very well in recent sessions  Yet some money managers shun that approach  preferring out of favor stocks  These pros often turn to the list of stocks making new 52 week lows as a source of ideas It s been slim pickings for these investors  but this week s sharp selloff brings a silver lining  The number of stocks hitting new 52 week lows is now rising quickly  In fact  new lows outnumbered new highs for this first time all year on April 4  Among the stocks that are plumbing the depths are some intriguing names  Here s a small sample of rebound candidates  all of which hit a fresh 52 week low at some point this past week 1  Titanium Metals  NYSE    This company provides raw and processed titanium to airplane makers  sporting goods firms and others that need the metal s high strength and low weight  Shares have been slumping on concerns of a global economic slowdown  which would crimp demand  Right now  analysts expect sales to rise 13  in 2012 to  1 18 billion and another 20  to  1 45 billion in 2013  Then again  management doesn t hold conference calls  so analysts are just making their best guess  Perhaps the weak stock chart tells you that near term estimates are too high   But this stock has one huge backer  Chairman Harold Simmons  He s been buying shares for more than a year    at prices above current levels  Along with other insiders  he controls more than 50  of the stock  Even as the stock has been falling  rumors have swirled that Simmons s heavy insider buying is a prelude to a takeover  His  9 billion net worth gives him ample firepower to take the company private  2  Deckers Outdoor  Nasdaq    This footwear and accessories vendor was a scorching hot growth stock in recent years  thanks to insatiable demand for its UGG boots  Shares rose from  12 in early 2009 to above  110 this past fall  but have since fallen by nearly half   The selloff is due to three factors  The warm winter dampened sales of UGG boots  and also likely led the company to carry abnormally high inventory levels in the first quarter   a 40  spike in the cost of sheep skin    a key raw material for the UGG boots  and higher than expected spending to expand the company s international sales infrastructure    Yet all of these negatives should reverse themselves in the coming year  according to analysts at Auriga Securities  Though they concede that near term results will likely be lackluster  they spot a big earnings rebound coming later in 2012 and into 2013  at which time earnings per share  EPS  should hit a record  6 a share  That s why they see shares rebounding from a recent  65 to  100 over the next 12 months    good for a 35  gain  The recent stock price slump has been beneficial in one respect  Deckers is in the midst of a  100 million stock buyback  and can buy more shares when the stock price falls    3  Pain In The Gold Patch A whole raft of gold producers have seen their stocks hit 52 week lows this week  including Barrick Gold  NYSE     Newmont Mining  NYSE     Goldcorp  NYSE     Kinross Gold  NYSE     Goldfields  NYSE    and Harmony Gold  NYSE       The selloff comes at a time when gold itself has moved a bit higher thus far in 2012  Yet this is part of a larger trend  In 2011  gold rose 9  in value  while a market weighted basket of gold mining stocks fell 12     Why the disconnect  It s because a number of gold miners are dealing with rising development costs  which is eating into profits  And some miners  such as Kinross  have had to take big write downs as well  as key mines will not be as productive as initially hoped    Still  with the underlying commodity holding firm  many of these stocks now look like bargains in terms of Net Asset Value  NAV   Many of those NAVs are calculated on initial costs and don t fully reflect the value of each ounce of gold that is yet to be tapped  Merrill Lynch uses Barrick Gold as an example  The NAV of the mines is around  32 per share  but Merrill thinks shares should trade for two times NAV  or  64 a share  That s more than 50  higher than the current stock price    Merrill s analysts recently attended a meeting held by Goldcorp  and after running through the numbers  figure shares are worth  67  which is also more than 50  above current levels    Rather than focus on one stock  investors can also bottom fish with the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF  NYSE     which holds a basket of gold mining stocks and is also trading near a 52 week low    4  Coal Is Not King Lastly  sentiment around coal producing stocks continues to plunge as low natural gas prices lead to falling demand for coal in power plants  Alpha Natural Resources  NYSE     Arch Coal  NYSE     Patriot Coal  NYSE    and James River Coal  Nasdaq    all hit multi year lows this week  The selloff now appears overdone  as these stocks trade for just two to four times cash flow    even when applying the most bearish forward assumptions for demand in 2012  This is surely a group that is so out of favor that it is now worthy of further research  And like the gold miners above  you may decide that a basket approach is your best bet  in which case the Market Vectors Coal ETF  NYSE    would be the way to go    Risks to Consider  Even as these stocks scrape fresh lows  they may not rebound imminently  as near term woes need to be worked through   Action to Take     The real charm of unloved stocks is that they ve already taken a beating  and though they could fall further  they don t carry the risk of a major selloff that better loved stocks do if investors  moods sour  Aside from Titanium Metals and Deckers Outdoor  which merit further research on their own  I like the idea of taking a basket approach to gold miners and coal  By David Sterman,2012-04-11,StreetAuthority,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-market-just-handed-investors-4-major-bargain-opportunities...-119710,119710
189959,411475,NEM,Gold 2000 by Years End,opinion, All men see these tactics whereby I conquer  but what none Can see is the strategy out of which victory is evolved    Sun  Tzu The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 208 points Thursday after Greece scrapped a referendum on unpopular budget cuts and the European Central Bank unexpectedly cut interest rates  It was the second straight day of big gains in the stock market The European Central Bank surprised markets by cutting its benchmark interest rate a quarter of a percentage point  to 1 25 percent  The bank had increased its key rate twice this year  but that was before Mario Draghi took over as head of the bank this week  The announcement sent stocks higher as investors hoped that lowering borrowing costs would help prevent a recession in Europe  Buying intensified in the early afternoon after Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou abandoned his effort to put package of austerity measures to a public vote  A  no  vote could have caused chaos in the European and global financial system by leading to a messy default on Greece s debt Investors and other European nations were shocked by Papandreou s announcement Monday that he would call a referendum on a financial rescue package worked out just last week after months of negotiations between Greece and its international lenders The Dow lost 573 points the first two days of this week as investors feared that Europe s plan to preserve its currency union was in jeopardy  Markets in the U S  and Europe have been highly sensitive to headlines out of Europe as leaders there try to avoid a financial calamity  Investors have become fatigued as various efforts to resolve the situation seem to continually run into trouble Today it looks like a deal in Europe is more likely and that s making the market positive  but who knows what people will think tomorrow                                                                            Before I begin my essay on gold I must add that if Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou had put his package of austerity measures to a public vote  a  no  vote could have caused chaos in the European and global financial system and gold would have gone parabolic  By abandoning his effort to put package of austerity measures to a public vote and making it seem like it was the will of the government gold will simply continue to rise  Gold is again being seen in Greece as an essential store of wealth  hedge against inflation and safe haven asset  This is not surprising given the political game of chicken that has been played for the last several weeks The fact that gold cannot default or go bankrupt unlike every single corporation  bank and government in the world is making it the safe haven of choice again  There is also the important fact that unlike currencies and bonds  gold cannot be debased by bankers and central bankers Gold has marked a key Fibonacci pivot point and may now begin a new wave higher  potentially reaching  1900 before year end while on track to surpass the  2000 level in 2012  It s been several weeks since I ve written about gold and we have had a wild ride since the  1910  1920 highs in August   At the time  I wrote a major correction was imminent and we witnessed a  208 drop that took place over just a few days  We covered our short at  1725 and then gold immediately rallied back to a double top at  1920  It then corrected back as scripted to 1531  That pullback to  1531 qualifies as a Fibonacci retracement of the 34 month rally from  681 to  1920 and would also qualify for a price low for a fourth major wave correction My initial targets for the gold pullback were  1480  1520 if the  1650 area was violated  Most recently  we have seen gold run up to  1681  another Fibonacci resistance zone  a few times and then back off to the low  1600 s With the recent push over  1681  we can now confirm the fourth wave is over at the  1531 lows and the fifth wave is likely in the very early stages  but beginning to build steam I will say that we want to make sure the  1650  1680 areas are defended by gold on any pullbacks in order for this forecast to remain valid  During this fifth wave up  eventually we should see the  2380 range in gold  but it will not take place overnight  In the next few months  I am looking for gold to attack the  1900 range  possibly even by year end  and then attack the  2000 plus range in 2012 As written above  with all of the macro events in Europe changing on an almost daily basis  the whipsaws in both the precious metals and equities markets are difficult to forecast and trade for most investors  However  gold has been moving in defined Fibonacci and wave patterns for ten years now and if I m right  has about three years left in a 13 year bull cycle Attached is the updated weekly chart for gold  You can see prior lows as they related to oversold indicators  and where we just came off the  1531 lows and its Fibonacci pivot along with the oversold indicators below Look for gold to attack  1775 first  then  1800   1840  and  1900 in the coming six to ten weeks or so  The sharp recent correction in gold does not erase the long term fundamental drivers that are still in place and likely to push the metal higher So that begs the question how does the retail investor get into the gold trade now Well a lot of this comes at a time frame when many people and much the public was underexposed to the gold move  from the move up from  1200   1300  all the way to  1925  The sense is that gold will move too far too fast  and as a result  people didn t want to chase the move  Well  the issues that helped gold rise are still very much in play There is still a lot of question and concern about debasement of currencies around the world  Overall  in terms of what various central banks are doing  that s still very much in play  and overall  peripheral and sovereign debt concerns have not been solved either So we look at a way to have a real currency  a solid currency  gold still meets all those needs despite a short term technical correction In conclusion  I think that every retail investor needs to have 20  of his portfolio in gold and silver  What they need is exposure to precious metals  The biggest threat to anyone in retirement is inflation  Especially with the debasement of the US dollar  this is still very big story  I suggest that every retail investor buy something like the SPDR Gold Trust  GLD   buy the iShares Gold Trust ETF  IAU   buy the iShares Silver Trust  SLV   Buy Newmont Mining   NEM   Goldcorp  GG  because besides owning the underlying commodity  you want to own the companies that mine and produce that commodity as well That gives you somewhat of a diversified exposure  but buy owning the  Market Vectors Gold Miners Trust  GDX   which is the gold miners ETF that consists of the top 30 gold mining stocks out there  you get all of the diversification you will

189960,411476,NEM,Profit From The Coming Transfer Of Wealth By Understanding Wealth Cycles,opinion,Different asset classes have proved to be more or less favorable during different time periods  History has shown that the bigger returns have been made from being in the right market at the right time  The fluctuations among different assets are called wealth cycles Simply put  a wealth cycle is a way for an observant investor to forecast market direction and move money from an overvalued asset in a bubble to an undervalued asset class  Then ride the new asset up until it becomes overvalued  sell  and repeat the process with a different asset But you must pay close attention to the market and know when to get out  It is also important to watch what s happening in other sectors and look for the next big opportunity Wealth cycles are not new  they have been around since ancient Greece and Rome and they still reoccur regularly in today s modern world  In fact  recognition of cycles is a way humans recognize patterns and plan for the future Wealth cycles and economic cycles are actually quite simple  they start off with economic expansion  often led by an increase in credit  which then leads to a crisis  followed by a recession  and finally preceded by a recovery  which leadsyet again to an expansion  By watching these patterns and keeping tap on the pulse of the economy these cycles can actually be predicted by with some regularity  You can see these cycles play out in different asset classes such as stocks  real estate  precious metals and commodities  For a while commodities are plentiful and prices are low  During this time real estate and stocks outperform commodities and gold  Then  the cycle reverses  and gold  precious metals and commodities outperform stocks and real estate The chart shows the real estate and stock markets performance against gold over the past 80 years  Both marketshave followed each other almost perfectly  At the last bottom in stocks in the early 1980 s you could have bought the Dow Jones index for about one ounce of gold  and you could have picked up a new house for less than 80 ounces of gold  Then twenty years later the Dow Jones was worth 44 ounces of gold and an average house in the US was selling for close to 800 ounces of gold We are currently in the middle of a bull market in precious metals and commodities  We can expect this cycle to end when gold trades in par with the Dow Jones and a new house in the US is worth less than 100 ounces of gold  At that point in time  gold has reached its peak in terms of purchasing power relative to stocks and other financial assets  and it will be time to move into another asset class such as stocks and real estate  However  for now I recommend any prudent investor to load up on physical gold  silver and quality gold stocks  like Newmont Mining  NEM   Goldcorp  GG   Barrick Gold Corporation  ABX   New Gold Inc   NGD  Yamana Gold Inc  AUY  and Silver Wheaton  SLW  to name a few  and ride this bull market to the end ,2011-11-24,Rob Hall,https://www.investing.com/analysis/profit-from-the-coming-transfer-of-wealth-by-understanding-wealth-cycles-106645,106645
189961,411477,NEM,Gold Outlook  How it will Fare in 2012,opinion,The consensus among investment bankers and many traders is that gold prices will continue to climb in 2012  In other words  gold prices are not in a bubble  Among the most sanguine about gold prices is Goldman Sachs  It forecasts a price at the end of next year around  1 940  slightly higher than the metal s 2011 high of  1 925 10  reached on Sept  6 of this year Deutsche Bank also has a positive view on gold  It has told clients the world is halfway through a commodity super cycle and that gold will draw key support from negative real interest rates   Our strongest conviction trade remains long precious metals and specifically gold   Deutsche Bank wrote in its  The Market s in 2012  publication   In an environment where real interest rates are negative and the U S  equity risk premium is high we expect this will sustain strong private and public sector demand for gold  Barclays is also upbeat about gold  anticipating a rebound in physical investment demand in 2012   Our strongest conviction trade remains long precious metals and specifically gold   Barclays recently wrote to cli ents   In an environment where real interest rates are negative and the U S  equity risk premium is high we expect this will sustain strong private and public sector demand for gold  Indeed given investor appetite to protect against tail events such as the break up of the Eurozone  we view an overshooting in the gold price as a high probability event  According to the measures we employ  gold would need to move above  2 170 per ounce for prices to be considered ex treme and for the market to start displaying bubble characteristics  The CME Group  which owns the Comex  offered an upbeat outlook for gold earlier this month  CME noted in a Dec  20 article posted on the group s Web site that gold had 16 percent year on year gains in the early 2000s before a 28 percent gain in 2009 and 2010  CME expects this year to see a reversion to the pre crisis gains of about 16 percent   For 2012 we would expect to see good gains in gold prices but more modest than those achieved over the last three years   CME said in the article  entitled  The Economy in 2012   and its implications for gold  Key factorsCIBC s Barry Cooper  Managing Director of Institutional Equity Research  sees gold at  2 000 next year and  2 200 in 2013  With the recent sovereign credit issues in both the U S  and Europe  and weak economic data from both sides of the Atlantic  we believe the safe haven characteristics of gold will again play an important role in the performance of the metal   he wrote recently Cooper cited six factors that bode well for gold in 2012 1  Supply from mines continues to be limited   While production increases have been touted by many producers  collectively global gold production growth is dismal  Either many of the projects fail to meet production expectations or fail to be built  either on time or at all 2  Investment demand remains high Gold exchange traded funds account for almost 10 percent of world demand and on the margin have influenced the gold price by likely more than  300 per ounce  Private stocks of gold bullion have also escalated as witnessed by the increased activity within physical coin demand that was up 30 percent year over year  We believe that preservation of wealth has become paramount amongst inves tors  and on an international stage  gold will be the chosen vehicle for maintaining one s relative position in the world 3  Central banks are switching from selling to buying   After being net sellers of gold for most of the past 20 years  central banks have become net buyers  and in the most recent quarter bought a net 150 metric tons of gold  The move into gold by central banks was in part driven off of the credit worthiness of foreign debt that is becoming ever more difficult to assess that potential for default 4  Interest rates remain low  lessening the enticement for hedging Gold hedging by producers effectively over supplies the market today with gold that will not be produced until sometime in the future  By using the contango offered between interest rates and the lease rate for gold  a higher realized gold price could be achieved  Although lease rates remain low  interest rates do not offer any sizeable contango opportunities  In addition  the disdain held by investors for hedged companies continues to put pressure against hedging 5  Economic conditions are likely to remain clouded for an extended period of time   Thus far financial bailouts have only deferred problems  not fixed them  We believe the agony of a slow recovery will prevail for an extended period of time with multiple stops and starts  leading to an uncertain outlook  Gold is usually considered a stabilizing entity during the periods where there are a multitude of outcomes with a negative bias 6  Continuing strong jewelry demand from China and other parts of the Eastern world   While jewelry demand has diminished in tonnage terms as well as percentage terms of world gold demand  it remains an important component in the fundamental aspects for gold pricing  Jewelry demand makes up about 50 percent of the global market  Thus despite being on decline in tonnage terms  the dollar amount of jewelry bought reached a record high in the most recent quarter The dollar could challenge the upbeat consensus about gold in 2012  according to Deutsche Bank   We are maintaining our bullish outlook for gold   Deutsche Bank wrote in a Dec  9 client note   However  we expect the next test for the market will be a further appreciation in the U S  dollar heading into the new year  Unlike previous periods of risk aversion that occurred in 2009 and 2010  this time U S  dollar strength is not being accompanied by strong inflows into physically backed gold exchange traded funds  In fact over the past three years there has been a significant moderation in investor flows into gold  which may reflect some concern that gold has moved into overvalued territory  From a positioning perspective  the liquidation in gold length on Comex over the past few months appears to have drawn to a close but currency trends may yet trigger an additional round of speculative liquidation  Gold mining shares to see higher demand CIBC s Cooper said that shares of almost every gold and silver producer have underperformed the commodity for much of the past three years   We view the situation as a  risk off  scenario whereby investors are seeking safety in the metal but not in the equities  We believe that the pendulum between the two investment classes has swung too far and expect that equities should be able to perform better going forward as bottom line results begin to drive fundamental valuation metrics   he wrote Among the themes that we expect will produce an appetite for equities are the following for companies with market capitalizations greater than  3 billion 1  Growth   Production growth has been the key driver for gold shares for much of the past decade and we think this aspect will continue to be a focus for investors  Among the names offering the strongest production growth in the coming three years are Goldcorp  Yamana  Eldorado  AuRico and Osisko 2  Dividends   The partnership between investors and companies has become strained with the common mend being increased dividends  Three companies stand out with a unique dividend policy that is predictable and defined  Newmont Mining  Silver Wheaton and Eldorado Gold  Newmont Mining has a dividend policy payout related to the gold price with an escalator that accelerates payments above a gold price of  1 700 per ounce  Silver Wheaton has a payout of 20 percent of the previous quarter s cash flow  Eldorado has a dividend policy related to gold production levels and changes to the gold price 3  Value   Gold equities have never been cheaper and now many trade well below S P averages for traditional metrics such as price earnings ratios  Among the least expensive producers are Barrick Gold  Iamgold  Kinross Gold and AuRico Gold 4  Safety   One of the reasons for wanting exposure to gold is for the safety aspect offered by the metal  It  therefore  is logical that gold companies which offer safety within their group may be preferred investments  Among the gold producers with the highest safety factors  geopolitical  opera tional  corporate  are Barrick Gold  Goldcorp  Franco Nevada  Royal Gold and Silver Wheaton 5  Discovery   Real value enhancement comes from the discovery of new gold reserves in the ground  We find that while most companies are fairly good at replacing reserves on a consistent basis  few are able to increase their reserves faster than the extraction rate  Among the companies that have had a record of discovery that is better than the rate of mining are Agnico Eagle  Iamgold  Centerra and Yamana The white metalsUnlike the upbeat consensus for gold prices in 2012  there is more diversity on prospects for silver and the other white metals  Earlier this month Deutsche Bank told clients that silver is likely to continue to underperform gold  We expect this to continue as silver and platinum group metals re main vulnerable to a deteriorating outlook for global growth   Deutsche Bank said   Given what remains resilient but still fragile business confidence in the U S  we expect silver will find it increasingly difficult to out perform  CIBC  on the other hand  sees silver at  50 next year and  52 in 2013  As 2011 ended  silver was trading several dollars beneath  30 per troy ounce and lower than the price it began 2011 with Platinum and palladium may fare better than silver  analysts say  The main reason for  platinum and palladium doing better than silver  is the deteriorating output picture in South Africa   Barclays wrote in a note to clients   Hampered by strikes  declining ore grades and power shortages we expect the country s output of both palladium and platinum to fall in 2012   Moreover  after recent accidents  local producers report they are now losing up to four days of production per month because of safety is sues  With Russian stocks of palladium now widely believed to be close to exhaustion  palladium supplies look very tight and we forecast a year on year decline of 3 per cent to 4 percent in supply next year   The decline in platinum supply should slow  with Russian supply stable and a relatively modest decline all that we expect in South African supply   It could be  however  that all of the white precious metals could face troubles in 2012  Deutsche Bank warned clients recently that silver and platinum group metals  remain vulnerable to a deteriorating outlook for global growth ,2011-12-29,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gold-outlook:-how-it-will-fare-in-2012-109990,109990
189962,411478,NEM,Why You Need Gold And Silver Stocks,opinion,Any person alive in the 1970s remembers the incredible bull market in mining stocks  Toward the end of that decade  there were many stocks that appreciated 10 or 20 TIMES in just a few years from 1978 to 1980  At least one of the better known gold stock mutual funds from that period  the Van Eck International Gold Fund returned over 22  for the entire decade of the 1970s  see Bob Kargenian  Advisor Perspectives on Investing With Inflation   Going further back in time  to the Great Depression  there were three  large gold stocks that also made people money during a time when most stock investors lost their shirts  Homestake Mining  Alaska Juneau Gold Mining Company  and Dome Mines Limited  all had average returns of about 300  from 1929 to 1933  and this does not include dividends which were often north of 8   The prices of Homestake and Alaska have been tracked by Mark Lundeen  with the help of Barron s Magazine  as part of the Barron s Gold Mining Index  Lundeen has shown that these two companies generated returns of over 100 TIMES for an investor who held them from the 1930s to 1980 Mining Stocks Suffer From Irrational PessimismHowever  Lundeen and Barrons were unable to come up with more data regarding all of the other  smaller mining companies that existed during this period  These men aren t alone  no major financial media publication or research institute that I know of has undertaken a serious study of the performance of all gold and silver mining stocks during the first part of the last bull market in silver  from the 1930s through to the early 1970s  This  more than anything else  may be an indicator of how kooky and weird the larger investment world feels investing in gold and silver miners is   Most major mining indexes  like the XAU or HUI were put together in the 1980s or 1990s   Still  anecdotal evidence shows that a diversified basketof large producers with some  juniors  in them easily produced returns in excess of 500 to 1000   including dividends  Many South African miners actually paid out dividends at different points as high as 15   if not higher   Doug Casey  along with his associate Jeff Clark have published some of this data  and Doug included examples of major profits in the mining sector in his book  Crisis Investing  which was a national best seller in the early 1980s Like the Tide  Irrational Exuberance Will Come In With MinersWhat contributed to the mining stock mania of the late 1970s was the belief that earnings growth  coupled with the price of bullion  could only go one way  up  And not just up  but up big  as in annualized rates of north of 50   If you know anything about Wall Street  you understand that speculators and institutional money alike often demonstrate a willingness to  pay up  for growth  You certainly saw this is in the dot com bubble  where many stocks had price to earnings ratios in the 1000s  or  worse yet  did not even have price to earnings ratios because they had no earnings  But the belief was that everyone  had  to own these companies  which were hot and seemed to be a part of the best new thing to come along  the internet  since the invention of the wheel   Understand that most companies don t have price to earnings ratios much higher than 10 or 15  and some would even call that expensive  But if the mood strikes Wall Street or other assorted speculators right  the same could happen to gold and silver miners as happened to the internet stocks of the 90s  or the mining shares of 1978 1980  Valuation is subjective  and it often does not matter  Of course  this has yet to be the case  at least in the aggregate  Most of the major indexes which follow the precious metal miners have failed to keep up with the appreciation in gold and silver since 2008  Anecdotally of course  this also happened in the last bull market from 1930 to 1980  a lot of the big gains were concentrated at certain times  It was either feast of famine with the mining stocks Some will also point out that the other reason the mining stocks have not performed as well has to do with the fact that there are so many more ways to gain exposure to gold and silver now through a brokerageaccount  In the 1970s  only the Central Fund of Canada existed  to my knowledge  as a kind of bullion equity that could be held in a brokerage account  Now there are several such funds Five Reasons For Owning Gold and Silver StocksBut I am skeptical regarding this argument on five counts 1  Mining stocks can pay dividends  They aren t back to 16   but dividend payouts from mining stocks do appear to be growing  Recently  Newmont Mining essentially guaranteed increases in its dividend with the price of gold  as of the fall of 2011  As is often said about bullion to discredit it as an investment  bullion pays no income  Not so with mining stocks 2  Mining companies can be takeover targets and you might benefit from the bidding war for assets  I should also add that with a mining stock you own gold or silver  in the ground   meaning a potential windfall if the next version of the California or Nevada gold or silver rush materializes 3  It is important to remember that if you own gold or silver outright in the United States  you will likely face a higher tax upon sale than owning it in equity form  either through one of the trusts like the Central Fund  or by owning a mining stock  4  No one ever confiscated a mining stock  In the bull market from 1930 to 1980  Americans could not legally own silver bullion until the mid 1960s  and gold bullion not until 1975  Along with rare coins and jewelry  another way to hedge yourself against inflation was with mining stocks  So mining stocks are an important way to diversify yourself against the political risk that your bullion will either be confiscated or taxed at a very high rate 5  Finally  mining stocks do provide leverage to the gold or silver price  assuming that they can get their costs under control  or at least have their costs increase more slowly than the increase in the price of bullion   For example  if a mine has a profit of 300 dollars and the price of gold moves from 1700 to 2000  it is possible that most of that 300 dollars goes to the bottom line  remember I said most  and remember this is a theoretical discussion   A 300 dollar increase in the bullion price was only about a 20 percent increase  but a 300 dollar increase to the bottom line of the mining company is a 100  increase  Hopefully you can see the difference However  all of this is dependent upon Wall Street recognizing this story  and deciding that it wants to in fact pay up for this kind of earnings growth  The mining stocks are just not well understood at the moment  and frankly  they suffer from the fact that leverage can work in two ways  In the example above  if bullion declines or if costs spiral out of control  then obviously you have a problem with your silver or gold producer  With the mining shares  you also have political risk  or the risk of flooding  explosions  deaths  or environmental regulations  all ofwhich could shudder the best of projects  this is why diversification counts   It is true that gold and silver stocks are just that  stocks  They are not a substitute for bullion As of this writing  investors are risk averse  this is one reason behind the interest in bullion as an investment  However  just as crisis consciousness is not the only driver for bullion investing  neither is risk aversion going to keep people away from the mining shares forever  Barring the end of the world  I think they will eventually get their day in the sun  And in that environment  it won t matter what the actual earnings are  what the actual feasibility of a project is  or what is going on politically  People will have gold and silver fever  like they had dot com fever in the  90s  and they will grab anything with the word gold or silver in the title  as David Morgan likes to say  This irrational aspect stock investing speculating  may be unsettling to some  but I think it has a far larger grounding in reality than many realize  So do your homework  diversify  don t be scared  and buy some mining shares before the sleeping herd wakes up ,2012-02-10,Ryan

189965,411481,NEM,Uranium Miners Beginning Major Upswing  Interview With Jeb Handwerger,opinion,Despite the Fukushima setback of last March  nuclear power is not a dinosaur industry of the past  according to Jeb Handwerger  editor of Gold Stock Trades  In fact  he believes the world is reawakening to the need for nuclear power generation  which demands increasing amounts of uranium  The big percentage returns on uranium will come from the near term U S  domestic producers and junior exploration companies in the Athabasca Basin  and in this exclusive interview with   Handwerger shares his favorite names that could return huge multiples COMPANIES MENTIONED     CAMECO CORP    DENISON MINES CORP    EXELON CORPORATION   EXTRACT RESOURCES LTD    GLOBAL X URANIUM ETF   KALAHARI MINERALS PLC   PALADIN ENERGY LTD      URANIUM ONE INC  The Energy Report  I can see from your newsletter that you are bullish on uranium  Can you explain why Jeb Handwerger  The worldwide demand for electrical power is giving rise to a nuclear renaissance  Even before the events in Japan in March 2011 there was renewed interest  In some ways  the disaster at Fukishima can benefit the sector by pushing us into the modern age of nuclear  which is safer  cleaner  smaller and in some cases portable  We are really at the cusp of a nuclear revival  and I think it is going to be stronger than ever  The West and especially North America have the ability over the next few years to become not only energy independent  but to become suppliers and exporters of energy  Regardless of public opinion on this energy source  nuclear power is not going away  Countries are going to have to learn how to live with and use nuclear power in a safer and more efficient way TER  What are the catalysts you re seeing in the sector JH  There are so many catalysts in the sector right now  We just saw two new approvals for nuclear power plants in Georgia with the new AP1000 Generation III design  This is after three decades of not approving a reactor here in the U S  Elsewhere we see that Canada has its own CANDU  Canada deuterium uranium  reactors  and we ve seen Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper work out a deal with the Chinese Investment Corporation  China is looking to expand its investment presence in natural resources and to diversify its large holdings of U S  dollars and Treasuries  The Chinese are establishing relationships with uranium producers  and this is going to be very big for Canadian resource companies  We are really excited about the uranium sector at the moment  We re even seeing interest from major entrepreneurs  such as Bill Gates TER  I ll ask you about Gates in a bit  But where are uranium equities in their cycle right now JH  Right now uranium is presenting a once in a lifetime opportunity  Even though we have seen a rally with some near term producers up over 200  since those 2011 lows  investors are just now beginning to realize a real turn in uranium market fundamentals  and I think we re really beginning the next cycle  moving higher as demand outpaces supply  Many technical charts show stocks beginning to break above their long term 200 day moving averages  It may begin to slope upward The Global X Uranium ETF  URA NYSE  is one of the better ways to look at the sector as a whole  and the 200 day moving average right now is about  10 34  having just broken  10 45  It is up over 33  in 2012 outpacing the gold and silver miners TER  Do you see uranium equities as value plays JH  I see that the near term producers have rallied and have had quite a bounce  and now are not as cheap as they once were  that s for sure  Some of the producers have also moved  such as Uranium One Inc   UUU TSX   Cameco Corp   CCO TSX  CCJ NYSE  and Denison Mines Corp   DML TSX  DNN NYSE A   So far I haven t seen a really explosive move in many of the uranium explorers  and so I think that there s still a lot of upside  Investors have to realize that when the uranium sector begins a new leg up  the moves will be dramatic  We believe we are still early in the game TER  Do you have a favorite play  JH  My main recommendation over the past few months has been   It hit a low in October  it has rallied since that point with over a 200  move  But I still don t think it s been recognized that it is in construction at its Nichols Ranch Project and should be producing 600 800 thousand pounds of uranium annually  Its grades are substantially higher than its peers and it already has a processing agreement signed with its neighbor  Cameco  I think we re still early stage  It s one of my premier  select equities  and I recommend it be bought on pullbacks  Uranerz is well funded and fully permitted for construction on its Nichols Ranch Project in the Powder River Basin  which is scheduled for production of uranium ore by the end of this year  The 20   50  and 200 day moving averages are sloping upwards It is important to note that Uranerz  land position is strategically surrounded by hungry majors such as Uranium One and Cameco  which has stated that its production needs are beefing up  Already  Cameco has arranged for Uranerz to use its processing facilities  which heretofore have been underutilized as Cameco is not meeting desired production levels Cameco was willing to pay a premium for Hathor  which had nowhere near Uranerz  immediate potential  It may be occurring to Cameco that Uranerz might make a desirable acquisition that will enable the company to expand profitably in this strategic area Uranium One  which also neighbors Uranerz  might make a bid for the next U S  domestic producer  The acquisition possibilities seem endless  with the Chinese looking for acquisitions to purchase with their hoard of depreciating U S  dollars and Euros  Additionally  the flooding of the Ranger deposit in Australia further intensifies the supply demand ratio of uranium  which is positive for North American miners such as Uranerz Uranerz also has an agreement to sell uranium to Exelon Corporation  EXC NYSE   one of the largest nuclear power producing utilities  It will be shipping resin over to Cameco s processing facility  which is not being filled to capacity  and that s telling me that Uranerz will be a great acquisition target TER  Do you think we will see a bidding war between Uranium One and Cameco for Uranerz JH  Possibly  and I think that Paladin Energy Ltd   PDN TSX  PDN ASX  is also interested in coming into North America  Paladin just did a big write down on its African deposit and took a loss  Paladin CEO John Borshoff was also CEO at Uranerz from 1987 to 1991  and I am sure he is aware that it should be coming into production by the end of the year  Right before Fukushima in 2011  Paladin bought the Michelin uranium deposit from Fronteer Gold  acquired by Newmont Mining Corporation  NEM NYSE    So  Paladin definitely has an interest in North America TER  Jeb  just one more question about Uranerz  Only 18  of shares are being held by institutions  Just based on that capital structure  there s tremendous room for appreciation here  isn t there JH  That s why I have targeted Uranerz shares at around  7  which is still over double where it is today  I don t think it is a real stretch when you see the supply demand constraints over the next 12 18 months  The majors such as Paladin  Rio Tinto  China and surprisingly the government of Iran are having problems dealing with the ever rising threat of resource nationalism as exemplified by Namibia  which is making noises that it may institute a super tax on miners  Of these aforementioned entities  Rio Tinto and Paladin may find a warmer welcome in the mining friendly Canadian Athabasca Basin and U S  Powder River Basin TER  You just began following   with a market cap of under  10 million  M   How do you classify this stock  seeing that it s too small for mutual funds to purchase shares JH  I look at Athabasca Uranium as an exploration company in the midst of an upswing  We had not seen a lot of interest in uranium exploration plays  but that changed at the end of 2011  The Rio Tinto deal with Hathor changed the price of real estate in the Athabasca Basin  and this is something that investors are going to begin to realize as the whole area heats up  Uranium is to the Athabasca Basin as oil is to Saudi Arabia  The Basin has by far the best grades in the world  as Saudi does oil  If you re looking for a company with a proven exploration model that is trying to replicate the Hathor  Denison and Cameco model  then Athabasca Uranium is one that you are going to keep a close eye on  It s using leading edge technology  including airborne surveys and seismic data to precisely designate its drilling targets If an investor believes in a uranium bull market and that exploration plays are going to provide significant leverage to the price of uranium  then this is a company you should be looking at because it s on a geological discovery trend  The big boys  such as Cameco  Rio Tinto  Sovereign Asian Funds and possibly BHP Billiton Ltd   BHP NYSE  BHPLF OTCPK  are realizing that future uranium production will come from the Athabasca Basin  This is where deposits have grades tens to hundreds of times greater than conventional projects and are located in the mining friendly jurisdiction of Saskatchewan  Canada To your point  you are right that with a  10M market cap the mutual funds are not going to invest in the company yet  but you have to remember that this young company really acquired all these land assets after Fukushima  when this opportunity presented itself  This is a chance for investors to get in on a ground floor opportunity where if the company does make a discovery  it has the potential to make very impressive gains  I can t emphasize enough that the Rio Hathor deal has changed the Athabasca Basin  and certainly the price of real estate in the area  I think investors need to follow companies like Athabasca Uranium  which is on the verge of hitting one of its target areas TER  The company currently has samples in analysis  What can we expect to see happen to these shares if these analyses show strikes JH  That s a good question  This is an area where there are massive uranium deposits  and if Athabasca Uranium has a showing similar to the size of McArthur Lake  the rewards could be spectacular on the exploration side  There s limited volume on the shares  and investors need to remember that it s a speculative exploratory play Looking at the map  it s clear that Athabasca Uranium is surrounded by hungry giants such as Cameco  Rio  Denison and AREVA  AREVA EPA   among others  This company is actively exploring this area and has encountered massive alterations zones for which results are currently pending  The company is optimistic that of the many holes being currently explored  it would take only several dramatic finds to replicate the Hathor phenomenon  which resulted in the stock rising from a few pennies to dollars  Athabasca Uranium is modeling itself after the Hathor success  The same aces that generated Hathor are being replicated step by step by this young uranium miner  which is barely more than a year old  It has the  goods  sitting directly in the middle of other successful mining ventures  The company hired Dr  Zoltan Hajnal  who was the seismic exploration expert for Hathor  Hathor s exploration success was based on the use of seismic data to efficiently pinpoint targets  The success rate of its drilling subsequently rose to approximately 70   Dr  Hajnal played an integral role in the Roughrider discovery  Read the full interview by Check out Jeb s recent interview with Uranerz Chairman
