Hidden Catalysts
Wendy s remains on track to achieve its goal of 7 500 global restaurants by 2020  In this regard  the company s international business is expected to boost growth in the future  Also  it plans to expand and form partnerships in emerging markets of Argentina  the Philippines and Japan 
Further  Wendy s has long term development agreements with franchisees in Singapore  the Middle East  North Africa  the Russian Federation  the Eastern Caribbean  Argentina  Japan  Georgia  the Republic of Azerbaijan  Ecuador and Chile  This apart  the company is exploring growth opportunities in China  Brazil and other key international markets  These less saturated emerging markets offer the company enormous growth opportunities 
Additionally  Wendy s is benefiting from its transition to a franchised business model  In 2017  the company had several first time builders and doubled the number of franchisees from 2015 by building new restaurants  The company is expecting 1  growth in 2018  Although the reduction in ownership has been weighing on revenues over the past few quarters  we believe franchising a large chunk of its system will lower Wendy s general and administrative expenses and thereby boost earnings 
This Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company s brand transformation initiatives includes menu innovation  promotional offers and bold new packaging  intended toward boosting sales  Meanwhile  the practice of offering customized sandwiches on order and serving hamburgers made of never frozen beef would continue driving the company s sales  Notably  the first quarter of 2018 marked Wendy s 21st consecutive quarter of positive same store sales growth in North America  mirroring long term strength and relevance of the brand 

Concerns
Wendy s is likely to incur additional capital expenditures in the coming years to boost the re imaging program  This  in turn  might lower free cash flow in the near term  Although the company has transitioned toward a franchise based model that trims capital expenditures  it will take time to reap benefits  In fact  the company expects capital expenditures of approximately  75  80 million in 2018 
In addition  Wendy s valuation looks a bit stretched when compared with its industry average  Looking at the company s price to earnings  P E  ratio  which is one of the most commonly used valuation ratio and is best suited for evaluating restaurants  investors might not want to pay any further premium  The company currently has a trailing 12 month P E ratio of 37 07  So  the stock is relatively overvalued right now compared with its peers  as the industry s average PE currently is 24 95

already rising expenses  In the first quarter of 2018  restaurant level operating profit margin contracted 130 basis points  bps  to 20   The downturn was due to a 90 bps increase in the cost of sales  70 bps rise in other restaurant operating expenses and 40 bps surge in occupancy costs Nonetheless  to curb expenses  the company is focusing on a new supply chain management software  replacing its older manual system  This would result in improved control of waste and cost of goods  significantly reducing inventory levels at the restaurants Zacks Rank   Stocks to ConsiderCurrently  Red Robin

9029,230544,DENN,Wendy s Rides On Franchising  Re Imaging   Expansion Efforts,opinion,The Wendy s Company s   NASDAQ WEN   strong international presence  relentless expansion  initiatives related to re imaging restaurants  product and technological innovation put it on growth trajectory The company recently posted better than expected   Adjusted earnings of 11 cents increased 37 5  year over year  primarily favored by the positive effect of lower tax rate related to share based payments  along with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017  Increased revenues also drove earnings of the company In the first quarter  Wendy s recorded year over year revenue growth after four consecutive quarters of revenue decline  Throughout 2017  the company s top line was under substantial pressure due to the system optimization initiative through franchising  Also  the company s surprise history has not been much impressive as it missed the consensus mark in two of the last four quarters  delivering a negative average earnings surprise of 1 99  However  backed by a solid brand presence  the company s shares have rallied 15 3   outperforming the  s growth of 3 5   Given its refranchising and reimaging initiatives to further strengthen the brand  the stock should continue to perform well in the quarters ahead Franchised Business Model to Boost EarningsWendy s is benefiting from its transition to a franchised business model  In 2017  the company had several first time builders and doubled the number of franchisees building new restaurants compared with 2015  The company is expecting 1  growth in 2018  Though the reduction in ownership weighed on revenues throughout 2017  we believe that franchising a large chunk of its system will lower Wendy s general and administrative expenses  and thereby boost earnings  Moreover  over the long term  it would generate a higher return on equity by lowering capital requirements  This would also boost free cash flow  thereby enhancing shareholders  return  Also  in the first quarter of 2018  the company s top line gained from the Franchise flip that occurred in 2017 Going forward  the company also plans to continue facilitating franchisee to franchisee restaurant transfers through its buy and flip strategy  This strategy ensures that restaurants are put in the hands of well capitalized franchisees  committed to long term growth  In 2017  Wendy s facilitated 540 Buy and Flip transactions  with 130 in the fourth quarter Re Imaging Restaurants Likely to Improve Guest ExperienceWendy s remains on track to achieve at least 70  of its Image Activation goal for 2020 as part of its brand transformation initiative  This program has gained traction in the recent past  leading to increased traffic and higher sales at its restaurants  At the end of 2017  43  of the global system featured the brand s new image  Interestingly  as a result of this re imaging  customers have seen some bold designs and friendlier restaurant teams  In 2017  Image Activation benefited North America same restaurant sales by 70 basis points and the company expects a 60 basis point benefit in 2018 Strong International Presence   Expansion Efforts Bode WellWendy s is steadfast in completing the goal of its global restaurant count reaching 7 500 by the year 2020  The company s international business is thus poised to be growth driver in the future  The company has growth plans and partnerships in Argentina  the Philippines and Japan  Further  Wendy s has long term development agreements with franchisees in Singapore  the Middle East  North Africa  the Russian Federation  the Eastern Caribbean  Argentina  Japan  Georgia  the Republic of Azerbaijan  Ecuador and Chile Moreover  the advancement of Image Activation and improvement in its restaurant economic model are also enabling the company to make progress with its new unit development goals  The company achieved total net new development of 97 restaurants globally  in 2017  indicating growth of 1 5  year over year  Also  in the first quarter of 2018  the company opened 33 new restaurants as part of its expansion endeavors  Further  the company boasts a strong pipeline of projects that are expected to help it achieve its 2018 net new restaurant development growth goal of 2  globally Zacks Rank   Other Stocks to

9030,230545,DENN,YUM  Brands  YUM  Stock Up 22  In A Year  More Room To Run ,opinion,"YUM  Brands  Inc    NYSE YUM   looks promising on the back of its effort to drive growth by developing its three iconic global brands and creating a more efficient cost structure  In the past year  shares of the company have rallied 22 2   outperforming the  s increase of 4 8   However  the stock recently came under pressure after the company s comps growth came in below the analyst expectations  Let s delve deeper 
Hidden Catalyst
In the first quarter of 2018  Yum Brands  completed the second year of its transformation journey  By relying extensively on the four key drivers of growth   distinctive  relevant and easy brands  unmatched franchise operating capability  bold restaurant developments  and unrivaled culture and talent   the company remains on track to achieve its target 
Additionally  the digital wave has hit the U S  fast casual restaurant sector  More and more restaurants are deploying technology to enhance guest experience  Yum  Brands is also not far behind in this race as the company seems to continue with its transformation process toward a single point of sale system in the United States  Evidently  in fourth quarter 2017  Yum  Brands announced a partnership with online food delivery platform  Grubhub  to enhance online sales and delivery from its restaurants  The company has started integrating all KFC and Taco Bell restaurants with Grubhub in the first quarter 
Furthermore  this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company has adopted a de risking strategy by reducing its ownership of restaurants through refranchising  In first quarter 2018  Yum Brands  had franchise ownership of 97  and is committed toward becoming at least 98  franchised  It expects to possess less than 1 000 company owned restaurants by the end of 2018 
We believe that refranchising a large portion of the system reduces the company s capital requirements and facilitates earnings per share growth and ROE expansion  Additionally  free cash flow will continue to grow  facilitating reinvestments to increase brand recognition and shareholder return 
Remarkably  this shift to refranchising has substantially benefited the company s operating margin over the years  Also  it has helped Yum Brands  to post year over year growth in earnings over the past few quarters  Moreover  the company s earnings have surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing six quarters 

Concerns
Despite reporting better than expected results in the first quarter 2018 the company s shares recently came under pressure after its comps growth of 1  came in below the analyst expectations 
Additionally  the company is highly exposed to various macroeconomic headwinds due to continual expansion in international markets  Therefore  Yum Brands  earnings remain highly vulnerable to fluctuations in exchange rates  Also  an increase in the cost of employee wages  benefits and insurance as well as other operating costs  such as rent and energy costs remain concerns for the company   A competitive retail environment might hurt the restaurants  costs as well 
Stocks to Consider
Some better ranked stocks in the same space are Brinker International  Inc    NYSE EAT    Del Taco Restaurants  Inc    NASDAQ TACO   and Denny s Corp    NASDAQ DENN    All these stocks has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  
Brinker International has a long term earnings growth rate of 10 9

9036,230551,DENN,Amazon  Walmart   Target Each Just Stepped Up Their Own Delivery Game,opinion,"On Friday  reports surfaced about three of America s biggest retailers that detailed each was making further headway into the ultra competitive online delivery space 
Amazon com   NASDAQ AMZN  
Just weeks after the e commerce giant finalized its acquisition of organic grocer Whole Foods  Amazon has announced a new partnership with Olo  a New York based food delivery service  The up and coming delivery option provides digital order and pay technology to 200 restaurants like Applebee s  Chipotle   NYSE CMG    Denny s   NASDAQ DENN    Shake Shack   NYSE SHAK    and Wingstop   NASDAQ WING   
As part of the deal with  Olo s clients would be listed on the Amazon Restaurants section of Amazon com  Olo will then provide the tech that published menus and take orders while Amazon arranges deliveries  Amazon Restaurants has also   which is an Olo product that allows restaurants to take delivery orders from Amazon and other third party services 
Not only will this partnership help Olo s customers connect with Amazon Restaurant s delivery services  but it will also give Amazon s customers access to more restaurant options 
Shares of food delivery leader GrubHub   NYSE GRUB   has taken a beating on the news  falling as much as 7  before regaining some ground  the stock is currently down about 3 3  
Walmart   NYSE WMT  
In a   big box leader Walmart announced that it is testing a service that delivers groceries to your home  and unloads them for you straight to your refrigerator even when you re not home 
Working with smart lock startup August Home and same day delivery service Deliv  Walmart customers can order groceries and other items online  and orders will then be securely brought in to their homes when ready  When the delivery person rings a customer s doorbell  it triggers a smartphone notification  which you can then watch the delivery take place if you choose 
Delivery associates enter a customer s home by pressing a one time  pre authorized passcode into the smart lock  the worker would then carry groceries to the kitchen and unload them in the fridge  while any other items would be left by the front door 
Walmart said the test will take place in Silicon Valley  with a small number of August Home users that have chosen to use the service  It is not clear how long this current test will last  or how this aspect of Walmart s delivery program will evolve 
Target   NYSE TGT  
Fellow big box frontrunner Target recently upped its delivery service game  with Target Restock offering city dwellers next day delivery on everyday essentials ordered online 
After testing the service over the summer  the company expanded Target Restock to eight additional cities  which makes it available to over 70 million people  It s now available in Atlanta  Chicago  Los Angeles  New York  Philadelphia  San Francisco  coming mid October   St  Louis  and the Washington  D C  Baltimore  MD areas  
Similar to Amazon s Prime Pantry  customers can fill a box  up to 45 pounds  with typical household items think laundry detergent and cleaning supplies for a flat  4 99 fee  Amazon charges  5 99 per box  Another advantage  Target doesn t charge an annual membership fee  and is available to any online Target shopper in the supported metropolitan regions 
This is just one of the many new initiatives Target is trying out  and many seem to be hitting their mark  the company s smaller format stores and in house brands were a big reason for its better than expected results last quarter  And  Target Restock s expansion is a sign that shoppers are consciously choosing Target over other online options for things like paper towels and other grocery related items 
Perhaps Amazon s dominance is not as all encompassing as it appears

9042,230557,DENN,Denny s  DENN  Sees Hammer Chart Pattern  Time To Buy ,opinion,"Denny s Corporation   NASDAQ DENN   has been struggling lately  but the selling pressure may be coming to an end soon  That is because DENN recently saw a Hammer Chart Pattern which can signal that the stock is nearing a bottom 
What is a Hammer Chart Pattern  
A hammer chart pattern is a popular technical indicator that is used in candlestick charting  The hammer appears when a stock tumbles during the day  but then finds strength at some point in the session to close near or above its opening price  This forms a candlestick that resembles a hammer  and it can suggest that the market has found a low point in the stock  and that better days are ahead 
Other Factors
Plus  earnings estimates have been rising for this company  even despite the sluggish trading lately  In just the past 60 days alone 1 estimate has gone higher  compared to none lower  while the consensus estimate has also moved in the right direction 
Estimates have actually risen so much that the stock now has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  suggesting this relatively unloved stock could be due for a breakout soon  This will be especially true if DENN stock can build momentum from here and find a way to continue higher of off this encouraging trading development ",2016-08-25,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/denny's-(denn)-sees-hammer-chart-pattern:-time-to-buy-200150311,200150311

earnings of  1 24 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 23 by a penny  Further  earnings increased 31 9  year over year  benefitting from improved revenues and lower share count  However  margins remained weak in the quarter Quarterly revenues rose 15 4  year over year to  881 7 million supported by the increased restaurant capacity as a result of the Pepper Dining acquisition on Jun 25  2015 and an extra week of sales  which were partially offset by lower comps Company sales rose 15 8  and franchise and other revenues also rose 2 1   Revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of

sChili s reported revenues of  747 3 million  up 17 1  year over year  This was primarily due to an increase in restaurant capacity  improved comps as well as an additional operating week Chili s company owned comps fell 1 8  due to a 4 1  decline in traffic  Comps compared favorably with the prior quarter decline of 3 6   We note that comps had decreased 0 8  in the year ago comparable period Comps at Chili s franchised restaurants went down 3 4  as against 1 9  growth in the year ago quarter and 1 7  decline in the last quarter  Notably  increased competitive activity in the QSR category continued to affect sales and traffic trends in the quarter Chili s restaurants are comparatively heavily concentrated in Texas and Louisiana  where declining oil prices have led to macroeconomic

a decline of 0 1  a year ago  We note that  comps had increased 0 2  in the prior quarter  The decline in the quarterly comps was due to the timing of marketing spending and seasonal softness in the banquet business Expenses and MarginsTotal costs and expenses increased 15 8  to  782 3 million  mainly due to higher restaurant expenses and restaurant labor costs Cost of sales ratio declined 10 bps year over year due to unfavorable mix partially offset by favorable menu and commodity pricing Restaurant labor  as a percentage of revenues  was down 110 bps in the quarter due to higher wages and

9048,230563,DENN,Forget Chipotle  Invest In These Restaurant Stocks Instead ,opinion,"Chipotle Mexican Grill  Inc    NYSE CMG   had been an investor favorite with revenues exhibiting an extraordinary CAGR of over 23  til 2014 from the time it went public  The stunning performance was supported by solid comparable restaurant sales  comps  growth However  Wall Street s darling fell from grace toward 2015 end  as a slew of E  coli and norovirus contamination incidents derailed its growth story  In fact  despite various food safety initiatives  Chipotle continues to reel under the negative publicity associated with food borne illnesses which has impacted its share price by nearly 17  year to date Over the past 60 days  the Zacks Consensus Estimate has decreased 11 5  for 2016 earnings  adding to the company s woes  Moreover  for 2016  sales and earnings are projected to decline nearly 10  and 75   respectively  raising questions over this Zacks Rank  4  Sell  company s prospects  What s Hurting Chipotle Chipotle s performance has been largely dented by the food safety issues  As a safety measure  the fast casual chain was forced to close several outlets  Although these were reopened later with fresh ingredients and extensive cleaning and sanitizing activities  the incidents dealt a severe blow to Chipotle s sales The fact that Chipotle uses only healthy ingredients has long been its marketing strength and has been attracting customers despite its comparatively high prices  Thus  given the negative publicity related to food borne illnesses  Chipotle s popularity among health conscious diners is declining  The company thus expects both earnings and revenues to remain under pressure in the near term At its fourth quarter 2015 conference call  Chipotle stated that it is not possible for the company to provide any meaningful comps outlook for 2016 in the wake of the prevailing volatile sales trends  The company added that future sales prediction is difficult as it awaits further developments and other announcements from health authorities Meanwhile  other restaurants have been working on providing customers with healthier food and innovative menu options in the fast casual restaurant space  intensifying competition for Chipotle  In fact  owing to food safety issues and increased competition  in Jun 2016  Chipotle lost the tag of the most popular Mexican restaurant  per an annual survey from Harris Poll  which is likely to further hurt traffic Moreover  a recent CNNMoney report revealed that nearly 10 000 of Chipotle s workers have joined a class action lawsuit against the company for wage theft  thereby compounding its woes Going forward  Chipotle expects combined marketing and promo expenses to remain at elevated levels as the company plans to continue to connect with its customers to reclaim their trust and loyalty and bring them back to its stores  Thus  the costs associated with these and the expenses to support the company s newly designed food safety program will continue to impact profitability Also  implementation of food safety practices has increased the amount of labor required to prepare and serve food  resulting in higher labor costs which may continue to keep profits under pressure 5 Alternate PicksChipotle might be going through a rough patch but there are other restaurant stocks that are performing well at the moment With the help of the   we have zeroed in on five stocks in the Retail Restaurants industry with a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  Below are five stocks that have had a good run on the bourse so far and have better prospects than Chipotle  So let s dig in Headquartered in Louisville  KY  Papa John s International Inc    NASDAQ PZZA   operates   franchises pizza

full year 2016  sales and EPS are projected to grow a respective 4 6  and 17 4  Headquartered in Dallas  TX  Wingstop Inc    NASDAQ WING    together with its subsidiaries  franchises and operates restaurants under the Wingstop brand  Its restaurants offer cooked to order  hand sauced  and tossed chicken wings  Solid unit development  investments in technology along with migrating to a national

upward trend in earnings estimate revision for 2016 and 2017 earnings  Further  for full year 2016  sales growth is pegged at 17 2  while EPS is expected to grow a solid 17 6  Headquartered in Syracuse  NY  Carrols Restaurant Group  Inc    NASDAQ TAST   operates through its subsidiaries and is one of the largest restaurant companies in the U S  The company is the largest Burger King franchisee  based on restaurant count  The company s astounding earnings growth  significant improvement in the top line and operating margin along with innovative product introductions hold well for long term growth The stock has returned over 8  on a year to date basis and has been seeing an upward trend in earnings estimate revision for 2016 and 2017  over the past 60 days  Additionally  for full year 2016  sales growth is pegged at 10 2  while EPS is likely to improve a solid 55 3  Headquartered in Spartanburg  SC  Denny s Corp    NASDAQ DENN   is one of the largest restaurant companies

earnings  over the past 60 days  reinstate hope on the stock s prospects  Further  for full year 2016  sales growth is poised at 3 1  while EPS is expected to grow 20 2  Headquartered in Lake Forest  CA  Del Taco Restaurants  Inc    NASDAQ TACO   is the second largest Mexican American QSR chain by units in the United States  serving more than three million guests each week  The company s increased focus on enhancing menu offerings along with driving guest experience raise optimism Notably  year to date  the stock has returned nearly 5   Further  for full year 2016  sales are expected to grow a healthy 20  Bottom LineAt this juncture  it does seem like dumping Chipotle might be a prudent move  Meanwhile  though the restaurant industry has its share of pitfalls in the form of sluggish comps growth and traffic trends along with rising labor costs  effective sales initiatives undertaken by the companies should keep it going  We expect the industry to sustain the momentum going ahead  and thus investors should not shy away from investing in this space

9070,230585,DENN,Denny s Prepping For Another Grand Slam,opinion,"I started talking about casual dining stocks at a conference in San Diego in October  Back then I was looking at Cracker Barrel Old Country Store  NASDAQ CBRL  and Dennys Corporation  NASDAQ DENN  among others  Many of them have moved a lot since then  They continue to perform well and rotate through consolidation and moves higher 

One of the originals  Denny s  is now back on my radar  It had a 40  move higher from the October time frame before consolidating in the current symmetrical triangle  A break of that higher would target the start of another leg up  with a price objective of 11 50 initially  Will it go another 40   The upside story gains some credence from what is known as a Positive RSI Reversal that is underway in the chart 
This is when the low at  B  is remains above the low at  A  but the RSI at  B  is lower than the RSI at  A   This phenomenon targets a move higher to 10 59  well above the break out criteria for the triangle  Look for this break out to add another restaurant to your rotation

9071,230586,DENN,3 Restaurant Stocks That Outperformed McDonald s In 2014,opinion,"The year 2014 turned out to be a tough one for the leading burger chain McDonald s Corporation  NYSE MCD   This Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing three quarters while revenues fell short of the consensus mark in all three  As a result  the company has an average positive earnings surprise of only 2 41  and a negative revenue surprise of 1 73  
Overall  the company s performance was unimpressive and its share price failed to register gains in 2014  This compares with the S P 500 s gain of 12 4   This brings us to the question as to why McDonald s  once the industry s darling  struggled to keep pace with the broader index  Besides some common industry headwinds  a slew of negatives in most of its operating regions resulted in the weak performance of the company  In fact  the company has been consistently posting negative comps over the past six months  Comps at all its operating regions have been under pressure  It has not been able to post positive comps since Oct 2013 in the domestic market owing to heightened competition and a few unwise decisions that slowed down service  The introduction of too many items in 2013 continued to impact service and orders in 2014 as well  Europe  its other important market  has seen sluggish comps owing to the weakening of euro and poor performance in Russia where the company is facing pressure from consumer safety regulators  This has even led to temporary disclosure of restaurants  The Asia Pacific  Middle East and Africa regions have also performed dismally due to food safety issues in China 
In Jul 2014  it was found that Shanghai Husi Food Co    a supplier of McDonald s    was reusing meat that had fallen on the factory floor as well as mixing fresh and expired meat  This led to food safety concerns and lower consumer confidence  which negatively impacted comps How Was the Performance of Other Restaurant Stocks  The U S  restaurant industry was under the weather at the beginning of 2014  Increasing food costs  weak consumer spending environment and a few political and general issues kept the industry under pressure 
However  better job prospects  stepped up economic activities  better than expected GDP numbers  improved business  renewed optimism as a result of the housing recovery  rising wages and cheap fuel in the second part of the year improved the bleak picture to some extent  In fact  the economy recorded back to back quarters of strong growth in over a decade and is now well on track for the best annual job growth since late 1999 
 Not surprisingly  consumer sentiment jumped to 93 6 in December from 88 8 in November  as per Thomson Reuters University of Michigan  The final reading represents the highest level in nearly eight years  Buoyed by positive sales and traffic and an optimistic outlook among restaurant operators  the Restaurant Performance Index  RPI   which tracks the health of and outlook for the U S  restaurant industry  remained above 100 at 102 1 in November   the 21st consecutive month in which the RPI scored above 100 

This signifies expansion of key industry indicators  The Current Situation Index  which measures current trends in four industry indicators  same store sales  traffic  labor and capital expenditures   remained above 100 in November   marking the ninth consecutive month in which the index came above 100 Stocks That Outperformed McDonald s More or less all restaurateurs were affected by the fluctuations in the economy  but some of them managed to outperform owing to their strong fundamentals  Though fourth quarter results have not been announced yet  we have handpicked three stocks with almost the same menu as McDonald s but turned out to be better performers in terms of three quarter average revenue and earnings surprises  and year to date share price return  These stocks also hold a favorable Zacks Rank and therefore are expected to perform well going forward as well  Based in South Carolina  Dennys Corporation  NASDAQ DENN  offers a wide selection of lunch and dinner items including burgers  sandwiches  salads  along with an assortment of beverages  appetizers and desserts  This Zacks Rank  2  Buy  company is well known for its breakfast items  which are available round the clock 

The company s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the past three quarters and matched the same in one  It currently has a positive earnings surprise of 7 87   Revenues missed the consensus mark in one quarter but beat the same in two quarters  The company currently has a positive revenue surprise of 0 23   In 2014  share price of the company gained 43 4   much higher than McDonald s  Owing to its varied menu offerings and innovations  marketing and advertising and focus on brand protection and quality  the company has been able to post an impressive performance  Based in California  Jack In The Box Inc  NASDAQ JACK  restaurants offer a broad selection of distinctive products  which include hamburgers  tacos  specialty sandwiches  drinks  real ice cream shakes  salads and side items  Jack in the Box restaurants also offer guests the ability to customize their meals and to order any product  including breakfast items  any time of the day 

The Jack in the Box restaurant chain was the first major hamburger chain to develop and expand the concept of drive thru restaurants  Besides  most of its restaurants have seating capacities ranging from 20 to 100 and are open 18 24 hours a day  This Zacks Rank  2 company s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the past three quarters while missing the consensus mark in one  Revenues topped the estimates in all three quarters of the year  The company has an average positive earnings and revenue surprise of 4 67  and 0 96   respectively  Share price of the company gained 61 4  in 2014  Based in Ohio  The Wendy s Co  NASDAQ WEN  offers an extensive menu comprising hamburger sandwiches and chicken breast sandwiches  which are customized to suit the customer s choice of condiments  Wendy s menu also includes chicken nuggets  chili  French fries  baked potatoes  freshly prepared salads  soft drinks  Frosty desserts and kids  meals  In addition  the restaurants sell a variety of promotional products on a limited time basis  This Zacks Rank  3 company s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in one of the three quarters  it beat and remained in line in the other two quarters  On the revenue front  the company missed the consensus mark in one quarter while beating the estimate in the other two 

Currently  the company has a positive average earnings and revenue surprise of 9 63  and 1 46   respectively  much higher than McDonald s  In 2014  share price of this company gained 6   higher than McDonald s  The company s brand transformation initiatives like menu innovation  promotional offerings  re imaging of restaurants and bold new packaging are helping it to perform well Other Better Performing Restaurateurs There are some other restaurants that do not have similar offerings but have emerged better than McDonald s in 2014 owing to their own speciality and strong fundamentals  Fresher  healthier  and customized meals from upstart fast casual chains like Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc  NYSE CMG  are stealing the profits and therefore posing competition for burger giants like McDonald s 

Chipotle Mexican Grill currently has a positive earnings surprise of 5 07  and revenue surprise of 4 62   Cracker Barrel Old Country Store  NASDAQ CBRL   another food chain offering Sandwich Platters comprising Half Pound Hamburger and Grilled Chicken Tenderloin  Fancy Fixin s  Country Salads  Desserts  Beverage and Juices has posted three quarter earnings and revenue surprise of 4 91  and 1 06   respectively  Also  the company has a separate Kids Menu

9073,230588,DENN,Stop Using Indicators To Keep You Out Of The Market,opinion,"I know that there are many market professionals that have favorite indicators that they swear by  Some are proprietary and take into account many different measures  Some are public like Bollinger Bands   And many can be adjusted in many ways to gain an edge  But for the vast majority of you these are all worthless  And that is because most of you use these indicators to keep you on the sidelines in cash or to put you back there  Professionals do not use indicators that way 
I do not care if you use 1  2 or 10 indicators in your work  At some time  and for most of you a lot of the time  they are useless  It is just human nature to focus more on protecting a downside loss that on continuing a winner  That is perfectly fine with me  The more of you that are looking for reasons to leave the market the better I will feel about the market 

Let me set a scenario for you  Denny s  NASDAQ DENN  was a hot stock the last quarter of 2014  It moved out of a base from August to early October and rocketed higher nearly 50  by mid December  But then the RSI was overbought and starting to move lower  The MACD also made a double top and started rolling down  If you sold the stock based on these changes to indicators then you locked in probably over 40   Not bad 

But what if you ignored that divergence  Since the RSI and MACD started lower the price has actually made 5 higher lows and a 3 higher highs  more than 10  above the December top and pullback  Oh  and those indicators still are diverging  It actually looks like they finally be right  in predicting some consolidation at least 
Denny s is just a simple example but there are countless traders I see everyday that are pointing out their favorite indicator on the S P 500 as a reason why you should  take some off  now  I can only imagine that the group that started this process of buying and selling on indicators were market strategists or portfolio managers or some other function that does not actually get paid by the execution price in and out 
Using indicators to augment your process is perfectly fine  But you need to remember how that indicator was created  Some genius  I ll be nice and call them that   took the actual price activity and manipulated it a million different ways until they found a great fit to a back test of data  They may have actually played it forward and tweeked it a bit from there too  Doesn t that bother you  Do you want to make buy and sell decisions on the creation of a mathematical formula that used some set of price history to come up with a new number that may or may not mean something this time  What was wrong with just using the actual price you thought was a good stop from your original plan 
Now before you all jump down my throat  yes I do use indicators  But to confirm what I am seeing in price  or not  I do not trade off of an extreme indicator reading  I may trade off of an extreme price move and look at the indicator as confirming that idea  Look at price first  Nothing else matters to your account value

9075,230590,DENN,4 Stocks To Watch  DENN  TDOC  DDD  REX,opinion,"The stock market continues to be ugly  and despite the late rally on Monday  you can t trust it  So  for now  we ll look at both longs and shorts to see how they are doing 
Denny s Corporation  NASDAQ DENN   a stock we rarely talk about  is in a beautiful rising channel  going from a dollar in 2009 to Monday s high of 12 60  up 84 cents  or 7   on nearly 3 million shares  That s the highest level this stock has reached since we ve been following it in 1998  More importantly  the rising channel that has formed since 2009 looks like it can take this stock up to 20 00  So Denny s could be interesting  especially with Monday s breakout above multiple tops and finishing in a consolidation zone or basing pattern  Look for a mid channel test around the 13 1 2 14 range  and then perhaps 18 as the secondary  Good volume  Looking for follow through 
Teladoc  Inc   NYSE TDOC   a new IPO  is acting great  up 1 63 to 33 20  or 5   on 458 500 shares traded on Monday  It ran up  formed a long consolidation  and then broke out  and looks like it wants to take off and run  but it s hesitating or stalling  It may need a little bit better technicals  The daily chart shows TDOC as having reached new  all time highs on Monday  The new target is 36 
Stocks on the Short Side   
3D Systems Corporation  NYSE DDD  continues to fall away  having gone from 96 00 to 12 00  and it s through the bottom of the channel  down another 82 cents to 12 34  or 6   on 4 6 million shares  on Monday  and usually that s a sign of an ending move  At this point  it s hard to predict what is next  Hopefully  someone will step in  buy the company  and turn it around  It was a really good company a few years ago 
REX American Resources Corporation  NYSE REX  continues its descent on Monday  down another 1 21 to 50 43  or 2 34   on 214 750 shares traded  It has a big move with wave one and two  and looks to be calling for a move to 38 39

9076,230591,DENN,Burger Joint Beats And Still Shows Upside,opinion,"America loves breakfast  especially all day breakfast  So maybe it was not a surprise that after reporting earnings Monday night  Denny s  NASDAQ DENN  stock bounced more than 7  on Tuesday  If you were holding it into earnings  congratulations  But after the long path lower and meek bounce    followed by a long consolidation    it s not very likely you were involved  Does the stock have more upside  It looks like it does 
The chart below shows the price action since making a top last August  It found support through January and February and moved higher  Then  two months of consolidation led up to earnings  The break of consolidation following earnings brought the price to the falling trend resistance going back to September  That may give many pause before buying 

But it also pushed the price over the 200 day SMA for the first time since October  The momentum indicators are bullish too  with the RSI bouncing off of the lower end of the bullish zone and the MACD crossing up  The Bollinger Bands  are opening to the upside too  And the Measured Move out of the consolidation looks for 11 50 
There s still the potential to hit a grand slam in this stock  Protect against the 200 day SMA and  if conservative  wait for a move over resistance to start swinging ",2016-05-03,Gregory W. Harmon,https://www.investing.com/analysis/burger-joint-beats-and-still-shows-upside-200127685,200127685

9086,230601,DENN,2 Delicious Restaurant Choices,opinion,"Following the economic sluggishness this past winter  the economy is now gaining momentum  This has been reflected in a series of reports  one of which has revealed that the manufacturing sector had expanded in April at the quickest pace since end last year  Monday s data on the services sector also reflected an upbeat trend  indicating that growth was occurring across sectors 
Services Sector Expands 
The ISM non manufacturing index increased to 55 2 in April from 53 1 in March  This is the highest level for the index since the month of August  The new orders index increased 4 8 points to 58 2   14 of the 18 industries covered by the report expanded last month 
These industries include construction  retailers and restaurants  Data from the report indicates that the economy is on the verge of recovering from a weak first quarter  Lack of growth during that period has been attributed to a long and arduous winter season 
Meanwhile  the employment rate has declined to 6 3  according government data released on Friday  beating most expectations  288 000 jobs have been added in April  creating further optimism about the economy 
Restaurant Performance Index Surges
Coming to the restaurant sector in particular  recently released data suggests that restaurant performance has increased significantly  As per data from the National Restaurant Association  its Restaurant Performance Index increased to its highest level in 10 months during the month of March 
The index increased from 100 5 in February to 101 4 in March  This is the 13th consecutive month that the index has remained above 100  which signals growth in all key industry indicators  More significantly  55  of restaurant operators have experienced a higher level of same store sales from March 2013 to March 2014 
46  of restaurant operators experienced higher customer traffic during the same period  Additionally  operators are more optimistic about an increase in sales in the future  49  believe that sales will increase in a six month period compared to 40  in the month of February  This is the highest level witnessed over the last two years 
An expansion in the service sector as a whole and a growth in industry specific indicators imply that the restaurant sector makes for a good investment choice  Below we present two restaurant stocks which possess the potential to grow appreciably  each of which also has a good Zacks rank

9087,230602,DENN,Danger Zone  Bob Evans Farms,opinion,"Why We Believe Bob Evans Farms is Ready to Fall Off a Cliff
Bob Evans Farms  NASDAQ BOBE  is in the Danger Zone this week  The Ohio based company has two segments  restaurants  72  of revenue  and BEF  packaged  Foods  28  of revenue   Bob Evans  profits and revenue have been in decline since 2010  and management s 2012 turnaround plan has been unsuccessful  The company is running out of cash while facing more and more competition  including direct competition from the Cracker Barrel  NASDAQ CBRL  chain and the rising popularity of fast casual restaurants such as Dunkin Donuts   NASDAQ DNKN   Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX   and Panera  NASDAQ PNRA  
Companies in trouble have symptoms  To interpret the symptoms you first must know what they are  The outline that follows will provide a starting point 
Symptom  1  Profitability Trending in the Wrong Direction
Restaurant sales have declined by 5  since 2010 while BEF Foods sales have increased by 18  
Bob Evans  operating profit  NOPAT  has also been in decline since 2010  Excluding Mimi s Cafe  which was sold in 2013  we see that the company s NOPAT fell by approximately 20  compounded annually between 2010 2014  Bob Evans  return on invested capital  ROIC  fell from 8  to under 4  over this time frame 
Symptom  2  Little Cash  Lots of Debt and Write Downs
Bob Evans is running out of resources to fund its dividend and turnaround efforts  The company has under  4 million in cash and  463 million in debt  almost half of its total assets 
Most investors probably do not know that the current turnaround efforts are doing more damage than good  Figure 1 shows accumulated asset write downs accelerating concurrent with an acceleration in revenue decline  Write downs  at this level  unequivocally signal that management is failing investors  With total asset write downs of  198 million  Bob Evans has written down 42 cents for every dollar on its balance sheet  These write downs  which began to climb in 2009  consist mostly of closing restaurants and goodwill impairment 
Figure 1   Bad Trends for Investors
 Sources    New Constructs  LLC and company filings 
Between 2012 and 2014  Bob Evans  spent  225 000 per store on a chain wide remodeling initiative in an attempt to reverse this revenue decline  Nevertheless  same store sales have continued to fall  In fiscal 1Q15  with the remodeling initiative completed  same store sales declined 2  year over year  Even more concerning is that the restaurants that finished remodeling in 2012 saw their same store sales decline 3  year over year in 3Q14 
Symptom  3  Last Place in Two Competitive industries
In its restaurant segment  Bob Evans competes mainly with Cracker Barrel  CBRL   Denny s  NASDAQ DENN  and DineEquity  NYSE DIN   which owns Applebee s and IHOP restaurants  Bob Evans  packaged foods business  which sells primarily sausage and frozen breakfast products  competes with companies like Tyson Foods  NYSE TSN  
Figure 2 shows that Bob Evans lags all of its competitors in terms of ROIC and NOPAT margin  With its  1 billion market cap Bob Evans is also the second smallest company on this list  bigger only than Denny s  Note the presence of Bob Evans  three fast casual competitors near the top of the list for both ROIC and NOPAT margins 
Figure 2   Lagging in Terms of Profitability

Sources    New Constructs  LLC and company filings 
The casual dining industry at large faces strong headwinds  Cracker Barrel has seen its profits grow by just 4  compounded annually since 2010  and same store sales slipped by almost 1  in the most recent quarter  Other competitors have not been so lucky  since 2009  DineEquity has seen its profits decline by 11  compounded annually  and Denny s profits have declined by 10  compounded annually over the same period 
Consumers are increasingly taking their business to fast casual restaurants such as Starbucks  SBUX  and Panera  PNRA   The fast casual industry saw aggregate sales  
The one bright spot is Bob Evans  BEF Foods segment  which has seen solid sales increases year over year  Bob Evans has around a   behind only Hillshire s 28   However  BEF Foods accounts for just 18  of Bob Evans  profits and its yearly gains have been offset by the restaurant segment s sustained decline 
Symptom  4  Turmoil in the Boardroom
BOBE has been in the news this year as a result of increasing activist investor activity  Hedge fund manager  has stated that Bob Evans  longstanding Board of Directors has become complacent and is responsible for the company s weak results 
Sandell recently  on the company s 12 member board  which gives his fund some leverage to enact its proposed changes  These changes include spinning off or selling the BEF foods segment and selling some of Bob Evans  company property and real estate 
Sandell alleges the spin off and real estate sales could generate up to  1 1 billion  He plans to use around 75  of these proceeds for a share repurchase program  Sandell s plan looks good on paper  but it faces an uphill battle  The remaining eight entrenched Bob Evans board members are extremely reluctant to sell the BEF Foods division as they have invested over  100 million in the segment over the past two years 
Darden Restaurants  NYSE DRI   which has also been battling activist investors since last December  is a mirror image of the case of Bob Evans  Unfortunately  the image is not pretty  The activists in DRI proposed similar spin off and real estate sale plans for the business as Sandell has for BOBE  Darden sold its Red Lobster business for  2 1 billion in March and is using the cash to pay off around 40  of its debt and implement a share repurchase plan of  500 million  These efforts have not distracted investors from Darden s declining same store sales  and the stock is down 7  since March  As seen in Figure 2  Bob Evans is already in worse operating condition than Darden  which makes it less likely to recover from its unprofitable ways 
Symptom  5  Stock Worth Versus Stock Price Creates Out of Touch Valuation
Despite Bob Evans  struggles and the casual dining industry s steady decline  the company is tremendously overvalued  BOBE s current price of   43 share implies that the company will grow NOPAT by  
This stock is so overvalued that even in the best case scenario for Sandell  it is still dangerous  Let us assume that Sandell sells both BOBE s real estate and BEF Foods  and that he gets the total  1 1 billion he estimates for both  which equates  47 per share 
We think it is na ve to expect Sandell to use more than half of the cash for share repurchases because Bob Evans has substantial debt and other senior liabilities of over  536 million or about  23 share  Spending all the proceeds on share repurchases would raise alarms with all stakeholders  especially bondholders  considering the company is free cash flow negative 
Let s assume Sandell is able to spend  564 million or  24 share on buying back stock  In which case  we need only to measure the expectations implied in  19 per share  current price  43 share minus  24 share  
To justify  19 share  BOBE must grow its profits by   This expectation seems awfully optimistic for a restaurant chain with steadily declining sales  If we assume a 9  compounded annual NOPAT growth rate for 9 years  the stock is   a 39  downside from  18  This situation is lose lose  Sandell cannot save shareholders 
Gridlock and hostility in the boardroom are likely to block Sandell s plan and any other major efforts to overhaul the company s declining restaurant business  Consequently  the decline in restaurant sales could accelerate  We ve seen this play out before with JC Penney  JCP   which saw its sales slide to 1987 levels after Bill Ackman s turnaround efforts clashed with an unfriendly boardroom 
The BEF Foods segment could also fail to grow as anticipated owing to competitive pressure from recently consolidated food giants Tyson and Hillshire 
In the short term  Bob Evans is experiencing too much upheaval to be a reliable bet  In the long term  BOBE is highly overvalued  especially for a company in a slow to no growth industry  With such formidable competition and such a poor history of capital allocation decisions  investors would be wise to stay away from this company in the middle of a  turnaround  
Symptom  6  Insiders Are Dumping Their Shares
Over the past 6 months  insiders have sold a net of 156 987 shares  or 18  of their shares  Only 811 shares were purchased by insiders over this timeframe  Insiders do not seem confident about the company s future

9168,230683,DENN,Cheesecake Factory s Sales Initiatives Impress  Costs High,opinion,"The Cheesecake Factory Inc    NASDAQ CAKE   has been undertaking prudent strategies to improve its performance  The company s strong sales building initiatives like extensive employment of digital and social media campaigns to showcase its high quality ingredients and preparation techniques  as well as focus on menu innovation are significantly contributing to its topline 
However  high costs are denting profitability of the company  In the   the company s earnings fell short of analysts  expectation while revenues surpassed the same  Earnings declined 22 2  year over year  Higher than expected insurance costs along with some legal settlement expenses have particularly dented the company s earnings in the quarter 
Also  the company s shares have declined 10 7  in the past year  comparing unfavorably with the  s gain of 4 2  in the same time period  Moreover  downward earnings estimate revisions raise questions over the stock s upside potential  Estimates for 2018 have gone down 1 5  over the past month 
Sales Building Initiatives Bode Well
Cheesecake Factory is committed to boost its sales for surviving in the competitive environment  The company has been investing heavily to improve guest experience  This is turn started stabilizing the company s sales trend starting from the fourth quarter of 2017  In the first quarter of 2018  total revenues grew 4 8  year over year on the back of increased comparable sales 
In order to boost comps  the company is focusing on improving its speed of service and training its servers so that they render a higher level of service  In addition to labor productivity  the company is majorly focusing on menu innovation and food efficiency 
Cheesecake Factory is preparing 50 menus under its Super Foods program  fresh from scratch in the restaurants  to increase consumer awareness of the brand  To this end  Cheesecake factory is leveraging its brand power through the launch of products in the CPG channel 
The company launched its brown bread in grocery stores in the Southeast with nationwide distribution capabilities  Going forward  the company intends to carry on with menu innovation by adding new Super Food items as well as the famous indulgences of The Cheesecake Factory 
Meanwhile  Cheesecake Factory s technology enabled initiatives have been doing well  with positive feedback for its mobile payment app  CakePay  The company is also witnessing incremental sales from its delivery service that continues to roll out nationwide  Presently  about 95  of the Cheesecake Factory restaurants offer third party delivery 
The company continues to improve its to go business including online ordering capability  which could be in pilot by the end of the year  This is anticipated to be a major contributor to the growth of the company s strong off premise sales channels  In 2017  the company s takeout business increased to 12  of the sales 
Efforts to Return Shareholders  Value Seem Encouraging
Cheesecake Factory continuously returns wealth to its shareholders via dividends and share repurchases  The company returned  175 million in cash via share buybacks and dividends in 2017  In the first quarter of 2018  management declared a quarterly cash dividend of 29 cents per share on the company s common stock 
The dividend is payable on May 22  2018 to its shareholders of record at the close of business on May 10  2018  Also  during the quarter  Cheesecake Factory repurchased approximately 0 7 million shares of its common stock at a cost of  34 9 million 
Rising Costs to Keep Profits Under Pressure
Of late  Cheesecake Factory s profits have been under pressure owing to a rising wage rate scenario  Moreover  the pre opening cost of outlets  given the company s unit expansion plans and expenses related to sales initiatives are adding to its costs  and likely to hurt profits  going forward 
In the first quarter of 2018  cost of sales ratio increased 10 basis points  bps  year over year to 23   Meanwhile  the labor expense ratio was 35 7   up 1300 bps from the year ago quarter  This was primarily driven by higher hourly labor  including more wages  overtime and training costs 
General and administrative expenses accounted for 6 6  of the revenues in first quarter 2018  up 20 bps from the prior year quarter due to higher marketing costs  repairs and maintenance  and additional workers  comp insurance costs  Notably  pre opening expenses were 0 2  of the total revenues  down 10 bps from the year ago quarter 
Heading into 2018  the company expects food inflation of more than 3   particularly across poultry  dairy  bread and seafood  Wage inflation is anticipated to be about 5  in 2018 
Zacks Rank   Stocks to Consider
Cheesecake Factory carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  
Some better ranked stocks in the U S  restaurant space include Wingstop   NASDAQ WING    Denny s   NASDAQ DENN   and Dine Brands   NYSE DIN    While Wingstop sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   Denny s and Dine Brands carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see

locations on the Grubhub marketplace  For Taco Bell  delivery exists in over 4 000 restaurants Refranchising   Efficiency Initiatives Boost Earnings YUM  Brands has adopted a de risking strategy by reducing its ownership of restaurants through refranchising  In fact  the China division s spin off has largely made the company more asset light  In the first quarter of 2019  YUM  Brands opened 310 net new units  reflecting net new unit growth of 7   We note that refranchising large portion of the system reduces the company s capital requirements and facilitates earnings per share growth and ROE expansion  Moreover  free cash flow will continue to grow  facilitating reinvestments to increase brand recognition and shareholder return  Remarkably  this shift to refranchising has substantially benefited the company s operating margin over the years  Consequently  YUM  Brands expects to become a  pure play  franchisor with more stable earnings  higher profit margins  lower capital requirements and stronger cash flow conversion Meanwhile  YUM  Brands  aims to revamp its financial profile which in turn will improve organizational efficiency and cost structure globally  It believes that a  slimmer Yum Brands  would lead to efficiency gains  Management expects to cut capex to about  100 million by 2019  increase free cash flow conversion to 100   and reduce General and Administrative  G A  expenditure by approximately  300 million  or 1 7  of system sales   Additionally  the company aims to maintain an optimized capital structure  with leverage of five times EBITDA  Over the next three years  it is committed to returning additional  6 5  7 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends  Resultantly  the company expects EPS of at least  3 75 in 2019  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in 2019 is pegged at  3 81  suggesting growth of 20 2  from 2018 ConcernsYUM  Brands  revenues in the first quarter of 2019 were down 9  year over year owing to sales slump on account of persistent refranchising initiatives  The de risking strategy of the company to reduce the ownership of restaurants by expanding franchise is expected to negatively impact revenues in the near term but will bolster earnings in the long term The company has also been facing declining revenues at its Pizza Hut division  Decline in net new unit growth and low system sales have been affecting comps as well  Further franchising has been weighing on the division s near term revenues  In the first quarter of 2019  Pizza Hut s revenues amounted to  243 million  down 3

9203,230718,DENN,Top 5 Things To Know In The Market On Monday,news,"Investing com   Here are the top five things you need to know in financial markets on Monday  July 30 
1  Dollar Dips At Start Of Busy Week For Central Banks  Data
The U S  dollar was a shade lower against its peers  as market participants awaited key central bank meetings this week that could set the near term course for currencies 
Central banks in focus include the Bank of Japan  which ends a two day meeting on Tuesday  and the Federal Reserve  which concludes its policy meeting on Wednesday  The Bank of England also makes a policy decision on Thursday 
There s also a gusher of economic reports in the coming week  as the calendar rolls to August from July  with data on U S  inflation and payrolls in the spotlight 
The U S  dollar index  which measures the greenback s strength against a basket of six major currencies  was down 0 15  at 94 34  after dipping slightly on Friday  when upbeat second quarter U S  gross domestic product data failed to lift the greenback  as markets had mostly priced in strong figures 
Elsewhere  in the bond market  U S  Treasury prices edged lower  pushing yields higher across the curve  with the benchmark 10 year yield ticking up to around 2 98   while the Fed sensitive 2 year note was near a two decade high of 2 68  
2  Another Big Week Of Earnings Kicks Off 
More than 140 companies listed on the S P 500 are set to report corporate results in what will be the last big week of the second quarter earnings season 
Monday sees  Caterpillar   NYSE CAT   Loews  NYSE L   Bloomin  Brands  NASDAQ BLMN   Booz Allen Hamilton  NYSE BAH    Diamond Offshore   NYSE DO   and Seagate Technology  NASDAQ STX  report ahead of the opening bell 
AK Steel  NYSE AKS   Denny s  NASDAQ DENN   Rent A Center  NASDAQ RCII   Transocean  NYSE RIG   Illumina  NASDAQ ILMN   and KLA Tencor  NASDAQ KLAC  are due after the bell 
But Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  will get the most attention when it reports Tuesday after hours  The iPhone maker s results will be closely watched after disappointing forecasts from Facebook  NASDAQ FB  and Twitter  NYSE TWTR  last week shook investor belief in tech resilience 
Some of other high profile tech names reporting this week are Procter   Gamble  NYSE PG    Pfizer   NYSE PFE   Baidu  NASDAQ BIDU   Sprint  NYSE S   Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA   Square  NYSE SQ   Wynn Resorts  NASDAQ WYNN   CBS  NYSE CBS   Teva Pharma  NYSE TEVA   DowDuPont  NYSE DWDP   Shake Shack  NYSE SHAK   Kraft Heinz  NASDAQ KHC   and Warren Buffet s Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa  




3  U S  Stock Futures Point To Lower Open 
U S  stock futures looked set to kick off the week on a downbeat note  with the major indices on track to open with modest losses  as investors focused on the latest batch of corporate earnings 
At 5 10AM ET  the tech heavy Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a loss of 7 points  or about 0 1   at the open  The blue chip Dow futures and S P 500 futures also indicated a slightly lower start to their respective trading sessions 
Wall Street fell on Friday  as disappointing results from Intel  NASDAQ INTC  and Twitter soured the mood on the Nasdaq 
Elsewhere  in Europe  most of the region s major bourses traded lower  with almost every sector in the red  Earlier  Asian stocks closed in negative territory  as markets took cues from declines in Wall Street s last session 
4  Oil Prices Edge Higher
In commodity markets  oil prices edged higher  with U S  benchmark WTI outperforming thanks to recent upbeat news on the U S  economy  but gains were limited as the fallout from trade tensions weighed on markets 
U S  crude jumped 81 cents  or 1 2   to  69 50 a barrel  while Brent  the global benchmark  tacked on 45 cents  or 0 6   to  75 21 
The U S  economy grew at its fastest pace in nearly four years in the second quarter  but trade tensions remain high between Washington and Beijing despite an easing between the U S  and the European Union 
5  Trump Threatens Government Shutdown
U S  President Donald Trump called on Congress to enact sweeping immigration reform  including a border wall  and threatened a federal government shutdown if Democrats refused to back his proposals 
In a series of early Sunday morning posts on Twitter  the president lambasted Congress over immigration reform  He then threatened to shut down the government if Congress didn t move U S  laws  based on MERIT  



Trump has threatened a shutdown several times since taking office in a bid to get immigration priorities in congressional spending bills  especially funding for a wall along the southern U S  border  Trump has asked for  25 billion to build the wall

9210,230725,DENN,5 Top Ranked Stocks To Bet Big On Rising P E Investing,opinion,"Generally  investors are in search of stocks with a low price to earnings  P E  ratio  The idea is that the lower the P E  the higher will be the value of the stock  It means a stock s current market price is not priced in yet  and has room left to run owing to its higher earnings potential  This clearly justifies investors  inclination toward low P E stocks 
But stocks with a rising P E are also worth a bet  We ll tell you why 
Why Rising P E a Valuable Tool 
Investors should note that stock price moves in tandem with earnings performance  If earnings come in stronger  the price of a stock shoots up  Solid quarterly earnings and the forward guidance boost earnings forecasts  leading to stronger demand for the stock and a rise in price 
So  if the price is rising steadily  it means that investors are assured of the stock s fundamental strength and expect some strong positives out of it  Also  studies have revealed that stocks have seen their P E ratios jump more than 100  from their breakout point in the cycle  So  if you can pick stocks early in their breakout cycle  you can end up seeing considerable gains 
The Winning Strategy
In order to shortlist stocks that are exhibiting an increasing P E  we chose the following as our primary screening parameters 
EPS growth estimate for the current year is greater than or equal to last year s actual growth
Percentage change in last year EPS should be greater than or equal to the previous year
 These two criteria point to a positive or flat earnings growth trend over the years  
Percentage change in price over four weeks greater than percentage change in price over 12 weeks
Percentage change in price over 12 weeks greater than percentage change in price over 24 weeks
 These two criteria show that price of the stock is increasing consistently over the said timeframes  
Percentage price change for four weeks relative to the S P 500 greater than percentage price change for 12 weeks relative to the S P 500
Percentage price change for 12 weeks relative to the S P 500 greater than percentage price change for 24 weeks relative to the S P 500
 Here the case for consistent price gains gets even stronger as it displays percentage price changes relative to the S P 500  
Percentage price change for 12 weeks is 20  higher than or equal to percentage price change for 24 weeks  but it should not exceed 100 
 This criterion indicates that a 20  increase in the price of a stock from the breakout point gives cues of an impending uptrend  But a jump of over 100  indicates that there is limited scope for further upside and the stock might be due for a reversal  
In addition  we place a few other criteria that lead us to some likely outperformers 
Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Only companies with a Strong Buy or Buy rating can get through 
Average 20 day Volume greater than or equal to 50 000  High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity 
Just these few criteria narrowed down the universe from over 7 700 stocks to just 18 
Here are five of the 18 that passed the screen 
Denny s Corporation   NASDAQ DENN    It is one of the largest restaurant companies  operating moderately priced restaurants  Denny s  Hardee s  Quincy s  El Pollo Loco  Coco s and Carrows  It has a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  It belongs to a favorable Zacks industry  placed at the top 40  of 250  industries   You can see

30257,251772,DENN,Beat Market Volatility With These 5 Low Beta Stocks,opinion,It is widely believed that taking risks prove beneficial in the world of equity investment  However  risky stocks deliver solid returns only in bullish market conditions  Thus  it would be ideal to invest in low beta stocks as they are less correlated to the market and thus have the potential to deliver impressive returns What is Beta Beta measures the volatility or risk of a particular asset in comparison to the market  In other words  beta measures the extent of a security s price movement relative to the market  In this article  we are considering the S P 500 as the market If a stock has beta of 1 then the price of the stock will move with the market  So the stock is more volatile than the market if its beta is more than 1  In the same way  the stock is not as volatile as the market if its beta is less than 1 For example  if the market offers a return of 20   a stock with beta of 3 will return 60   which is overwhelming  Similarly  when the market slips 20  the stock will sink 60   which is devastating Screening Criteria We have taken beta between 0 and 0 6 as our prime criterion for screening stocks that are less volatile than the market  But this should not be the only factor to be considered while selecting a winning strategy  We need to take into account other parameters that can add value to the portfolio Percentage Change in Price in the Last 4 Weeks greater than zero  This ensures that the stocks saw positive price movement over the last one month Average 20 Day Volume greater than 50 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stocks are easily tradable Price greater than or equal to  5  They must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher Zacks Rank equal to 1  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stocks indicate that they will significantly outperform the broader U S  equity market over the next one to three months  You can see  Here are five of the 14 stocks that fit the bill Headquartered in St  Louis  MO Post Holdings Inc    NYSE POST   manufactures ready to eat cereals  The company s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters  the average positive beat being 12 54   In fiscal year 2020 and 2021  the stock is likely to see earnings growth of 4 5  and 14 6   respectively Arcosa Inc    NYSE ACA    headquartered in Dallas  TX  is primarily involved in providing infrastructure related products  The company is expected to have seen earnings growth of 25 3  in 2019  In 2020  the stock is likely to witness earnings growth of 14 5  Headquartered in Oak Brook  IL  Great Lakes Dredge   Dock Corporation   NASDAQ GLDD   is primarily engaged in providing services related to dredging  The company is expected to have recorded earnings growth of 358 8  in 2019  In 2020  the stock is likely to see earnings growth of 10 3  Denny s Corporation   NASDAQ DENN    headquartered in Spartanburg  SC  is primarily involved in operating full service restaurant chains  In 2020  the stock is likely to see earnings growth of 18 1  Headquartered in Dallas  TX  Match Group  Inc    NASDAQ MTCH   is mainly involved in providing dating products  The company is expected to have seen earnings growth of 38 2  in 2019  The same for 2020 is estimated to be 3 1  You can get the rest of the stocks on this list by signing up now for your 2 week free trial to the Research Wizard and start using this screen in your own trading  Further  you can also create your own strategies and test them first before taking the investment plunge The Research Wizard is a great place to begin  It s easy to use  Everything is in plain language  And it s very intuitive  Start your Research Wizard trial today  And the next time you read an economic report  open up the Research Wizard  plug your finds in  and see what gems come out  Disclosure  Officers  directors and or employees of Zacks Investment Research may own or have sold short securities and or hold long and or short positions in options that are mentioned in this material  An affiliated investment advisory firm may own or have sold short securities and or hold long and or short positions in options that are mentioned in this material Disclosure  Performance information for Zacks  portfolios and strategies are available at   ,2020-01-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/beat-market-volatility-with-these-5-lowbeta-stocks-200501424,200501424

106852,328367,DENN,Why Denny s is Giving Away Burgers From Beyond Meat,news,"Stock market darling Beyond Meat  NASDAQ BYND  can add a new nationwide menu rollout to its list of accomplishments  On January 30  Denny s  NASDAQ DENN  will launch its Beyond Burger at all 1 700 Denny s locations  To celebrate  the company is advertising a free burger with the purchase of a drink while supplies last 
Beyond Meat has enjoyed several new restaurant partnership over the past year  so this rollout may not seem that newsworthy  But there s something worth highlighting here 

Fad or forever 
When Denny s reported third quarter 2019 earnings  it highlighted year over year comparable restaurant sales growth of 1 1  and EPS growth of 4 7   But in the question and answer session  analysts asked about Beyond Meat  which was excluded from management s prepared remarks  In October 2019  Denny s launched the Beyond Burger in the Los Angeles market  and was preparing to bring it to all locations this year 
In response to the questioning  Beyond Meat  Denny s CEO John Miller said   I m usually pretty good at predicting fads and trends  But this one we ll wait and see   Despite years of experience in the restaurant industry  Miller still seems unsure how to gauge long term prospects of plant based meats  
When Denny s gives away its Beyond Burgers  the offer is for dine in only  Perhaps Denny s will be observing and engaging diners  to better answer the fad question and know whether this is a menu item worth keeping  For Denny s  understanding consumer demand is crucial to continuing its comps growth streak  The company has grown comps for eight consecutive years  including the first three quarters of 2019 
Healthy skepticism and optimism
Plant based meats are still a novel concept for many consumers  So it s not a bad idea to take a skeptically optimistic approach to the category  and to Beyond Meat   like Denny s CEO has  
There s at least some evidence that plant based meats are a little faddish at the moment  Carrols Restaurant Group  a Burger King franchisee  already reported preliminary fourth quarter 2019 results  in which Burger King comps growth slowed as the Impossible Whopper s novelty wore off  The Impossible Whopper is a plant based burger made by Beyond Meat competitor Impossible Foods 
The same thing happened with the Beyond Meat menu items at Del Taco  As Del Taco stopped promoting those items  sales declined accordingly  Ideally  demand would increase with time  not decline 

That said  Beyond Meat has added many new restaurant partners over the past year  Denny s joins Del Taco  Dunkin  Brands  and Carl s Jr  Hardee s  which have all added Beyond Meat menu items in the last 12 months  Each of these partners started with a small initial test  but saw enough to warrant a company wide launch  As long as Beyond Meat keeps converting temporary tests into permanent menu items  there s reason for optimism 
For now   
Both Denny s and Beyond Meat have yet to report fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings  but both should do so in coming weeks  For Denny s  look for a report on the completion of its refranchising strategy  This is taking the company from 90  franchised to up to 97  franchised  demanding a lot of attention in 2019  Now complete  it can turn its attention to other ways to grow shareholder value  Management mentioned it s considering a dividend  and I think it should  But if it doesn t offer one  listen to why management feels that cash is better used elsewhere 
In my opinion  Beyond Meat shareholders need to watch more than just the company s results  Since it records revenue at the moment it ships its products to restaurant and grocery partners  revenue growth in isolation isn t a great measuring stick for the company  It records a huge one time revenue gain when it supplies the product for these nationwide menu rollouts  Therefore  monitoring how the product is selling through at restaurants like Denny s and Dunkin  will paint a clearer picture of Beyond Meat s revenue as it moves from one time initial supply to the recurring restocking of these restaurant partners 
When Beyond Meat reports earnings  rather than fixate on revenue growth  I would watch the company s profit margin  If it s becoming more profitable with scale  that would be a great sign for investors  Conversely  if it s not  investors would need to dig deeper to find out why ",2020-01-29,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pod53,2070381

are highlights from Wednesday s Analyst Blog  5 Stocks to Take Advantage of Strong Consumer ConfidenceConfidence of Americans in the country s economy jumped in January buoyed by a strong labor market with historically low unemployment  growing wages and an impressive performance by Wall Street in 2019 Strong consumer confidence confirms U S  economic stability and clearly indicates that the expansionary phase  which is currently at the historically longest 11 5 years  is here to stay Robust Consumer Confidence in JanuaryOn Jan 28  the conference board reported that its consumer confidence index for the month of January came in at 131 6  the highest since August 2019  The metric exceeded the consensus estimate of 128 8  Notably  December s index was also revised upward to 128 2 from 126 5 reported earlier  This clearly highlighted firmness in the U S  economy The Present Situation Index  which gauges consumers  views on current market conditions  climbed from 170 5 in December  to 175 3  Moreover  the Expectations Index  which is a measure of consumers  short term  for the next six months  outlook for income  business and labor market conditions  increased to 102 5 from 100 in December Americans who said jobs were plentiful rose to 49  from 46 5   The percentage that said jobs were hard to find fell to 11 6  from 13   Americans claiming business conditions are  good  increased from 39 0  to 40 8   while those claiming business conditions are  bad  decreased from 11 0  to 10 4  Notably  a similar type of study known as consumer sentiment conducted by the University of Michigan reported that the preliminary index for January came in at 99 1  slightly below December s reading of 99 3  However  January s preliminary metric was the second highest in the last eight months   The U S  GDP growth rate did not fall below 2  in the first three quarters of 2019  buoyed by strong consumer spending  which constitutes more than 70  of the economy  Additionally  a solid labor market and gradual wage growth offset the drop in business spending and manufacturing activities  generating 12  of U S  GDP Future CatalystsThe recently signed phase one trade deal between the United States and China has significantly cooled down the nearly two year old tariff war  Although a complete deal is not likely to be signed before the U S  presidential election this November  the interim deal will at least help in restoring U S  business confidence and global economic growth Moreover  Fed s timey intervention with a 75 basis point rate cut in 2019 boosted the economy and raised investors  confidence  The Fed chair has reiterated his commitment to do whatever needed to support economic expansion and not raise interest rate until the inflation rate  which is currently at just 1 6   crosses the Fed s target level of 2     Our Top PicksAt this stage  it will be better to invest in consumer centric stocks with strong growth potential  We narrowed down our

are Denny s Corporation   NASDAQ DENN    Garmin Ltd    NASDAQ GRMN    LPL Financial Holdings Inc    NASDAQ LPLA   and Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS   4 Momentum Picks Screened on Driehaus StrategyRichard Herman Driehaus  a renowned American businessman and fund manager  created an investment approach using the buy high and sell higher theory  This strategy is perfect for investors who have the propensity to take high levels of risk  Using this particular strategy  investors can buy momentum stocks  The eventual success of this investment strategy helped Driehaus earn a place in Barron s All Century Team The American Association of Individual Investors  AAII  proved that the strategy has the potential to offer high returns  Its portfolio  which was developed following the strategy  has returned 13 5  and 18 1  in the five and 10 year time frames  respectively  compared with  1 1  and 4 2  returns registered by the S P 500  Thus  investors with a high risk appetite might give the Driehaus strategy a thought to boost returns A Brief Note on Driehaus  StrategyRegarding the strategy  Driehaus once said   I would much rather invest in a stock that s increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that s already in a decline and try to guess when it will turn around   In keeping with his insight  AAII took into account the percentage 50 day moving average as one of the key criteria before designing a portfolio It is calculated by dividing the numerator  month end price minus 50 day moving average of month end price  by the 50 day moving average of the month end price  Another momentum indicator   positive relative strength   has also been included  A positive percentage 50 day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50 day moving average level  indicating an uptrend Moreover  AAII found that Driehaus primarily focused on strong earnings growth rates and impressive earnings projections to pick potential outperformers  Companies with a strong history of beating estimates are also given importance in this strategy  which was made to provide better returns over the long term For the
