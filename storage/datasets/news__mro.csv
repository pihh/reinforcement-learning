217104,438620,MRO,Go West  Nigerian oil skirts U S  shale boom in journey to California,news,"By Noah Browning and Libby George
LONDON LAGOS  Reuters    Nigeria s oil  displaced by U S  shale  has found an unlikely new outlet this year  the coast of the continental United States that is farthest from the African country s shores 
The shale boom has upended the global market  turning the United States from a keen buyer of Nigerian oil to an aggressive competitor 
But no pipelines easily connect the shale hub at the Permian basin  located in Texas and New Mexico  to the West Coast  driving the latter to look to Nigeria to quench its thirst for crude 
Early this year  Californian refineries began loading up on Nigerian oil   taking cargoes of Qua Iboe  Bonga  Erha  Forcados and others  according to traders and Refinitiv Eikon data 
 Graphic  Nigerian oil to U S  West Coast   
The more than 6 million barrels that the U S  West Coast imported from Nigeria between April and August this year was almost four times higher than the amount for all of 2018 
The route is relatively rare for cargoes that must weather the 20 000 km  12 500 mile   40 day journey from Nigeria s lush coasts  around South America s Tierra del Fuego and up to Los Angeles 
 Graphic  Routes of selected West African oil cargoes discharging in California   
 Marathon Oil   NYSE MRO  at its Long Beach refinery has been the most consistent buyer  with another very large crude carrier  VLCC  full of Forcados oil departing Nigeria on Thursday 
Traders said a combination of market factors   including the difficulty and expense of getting U S  crude oil to the West Coast   made Nigerian grades attractive 
 It makes more cost sense  Even if U S  crude is closer on the map  when you factor in the price and availability of taking in barrels from Louisiana or Nigeria  Nigeria came out cheaper   one seller of West African oil said 
The purchases are a rare glimmer of hope this year for Nigerian oil  which now competes with U S  shale for buyers  including in its top outlet  India 
The United States had historically been a heavy importer of crude oil  but shale production  coupled with the lifting of a four decade export ban  transformed it into a net exporter of oil and fuels by late last year 
 Graphic  U S  Imports from Nigeria of Crude Oil   
Barrels from this U S  oil bonanza sailing to domestic shores face added costs  however  due to a century old law called the Jones Act  which mandates that only U S  flagged vessels can transport it 
The restriction often makes freight within the United States more costly than much longer journeys 
But traders warn the surprise opening of the West Africa West Coast export window  or arb  could be short lived due to the timescales and distance involved 
 The arb may be already shutting  The price factors which made a cargo exporting today look like a good deal would have been happening over a month ago when the deal was made   a major buyer of West African oil said 
 They won t be the same today and certainly won t be the same over a month from now when the cargo arrives  
The need to refine oil into low sulphur shipping fuels in time for stricter environmental rules on Jan  1 may also have lured those cargoes  as West Africa is home to the kinds of crude most suited to such products  This boon could be fleeting too 
 The honeymoon will be over in a year from now   said Ehsan Ul Haq  lead analyst with Refinitiv 
 At present  all refiners are desperate to produce marine gasoil or very low sulphur fuel oil  Once the market reaches equilibrium     there will be less interest  ",2019-09-09,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/go-west-nigerian-oil-skirts-us-shale-boom-in-journey-to-california-1973463,1973463

217109,438625,MRO,Norway s Aker BP switching gears from M A to exploration,news,"By Nerijus Adomaitis OSLO  Reuters    Norwegian oil and gas company Aker  BP   LON BP  is switching emphasis from M A towards exploration  taking a potentially riskier path to increase its resources after years when it has relied on acquisitions to add the bulk of its new barrels  The company said the change of tack was prompted by falling exploration costs  partly as a result of new technologies  as well as the rising cost of acquisitions in the energy sector because of stronger oil prices   Back in 2015 2016  we acquired resources for 50 60 70 cents a barrel  which is really hard to drill out on the Norwegian continental shelf   CEO Karl Johnny Hersvik told Reuters in an interview   Now  when the drilling and the  seismic  data acquisition cost have come down  and the acquisition costs of the equivalent contingent resources have gone up  it makes sense  to explore    Aker BP has added three times more barrels in oil and gas resources through acquisitions than it has found itself since the company was born about three years ago  Reuters calculations show   The company said it could still make acquisitions if opportunities arose  but declined to make any projections on how many barrels it could buy   Acquisitions    inorganic growth    contributed more than 500 million barrels of oil equivalent  boe  in resources in 2016 18  according to the calculations based on the company s annual reserve reports and investor presentations  Aker BP s own exploration efforts during that period were far smaller  the firm added 148 million boe from discoveries   83 million in 2016  10 million in 2017 and 55 million last year   It cost  1 1 a barrel after tax to find new resources last year  The company  controlled by Norwegian billionaire Kjell Inge Roekke and 30 percent owned by BP  said in January it was hiking its exploration budget by 40 percent year on year to a record  500 million in 2019 and planned to drill 15 exploration wells  It aims to find around 100 million boe net in 2019 20   Its sharpened focus on exploration is  to some extent  emblematic of a wider industry trend of companies beginning to step up drilling efforts   which were curbed after the 2014 market crash   as a result of technological advances and stronger oil prices  It could however be a riskier path for Aker BP  whose rapid growth driven largely by M A helped it weather the downturn better than many peers and has seen its share price more than triple since 2016   The company  which is solely focused on the Norwegian continental shelf  has had a mixed exploration record  It found a quarter of all new resources on the shelf in 2016  but the following year was disappointing   We have drilled too many dry wells   Aker BP s exploration chief Evy Gloerstad Clark told Reuters   If we want to get to the top we need to get a better exploration processes in place    But Aker BP and other firms  including Sweden s Lundin Petroleum Norway s largest firm Equinor  are facing a similar challenge  discoveries on the Norwegian continental shelf are getting smaller and smaller   INDUSTRY CHANGE Aker BP s strategy during the downturn contrasted with that of its closest rival on the continental shelf  fellow mid tier player Lundin  which stuck to a plan of organic growth via exploration  Lundin added only 21 5 million boe from discoveries in 2016 2018  its investor presentations showed  Lundin s share price growth has lagged Aker BP s   but the stock has still doubled since 2016  bolstered by reserve revisions at the giant Johan Sverdrup field which the firm found in 2010 and is due to start producing this year  Aker BP s exploration push reflects a sector wide change in investor sentiment  according to Teodor Sveen Nilsen at Sparebank 1 Markets    With the upturn in the cycle  investors are more focusing on exploration and reserve replacement than a few years ago  when all the focus was on return on capital and dividends   French oil company Total is launching its biggest exploration drive for years in 2019  for example  while Chinese oil majors are also stepping up drilling  NEW PROSPECTS Aker BP s CEO Hersvik said a lesson from past exploration failures was not to put all bets on one or two areas  and to do better homework to pinpoint the best spots to drill  The company said it would spend about 40 percent of its exploration budget targeting new prospects  while 60 percent will go to drill near its existing hubs  Gloerstad Clark also said Aker BP was working to better visualize its drilling and seismic data using specialized software  but this was taking time   The Norwegian continental shelf is proving an increasingly challenging environment for explorers  In 2011 2017  discoveries averaged under 10 million boe  compared with about 110 million boe in the early years of Norway s oil industry in 1966 1980   Aker BP started out in 2016  when Norwegian oil firm Det norske bought British major BP s Norway business in an all share deal  with BP taking a 30 percent stake  two years after Det norske acquired the Norwegian assets of  Marathon Oil   NYSE MRO   As a result of these and subsequent deals  including the acquisition of Hess  Norwegian assets in 2017  Aker BP s contingent resources   proven resources that could be tapped   tripled to 946 million boe between 2016 and 2018  The company has also amassed a large acreage to explore  with stakes in 156 production licenses   Jefferies analyst Mark Wilson said Aker BP s shift towards exploration was a logical step in the company s development  helped by Norway s favorable tax regime   
 It s a natural evolution that makes sense  but the proof will be in the pudding   he added ",2019-03-01,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/norways-aker-bp-switching-gears-from-ma-to-exploration-1795039,1795039

217146,438662,MRO,Is Marathon Oil  MRO  A Profitable Pick For Value Investors  ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Marathon Oil Corporation   NYSE MRO   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE Ratio A key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Marathon Oil has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12 26  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 18 01  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Marathon Oil s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  Further  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Oil   Energy sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 12 97  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers   We should also point out that Marathon Oil has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 14 75  which is tad higher than the current level  So it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near term P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings  Right now  Marathon Oil has a P S ratio of about 1 69  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 18 right now   Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years   If anything  MRO is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms  Broad Value Outlook In aggregate  Marathon Oil currently has a Zacks Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Marathon Oil a solid choice for value investors   What About the Stock Overall    Though Marathon Oil might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of A and a Momentum Score of C  This gives MRO a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores    Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current year has seen five estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to one lower while the full year 2020 estimate has seen five downward revision compared to one upward in the same time period      This has had a notable impact on the consensus estimate though as the current year consensus estimate has increased by 7  in the past two months  while the full year 2020 estimate has declined by 12 7   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Marathon Oil Corporation Price and Consensus    This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom Line  Marathon Oil is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible line up of statistics on this front However  with a sluggish industry rank  among bottom 29  of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks Oil and Gas   Integrated   United States industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below  So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana Ignited by new referendums and legislation  this industry is expected to blast

217147,438663,MRO,Why Marathon Oil  MRO  Is Poised To Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider Marathon Oil  MRO   This company  which is in the Zacks Oil and Gas   Integrated   United States industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
This energy company has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 262 88  
For the last reported quarter  Marathon Oil came out with earnings of  0 23 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 11 per share  representing a surprise of 109 09   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  0 06 per share and it actually produced earnings of  0 31 per share  delivering a surprise of 416 67  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Marathon Oil  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Marathon Oil currently has an Earnings ESP of  4 17   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on November 6  2019 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-10-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-marathon-oil-mro-is-poised-to-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200477831,200477831
217148,438664,MRO,Marathon Oil  MRO  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Marathon Oil  MRO  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on November 6  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This energy company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 04 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  83 3  
Revenues are expected to be  1 26 billion  down 24 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 62 07  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Marathon Oil 
For Marathon Oil  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  4 17  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Marathon Oil will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Marathon Oil would post earnings of  0 11 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 23  delivering a surprise of  109 09  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss

217172,438688,MRO,Analysts Estimate Marathon Oil  MRO  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"Marathon Oil  MRO  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on August 7  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This energy company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 14 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  6 7  
Revenues are expected to be  1 36 billion  down 4 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 48 73  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Marathon Oil 
For Marathon Oil  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 65  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Marathon Oil will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Marathon Oil would post earnings of  0 06 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 31  delivering a surprise of  416 67  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

217199,438715,MRO,PRT Vs  MRO  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors interested in Oil and Gas   Integrated   United States stocks are likely familiar with PermRock Royalty Trust  PRT  and Marathon Oil  MRO   But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors  We ll need to take a closer look to find out 
We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions  while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits 
Currently  PermRock Royalty Trust has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Marathon Oil has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   This means that PRT s earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive  so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook  However  value investors will care about much more than just this 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
PRT currently has a forward P E ratio of 4 35  while MRO has a forward P E of 45 27  We also note that PRT has a PEG ratio of 0 87  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  MRO currently has a PEG ratio of 4 28 
Another notable valuation metric for PRT is its P B ratio of 1 07  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  MRO has a P B of 1 19 
Based on these metrics and many more  PRT holds a Value grade of B  while MRO has a Value grade of D 
PRT is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook  which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model  And  based on the above valuation metrics  we feel that PRT is likely the superior value option right now ",2019-03-18,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/prt-vs-mro-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200398988,200398988

217201,438717,MRO,Earnings Preview  Marathon Oil  MRO  Q1 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"The market expects Marathon Oil  MRO  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on May 1  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This energy company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 07 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  61 1  
Revenues are expected to be  1 23 billion  down 29  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 57 9  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Marathon Oil 
For Marathon Oil  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  8 33  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Marathon Oil will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Marathon Oil would post earnings of  0 13 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 15  delivering a surprise of  15 38  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported

It surpassed estimates in three of the last four quarters  with average positive surprise of 6 70  Marathon Oil Corporation Price and EPS Surprise   Investors are keeping their fingers crossed and hoping that the company can surpass earnings estimates this time around too  However  our model indicates that Marathon Oil might not beat on earnings in the to be reported quarter Let s delve deeper and find out the factors likely to impact the upcoming results Factors at PlayFollowing the oil crash toward the end of 2018 that caught everyone off guard  WTI crude popped up to  60 55 a barrel in the March quarter of 2019  witnessing the fastest rate of oil price increase since a decade  Crude prices rebounded 30  in the first quarter  underpinned mainly by OPEC  supply cuts and U S  sanctions against Venezuela and Iran  which bode well for upstream players like Marathon Oil  In addition to favorable oil prices  the company is expected to realize the benefits of production growth in the United States  Driven by key low cost high margin U S  resource shale plays like Permian  Eagle Ford and Bakken the company expects first quarter U S  oil output in the band of 175 185 barrels per day  Indicating an increase from 164 bpd in the year ago period While Marathon Oil expects to reap profits from the U S  E P segment  the international market is likely to bear the brunt of contracting volumes in the first quarter  As it is  output from the International E P unit has been declining over several quarters and the trend is likely to continue this season as well  In fact  the firm itself anticipates international production to decline further in the to be reported quarter amid planned turnaround activity in Equatorial Guinea As such  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total output  both U S  and International  is pegged at 396 barrels of oil equivalent per day  Boe d   suggesting a decline from the year ago figure of 431 Boe d While we expect rebounding oil prices and rising output from the U S  E P segment to aid Marathon Oil s first quarter 2019 results  dim prospects of the international segment may limit profits Earnings WhisperOur proven model does not conclusively predict that Marathon Oil will beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the quarter to be reported  This is because it doesn t have the right combination of the two key ingredients   a

That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Marathon Oil doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-02-05,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/marathon-oil-mro-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200384395,200384395
217212,438728,MRO,Can Marathon Oil  MRO  Keep The Earnings Surprise Streak Alive ,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Marathon Oil  MRO   which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas   Integrated   United States industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This energy company has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of  4 29  
For the last reported quarter  Marathon Oil came out with earnings of  0 24 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 20 per share  representing a surprise of 20   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  0 21 per share and it actually produced earnings of  0 15 per share  delivering a surprise of 28 57  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Marathon Oil  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Marathon Oil currently has an Earnings ESP of  2 36   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on February 13  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-02-06,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/can-marathon-oil-mro-keep-the-earnings-surprise-streak-alive-200385196,200385196

closing bell  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to be reported quarter is pegged at a profit of 20 cents on revenues of  1 501 million The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has moved south by a penny over the past month  However  its earnings estimates of 20 cents signal a turnaround from a loss of 8 cents per share incurred in the year ago quarter  Further  revenues are also expected to record year over year growth of 19 8  in the to be reported quarter Notably  in the last reported quarter  the company delivered weaker than expected earnings on high operating expenses  Nonetheless  Marathon Oil displays a sound earnings history  having gone past estimates in three of the last four quarters  with average positive surprise of 71 07  Marathon Oil Corporation Price and EPS Surprise   Let s take a look at the factors that are likely to impact its performance in the to be reported quarter Factors at PlayMarathon Oil s strong inventories of development projects place it well for growth  The company has been improving the quality of assets  which bodes well for production  The company has successfully established itself in the Delaware Basin and STACK SCOOP resource plays  while exiting the oil sands and conventional assets with limited upside Management had earlier predicted third quarter 2018 U S  Exploration   Production  E P  output available for sale in the range of 290 000 300 000 BOE d  Even the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total sales volume at the U S   E P  segment for the third quarter is pegged at 300 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day  BOE d   which is well above the year ago figure of 244 000 BOE d Along with expanded production volumes  the North American market is likely to benefit from higher commodity price realizations  Notably  oil prices were fueled by concerns over U S  sanctions on Iran  OPEC s efforts to tighten the market and strong global demand  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for realized prices in the United States is projected to increase on a year over year basis  which might boost Marathon Oil s top line  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average oil price is expected to jump 47 9  from the prior year level to  66 a barrel Nonetheless  the company is expected to bear the brunt of receding output from international E P activities  Notably  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales volumes from international operations is pegged at  11 000 Boe d  which is below the year ago level of  165 000 Boe d  In fact  in the last reported quarter  the company had forecast weaker output from international operations for the quarter to be reported  Marathon Oil expects International E P output to remain within 105 000 115 000 BOE d  down from the second quarter level  owing to planned maintenance in the United Kingdom and Equatorial Guinea Hence  while we expect Marathon Oil s U S  Production and Exploration segment to buoy the company s earnings  lower volumes from international operations may limit overall profits

What s Next for Marathon Oil 
While Marathon Oil has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Marathon Oil was favorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  0 24 on  1 56 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  0 77 on  6 10 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Oil and Gas   Integrated   United States is currently in the top 9  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2018-11-07,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/marathon-oil-mro-beats-q3-earnings-and-revenue-estimates-200356475,200356475
217240,438756,MRO,Marathon Burns Lower  Keep Watch For Near Term Relief,opinion,"Summary 

Marathon Oil  NYSE MRO  traded 4  lower on Friday morning 
This occurred as crude oil finished off its seventh consecutive week of losses 
However  our read of the stock s market cycles suggests it is close to a cycle bottom and is due for a modest bounce 


Crude oil   CL  futures fell 7  on Friday and by 30  since early October  as market participants continue to express concern about an oil glut  This is the result of continued robust supply in the face of the economic weakness that affects much of the globe 
OPEC and other countries will meet in early December to consider limiting their production in an effort to prop up oil prices  In the meantime  the dip in prices is affecting the energy sector broadly  with the Energy Select Index  XLE  NYSE XLE   down by 3  today and Marathon Oil down by 4  
In analyzing the market cycles for MRO  we can see the stock is in the declining phase of the shorter of its two cycles  However  we believe the stock is at a Fibonacci support zone  as this cycle begins to wind down  As such  we are expecting a bounce  with an  18 60 target

217260,438776,MRO,Eq  Guinea targets LNG expansion  European market,news,"  Equatorial Guinea aims to supply electricity to Cameroon
   Targeting European gas market
   Possible  4 billion expansion of Malabo hub
 
 By David Lewis
 MALABO  March 25  Reuters    Equatorial Guinea is forging
ahead with a gas gathering project that it hopes will double the
country s output  deepen links with gas hungry European nations
and provide electricity to Cameroon  a senior official said 
 Germany s E ON Ruhrgas  Spain s Union Fenosa and Portugal s
Galp Energia will help state gas company Sonagas complete a
draft gas master plan for Equatorial Guinea by the end of the
summer  Gabriel Obiang Lima  deputy mines and energy minister 
told Reuters late on Tuesday 
 The consortium  known as 3G  is central to a drive by
sub Saharan Africa s third largest oil producer to tap into its
own and regional natural gas reserves  most of which are lost
due to flaring from wells 
  This conference is the green light for them to start having
negotiations and contacts with the operators in Equatorial
Guinea   Lima said on the sidelines of the Equatorial Guinea Gas
Conference 
  By the end of the summer  we will definitely have the
initial draft  If things go to plan  we could even talk about a
final investment decision by mid next year   he said  referring
to the master plan  Lima is the son of President Teodoro Obiang
Nguema Mbasongo 
 Equatorial Guinea produces 3 7 million tonnes of liquefied
natural gas  LNG  from its first processing train that started
production at its Punta Europe terminal in May 2007 
 Asked by how much 3G would increase output  Lima said 
 Being very conservative  I would say one more  LNG train   
 Although still early in its conception  Lima said the
project is expected to cost a minimum of  4 billion and would
include an LNG plant  pipeline and other projects linked to
energy production from gas 
  We want to do an integrated project     Equatorial Guinea
is more gas prone than oil prone   he said 
 
 U S COMPANIES
 Equatorial Guinea s oil production has lept from virtually
nothing to around 380 000 barrels per day during the last decade
alone  Most of the companies that have invested in the Gulf of
Guinea state are from the United States 
 U S  company Marathon Oil is a major force in the country s
LNG production as the operator and 60 percent owner of joint
venture EG LNG 
 Like oil  world gas prices have plummeted during the global
slowdown and are as much as 50 percent down on their peaks of
last July 
 However  Lima said he believed Europe  which has seen fears
for longer term gas supplies stoked by geo political tensions in
Eastern Europe  would be central to his country s future 
  They are consumers   he said of Germany and Spain   If the
market is going to sign long term contracts  we will secure it
for them  
 Equatorial Guinea has been in talks with Gulf of Guinea
neighbours Nigeria and Cameroon about the possibility of buying
their gas to then export from the Malabo hub 
 Relations between the nations have often been strained  with
Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea still not agreed on their
maritime border  Gunmen who attacked the presidential palace in
Malabo last month are suspected to be militants from Nigeria s
restive Niger Delta 
 Earlier on Tuesday  Lima said he would be restarting talks
with the two nations to finalise a deal 
 Cameroon could benefit from the partnership by buying
discounted electricity from a power plant that would be set up
in Equatorial Guinea  a country split between mainland Africa
and the island of Bioko  where Malabo is situated 
  What we are proposing is to sell them very cheap kilowatts
    Cameroon can sell the electricity to its neighbours   Lima
said

217306,438822,MRO, Will Marathon Oil  MRO  Disappoint Investors In Q2 Earnings ,opinion,"Energy explorer Marathon Oil Corporation   NYSE MRO   is set to release second quarter 2017 results after the closing bell on Aug 2 
In the last reported quarter  the Houston  TX based company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 12 50  on the back of increased price realizations and cost control initiatives  As far as the company s earnings surprise history is concerned  it has an impressive record  Marathon Oil beat estimates in the last four quarters with an average positive surprise of 20 47  
Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
 Marathon Oil Corporation Price and EPS Surprise
    Factors at play
Being an upstream firm  weakness in the commodity prices might lower exploration and production activities  Oil prices have been falling below the psychologically critical  50 threshold again  erasing all the gains associated with the OPEC led output cut  The continued rise in domestic production owing to higher shale output has dragged down prices  During the second quarter  the price of oil and natural gas declined by 8 4  and 5   respectively  This might dent the company s earnings and revenues 
The year over year decline in production and uncertainty regarding its low cost Libyan operations are also causes of concern  Lack of growth opportunities is another threat  This also accounts for our bleak earnings outlook for the company 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Marathon Oil is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
That is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP  which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  is  15 39   This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at a loss of 15 cents  while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of 13 cents 
Zacks Rank  Marathon Oil currently carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   Note that we caution against Sell rated stocks  Zacks Ranks  4 and 5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Stocks to Consider
Here are some companies from the energy sector that  according to our model  have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter 
Noble Corporation   NYSE NE   has an Earnings ESP of  3 03  and a Zacks Rank  3  The company is likely to release earnings on Aug 3 You can see 
Enbridge Inc   NYSE ENB   has an Earnings ESP of  38 24  and a Zacks Rank  3  The company is expected to release earnings on Aug 3

217324,438840,MRO,Oil   Gas Industry Outlook   December 2016,opinion,"Crude Oil
We are almost at the last leg of 2016  a year that was marked by unprecedented energy market volatility 
The Story So Far
The year started on a disappointing note with crude prices falling to a 12 year low of  26 21 a barrel in Feb as investors worried about the oversupplied market  The commodity s collapse threatened the industry s creditworthiness by hurting cash flows  drying up liquidity and pummeling producer profit margins 
However  indications that supply was easing helped oil prices rebound to  50 barrel mark in early Jun  The surge was driven by outages in Nigeria  Libya  Venezuela and Canada   countries that hold some of the world s major sources of crude  The upward pressure in oil prices also reflected the U S  Energy Department s inventory releases that showed crude stockpile builds turning into draws  Things were further helped by a continued decline in U S  crude production 
With factors like Canadian wildfires  Nigerian outages disruptions  production issues in Venezuela and a strike by Kuwaiti oil workers vanishing from the market  oil slipped back under  40 in the first week of Aug  A glut of refined products also kept the commodity under pressure 
The volatility in oil prices continued with the benchmark touching the  50 threshold again early Oct  buoyed by government figures that continued to show large drawdowns  while investors betted on commitments by Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  or OPEC  and non OPEC players to slash production targets 
When divisions in the cartel became apparent and the future of the ambitious OPEC announcement looked more and more uncertain  the commodity fell back under  45 only to receive a booster shot 
The OPEC Deal
In a bold but not unexpected move  the OPEC cartel agreed on Nov 30 to reduce production starting next month  Seen as a desperate bid to put a floor on falling oil prices  the group   led by Saudi Arabia   promised to take 1 2 million barrels a day out of the market 
OPEC s decision to cut oil production was not totally surprising though the magnitude of reduction were deeper than many analysts had expected  The move aims to trim output to 32 5 million barrels per day    at the low end of a preliminary agreement struck in September 
Russia  which is not part of the body that pumps a third of the world s oil  will also join output cuts for the first time in 15 years  The biggest supplier outside the bloc relented from its longstanding position of only freezing production and agreed to cut 300 000 barrels from its record high output of more than 10 million barrels a day 
Oil Prices   Stocks Surge
The OPEC deal had a massive impact on the energy markets  sending crude prices back above  50 a barrel  While the entire sector is roaring higher since the announcement  the independent oil explorers and producers   whose revenues are directly associated with crude price   have been among the best performing stocks  In fact  shares of oil finders like Whiting Petroleum Corp   WLL   Oasis Petroleum Inc   OAS  and Marathon Oil Corp   NYSE MRO  have exploded higher and climbed to new multi month highs 
Certain Factors Still Linger
Despite OPEC s success in reaching an output deal  the oil sector is by no means out of the woods 
The commodity is facing heat on several other fronts  Perhaps most important pertains to the mounting worries about China s crude demand  In particular  the Asian giant s currency devaluation has stoked speculation about soft economic growth in the world s No  2 energy consumer 
What s more  the resilience of North American shale suppliers to keep pumping irrespective of prices and concerns over the effects of Brexit on crude demand means that not much upside is expected in prices in the near term  Moreover  a stronger dollar has made the greenback priced crude more expensive for investors holding foreign currency  Stronger focus on cleaner energy and weakness in industrial production worldwide are also holding back oil consumption 
As it is  with inventories near the upper limit of the average range for this time of year  crude is very well stocked and it still looks like the commodity is in an environment of excess supply  Therefore  while the OPEC driven rally is likely to drive up prices by a few dollars  it certainly can t be termed a seismic event 
Our View
In our view  crude prices in the next few months are likely to exhibit a sideways to bullish trend  mostly trading in the  50  55 per barrel range  As North American supply remains strong and demand looks underwhelming  oil is likely to maintain its low trajectory throughout at least the first half of 2017 
Natural Gas
Over the last few years  a quiet revolution has been reshaping the energy business in the U S  The success of  shale gas    natural gas trapped within dense sedimentary rock formations or shale formations   has transformed domestic energy supply  with a potentially inexpensive and abundant new source of fuel for the world s largest energy consumer 
With the advent of hydraulic fracturing  or  fracking     a method used to extract natural gas by blasting underground rock formations with a mixture of water  sand and chemicals   shale gas production is now booming in the U S  Coupled with sophisticated horizontal drilling equipment that can drill and extract gas from shale formations  the new technology is being hailed as a breakthrough in U S  energy supplies  playing a key role in boosting domestic natural gas reserves  As a result  once faced with a looming deficit  natural gas is now available in abundance 
Prices Fell to 17 Year Lows Earlier in 2016
With production from the major shale plays remaining strong and the commodity s demand failing to keep pace with this supply surge  natural gas prices hit 17 year lows of around  1 6 per million British thermal units  MMBtu  in the first quarter  The glut was further exacerbated by lackluster industrial requirement over the past few years 
And Then Recovered Strongly
Since then  successive below average builds on the back of warmer temperature across the country followed by the recent start of the withdrawal season  has been cutting into the year over year storage surplus  Statistically speaking  the current storage level   at around 4 trillion cubic feet  Tcf  is up only slightly from last year and is just 6  above the five year average  As a result  natural gas prices have rebounded strongly and doubled from the extreme lows it hit in Mar  The dramatic recovery has helped the commodity stay above the key psychological level of  3 per MMBtu
The price strength has translated into major gains for natural gas weighted firms including the likes of Cimarex Energy Co  NYSE XEC    XEC   Southwestern Energy Co   SWN  and Range Resources Corp  NYSE RRC    RRC    all Zacks Rank  3  Hold  companies   which have popped up 50  or more year to date  You can see  
Long Term Thesis Positive
With the early winter turning out cooler than expected  natural gas demand has picked up on the back of elevated power sector consumption due to air conditioning use  Coupled with the easing production from the major shale plays  natural gas prices are set to rise further 
What s more  rig count is now languishing below 120   compared to almost 200 a year ago and the high of 1 606 reached in 2008  Therefore  production growth is unlikely to resume anytime soon 
In general  sentiment toward natural gas is likely to become more positive in the near future as speculators bet on a frigid winter to follow the hot summer 
What the Zacks Industry Rank Indicates
Oil Energy is one the 16 broad Zacks sectors within the Zacks Industry classification  We rank 265 X industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry   To learn more visit

We put our X industries into two groups  the top half  industries with the best average Zacks Rank  and the bottom half  the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank   Over the last 10 years  using a one week rebalance  the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1

Early Q4 Predictions Look Positive
As is the trend over the past few quarters  a look back at the Q3 earnings season reflects that the overall results of the Oil Energy sector were again very weak  dragging down the aggregate growth picture for the S P 500 index 
Unlike the second quarter  in which oil advanced more than 26  sequentially to notch up the best quarterly percentage gain in seven years  the Jun Sep 2016 period turned out to be rather flat with crude barely advancing  In fact  the West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures during the third quarter hovered around the  45 per barrel mark  flat with the second quarter and down from  46 50 in the same period last year 
Before discussing Q4 2016 quarter estimates  let s take a look at this year s Q3 earnings season  Earnings fell by a whopping 63 3  year over year  following a 79  drop witnessed in the previous quarter  Things have been bad on the revenue front too  which was down 12 9  in the September quarter after declining 24 4  in the previous three month period 
However  the picture looks rather encouraging for the upcoming Q4 earnings season  This is not surprising  considering that oil scored a big jump on the recent OPEC deal that promises a worldwide cut in production  With estimate revisions going up  the Oil Energy sector s earnings are expected to improve 28 3  from the fourth quarter 2015 levels  while the top line is likely to show a growth of 5

217326,438842,MRO,5 Best Small Cap Energy Stocks Up 10  Since OPEC s Decision,opinion,"In a bold but not unexpected move  the OPEC cartel agreed on November 30 to reduce production starting next month  Seen as a desperate bid to put a floor on falling oil prices  the group   led by Saudi Arabia   promised to take 1 2 million barrels a day out of the market 
OPEC s First Output Cut in 8 Years
OPEC s decision to cut oil production was not totally surprising though the magnitude of reduction were deeper than many analysts had expected  The move aims to trim output to 32 5 million barrels per day    at the low end of a preliminary agreement struck in September 
Crude prices  which reached  110 per barrel in mid 2014  fell to a 12 year low of  26 21 in Feb on a supply glut amid slowing demand  In particular  the oil rout alarmed many of the countries whose economies depend on the commodity s exports 
A sop to populous big spending oil producers such as Venezuela and Iran  the cartel s cutbacks was a mild loss for Saudi Arabia that has been adamant about its continuing strategy to preserve market share by pumping oil almost flat out rather than trying to prop up prices by modifying production limits 
Riyadh was forced to soften its stand after it became clear that the kingdom was getting clobbered by its own policies  As a result  the world s largest crude exporter gave its seal of approval on the cartel s production cut decision   the first such attempt since 2008  What s more  Saudi Arabia will bear the lion s share of the production cuts to accommodate arch rivals Iran s demands 
Riyadh  OPEC s largest supplier of oil  will trim volumes by nearly a half a million barrels per day  while allowing Iran to boost production slightly  Another fast growing producer Iraq surprised pundits by pledging to curtail output by 0 2 million barrels per day 
Gets Russia to Comply
Russia  which is not part of the body that pumps a third of the world s oil  will also join output cuts for the first time in 15 years  The biggest supplier outside the bloc relented from its longstanding position of only freezing production and agreed to cut 300 000 barrels from its record high output of more than 10 million barrels a day 
Oil Prices   Stocks Surge
The landmark OPEC deal had a massive impact on the energy markets  sending crude prices back above  50 a barrel  While the entire sector is roaring higher since the announcement  the independent oil explorers and producers   whose revenues are directly associated with crude price   have been among the best performing stocks  In fact  shares of oil finders like Whiting Petroleum Corp     NYSE WLL     Oasis Petroleum Inc    NYSE OAS   and Marathon Oil Corp    NYSE MRO   have exploded higher and climbed to new multi month highs 
An Opportunity to Build a Position in Energy
While high inventories and robust production could still push the commodity to the low 40s  signs are emerging that oil prices are likely to stabilize and gradually pick up  Apart from a complete collapse of the agreement  there s not many catalysts to reverse the impetus 
In fact  most market observers see oil s post OPEC rally as the beginning of a sustained increase in prices  The cut by OPEC is expected reduce global output and help the oil market come into balance  thereby supporting the commodity to break out from the 2  year slump 
For investors willing to bet on the revival of crude prices  this is the perfect time to build or increase their position in oil related companies  However  selecting stocks to buy could be a tricky proposition  especially with oil prices moving like a roller coaster  
The Zacks Methodology
With the help of our   one can locate stocks with green shoots  In particular  we have shortlisted 5 companies that have gone up an impressive 10  or more since the OPEC announcement  and have a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy   A favorable Zacks Rank indicates that these stocks have been witnessing positive estimate revisions  which generally translate into rapid price appreciation  You can see  
The Small Cap Advantage
To magnify our returns  we have opted for small cap stocks  Owing to their significant growth potential  small cap stocks  stocks with a market cap of around  1 billion or below  usually tend to outperform their large cap peers over time  However  these can also be riskier than well known large cap companies  Nonetheless  the growth potential of small caps is tempting  especially given the current economic backdrop of continued strength in the U S  dollar and oil price unpredictability

Recap of the Week s Most Important Stories

	1  Offshore drilling giant Transocean Ltd  saw its shares decline 7 6  in the after hours trading session on October 3 after India based Reliance Industries Ltd  decided to exercise the option to terminate its contract for Transocean s Discoverer India rig ahead of schedule 

	The ultra deepwater drillship will be pulled out of service in Dec 2016  four years before the scheduled contract expiry in Jan 2021  Per the contract  Transocean will receive a lump sum compensation amount of approximately  160 million from Reliance for the early termination 

	This is another sign that the collapse in crude prices that began in mid 2014 amid a glut of supply and slowing demand for the commodity has affected the offshore drillers badly as oil companies cut back their capital spending 

	2  Leading upstream energy player Marathon Oil Corp  reported that it has signed a deal to sell off some of its non core assets in West Texas and New Mexico for  235 million 

	Under this deal  Marathon will be seen divesting its non operated  conventional CO2 and waterflood assets to an unidentified buyer by the end of this year  These assets averaged about 4 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first half of 2016 

	With oil prices remaining low for a long time and still hovering below  50 a barrel  exploration and production companies such as Marathon find it difficult to borrow funds from the lenders  Hence  this forces them to sell off their non core properties to meet their expenses 

	3  British oil major BP plc  NYSE      recently announced that it has struck an accord with the Egyptian government for the amendment of three concessions in the Arab country 

	BP has secured amendments from the authorities for three concessions in Egypt   Temsah  Ras El Barr and Nile Delta Offshore  This will facilitate acceleration of output from the Nooros gas discovery after recording positive appraisal results from another find  Recently  BP achieved record production of 700 million standard cubic feet per day  mmscfd  in the Nooros development  BP currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see     

	With the conclusion of these amendments  BP can progress with the enhancement of its drilling activities in these concession areas  The amendments also allow fast track development of the Nooros field in the Nile Delta offshore concession and should allow the company to reach a production level of 800 mmscfd by early 2017  Additional wells are also expected to be drilled by BP in Ras El Barr and Temsah areas  which will likely bring substantial gas to the Egyptian domestic market   Read more     

	4  Hamilton  Bermuda based offshore drilling firm SeaDrill Ltd   NYSE      saw its shares decline after North Atlantic Drilling Ltd   in which it holds 70  stake  announced a rig contract cancellation by Norwegian oil giant Statoil ASA  NYSE      

	This cancellation notice  which pertains to the contract for the West Epsilon jack up  came two months before the expiration of the drilling contract between the parties  The West Epsilon rig was originally contracted to provide drilling services in Norway until Dec 2016  However  Statoil has now decided to conclude the rig s current activities in mid Oct 

	As per the terms of the contract  North Atlantic Drilling is now entitled to receive a lump sum payment of approximately  11 million because of the early termination  The West Epsilon  on the other hand  is currently being marketed for new contract   Read more

 The Markets



Stocks ended lower on Friday following a disappointing report on GDP for the fourth quarter  The S P 500 Index closed down by 1 30   once again testing short term support around 1988 
Friday s session also concluded the first month of 2015  the result of which has caused investors to be concerned of the potential returns for the year ahead Investors are now looking toward the January Barometer to anticipate the performance for the remainder of the year The theory behind the barometer is that the direction of the equity market during the month of January will forecast the movement of the market through the remainder of the year 
The January decline of 3 10  on the S P 500 Index suggests further losses to follow  However  history suggests that using January as an indicator as to how the rest of the year will perform may be flawed  Of the 24 losing Januarys over the past 60 years  only 10  42   have seen losses continue through the remaining 11 months The  predictive power  of the barometer during negative Januarys  such as the one that just past  is clearly weak  Overall  the barometer has shown a success rate of 68  when the positive and negative Januarys are combined due to the 86  success rate of positive Januarys following by positive returns through the remainder of the year 
Given that the general propensity for the broad market is for gains over the long term  the higher frequency of success for positive years is to be expected  Since the new year is only one month old and major benchmarks have yet to break support  it remains too early to speculate on the direction of equity markets through the remaining months of the year 

























Looking forward to the month of February  volatility remains the norm as earnings season continues  Over the last 20 years  the S P 500 has averaged a decline of 0 3   however  positive results have been recorded in 60  of Februarys  Following fourth quarter economic strength  the first two months of the year tend to have few catalysts to influence stocks in any particular direction  causing equity market gyrations during the earnings reporting period  Profit taking following fourth quarter earning results is also a factor behind the volatile trading activity  Stocks resume their gaining path into the month of March as the economy rebounds following the winter months  Over the last 20 years  consumer and material stocks have been the best performers in the month of February  gaining in 65  of periods and averaging returns around 1   Financials  Technology  and Utilities have been the weakest sectors in February  each gaining in 55  of periods and averaging a loss of around 1 3   Currently  the weakest sectors during the month represent almost 40  of the weight of the S P 500 Index  suggesting that the best performing sectors have to post strong returns in order to lift broad equity benchmarks higher 











Sentiment on Friday  as gauged by the put call ratio  ended bearish at 1 14

217455,438971,MRO,Northern Tier Energy LP  NTI  IPO Report,opinion,Based in Ridgefield  CT  Northern Tier Energy LP  NTI  scheduled a  326 million IPO with a market capitalization of  1 8 billion at a price range mid point of  20  for Thursday  July 26  2012 NTI is an independent downstream energy company with refining  retail  and pipeline operations CONCLUSIONAvoid the NTI IPO  see  concerns  below   S 1 UNDERWRITERSManager  Joint Managers  Goldman  Barclays  BofA Merrill LynchCo Managers  Credit Suisse  Deutsche  UBS  J P  Morgan  Macquarie CapitalSUMMARYNTI is an independent downstream energy company with refining  retail  and pipeline operations that serves the  of the United States  NTI is a carve out from Marathon Oil  MRO   market capitalization of  19 billion  The deal happened in 2010 and was engineered by Goldman Sachs The petroleum industry is usually divided into three major components  Upstream  midstream and downstream  Midstream operations are usually included in the downstream category  CONCLUSIONAvoid the NTI IPO  see  concerns  below CONCERNS 1  20  of the outstanding stock is  paid in kind  to senior management and the   Worse  NTI s  partnership authorizes NTI to issue an unlimited number of additional units  including PIK units  2  NTI incurred a  92 million recent derivative loss  and NTI wants to re compensate the loss through the IPO proceeds  NTI will  pay  92 million to J  Aron   Company  an affiliate of Goldman  Sachs   Co   for losses incurred during the three months ended June 30  2012 as a result of resetting the price of certain derivative contracts   That s reason enough to avoid the NTI IPO  3  Also  there is no expected payout  although NTI does forecast generating  245 million in cash from operations for the 12 months ended June 30  2013  If all the  245 million were paid out the return at the price range mid point would be 13   but don t count on it for at least three reasons  See  Proposed Pipeline Initiative  below  this could eat up a lot of cash    85 million liability to be recorded post IPO  See   CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION ARRANGEMENT  below  Profit margins appear to be temporarily high  and NTI s cash flow forecast therefor might be unduly optimistic   More recently  during the second quarter of 2012  the discount to which NYMEX WTI trades relative to Brent has narrowed due to a number of factors  including recently announced changes in the pipeline infrastructure serving Cushing  Oklahoma  The narrowing of this margin may affect the prices at which we sell our refined products relative to our cost of crude oil and may therefore cause a reduction in our refining margins  S 1  page 95 4  Compared to mid stream partnerships  downstream is usually   NTI appears overvalued in terms of price to book  and NTI doesn t commit to a distribution payout range  Unlike most publicly traded partnerships  we will not have a minimum quarterly distribution or employ structures intended to consistently maintain or increase quarterly distributions over time  HISTORYNTI commenced operations in December 2010 through the acquisition of the St  Paul Park  Minnesota refinery  a 17  interest in the Minnesota Pipe Line Company and in MPL Investments  convenience stores and related assets from Marathon  MRO  for  554 million  which included cash and the issuance to Marathon of  80 million of a noncontrolling preferred membership interest in NTI s parent  Northern Tier Holdings Marathon Oil  MRO  has a market capitalization of  19 billion Northern Tier Energy  Inc   was incorporated in October 2011  Northern Tier Energy  Inc  was converted into Northern Tier Energy LP in June 2012 BUSINESSNTI is an independent downstream energy company with refining  retail  and pipeline operations that serve the PADD II region of the United States  The business is operated in two business segments  the refining business and the retail business  Refining BusinessThe refining business primarily consists of a 74 000 bpd  84 500 barrels per stream day  refinery  located in St  Paul Park  Minnesota  NTI s refining business also includes a 17  interest in the Minnesota Pipe Line Company and MPL Investments  which owns and operates the Minnesota Pipeline  a 455 000 bpd crude oil pipeline system that transports crude oil  primarily from Western Canada and North Dakota  for approximately 300 miles from the Enbridge pipeline hub at Clearbrook  Minnesota to NTI s refinery  The Minnesota Pipeline has historically transported the majority of the crude oil used and processed in NTI s refinery Retail BusinessThe retail business operated 166 convenience stores under the SuperAmerica brand and also supported 67 franchised convenience stores  which are also operated under the SuperAmerica brand  These convenience stores are located primarily in Minnesota and Wisconsin NTI s refinery supplied substantially all of the gasoline and diesel sold in NTI s company operated and franchised convenience stores for the three months ended March 31  2012 and the year ended December 31  2011 MARGINS NARROWINGDuring the second quarter of 2012  the discount to which NYMEX WTI trades relative to Brent has narrowed due to a number of factors  including recently announced changes in the pipeline infrastructure serving Cushing  Oklahoma  The narrowing of this margin may affect the prices at which NTI sells refined products relative to NTI s cost of crude oil and may therefore cause a reduction in our refining margins  PROPOSED PIPELINE INITIATIVEOn June 22  2012  consistent with NTI s strategy to optimize its crude oil supply and sourcing advantage  NTI entered into an exclusivity agreement with Saddle Butte Pipeline  LLC   Saddle Butte   and its wholly owned subsidiary  High Prairie Pipeline  LLC   High Prairie    This agreement sets forth a proposed non binding shipping commitment and equity investment by NTI in a 150 000 bpd pipeline spanning from McKenzie County  North Dakota to Clearbrook  Minnesota  The pipeline will be constructed and maintained by High Prairie  NTI sproposed commitment contemplates a ten year  50 000 bpd shipping commitment on the High Prairie pipeline at a tariff of  2 49 per barrel  or as otherwise approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission   FERC    and an equity investment in High Prairie proportional to NTI s throughput commitment as a percentage of total commitments on the High Prairie pipeline  Saddle Butte and High Prairie have granted certain exclusivity rights to NTI with respect to the High Prairie Pipeline project  Upon satisfaction of certain conditions  we have agreed to grant exclusivity rights to Saddle Butte and High Prairie during the negotiation of definitive agreements  There can be no assurance that definitive agreements with Saddle Butte and High Prairie will be reached regarding the proposed shipping commitment and equity investment IPOdesktop note   the above pipeline deal could very well consume cash  which would limit NTI s short term cash payout CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION ARRANGEMENT CREATES UNCERTAINTYIn connection with the Marathon Acquisition  NTI entered into a contingent consideration arrangement with Marathon  This arrangement would have required earn out payments if NTI s annual consolidated EBITDA  adjusted for certain agreed items exceeded  165 million during any year in each of the eight years following the Marathon Acquisition  Specifically  NTI would have been required to pay Marathon 40  of the amount by which the Agreement Adjusted EBITDA exceeded  165 million  subject to certain reductions  in any year in the eight years following the Marathon Acquisition  Total payments to Marathon under this agreement could not have exceeded  125 million over the eight years following the Marathon Acquisition Conversely  Marathon would have been required to make margin support payments to NTI of up to  30 million per year if the Agreement Adjusted EBITDA was less than  145 million  subject to certain reductions  in either of the twelve month periods ending November 30  2011 and 2012  Disputed paymentsAs of December 31  2011  NTI recorded a receivable of  30 million relating to the margin support component of the contingent consideration arrangement for the twelve months ended November 30  2011  Marathon disputed   12 million of this amount  In connection with the resolution of this dispute  NTI entered into a settlement agreement with Marathon on May 4  2012  Under the terms of this settlement agreement  Marathon will receive  40 million of the net proceeds from this offering  and Northern Tier Holdings will redeem Marathon s existing preferred interest with a portion of the net proceeds from this offering and issue Marathon a new  45 million preferred interest in Northern Tier Holdings in consideration for relinquishing all claims with respect to earn out payments under the contingent consideration agreement  At March 31  2012  in addition to the  30 million receivable discussed above  NTI recorded at fair value  an asset of  2 8 million related to the margin support component for the twelve months ended November 30  2012 and a liability of  79 2 million related to the earn out component  Upon the consummation of this offering  NTI will reverse any amounts recorded for the margin support and earn out arrangements and record a liability of  85 million DISTRIBUTION POLICYUnlike most publicly traded partnerships  NTI will not have a minimum quarterly distribution or employ structures intended to consistently maintain or increase distributions over timeNTI s quarterly distributions  if any  will not be stable and will vary from quarter to quarter and year to year as a direct result of variations The board of directors of NTI s general partner will adopt a policy pursuant to which distributions for each quarter  including the distributions of additional PIK  payment in kind  units on outstanding PIK units  will equal the amount of available cash NTI generate in such quarter basis USE OF PROCEEDSNTI expects to receive  288 million from its IPO  The IPO money plus  41 million of cash on hand is allocated to

217468,438984,MRO,The Best Mining And Energy Stock Bargains On The Market,opinion,There s an old saying on Wall Street that investors should look to the income statement for upside and the balance sheet for downside protection  But for mining and energy stocks  this axiom has been spun on its head  Income statement metrics are forcing many of these stocks down  but their balance sheets point to the way to vigorous upside  while that downside protection also remains in place     You can find no greater example of this than copper and gold miner Freeport McMoran  NYSE  FCX   Copper prices have fallen from around  4 50 a pound in early 2011 to a recent  3 60  dampening the company s profit prospects  Adding insult  the company is temporarily seeing reduced output at a key Indonesian mine on the heels of work stoppages  Lastly  concerns continue to fester that China s insatiable appetite for copper is set to slow down  Add it up  and you have a pretty dismal stock chart To be sure  this stock may look attractive at less than eight times trailing profits and less than four times trailing EBITDA  but Freeport McMoran s earnings per share  EPS  is expected to slump about 15  this year to about  4 15 a share  And investors simply shun stocks that are posting falling profits   But such an environment is precisely where you find value  Freeport McMoran is becoming a deep value stock if you measure the company s stock against the unlocked value in its various copper and gold mines   Let me explain      As mining engineers will tell you  it s highly unlikely that we ll soon hear about a brand new mining opportunity anywhere in the world  Any region that contains vast stores of copper  gold or other minerals has already been identified and exploited  So Freeport should benefit in the years to come from finite industry supply and stable to rising demand  Simply based on current dynamics  Goldman Sachs says Freeport McMoran s mines are worth  50 a share  That s more than 25  above current levels    Values across the board You can apply this same logic to many other mining firms  Take gold mining stocks as an example  They ve been steadily falling in value  even as the value of gold has remained fairly steady  As I noted   a number of gold mining stocks now trade well below analysts  price targets   These stocks actually trade above net asset value  NAV   but that s only because the calculation involves historical purchase prices of mines and not the value of untapped gold that is waiting to be harvested  On that basis  analysts see solid potential upside for this beaten down group    The oil and gas conundrum Trying to find verifiable bargains in the energy sector is a bit trickier  Natural gas prices have been plunging and production is becoming uneconomical for many players  Yet many of these same firms also have significant exposure to crude oil  which has seen more robust pricing  In light of the uncertainty regarding gas pricing right now  it only pays to look at oil focused companies  which have a greater reliance on oil production than gas production  in the context of their underlying NAV    What s a good baseline assumption for oil prices when calculating NAVs  Well  conveniently enough  investing firm Jefferies Group has just issued an updated oil price forecast and updated NAV assumptions for many of the oil companies that the firm follows    For the past few years  Jefferies had assumed that Brent Crude Oil  which reflects the spot market value in Europe  would settle in at  85 a barrel in 2013  This figure has now been bumped to  100  Their targets for West Texas Intermediate Crude  WTI   which is the basis for U S  pricing and is often at hefty discount to Brent Crude  is now higher  Jefferies sees WTI at  90 a barrel in 2013 and  95 a barrel by 2014 or 2015    Key positive and negative factors behind this updated view    Chinese oil imports will likely slow  because domestic natural gas production is rising at a 20  annual pace and substituting oil at some power plants    OPEC is showing more discipline  and will  defend  oil by cutting output if Brent falls below  100    Rising production costs are making certain energy fields economically unfeasible when oil falls much below  100 a barrel  creating a supply cut trigger    With higher targets for oil prices in the coming years  the analysts at Jefferies have also been kind enough to reconsider their previous target prices  so the following oil stocks now have solid upside  according to the firm   My personal favorite NAV play remains Marathon Oil  NYSE  MRO   which is a member of my  100 000 Real Money Portfolio  The company has a range of assets in the United States and abroad  Merrill Lynch pegs the NAV for Marathon Oil at  56 a share  nearly double the current price  Shares have weakened recently on slipping energy prices  but coming quarters should start to show the results of the company s large capital spending program  which should steadily boost output of oil and gas over the next few years    Risks to Consider  China is still a driving force in the commodities markets  and although recent economic data suggest that economy is doing OK  a hard landing would bring down demand and commodity pricing   These companies have spent considerable sums acquiring and developing their assets  On occasion  investors tend to overlook the value of these investments and sell off stocks based on near term cash flow trends  These are the times when asset focused investors tend to come in and scoop up bargains  Any of the stocks I mention here are good candidates to consider buying based on that premise  by David
