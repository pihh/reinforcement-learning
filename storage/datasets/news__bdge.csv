Prepared Remarks 
OperatorGood day  and welcome to the Bridge Bancorp Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call   Operator Instructions I would like to turn the conference over to Kevin O Connor  President and CEO  Please go ahead Kevin M  O Connor    President And Chief Executive OfficerGood morning and thank you for joining us today  I will be discussing our quarterly and full year performance as well and as well as sharing some insights about the bank strategic initiatives  I m joined on our goal by our CFO john McCaffrey  and together we will take your questions regarding results in general market conditions  I am pleased to report the net income historical Hydras quarter 14 2 million  with ups of 71 cents per share  or full year income was 51 7 million to 259 a share  These results reflect the impact of growth earning assets  aggressive management of funding costs and the continued evolution of the mix and geography of our loan portfolio  I m especially proud of the fact that over the last two years  despite two changes in Fed direction  we ve maintained a consistent NIM of 3 3   We ve done this by staying true to our strategy of nurturing and growing core deposits and taking a thoughtful approach to balance sheet management Our continued commitment to our core markets and the addition of some key producers in our Western markets  a lot of strong long growth and strong growth in originations and fueled increases in most loan types  These new loans helped offset some sizable pay downs we experienced at several are a long term customers successfully exited their businesses  The net of the activity resulted in a 12  lift in the overall loan portfolio to 3 7 billion  And considering our composite performance  given to the kinetic decisions to de emphasize some higher rate deposit products  and the impact of large deposit flows related to the aforementioned business sales  it s best to assess this on an average basis Fourth quarter IPC deposits grew by  212 million or 7  versus Q4 2018 and the year over year growth was 12   with DDA of  1 5 billion  representing 40  of total deposits  We ve also been very aggressive in managing the cost of these deposits and over the past two quarters  the cost of interest bearing deposits is down 33 basis points  This positive momentum in loans was partially offset by declines in other earning assets and resulted in average asset growth of 5  versus last year  and we ended 2019 with total assets of  4 9 billion  From a strategic perspective  we continue to stay on course and are focused on making smart investments in people and technology by hiring more bankers who partnered with branch teams  this strategy continued to bear fruit This year  our Western markets contribute a significant portion  or 82  of annual net loan growth  And we experienced enough taking deposits in those markets have over 19   In addition  the launch of new products expanded our offerings and it s helping to drive market share in new segments as well as deeper relationships with existing customers  Earlier this year  we became one of the few banks in New York to offer banking services to companies with permits to grow process and extract industrial hemp in CBD  This should expand our traditional customer reach  We recently launched functionality that allowed businesses to print official cashier checks on site  This is considerable value from many of our existing customers and acts as a differentiator versus other competitors And finally  with significant technical and credit development work in 2019  we are planning to launch a small business loan decisioning engine to significantly reduce the time line associated with small loan originations  freeing up internal resources and reducing customer friction I ll now turn this over to John to discuss in greater detail specifics on the margin and other income and expenses John McCaffery    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer And TreasurerThank you  Kevin  Thank you all for joining us this morning  And for those meeting the transcript  I will do my best to be intelligible  Let me get to the margin right after that  The quarter over quarter NIM compressed by 14 basis points  I will walk you through the big moving parts of that decline  First and foremost  increased prepayment activity in the bond portfolio resulted in higher premium amortization  thus depressing yields  Secondarily  another phenomenon has to do with the timing of the changes in rates on our loans and deposits  During the third quarter  as we manage our deposit rates lower  several accounts were moved more than the fed move and we effectively lowered some rates before the Fed move Therefore  impact to our deposits was larger and quicker than our loans  Additionally  our floating rate loans and geographical we price immediately  some can take up to a month retexe prevailing rates for the Deputy Prime or live war  therefore  quarter visibility of the fourth quarter with the loans catching up to the deposits and adjusting to falling rates  Lastly  the third quarter usually has about three or four basis points of line of credit renewal fees that do not occur in the fourth quarter  At this point  our floating rate loans have adjusted to the new rate levels and we continue to manage our deposit cost lower by increasing DDA and enhancing the mix of interest bearing deposits  You will notice that ITP deposits are down quarter over quarter as we decline to compete for high cost 1031 money replacing with lower rate broker deposits  Most of the loan growth came late in the quarter  so we will see the full effect of those loans in Q1  Going forward  we can keep our hands on all levers to support our net interest margin  These are impacted by loan swaps  drove our noninterest income higher As referenced in the press release  the flat yield curve and the overall low level of rate make these transactions attractive to borrowers who want low long term financing  In the fourth quarter  we swapped over  180 million in loans giving us only 13 basis points versus the fixed pricing  These factors are still in effect and we continue to close loan slots in Q1  Expenses were up on a linked quarter basis  mostly due to cash accrual for incentive payments  Our strong fourth quarter income and loan growth pushed our expected incentive payouts higher  We have instituted several programs to control expenses going forward  We are in the final testing phases of our CECL process  At this time  we are guiding a coverage ratio of 87 to 97 basis points  This includes specific reserves  which add about nine basis points to the ratio at this time  This is not significantly far from where our ratio has been historically  We still have an authorized stock buyback and are committed to using it to support our stock as we did last year during the second and third quarter  We are estimating a tax rate of 22 5  for 2020 Kevin will now make some closing remarks Kevin M  O Connor    President And Chief Executive OfficerAs john indicated this quarter s margin contraction is relative several factors  However  we believe our ability to manage funding costs and deliver non interest income in multiple ways  coupled with a focused approach to aggressively manage expenses and capital will allow us to achieve on performance targets  The ability our team was tested in 2019  and they delivered and I m competent to continue to build and make the prudent decisions including those related accounts  management to achieve positive results for the company and you  our shareholders I will now turn this over to the operator to take questions Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions  The first question comes from Will Curtiss from the Hovde Group  Please go ahead Will Curtiss    The Hovde Group    AnalystHey  good morning everyone Kevin M  O Connor    President And Chief Executive OfficerMorning  Will Will Curtiss    The Hovde Group    AnalystObviously  a strong quarter on the swap fees  So I m just curious now as we look to the first quarter your expectations  Or how should we think about the first quarter  And then maybe more broadly  how we should think about fee income growth for this year John McCaffery    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer And TreasurerSure  So    I mean  we do have    we closed several swap    loan swaps in January already  We have some in the pipeline  So again  as long as this rate environment is here will keep booking those fees  Q4 was pretty strong coming up to Q3  but again  I think it still follows the rate environment  And I think that the reason some of these borrowers want to go long term as we have multifamily borrowers in New York City given the new rent regulations are wanting to lock in lower to longer since they feel they re not going to be able to raise rents as quickly as they have in the past  So I think those factors together are what are going to keep that going into the quarter  And again  for the year  we can keep this momentum going  Some of those swap fees are generated from actually refinances of existing loans  So as much as we have loans that are out there that people want to come in and refinance as they got from renewals  that can also be a benefit there Will Curtiss    The Hovde Group    AnalystOkay  And then I wanted to ask  I know you mentioned hires as part of the strategy for last year  And I m just curious do you have the number of producers that you all brought on board this past year  And then maybe how you re thinking about additional opportunities going forward Kevin M  O Connor    President And Chief Executive OfficerI guess we had a net increase of five on the producer side and we re having conversations with half dozen people set it  and not say we re going to bring them many people on  But this is the time of the year when bankers to begin the dance between each other as to they re going to get their bonus throughout  Phonetic  out where they want to earn it next year Will Curtiss    The Hovde Group    AnalystUnderstood  Okay  And then just the last one from me  Do you have the accretion number for the fourth quarter by any chance John McCaffery    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer And TreasurerThe accretion number Will Curtiss    The Hovde Group    AnalystYes Kevin M  O Connor    President And Chief Executive OfficerThe premium amortization piece   John McCaffery    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer And TreasurerPremium amortization Will Curtiss    The Hovde Group    AnalystI think last quarter  it was four to five basis points  I believe Kevin M  O Connor    President And Chief Executive OfficerThe impact of purchase accounting John McCaffery    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer And TreasurerSo purchase accounting  Purchase accounting is minimal  It s one to two basis points of that  There s only a couple million dollars left in the whole bank  Last quarter    I think the second quarter was higher than usual but last quarter and this quarter is that    tracking about the same Will Curtiss    The Hovde Group    AnalystUnderstood  Thank you OperatorThe next question comes from David Bishop from D A  Davidson  Please go ahead David Bishop    D A  Davidson    AnalystHey  guys  Good morning Kevin M  O Connor    President And Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  David John McCaffery    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer And TreasurerGood morning  David David Bishop    D A  Davidson    AnalystA question  obviously noted the pressure on the margin in the fourth quarter  This sounds like there were some elevation there in the third quarter  Just curious  do you think most of the pressure on the asset yields has been sales  And it sounds like you had some room on the deposit side to bring costs down  Do you think you can stabilize it here  Or do you expect we ll see a little bit more pressure here before we see some stabilization in the second half of the year John McCaffery    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer And TreasurerI think the most part the loan pressure is off as far as repricings go  And I do think we have room in deposit  I think we can offset those things  If you look second quarter to fourth quarter  the third quarter kind of being the surge deposit benefit  We kind of track across kind of on the same level  So we think that that s kind of where we can be going forward David Bishop    D A  Davidson    AnalystIs EME the delta between the second and the fourth  I am sorry John McCaffery    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer And TreasurerRight  The second quarter and the fourth    the second quarter was  330 million and the fourth quarter was  326 million  There s also a little bit to go in those back and forth  but we think that range should be able to be sustained given the move in deposits and loans over that period of time  kind of  for us the rate cut cycle Kevin M  O Connor    President And Chief Executive OfficerAnd I would think that we were early on moving rates in really early in the third quarter and continued in the fourth  And as I ve reviewed many of the releases of our competitors that has occurred more in the fourth quarter  So I think you will see continued repricing down of liabilities John McCaffery    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer And TreasurerAnd we have some recent customers who kind of walked in when we told them we were cutting rates  They actually go over to some bank can get a better rate  then they kind of came back to do that rate is not there anymore either  So I think everyone is kind of getting on board with the cutting rates on deposit again David Bishop    D A  Davidson    AnalystGot it  And then in terms of new loan yields coming on board  Just curious how that compares relative to the third quarter  in maybe be it six weeks or so  how are the new market yields coming John McCaffery    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer And TreasurerSo the yields on new loans in the fourth quarter were about 4   That was because we had a lot of multifamily loans come along in the fourth quarter  And there were    then there were swaps  So that takes again  that 13  15 basis points off the rate  But    and I don t    and no one s expecting rates to go up anytime soon  We feel having the floating rate assets  especially on some of this longer term fee or multifamily money is better for us  So    but the focus this year in some of the new producers we brought on are going to be more focused on C I  The C I business during Q4 came on at 5 5   And the commercial mortgages and sales growth was a little over 4   So we re hoping by changing the mix up we re going to get better loan yields David Bishop    D A  Davidson    AnalystGot it  And then maybe just a commentary  obviously the fourth quarter  it sounded like some of the    the multifamily growth was driven by some of the rent control and the desire to lock in lower rates for longer  As you look out into 2020 in the pipelines  any sort of comments in terms of your expectations for loan growth John McCaffery    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer And TreasurerWe re    I guess  our expectation for loan growth for the entire bank is slightly less than it was last year in 2019 point to point  And we are certainly targeting more of a mix of commercial loans and less multifamily for the year  I think the    again as we sit with this yield curve environment and we are getting paid less for each of the    each margin piece is we put on  we re not looking to grow it as high as rates we have in the past  But still pretty strong and pretty close to where we were  I think high single digits David Bishop    D A  Davidson    AnalystGot it  Then one final question  John  it wasn t clear  the tax rate outlook for this year John McCaffery    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer And TreasurerWe re saying 22 5  David Bishop    D A  Davidson    Analyst22 5  John McCaffery    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer And TreasurerYes David Bishop    D A  Davidson    AnalystGot it  Thank you Operator Operator Instructions  The next question comes from Erik Zwick from Boenning and Scattergood  Please go ahead Erik Zwick    Boenning And Scattergood    AnalystGood morning  guys Kevin M  O Connor    President And Chief Executive OfficerGood morning  Erik Erik Zwick    Boenning And Scattergood    AnalystJust looking at that change in deposit balances year over year while total balances were down  I guess  about 2   demand deposits were up 9  and your IPC deposits now represent 80  of total deposits up from 76  a year ago  Can you just talk about what factors contributed to the success in remixing the deposit base and what your expectations for deposit growth in 2020 are now that loan deposit ratio is at 96  John McCaffery    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer And TreasurerRight  So we have a few moving parts in the deposits year over year  Remember while we did have    if you remember last year  in the first quarter  we kind of were talking about this large one deposit that we had from a customer that Kevin referenced  we sold the business  That    he had kind of moved that money out and he sold this business  gave us the deposit and then he was investing in other things  So that was about  90 million in money market account and one account  The 1031 money that we also    when rates starting to go down  we were paying them just about 2  and they were still getting 2  from other people So we decided to let that money go  That was another  90 million that would be in savings accounts  So there was some flow out of that  The DDA growth is    that s just boots on the ground for us  So we    we haven t seen    we haven t seen a broad based exhibit of money marketing or savings accounts leave the bank based upon the rate cuts that we get in Q3  There s been more chunky deposits  so people just    we have transactions  they need to fund  They were pulling the money out for that reason or they were the highest paying customers that we had  that we chose not to match rates they ll be getting other places Kevin M  O Connor    President And Chief Executive OfficerDDA generation really comes from the commercial bankers on the ground  I mean  we ve had a big increase in sort of line exposure  And that really flows from those customers that have joined us  They moved their deposits  We give them lines of credit  Sometimes they draw  sometimes they don t  But that s really the driver of deposit growth Erik Zwick    Boenning And Scattergood    AnalystI appreciate the color there  And would you be    would you expect to    for deposit growth to match loan growth this year  Or are you comfortable letting the loan to deposit ratio drift up a little bit higher John McCaffery    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer And TreasurerI m comfortable letting it drift up a little bit higher  That s not how I m forecasting it  I m certainly expecting deposits to grow commensurate with loans  That s the challenge we put in front of everybody  And I think there s lots of positive momentum going into this year Erik Zwick    Boenning And Scattergood    AnalystGreat  And then you mentioned several programs on the expense side to kind of manage expenses in 2020  Curious just one from first quarter perspective  in terms of the run rate  is the fourth quarter of  19 level a good place to start  And then how should we think about just kind of growth and expenses throughout the year John McCaffery    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer And TreasurerSo I would say then with    that the first quarter for 2020 should be slightly lower than 2019 Q4  We are    we came in a little bit higher than 2  on the    on the expenses to asset ratio  But we want to get back down to two and even drive a little bit lower as the year goes on  We will be    so we will be looking at our expense budget  prospectively to say  if we re not getting the income or the balance sheet growth  we re going to kind of that drives you back on the expenses  So we ll keep looking at it over the year  The growth and expenses that were related to some manual fraud work that we were doing for the year and then we put a new software system in place and they were run concurrently  So we should be able to as we had some of those people who were doing a manual fraud review to other things We are looking at or we have begun to  in attrition  manage our branch staffing model  make people a little more universal employees in the branches so they can do different tasks in the branches  especially when transactions are a little bit slower    we are putting in more    I think the numerated product that Kevin talked about before should free up some people on the origination space and the loans to do other loans or we don t have to replace them  So there s a few things going on as far as expense control go  I think we re also looking at cutting back a little bit on sponsorships this year as we have a new marketing director in place and we re changing our marketing spend in different venues  focusing more on the western markets and by remixing some of our how each dollar that we spend there as well David Bishop    D A  Davidson    AnalystAnd just finally  given the strong commercial real estate and multifamily growth in the fourth quarter  Do you have an estimate of where your CRE to total capital ended the year  I think you re around 350  at the end of the third quarter  Just curious  I would expect that ticked up a little bit John McCaffery    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer And Treasurer386  at the end of the year Erik Zwick    Boenning And Scattergood    AnalystGreat  thank you so much for taking my questions John McCaffery    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer And TreasurerYou re welcome OperatorThe next question comes from Alex Twerdahl from Piper Sandler  Please go ahead Alex Twerdahl    Piper Sandler    AnalystGood morning Kevin M  O Connor    President And Chief Executive OfficerHey  Alex Alex Twerdahl    Piper Sandler    AnalystJust going back to the swap fee income which is obviously a huge quarter for that in the fourth quarter  And now we ve seen the momentum growing through the end of 2019  Is that    the fourth quarter is more kind of like a perfect storm of rates and appetite  et cetera  and is it like a really big quarter  Or do you think that we re going to be as that business has ramped up  you could kind of repeat that at least for the foreseeable future John McCaffery    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer And TreasurerIt is    so again  all of those factors still are in place and we ll still getting increase in close the two loans in January for the same reasons we did in Q4  January I think overall is kind of a slow month for people as they re doing their taxes and getting their financials together  So I think it s going to    and fourth quarter typically is a more busy quarter for loan originations  So throughout the year if conditions stay in place  then we can do more as the year goes on  So whether it s the first quarter or the second quarter  you can see last year  it kind of ramp up  But it is based upon the flows of the business itself  So we re still seeing them  We think we can come close to last year s number  But may be differences in timing as to when that happens Kevin M  O Connor    President And Chief Executive OfficerIt would be great if we could control customers  behavior  But at certain points in time we do get chunky growth in the second and fourth quarters Alex Twerdahl    Piper Sandler    AnalystOkay  So lot of volatility in that line  The full year maybe it comes in that kind of  6 million to  7 million range if everything goes right John McCaffery    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer And TreasurerCorrect Alex Twerdahl    Piper Sandler    AnalystOkay  And then just given the very strong loan growth and it seems like a lot of it happened kind of late in the quarter  Does that mean that maybe the sort of the pipeline needs to rebuild as you head into the first quarter  Or was the backlog still pretty good for the ability to actually close loans in the first quarter John McCaffery    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer And TreasurerBut there s    first quarter is typically focused because of people s behavior and what s going on  Our pipeline is showing  300 million of new money and almost  500 million in kind of including refinancings  So if you look at   Kevin M  O Connor    President And Chief Executive OfficerI think it s down about  100 million from where we began in the fourth quarter I would say John McCaffery    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer And TreasurerYes Alex Twerdahl    Piper Sandler    AnalystDown about a  100 million  Okay  And then you just have just handy the impact on the margin from the prepays in the fourth quarter John McCaffery    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer And TreasurerYes  We haven t  I m going to say it s not a lot Kevin M  O Connor    President And Chief Executive OfficerAre you talking about the prepayment on the MBS portfolio Alex Twerdahl    Piper Sandler    AnalystYes  I m just trying to get a sense for kind of what the right    kind of the real driver of the margin  It seems like most of it was driven by the mismatch and the timing of loan yields versus funding costs coming down third quarter to the fourth quarter  But there is anything else that might be coming in nonrecurring that we should be paying attention to John McCaffery    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer And TreasurerYes  So prepayments on loans    of our loans was about  200 000 in the fourth quarter  The prepayments on the investment portfolio had about  versus the second quarter  probably a five basis point impact  And probably that depends on how you want to measure the increase in the premium amortization on the portfolio Alex Twerdahl    Piper Sandler    AnalystVersus the third quarter event  right John McCaffery    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer And TreasurerVersus the second quarter Alex Twerdahl    Piper Sandler    AnalystVersus second quarter  Okay John McCaffery    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer And TreasurerVersus the third because it ramped up in the third quarter as well and continued going up into the fourth quarter  So versus the third quarter it was probably three basis points Alex Twerdahl    Piper Sandler    AnalystOkay  All right  great  Thanks for taking my questions Kevin M  O Connor    President And Chief Executive OfficerAll right Operator Operator Instructions  The next question comes from Collyn Gilbert from KBW  Please go ahead Collyn Gilbert    KBW    AnalystThanks  Good morning gentlemen Kevin M  O Connor    President And Chief Executive OfficerMorning  Collyn Collyn Gilbert    KBW    AnalystI just want to dig into the loan dynamic a little bit here and just make sure I m understanding this right  So the multifamily loans that came on this quarter  I know you gave some of the origination yields  But what were the    what was kind of the blended yield on the multifamily loans that came on this quarter Kevin M  O Connor    President And Chief Executive OfficerThis quarter  3 56  Collyn Gilbert    KBW    AnalystOkay  So I guess  it seems as if the    and I understand your    the outlook for the year and mix shift benefit moving for the year  But if we just assume kind of the flow through of what came on this quarter  I guess  it seems like that loan yield can continue to compress  I don t want to say fairly meaningfully  But if you re looking at a portfolio yield of 4 50  or 4 45   I guess  it was for the quarter and most of the stuff coming on  And then I m just trying to reconcile that with    I know you re talking about lower deposit outlook  but it just seems like you re really now maybe perhaps below even where the market is which I ll ask that question in a second  But just first on the loan yield side  I mean  can you quantify maybe a little bit more as to where you think the compression in the loan yield could go as the year progresses John McCaffery    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer And TreasurerSo I guess one reason maybe I ll just jump ahead  Maybe the reason we look for a little bit below market is because if we re doing effectively floating rates multifamily loans and not five or seven or 10 year fixed rate  were giving up about 13 basis points there  So going forward  I mean  maybe rates will go up  But again  it s going to be focused on mix of the loan portfolio away from CRE and multifamily to an extent  I mean  again we still have multifamily loan in portfolio that coming for refinancing and against no smart fees   But I think it s    to some extent  it s a seesaw between putting more multifamily than having more swap fees  If they re good loans you could do them  but again  how much we can compress the margin or how much we can compress the loan yields for the year  I mean  is based upon doing more multifamily Kevin M  O Connor    President And Chief Executive OfficerI mean  if I look at the pipeline that s out there today  the weighted average rate on that is in the 470s Because of the mix of commercial that s part of it  So while the fourth quarter was a ponderance with multifamily which should be going through 2020 upgrade or mix of C I which carries little bit higher rate  So   John McCaffery    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer And TreasurerBased upon our projections our loan yields kind of stay flat for the year  Based upon the mix that we had from our plan going forward Collyn Gilbert    KBW    AnalystOkay  Got it  And then just    then on the deposit side  just curious now where some of the CD rates or your higher rate products  what    where those are  What the offering rates are on those  And if you re kind of below market on some of those higher rate products John McCaffery    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer And TreasurerSo we don t really have    I think we have a high rate CD out there  it s 2  for two years  But it s    we don t really make    at some of our market  we don t have a lot of customers that come in with other agents looking for rate products Kevin M  O Connor    President And Chief Executive OfficerWe actually    that attempt at one point in time when rates were rising  those lost money in with CDs in our branches and our customers and we just don t have that sort of consumer base and our customers are not trained  they don t come here looking for higher rates  So I guess  we are    we ve always been below peer on the deposit side  I think the deposit franchise that we ve built over the last 100 years are really  quite honestly  the last dozen years reflects our commercial bank and deposit franchise which is geared toward DDA  it s geared toward money market as to your excess liquidity for our customers  So we ve been below peer  We were below peer when rates are going up  I think we ll be below peer as rates go down A measure of success of our commercial banking officers and our relationship  it is much about the deposits they bring  it isn t about the loss  And so we continue to feel    I mean  I think the 40  DDA was when this company was  600 million in size and it s 40  DDA and  5 billion in size  So we ve kept tied to our mission  So that s the part that we re most proud of and that s the value of this franchise is its deposits and we ll continue to manage that aggressively John McCaffery    Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer And TreasurerAs we went through and lowered deposit rates in the third and fourth quarter  we realized that upwards of 80  of our money market accounts were priced individually  We had to go in there and bring those rates down one account at a time  I guess  that s kind of how we do it with our customers  So So I think when you say  we have  we have a record out there  but that s just dangling just to bring people in the door  we don t get deposits that way Kevin M  O Connor    President And Chief Executive OfficerI think the right way might be three basis points Collyn Gilbert    KBW    AnalystOkay  Okay  very good  I think I ll leave it there  Thanks guys Kevin M  O Connor    President And Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Collyn OperatorThis concludes our question and answer session  I would like to turn the conference back over to Kevin O Connor for any closing remarks Kevin M  O Connor    President And Chief Executive OfficerI guess and I want to thank everybody again  And if you indulge from    I want to take a moment to acknowledge the passing this week of a loyal customer and a great friend of mine of the bank  Roger Fox  He was one of our first customers a dozen years ago when we opened our branch in Deer Park  And as I look at the businesses we ve grown in these new markets that we talk about  much of it connected in some ways to the network of people he has introduced us to  He was a big advocate of the bank  He walked around wearing our pin proudly  He ll be missed by all of us  And I just    I want to take a moment  So I appreciate that  So again  thank you  We re excited about the prospects for 2020  I think that we ve demonstrated to you our ability to sort of manage through different cycle conversations about expenses and capital  So now we ll adjust and make the right decisions as events occur So again  thank you  and I look forward to talking to each individual Operator Operator Closing Remarks Duration  32 minutesCall participants Kevin M  O Connor    President And Chief Executive OfficerJohn McCaffery    Executive Vice
