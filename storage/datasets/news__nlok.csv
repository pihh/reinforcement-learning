LONDON  Reuters    Cybersecurity company Avast said demand for products that protected users  privacy  such as VPN and AntiTrack  would drive revenue growth for the year to the upper end of its high  single digit percentage range after a 9  rise in the first half 
London listed Avast  which has grown through a  freemium  model of giving away its basic antivirus software and then selling additional services  said customers were increasingly aware of online risks 
 AntiTrack helps users to stop tracking from both advertisers and other data collectors   Chief Executive Ondrej Vlcek said in a interview 
 It makes it much harder for both advertisers and other entities that want to track you on the Internet to do that  
Avast has also seen strong demand for its high security browser  he said  with the number of active users rising to about 40 million  The company monetizes the browser through search revenue and advertising  he said 
Shares in Prague based Avast  which listed in May 2018  rose to a new high of 322 pence in early trade on Wednesday following its results 
The company reported a 9 2  rise in first half adjusted revenue to  421 7 million  ahead of a company supplied consensus estimate of  414 million 
Adjusted core earnings rose 6 5  to  236 5 million  beating a forecast of  229 million 
Cyber security stocks have been boosted by chipmaker Broadcom s acquisition of antivirus software maker Symantec  NASDAQ SYMC  Corp s enterprise unit this month

42528,264043,NLOK,UK based tech investor Notion Capital raises  150 million for new fund,news,"By Douglas Busvine
BERLIN  Reuters    British tech investor Notion Capital has raised  150 million for its fourth venture fund dedicated to European start ups offering software as a service  bringing total assets under management to more than half a billion dollars 
The fund launch comes as Notion marks its 10th year of investing in cloud based software firms that have the potential to shake up industries by offering online services that are easy to use and can be quickly scaled 
Notion invests in companies that have received initial support from individual investors and are in need of  post seed  funding  They typically have  1 million in annual revenues 
 We then look to take them on the  1 million to  100 million journey   Managing Partner and Co founder Stephen Chandler told Reuters in an interview 
Notion has achieved returns approaching three times on its first fund and investments it has sold on include marketing firm NewVoiceMedia  acquired by Vonage a year ago for  350 million 
That doesn t include investments that the fund still holds  such as invoicing platform Tradeshift  in which Notion invested  7 million in 2011 
Tradeshift raised  250 million in a Series E funding round led by Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  Principal Strategic Investments in May 2018  and is on course to float on the stock market within the next couple of years  said Chandler 
A more typical exit route for Notion would be to a trade or strategic investor  meaning it doesn t face the wide difference in valuations on private and public equity markets that have hit big U S  tech IPOs of late 
Notion  which describes itself as Europe s largest dedicated financier of business to business software firms  was itself set up by alumni of cloud based security provider MessageLabs  sold to Symantec  NASDAQ SYMC  in 2008 for  700 million 
Backers of its fourth fund include British Patient Capital  Texas A M University Endowment and S Cubed Capital  as well as founders of firms including MoneySupermarket  Moonpig  Ocado  LON OCDO   Play com  TAG  FeelUnique and others 
One name missing from the roster is the European Investment Fund  which had previously supported Notion but was unable to agree terms to address Britain s planned exit from the European Union 
Chandler  who expressed dismay at the political uncertainty around Brexit  said Notion would continue to invest in continental Europe and hoped to work again in future with the European Investment Fund ",2019-10-03,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/ukbased-tech-investor-notion-capital-raises-150-million-for-new-fund-1991233,1991233
42529,264044,NLOK,Undercover entrepreneurs  fearful Mexican tech startups shun spotlight,news,"By Julia Love and Daina Beth Solomon
MEXICO CITY  Reuters    In Mexico s burgeoning startup scene  publicity is the last thing many entrepreneurs want 
Unlike plenty of their P R  hungry counterparts in Silicon Valley  Mexican startup founders often decline media interviews  avoid public announcements and suppress details of financial success 
One big reason  they do not want to attract criminals 
 You are getting yourself in a position where you could be subject to ransom   entrepreneur Ulises Vazquez said of the drug fueled violence and kidnappings that have scarred society 
 You want to have a low profile to be able to continue with your freedom   he added  Vazquez twice kept quiet on major startup milestones  when he sold a stake in his advertising agency Ergos in 2010  and when the acquiring firm  Matomy  TA MTMY   went public in 2014 
Though understandable  the low profile approach is holding back Mexico s technology industry  investors and experts say  making it harder to attract talent and money  especially from abroad 
Mexico s tech sector last year drew only  175 million in venture capital  according to the Association for Private Capital Investment in Latin America  That was dwarfed by Brazil  the region s powerhouse  which received  1 3 billion  but also trailed Colombia  which drew  334 million in venture capital though its economy is worth about a quarter of Mexico s 
Reuters spoke with two dozen investors and startup founders who acknowledged that security concerns were widespread in the tech community and had even pushed some entrepreneurs abroad 
Illustrating the concern  most declined to speak on the record  
Without publicity  entrepreneurs struggle to recruit the best  bring in money and inspire the next generation  said Daniel Green  a partner at Silicon Valley law firm Gunderson Dettmer who advises startups across Latin America  
 It certainly stunts the growth   he said 
 LIVING AT RISK 
To be sure  violence is rampant elsewhere in Latin America  from drug torn Colombia to crime ridden Brazil 
But the issue is especially acute in Mexico due to an escalation of violence from over a decade ago when the government sent armed forces into the streets to crack down on the cartels  Around the same time  drug gangs began branching into extortion   
A string of high profile kidnappings and murders  including the death of an executive at broadcaster Televisa killed on his bike during a shootout in 2017  rattled the elite  
That has generated business for executive protection firms  who provide bullet proof vehicles  GPS trackers  armed bodyguards and real time monitoring 
For startups  the fears may be more perception than reality  there are no known cases of tech entrepreneurs being attacked after sharing their company s success 
And some do still announce their deals 
Bismarck Lepe  chief executive of software company Wizeline  believes his peers are being over cautious  despite the horrors Mexico has suffered 
 Communicating more about your success helps the community  helps the company  helps the investors   said Lepe  who divides his time between Silicon Valley and Mexico 
 As long as you are not involved in the drug trade  nothing is going to happen to you  
Mexican entrepreneur Domingo Guerra  who founded cybersecurity startup Appthority in California  said he is not generally worried about safety when he returns home  But he did feel uncomfortable after announcing a funding round 
 Folks were asking how I was going to spend the money  what I was going to buy first   said Guerra  now a senior director at cybersecurity giant Symantec  O SYMC  after the acquisition of his company in 2018   I spent a lot of time explaining that really none of that money was for the founders  
One startup founder  assigned a U S  Army veteran trained in anti kidnapping maneuvers by a firm acquiring his company  became fed up of having to take a different route home every day and eventually relocated with his family to the United States 
Another who founded his startup in the San Francisco area said American colleagues were frustrated by his quiet approach due to fears for his relatives back in Mexico 
 There s an unofficial tax for operating and living in Mexico   and that tax is living at risk   he said  
FROM SCOOTER TO SUV
Some entrepreneurs have simply faded from public view 
Adolfo Babatz  the chief executive of Mexican payments company Clip  was once a staple of the local business press  In 2018  he gave at least five published interviews and graced the cover of business magazine Expansion beside the headline   Think big  
He took a different tack this year after SoftBank  T 9984  pumped about  20 million into his company  making him among the first Mexican entrepreneurs to win the Japanese conglomerate s stamp of approval  Babatz did not announce the deal and appears to have given few interviews so far in 2019 
SoftBank  which plans to pour  5 billion into Latin America  declined to comment 
Some entrepreneurs advocate workarounds  
Gabriel Leon  who recently launched fintech company Oyster Financial in Mexico  plans to disclose company funding rounds on an online database  rather than via the media 
 We never talk about money   he said   We talk about the product we re building  the opportunity in the market  our competitors  That s how you get attention from investors   
Some entrepreneurs say the political climate  with leftist President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador frequently crusading against the elites  has made it an additionally awkward time to tout multi million deals in a culture that frowns on bragging 
Mexico s Economy Ministry did not respond to Reuters requests to discuss the startup sector s security concerns 
Sergio Romo  chief executive of Mexican scooter startup Grin  followed a similar trajectory to Babatz after a  45 7 million funding round last year 
Earlier this year  Romo  who was known for tooling around the capital in his company s neon green scooters  left a meeting with Mexico City regulators in a large SUV with tinted windows  according to someone who participated in the meeting 
Romo told Reuters that was unusual and he still uses scooters  but acknowledged keeping a low profile was advisable 
 People outside the startup world tend to think that founders who raise a lot of money become rich themselves  but sometimes that s not the case   he said 
 We are just founders trying to make it happen

 Reuters    Chipmaker Broadcom  NASDAQ AVGO  Inc said on Thursday it will buy antivirus software maker Symantec  NASDAQ SYMC  Corp s enterprise security unit for  10 7 billion in cash to scale up its software business through deals 
Shares of Symantec rose 3 6  and Broadcom 2  in extended trading 
Broadcom last year bought U S  business software maker CA Inc  NASDAQ CA  for  18 9 billion and was reportedly in talks to buy infrastructure software company Tibco Software Inc  which was taken private by Vista Equity Partners for  4 3 billion in 2014 
Its push to software came after a failed attempt last year to buy mobile chipmaker Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  Inc for  117 billion  which was scuttled by the Trump administration  citing national security 
 M A has played a central role in Broadcom s growth strategy and this transaction represents the next logical step in our strategy   Broadcom Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan said 
Through a string of acquisitions  Tan has propelled the chipmaker that was worth just a few billions to a market capitalization of about  108 billion in the 13 years that he has been at the helm 
Broadcom said the Symantec deal is expected to close in the first quarter of its fiscal year 2020 and is subject to regulatory approvals in the United States  European Union and Japan  It plans to raise fresh debt to fund the deal 
Symantec s enterprise security unit offers a mix of security products and services to business and government customers  helping them improve their security  while reducing cost and complexity 
Revenue at the unit  which is being sold to Broadcom  rose 9 9  to  611 million  Analysts on average had expected  564 3 million

NEW YORK  Reuters    U S  stocks rose on Wednesday  with each of the major indexes closing at a record high  as expectations grew that the Federal Reserve would take a more dovish turn as a raft of data provided more evidence of a slowing economy 
Benchmark U S  10 year Treasury Note yields  US10YT RR  touched its lowest since November 2016 at 1 939   while euro zone yields tumbled to record lows on bets the European Central Bank s next chief would stay a dovish course 
Data on Wednesday showed the U S  trade deficit jumped to a five month high while services sector data showed a slowdown in activity  The reports come on the heels of data on housing  manufacturing  business investment and consumer spending that point to slowing economic growth in the quarter 
 The data has been mixed  it hasn t been terrible  sort of a decline generally   said Thomas Martin  senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments in Atlanta  Georgia 
 Certainly the bond market is continuing to hit fresh yield lows so that is a message there is a definite slowing and the central banks will have to cut  I guess the equity markets are saying that is going to be OK

Rising expectations for a rate cut  fueled by softer economic data and comments from global central banks indicating a more dovish stance helped the S P 500 and the Dow Jones indexes post their best June performance in decades 
The Atlanta Fed on Wednesday trimmed its second quarter GDP growth view to 1 3  on an annualized rate  down from 1 5  on Monday 
Trading volumes were thin due to shortened trading hours on Wednesday ahead of the July Fourth holiday  About 4 15 billion shares changed hands in U S  exchanges  compared with the 6 89 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions

42642,264157,NLOK,Two out of three hotels accidentally leak guests  personal data  Symantec,news,"By Angela Moon
 Reuters    Two out of three hotel websites inadvertently leak guests  booking details and personal data to third party sites  including advertisers and analytics companies  according to research released by  Symantec Corp   NASDAQ SYMC  on Wednesday 
The study  which looked at more than 1 500 hotel websites in 54 countries that ranged from two star to five star properties  comes several months after Marriott International disclosed one of the worst data breaches in history 
Symantec said Marriott was not included in the study 
Compromised personal information includes full names  email addresses  credit card details and passport numbers of guests that could be used by cybercriminals who are increasingly interested in the movements of influential business professionals and government employees  Symantec said 
 While it s no secret that advertisers are tracking users  browsing habits  in this case  the information shared could allow these third party services to log into a reservation  view personal details and even cancel the booking altogether   said Candid Wueest  the primary researcher on the study 
The research showed compromises usually occur when a hotel site sends confirmation emails with a link that has direct booking information  The reference code attached to the link could be shared with more than 30 different service providers  including social networks  search engines and advertising and analytics services   
Wueest said 25 percent of data privacy officers at the affected hotel sites did not reply to Symantec within six weeks when notified of the issue  and those who did took an average of 10 days to respond 

 Some admitted that they are still updating their systems to be fully GDPR compliant   Wueest said  referring to Europe s new privacy law  or the General Data Protection Regulation  which took effect about a year ago and has strict guidelines on how organizations should deal with data leakage ",2019-04-10,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/two-out-of-three-hotels-accidentally-leak-guests-personal-data-symantec-1832220,1832220

42710,264225,NLOK,China denies  slanderous  economic espionage charges from U S   allies,news,"By Philip Wen TIANJIN  China  Reuters    China s Foreign Ministry said on Friday it resolutely opposed  slanderous  accusations from the United States and other allies criticizing China for economic espionage  urging Washington to withdraw its accusations  The United States should also withdraw charges against two Chinese citizens  the ministry said  adding that China had never participated in or supported any stealing of commercial secrets and had lodged  stern representations  with Washington   We urge the U S  side to immediately correct its erroneous actions and cease its slanderous smears relating to internet security   it said  adding that it would take necessary measures to safeguard its own cybersecurity and interests  It has long been an  open secret  that U S  government agencies have hacked into and listening in on foreign governments  companies and individuals  the ministry added   The U S  side making unwarranted criticisms of China in the name of so called  cyber stealing  is blaming others while oneself is to be blamed  and is self deception  China absolutely cannot accept this   U S  prosecutors indicted two Chinese nationals linked to China s Ministry of State Security intelligence agency on charges of stealing confidential data from American government agencies and businesses around the world  Prosecutors charged Zhu Hua and Zhang Shilong in hacking attacks against the U S  Navy  the space agency NASA and the Energy Department and dozens of companies  The operation targeted intellectual property and corporate secrets to give Chinese companies an unfair competitive advantage  they said  The pair were members of a hacking group known within the cyber security community as APT 10 and also worked for a Tianjin company Huaying Haitai Science and Technology Development Co  prosecutors said  Reuters was unable to locate immediately contact details for Zhu or Zhang  Corporate records show Huaying Haitai is registered at an address in a non descript yellow office tower complex in the southern fringes of Tianjin  which is about an hour s drive southeast of capital Beijing   A woman who answered the door to the small unmarked office told Reuters she worked for an advertising company which had only moved in months earlier   She confirmed the previous occupants were a company called Huaying Haitai  but said she was unsure what they did  PROPERTY THEFT Britain  Australia and New Zealand joined the United States in slamming China over what they called a global campaign of cyber enabled commercial intellectual property theft  signaling growing global coordination against the practice   China s Foreign Ministry said Britain and other countries had also made  slanderous comments  stemming from  ulterior motives    Five sources familiar with the attacks told Reuters the hackers breached the networks of  Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co   N HPE  and  IBM   N IBM   then used the access to hack into their clients  computers  IBM said it had no evidence that sensitive data had been compromised  HPE said it could not comment  Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters she noted IBM s statement that it had no evidence sensitive data had been compromised  Certain people in the United States have taken to regular slandering of China  Hua told reporters   Perhaps they think that if they repeat a lie 1 000 times it becomes the truth  But I want to tell them that it s still a lie even if repeated 10 000 times   China U S  ties in recent months have also been affected by a protracted trade war  though there is currently a truce as both countries try and work out a resolution  Asked whether China s anger over the cyber accusations would impact upon China U S  trade talks  Hua reiterated a line from the ministry s statement earlier in the day that if the United States did not mend its ways then relations would be seriously harmed  Adding to the tensions  on Thursday China denounced a new U S  law related to Tibet  The official China Daily wrote in an editorial on Friday that the new Tibet related legislation added an  additional flashpoint  to already rocky relations   With Washington favoring a confrontational approach aimed at maintaining its hegemony rather than a cooperative one for the common good  Beijing will have to be prepared to stand its ground and respond as necessary to safeguard its core interests   The Australian foreign affairs and home affairs departments said in a statement that APT 10 was engaged in  sustained cyber intrusions  on large managed service providers  MSPs   or information technology contractors globally   Australia calls on all countries  including China  to uphold commitments to refrain from cyber enabled theft of intellectual property  trade secrets and confidential business information with the intent of obtaining a competitive advantage   the joint statement said  An Australian government source said the Chinese had breached  a small number  of targets but the extent of the attack was unclear   We may never know how many companies were impacted   said the source  who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment on the attacks   We ve informed those caught up but we need others to make urgent checks   Nick Savvides  chief technology officer for cybersecurity provider  Symantec Corp   O SYMC  in Asia Pacific  said in an email that cyber espionage had become  overt in recent years

42768,264283,NLOK,Crossover Health  a little known startup that got a big boost when Apple picked it to run medical clinics for staff  is ramping up big time,news,Crossover Health  a company that runs on site or near site healthcare clinics for large employers  has been gaining traction   In July  the company had its 1 millionth patient visit  with plans for another 500 000 visits in the next 12 months   Companies like Crossover are growing at a time when employers are looking at ways to cut down on their own healthcare costs   From in house chefs to cold brew to bikes on campus  tech companies have always been looking for perks to give them a competitive edge  One perk Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  landed on back in 2011  on site health clinics  The world s biggest tech company chose to work with a little known startup called Crossover Health to operate its medical clinics in its Cupertino headquarters which would give employees access to healthcare without having to leave the Apple campus    Fast forward eight years later and Southern California based Crossover has grown to operate 13 on site clinics and five near sight clinics in the San Francisco Bay Area  Boston  and Texas  The company now works with other large companies like Facebook  NASDAQ FB   Comcast  NASDAQ CMCSA  Universal  and LinkedIn  NYSE LNKD     Crossover still works with other Apple employees in locations outside headquarters   Crossover has been gaining traction  In July  the company had its 1 millionth patient visit  with plans for another 500 000 visits over the 12 months for its 175 000 employee members  It s also picked up  113 5 million from investors including Gurnet Point Capital and Norwest Venture Partners   For many Americans  their employers are the ones picking up the tab for their healthcare  More  population is covered by an employer sponsored healthcare plan  and almost 80    As healthcare costs go up  employers are the ones feeling the pressure   and looking for new ideas  That s where Crossover comes in   The hope with on site or near site clinics is to make healthcare more convenient for employees  and along the way ideally cheaper by cutting down on visits  Crossover says it can save as much as  970 per member compared to what employers would be paying if that employee went through the traditional healthcare system  That savings can add up for a company with thousands of employees  It makes Crossover CEO Scott Shreeve s pitch simple    Employers  you re already paying for this   Shreeve told Business Insider   You re paying a big check  but you don t really know what you re getting  What we advocate for is  learn how you re spending your money    Crossover s clinics On site clinics aren t anything new  Their history dates back to the 1800s  and they rose again to prominence between 1930 1960   started covering healthcare as a way to convince people to work for factories that were ramping up production during the war economy  After that  the popularity of on site clinics waned  though there s now a renewed interest as employers look for new ways to tackle rising healthcare costs  Besides Apple  Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  is also considering operating its own clinics for employees  Independent doctors  have been setting up on or near site clinics paid based on a per member  per month model as well  Here s how it works  Employers opt into the program and pay on a per member per month basis  Those who opt in still use their insurance  with co pays set by the employer  The employer and Crossover work to recruit employees to join  From there  the members have access to primary care appointments  as well as physical therapy  behavioral health visits  eye doctors  and health coaching sessions   By paying on a per member basis  Crossover doesn t have as much of motivation to pack in as many visits as possible  Instead of interacting with patients only when they re sick  Shreeve said  the hope is to reach members in other ways    We just think that s wrong we think healthcare should have other touchpoints that help keep you healthy   Shreeve said   Because they re all part of the same clinic  the primary care doctors are able to chat about their patients with the on staff therapists and other physicians who are interacting with that same patient  That provides for a more holistic healthcare experience   Crossover s appeal to employers For employers looking for ways to cut down on their healthcare costs as well as come up with a benefit employees want  Crossover s model can be a good fit   Cyber security company Symantec  NASDAQ SYMC  chose to work with Crossover as it looked for ways to mitigate the trend of increased healthcare costs    It s an ongoing battle for us to stay ahead of the game and try to come up with innovative ways where employees feel like they re getting a best in class benefit   Jennifer Lepird  Senior Director of Rewards   HRIM at Symantec told Business Insider  Symantec and the other clients Crossover works with aren t alone in looking for new ways to get a more direct grip on the healthcare their employees consume  In 2019  General Motors  NYSE GM  will offer its salaried employees in Southeast Michigan a plan that   covering about 24 000 employees and their families  lessening the company s use of its health insurance company  And in January   formed an independent venture aimed at lowering healthcare costs for their employees   Healthcare s waiting for its  Uber  moment and employers have realized that they can t sit on the sidelines   Renya Spak  a partner at health benefits firm Mercer and head of the company s Healthcare Innovation Center    They need to drive and shape the direction of that change in order to have greater influence and better

42802,264317,NLOK,China based campaign breached satellite  defense companies  Symantec,news,"By Joseph Menn
SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters    A sophisticated hacking campaign launched from computers in China burrowed deeply into satellite operators  defense contractors and telecommunications companies in the United States and southeast Asia  security researchers at  Symantec Corp   NASDAQ SYMC  said on Tuesday 
Symantec said the effort appeared to be driven by national espionage goals  such as the interception of military and civilian communications 
Such interception capabilities are rare but not unheard of  and the researchers could not say what communications  if any  were taken  More disturbingly in this case  the hackers infected computers that controlled the satellites  so that they could have changed the positions of the orbiting devices and disrupted data traffic  Symantec said 
 Disruption to satellites could leave civilian as well as military installations subject to huge  real world  disruptions   said Vikram Thakur  technical director at Symantec   We are extremely dependent on their functionality  
Satellites are critical to phone and some internet links as well as mapping and positioning data 
Symantec  based in Mountain View  California  described its findings to Reuters exclusively ahead of a planned public release  It said the hackers had been removed from infected systems 
Symantec said it has already shared technical information about the hack with the U S  Federal Bureau of Investigation and Department of Homeland Security  along with public defense agencies in Asia and other security companies  The FBI did not respond to a request for comment 
Thakur said Symantec detected the misuse of common software tools at client sites in January  leading to the campaign s discovery at unnamed targets  He attributed the effort to a group that Symantec calls Thrip  which may be called different names by other companies 
Thrip was active from 2013 on and then vanished from the radar for about a year until the last campaign started a year ago  In that period  it developed new tools and began using more widely available administrative and criminal programs  Thakur said 
Other security analysts have also recently tied sophisticated attacks to Chinese groups that had been out of sight for awhile  and there could be overlap  FireEye Inc in March said that a group it called Temp Periscope reappeared last summer and went after defense companies and shippers  FireEye had no immediate comment on the new episode 
It was unclear how Thrip gained entry to the latest systems  In the past  it depended on trick emails that had infected attachments or led recipients to malicious links  This time  it did not infect most user computers  instead moving among servers  making detection harder 
Following its customary stance  Symantec did not directly blame the Chinese government for the hack  It said the hackers launched their campaign from three computers on the mainland  In theory  those machines could have been compromised by someone elsewhere

42831,264346,NLOK, Human Error Still Biggest Factor in Crypto Related Attacks  Study Shows ,news,"In cybersecurity  it typically doesn t matter how much code is in place to protect individuals if they don t use prudence and vigilance to stop themselves from falling victim to attacks 
This wisdom appears to be true even when referring to the cryptocurrency community and mining malware  according to a  by cybersecurity company Proofpoint 

 Email remains the top attack vector  Threats range from spam that clogs inboxes and wastes resources to email fraud that can cost organizations and people millions of dollars  And mainstream interest in cryptocurrency is driving advances in malware and new approaches to phishing and cyber crime   the company wrote in its latest Human Factor Report 

Proofpoint found that up to 95  of attacks through fake browser and plugin updates used social engineering to trick people into installing malware and willingly executing it on their computers 
All of this might also be due to the fact that suspicious and impostor domains outnumbered their brand registered counterparts by a factor of 20  A user that sees a piece of software coming from what they perceive as a legitimate company is more likely to click on it 
The report also found that more than half of attacks carried out on social media come from spoofed customer support accounts  although the rest of it might be attributed to the way that malware propagates through social media using known contacts of an infected person 
In email attacks  we can see the highest rate of growth in the number of cryptomining malware infections 

 Observed network traffic of coin mining bots jumped almost 90  between September and November  2017   This threat activity closely mirrored the rise and fall of the value of Bitcoin   the report added 

Although we already know that instances of cryptojacking are  thanks to reports from Symantec  NASDAQ SYMC   there wasn t yet a lot of insight into how these attacks are carried out 
It turns out that humans continue to be the greatest vulnerability in any system  meaning that companies may have to begin constructing new policies lest they lose most of their computing resources to cryptojackers ",2018-04-18,Cryptovest,https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/human-error-still-biggest-factor-in-cryptorelated-attacks-study-shows-1401705,1401705

Core inflation  which excludes food and fuel  is projected to climb 2 2   a tad faster than the 2 1  gain recorded in the preceding month 
Core prices are viewed by the Federal Reserve as a better gauge of longer term inflationary pressure because they exclude the volatile food and energy categories 
A jump in inflation could be a sign that the Fed would have to raise interest rates more rapidly if it begins to run above its 2  target 
The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was slightly lower at 92 80  pulling back from Wednesday s four and a half month high of 93 26

At around 5 30AM ET  the blue chip Dow futures were up 35 points  or about 0 15   the S P 500 futures tacked on 5 points  or around 0 2   while the tech heavy Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a gain of 13 points  or roughly 0 2

5  Bank Of England  Super Thursday 
The Bank of England  BoE  will announce its rate decision at 1100GMT  7 00AM ET   with market expectations now overwhelmingly in favor of interest rates being held at the current 0 5  rate 
Interest rate bets have swung around sharply from early April when investors priced a 90  chance of the BoE raising rates by 25 basis points 
But a spate of weak economic data is almost certain to stay the BoE s hand  which might now struggle to convince investors that it will raise borrowing costs at all this year 
BoE Governor Mark Carney will hold a press conference shortly after the announcement  and investors will monitor his language for signals on what the appetite is for hikes further out in 2018 
The British pound was a shade higher against the dollar at 1 3565  staying within sight of Tuesday s four month lows of 1 3483

On a yearly base  core CPI is projected to climb 2 2   a tad faster than the 2 1  gain recorded in the preceding month  Core prices are viewed by the Fed as a better gauge of longer term inflationary pressure because they exclude the volatile food and energy categories 
Rising prices would be a catalyst to push the U S  central bank toward raising interest rates at a faster pace than currently expected as policymakers seek to maintain inflation near the 2  target 
Markets are currently looking for the Fed s next rate hike to arrive in June with a follow up increase in September  according to Investing com s Fed Rate Monitor Tool  Odds for a third hike  for a total of four in 2018  were last at around 44  
In addition to the inflation data  investors will also keep an eye on weekly jobless claims to be released at the same time

42869,264384,NLOK,In a first  U S  blames Russia for cyber attacks on energy grid,news,"By Dustin Volz and Timothy Gardner WASHINGTON  Reuters    The Trump administration on Thursday blamed the Russian government for a campaign of cyber attacks stretching back at least two years that targeted the U S  power grid  marking the first time the United States has publicly accused Moscow of hacking into American energy infrastructure  Beginning in March 2016  or possibly earlier  Russian government hackers sought to penetrate multiple U S  critical infrastructure sectors  including energy  nuclear  commercial facilities  water  aviation and manufacturing  according to a U S  security alert published Thursday  The Department of Homeland Security and FBI said in the alert that a  multi stage intrusion campaign by Russian government cyber actors  had targeted the networks of small commercial facilities  where they staged malware  conducted spear phishing  and gained remote access into energy sector networks   The alert did not name facilities or companies targeted  The direct condemnation of Moscow represented an escalation in the Trump administration s attempts to deter Russia s aggression in cyberspace  after senior U S  intelligence officials said in recent weeks the Kremlin believes it can launch hacking operations against the West with impunity  It coincided with a decision Thursday by the U S  Treasury Department to impose sanctions on 19 Russian people and five groups  including Moscow s intelligence services  for meddling in the 2016 U S  presidential election and other malicious cyber attacks  Russia in the past has denied it has tried to hack into other countries  infrastructure  and vowed on Thursday to retaliate for the new sanctions   UNPRECEDENTED AND EXTRAORDINARY  U S  security officials have long warned that the United States may be vulnerable to debilitating cyber attacks from hostile adversaries  It was not clear what impact the attacks had on the firms that were targeted  But Thursday s alert provided a link to an analysis by the U S  cyber security firm Symantec  NASDAQ SYMC  last fall that said a group it had dubbed Dragonfly had targeted energy companies in the United States and Europe and in some cases broke into the core systems that control the companies  operations   Malicious email campaigns dating back to late 2015 were used to gain entry into organizations in the United States  Turkey and Switzerland  and likely other countries  Symantec said at the time  though it did not name Russia as the culprit  The decision by the United States to publicly attribute hacking attempts of American critical infrastructure was  unprecedented and extraordinary   said Amit Yoran  a former U S  official who founded DHS s Computer Emergency Response Team   I have never seen anything like this   said Yoran  now chief executive of the cyber firm Tenable  said  A White House National Security Council spokesman did not respond when asked what specifically prompted the public blaming of Russia  U S  officials have historically been reluctant to call out such activity in part because the United States also spies on infrastructure in other parts of the world  News of the hacking campaign targeting U S  power companies first surfaced in June in a confidential alert to industry that described attacks on industrial firms  including nuclear plants  but did not attribute blame    People sort of suspected Russia was behind it  but today s statement from the U S  government carries a lot of weight   said Ben Read  manager for cyber espionage analysis with cyber security company FireEye Inc  ENGINEERS TARGETED The campaign targeted engineers and technical staff with access to industrial controls  suggesting the hackers were interested in disrupting operations  though FireEye has seen no evidence that they actually took that step  Read said  A former senior DHS official familiar with the government response to the campaign said that Russia s targeting of infrastructure networks dropped off after the publication in the fall of Symantec s research and an October government alert  which detailed technical forensics about the hacking attempts but did not name Russia  The official declined to say whether the campaign was still ongoing or provide specifics on which targets were breached  or how close hackers may have gotten to operational control systems   We did not see them cross into the control networks   DHS cyber security official Rick Driggers told reporters at a dinner on Thursday evening  Driggers said he was unaware of any cases of control networks being compromised in the United States and that the breaches were limited to business networks  But  he added   We know that there is intent there   It was not clear what Russia s motive was  Many cyber security experts and former U S  officials say such behavior is generally espionage oriented with the potential  if needed  for sabotage  Russia has shown a willingness to leverage access into energy networks for damaging effect in the past  Kremlin linked hackers were widely blamed for two attacks on the Ukrainian energy grid in 2015 and 2016  that caused temporary blackouts for hundreds of thousands of customers and were considered first of their kind assaults   Senator Maria Cantwell  the top Democrat on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee  asked the Trump administration earlier this month to provide a threat assessment gauging Russian capabilities to breach the U S  electric grid  It was the third time Cantwell and other senators had asked for such a review  The administration has not yet responded  a spokesman for Cantwell s office said on Thursday  Last July  there were news reports that the Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corp  which operates a nuclear plant in Kansas  had been targeted by hackers from an unknown origin  Spokeswoman Jenny Hageman declined to say at the time if the plant had been hacked but said that there had been no operational impact to the plant because operational computer systems were separate from the corporate network  Hageman on Thursday said the company does not comment on security matters   
John Keeley  a spokesman for the industry group the Nuclear Energy Institute  said   There has been no successful cyber attack against any U S  nuclear facility  including Wolf Creek  ",2018-03-15,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/us-blames-russia-for-cyber-attacks-on-energy-grid-1344012,1344012
42870,264385,NLOK, Sweden Beset by Cryptojacking Woes ,news,"As cryptocurrency related attacks become more profitable  hackers are finding new ways to get the greatest bang for their buck  sometimes resorting to a special type of attack called cryptojacking  Sweden is now suffering a barrage of such attacks  with the figure ballooning by around 10 000  at the end of last year  according to research by US cyber security company Symantec  NASDAQ SYMC  

 It has gone through the roof  I ve never seen such a big change in the short term   news provider TT cited Symantec expert Ola Rehnberg as saying 

The cryptojacking boom in Sweden is the largest recorded so far  but it is not that far above the average  which sits in the region of 8 500  
Towards the end of last year  Symantec researcher Candid Wueest  about this phenomenon when he predicted that we would see an explosion of cryptocurrency related malware in 2018 

 Defacing a website is fun for some people  but it s not profitable this is  and so we think it will increase   he said 

Indeed  2018 saw an increase in both the sophistication and frequency of attacks  putting immense pressure on cybersecurity firms to come up with solutions that would help prevent such incursions 
Wueest added that  it doesn t cost much  to commandeer websites for cryptojacking 
There are numerous vulnerabilities in mainstream web platforms that allow hackers to put a minimum of effort to inject scripts like those offered by Coinhive and wait for the money to roll in 
In an ideal implementation  hackers can have a script that uses only part of a visitor s CPU power when they go to a website  slowing their system down but not enough to cause any readily noticeable changes 
It might only result in pennies  but when the initial investment is  0  no one is likely to complain about getting modest returns ",2018-03-23,Cryptovest,https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/sweden-beset-by-cryptojacking-woes-1356094,1356094

The rise of cryptocurrencies has created a new incentive for hackers  We are now entering a  gold rush  of malware that exploits computer CPUs and GPUs to mine cryptocurrencies for nefarious entities 
Symantec s report shows that incidences of downloader variant malware have soared by 92  
Those who steer clear of Windows may consider themselves safe  but Macs also saw an 80  surge in new malware 
Perhaps the most stunning find is that the instances of coin mining software detected by Symantec have rocketed by 8 500  

 With a low barrier of entry only requiring a couple lines of code to operate cyber criminals are using coinminers to steal computer processing power and cloud CPU sage from consumers and enterprises to mine cryptocurrency   the report said 

The company also sees potential new avenues for hackers looking to exploit devices to mine cryptocurrencies for themselves 

 As malicious coin mining evolves  IoT  Internet of Things  devices will continue to be ripe targets for exploitation   the report added 

Symantec noted that it found a 600  increase in IoT attacks last year  making them a weak link in many residential and commercial setups that fail to secure themselves against such attacks 
 by Symantec showed that Sweden got the gold for the highest proportion of cryptojacking incidents in the last quarter of 2017  While the global average increase for cryptocurrency mining malware is around 8 500   the figure for the country came at a whopping 10 000  
Hackers have it good  they get a large profit with a minimum effort by modifying a variant of successful malware and setting it to mine to their own wallets 
Perhaps the most sophisticated piece of malware discovered recently was described in a report by the SANS Internet Storm Center 
The software hunts for other coinjackers running in the system and kills them all before mining  making full use of the resources available and thus maximizing the hacker s profits 
These types of attacks are set to continue their upward trend until cybersecurity companies concentrate their energies on eradicating them ",2018-04-05,Cryptovest,https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/cryptojacking-enjoys-boom-new-symantec-report-shows-1379683,1379683

42901,264416,NLOK,Tech firms let Russia probe software widely used by U S  government,news,"By Dustin Volz  Joel Schectman and Jack Stubbs WASHINGTON MOSCOW  Reuters    Major global technology providers SAP  DE SAPG   Symantec  O SYMC  and McAfee have allowed Russian authorities to hunt for vulnerabilities in software deeply embedded across the U S  government  a Reuters investigation has found  The practice potentially jeopardizes the security of computer networks in at least a dozen federal agencies  U S  lawmakers and security experts said  It involves more companies and a broader swath of the government than previously reported   In order to sell in the Russian market  the tech companies let a Russian defense agency scour the inner workings  or source code  of some of their products  Russian authorities say the reviews are necessary to detect flaws that could be exploited by hackers   Graphic    But those same products protect some of the most sensitive areas of the U S government  including the Pentagon  NASA  the State Department  the FBI and the intelligence community  against hacking by sophisticated cyber adversaries like Russia  Reuters revealed in October that Hewlett Packard Enterprise  N HPE  software known as ArcSight  used to help secure the Pentagon s computers  had been reviewed by a Russian military contractor with close ties to Russia s security services  Now  a Reuters review of hundreds of U S  federal procurement documents and Russian regulatory records shows that the potential risks to the U S  government from Russian source code reviews are more widespread  Beyond the Pentagon  ArcSight is used in at least seven other agencies  including the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the State Department s intelligence unit  the review showed  Additionally  products made by SAP  Symantec and McAfee and reviewed by Russian authorities are used in at least eight agencies  Some agencies use more than one of the four products   Graphic    McAfee  SAP  Symantec and  Micro Focus   L MCRO   the British firm that now owns ArcSight  all said that any source code reviews were conducted under the software maker s supervision in secure facilities where the code could not be removed or altered  The process does not compromise product security  they said  Amid growing concerns over the process  Symantec and McAfee no longer allow such reviews and Micro Focus moved to sharply restrict them late last year  The Pentagon said in a previously unreported letter    to Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen that source code reviews by Russia and China  may aid such countries in discovering vulnerabilities in those products   Reuters has not found any instances where a source code review played a role in a cyberattack  and some security experts say hackers are more likely to find other ways to infiltrate network systems  But the Pentagon is not alone in expressing concern  Private sector cyber experts  former U S  security officials and some U S  tech companies told Reuters that allowing Russia to review the source code may expose unknown vulnerabilities that could be used to undermine U S  network defenses   Even letting people look at source code for a minute is incredibly dangerous   said Steve Quane  executive vice president for network defense at Trend Micro  which sells TippingPoint security software to the U S  military  Worried about those risks to the U S  government  Trend Micro has refused to allow the Russians to conduct a source code review of TippingPoint  Quane said  Quane said top security researchers can quickly spot exploitable vulnerabilities just by examining source code   We know there are people who can do that  because we have people like that who work for us   he said  In contrast to Russia  the U S  government seldom requests source code reviews when buying commercially available software products  U S  trade attorneys and security experts say  OPENING THE DOOR Many of the Russian reviews have occurred since 2014  when U S  Russia relations plunged to new lows following Moscow s annexation of Crimea  Western nations have accused Russia of sharply escalating its use of cyber attacks during that time  an allegation Moscow denies  Some U S  lawmakers worry source code reviews could be yet another entry point for Moscow to wage cyberattacks   I fear that access to our security infrastructure   whether it be overt or covert   by adversaries may have already opened the door to harmful security vulnerabilities   Shaheen told Reuters  In its Dec  7 letter to Shaheen  the Pentagon said it was  exploring the feasibility  of requiring vendors to disclose when they have allowed foreign governments to access source code  Shaheen had questioned the Pentagon about the practice following the Reuters report on ArcSight  which also prompted Micro Focus to say it would restrict government source code reviews in the future  HPE said none of its current products have undergone Russian source code review  Lamar Smith  the Republican chairman of the House Science  Space and Technology Committee  said legislation to better secure the federal cybersecurity supply chain was clearly needed  Responding to the Reuters report on Thursday  Democratic Congressman Jim Langevin  a senior member of the House Armed Services Committee  said the Pentagon must consider  any access adversaries may have to source code when it is making purchasing decisions    Most U S  government agencies declined to comment when asked whether they were aware technology installed within their networks had been inspected by Russian military contractors  Others said security was of paramount concern but that they could not comment on the use of specific software  A Pentagon spokeswoman said it continually monitors the commercial technology it uses for security weaknesses  NO PENCILS ALLOWED Tech companies wanting to access Russia s large market are often required to seek certification for their products from Russian agencies  including the FSB security service and Russia s Federal Service for Technical and Export Control  FSTEC   a defense agency tasked with countering cyber espionage  FSTEC declined to comment and the FSB did not respond to requests for comment  The Kremlin referred all questions to the FSB and FSTEC  FSTEC often requires companies to permit a Russian government contractor to test the software s source code  SAP HANA  a database system  underwent a source code review in order to obtain certification in 2016  according to Russian regulatory records  The software stores and analyzes information for the State Department  Internal Revenue Service  NASA and the Army  An SAP spokeswoman said any source code reviews were conducted in a secure  company supervised facility where recording devices or even pencils are  are strictly forbidden    All governments and governmental organizations are treated the same with no exceptions   the spokeswoman said  While some companies have since stopped allowing Russia to review source code in their products  the same products often remain embedded in the U S  government  which can take decades to upgrade technology  Security concerns caused Symantec to halt all government source code reviews in 2016  the company s chief executive told Reuters in October  But Symantec Endpoint Protection antivirus software  which was reviewed by Russia in 2012  remains in use by the Pentagon  the FBI  and the Social Security Administration  among other agencies  according to federal contracting records reviewed by Reuters  In a statement  a Symantec spokeswoman said the newest version of Endpoint Protection  released in late 2016  never underwent a source code review and that the earlier version has received numerous updates since being tested by Russia  The California based company said it had no reason to believe earlier reviews had compromised product security  Symantec continued to sell the older version through 2017 and will provide updates through 2019  McAfee also announced last year that it would no longer allow government mandated source code reviews  The cyber firm s Security Information and Event Management  SIEM  software was reviewed in 2015 by a Moscow based government contractor  Echelon  on behalf of FSTEC  according to Russian regulatory documents  McAfee confirmed this  The Treasury Department and Defense Security Service  a Pentagon agency tasked with guarding the military s classified information  continue to rely on the product to protect their networks  contracting records show  McAfee declined to comment  citing customer confidentiality agreements  but it has previously said the Russian reviews are conducted at company owned premises in the United States   YOU CAN T TRUST ANYONE  On its website  Echelon describes itself as an official laboratory of the FSB  FSTEC  and Russia s defense ministry  Alexey Markov  the president of Echelon  which also inspected the source code for ArcSight  said U S  companies often initially expressed concerns about the certification process   Did they have any  Absolutely    Markov wrote in an email   The less the person making the decision understands about programming  the more paranoia they have  However  in the process of clarifying the details of performing the certification procedure  the dangers and risks are smoothed out   Markov said his team always informs tech companies before handing over any discovered vulnerabilities to Russian authorities  allowing the firms to fix the detected flaw  The source code reviews of products  significantly improves their safety   he said  Chris Inglis  the former deputy director of the National Security Agency  the United States  premier electronic spy agency  disagrees   When you re sitting at the table with card sharks  you can t trust anyone   he said   I wouldn t show anybody the code

42906,264421,NLOK,Corporate partners cut cord with NRA as gun control debate rages,news,"By Barbara Goldberg and Gina Cherelus NEW YORK  Reuters    The fallout over last week s shooting rampage at a Florida high school started to take its toll on the National Rifle Association s roster of corporate partners on Friday as a half dozen companies severed marketing ties with the gun advocacy organization  The exodus of corporate names  ranging from a major insurer to car rental brands and a household moving company  occurred after the NRA launched a counter offensive against a student led campaign for tighter U S  gun ownership laws  At the same time  gun control activists are stepping up pressure on Amazon com Inc  NASDAQ AMZN  and other online streaming platforms to drop the online video channel NRATV  featuring gun friendly programming produced by the NRA  Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America  founded after 20 first graders were shot and killed at a Connecticut school in 2012  sent letters to Apple Inc  NASDAQ AAPL   AT T Inc  NYSE T   Amazon  Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL  Inc s Google and Roku Inc on Friday  asking them to drop NRATV from their platforms    We have been just disgusted by NRATV since its beginning   Shannon Watts  founder of the Moms Demand Action group  told Reuters   It tries to pit Americans against one another  all in an attempt to further their agenda of selling guns   AT T said it does not carry NRATV  None of the other companies immediately responded to requests for comment  The issue of gun control  and the NRA s role in opposing it  became the focus of renewed national debate on Feb  14  when a former student killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland  Florida  with an AR 15 assault rifle he had purchased legally  The U S  Constitution s Second Amendment protects the right of Americans to bear arms  The NRA  which has long used campaign donations and effective lobbying to command political influence  argues that stricter gun control would erode individual rights  The group has not commented on companies cutting ties  Angry student survivors of the shooting have confronted politicians from state lawmakers to U S  President Donald Trump himself  demanding stricter gun control laws   In response  the NRA and Trump have suggested arming teachers who have received training to deter attackers  a proposal that has been met with skepticism by teachers unions and gun violence experts  TRENDING ON TWITTER Before the corporate defections  nearly two dozen companies nationwide had offered incentives to NRA members  according to ThinkProgress com  a news site owned by the Center for American Progress Action Fund  The attrition started late Thursday when three rental car brands owned by Enterprise Holdings Inc said they were ending discount programs  and First National Bank of Omaha said it would not renew the NRA s contract to issue a co branded Visa card  By Friday  the list of defectors expanded to include  Symantec Corp   NASDAQ SYMC   which ended an discount program for its LifeLock identity theft product  Home security company SimpliSafe and Hertz Corp also terminated discount programs  Chubb  NYSE CB  Ltd said it would stop underwriting a NRA branded insurance policy for gun owners that covers legal costs in self defense shootings  Another insurer  MetLife Inc  NYSE MET   also said it had ended an auto and home incentive program for NRA members  And North American Van Lines said it was scrapping its an affiliate relationship with the NRA  David Hogg  one of the student survivors of last week s attack who launched the  NeverAgain anti gun violence movement  said the students would target any company with ties to the NRA  in addition to lawmakers who accept donations  About a dozen other companies with marketing ties to the NRA  including FedEx Corp  NYSE FDX  and Hertz  which offer discount programs  did not respond to requests for comment  SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGNS Activists have also called on public pension funds to divest from gun maker stocks  which were broadly lower on Friday   Meanwhile  an online campaign using the Twitter hashtag  StopNRAmazon picked up steam  putting pressure on Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos to drop the channel  Many of those tweeting are in the entertainment industry   Ironic how the  NRA likes to point a finger at what kids watch on TV     while they spew vile rhetoric on NRAtv  streamed on  Amazon and aimed solely at boosting gun sales   wrote screenwriter Randi Mayem Singer  Moms Demand Action  which sent the letters to the streaming platform  also posted an online petition using the hashtag  DumpNRATV   To be affiliated with them  whether you are a company or a lawmaker  it is not going to pay off in the long run   said Watts  the group s founder  signaling the start of a broader campaign   Doing business with the NRA is clearly bad business   The target of its ire is NRATV  which describes itself as  America s Most Patriotic Team on a Mission to Take Back The Truth   The channel features programming that leans heavily on speeches by NRA chief executive Wayne LaPierre and spokeswoman Dana Loesch  Yet another campaign  using the hashtag  BoycottNRA  was the top trending topic on Twitter on Friday morning   The push is the latest effort by social activists to use social media to apply economic pressure to force change   Last April  Fox News parted ways with television host Bill O Reilly when sponsors started to drop his show in the wake of sexual harassment allegations against him   Similarly the National Football League announced a tougher policy on handling domestic violence accusations against players when its marketing partners applied pressure for

42931,264446,NLOK,U S  warns public about attacks on energy  industrial firms,news,"By Jim Finkle  Reuters    The U S government issued a rare public warning that sophisticated hackers are targeting energy and industrial firms  the latest sign that cyber attacks present an increasing threat to the power industry and other public infrastructure  The Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation warned in a report distributed by email late on Friday that the nuclear  energy  aviation  water and critical manufacturing industries have been targeted along with government entities in attacks dating back to at least May  The agencies warned that hackers had succeeded in compromising some targeted networks  but did not identify specific victims or describe any cases of sabotage   The objective of the attackers is to compromise organizational networks with malicious emails and tainted websites to obtain credentials for accessing computer networks of their targets  the report said  U S  authorities have been monitoring the activity for months  which they initially detailed in a confidential June report first reported by Reuters  That document  which was privately distributed to firms at risk of attacks  described a narrower set of activity focusing on the nuclear  energy and critical manufacturing sectors  Department of Homeland Security spokesman Scott McConnell declined to elaborate on the information in the report or say what prompted the government to go public with the information at this time    The technical alert provides recommendations to prevent and mitigate malicious cyber activity targeting multiple sectors and reiterated our commitment to remain vigilant for new threats   he said   The FBI declined to comment on the report  which security researchers said described an escalation in targeting of infrastructure in Europe and the United States that had been described in recent reports from private firms  including  Symantec Corp   NASDAQ SYMC    This is very aggressive activity   said Robert Lee  an expert in securing industrial networks  Lee  chief executive of cyber security firm Dragos  said the report appears to describe hackers working in the interests of the Russian government  though he declined to elaborate  Dragos is also monitoring other groups targeting infrastructure that appear to be aligned with China  Iran  North Korea  he said      The hacking described in the government report is unlikely to result in dramatic attacks in the near term  Lee said  but he added that it is still troubling   We don t want our adversaries learning enough to be able to do things that are disruptive later    The report said that hackers have succeeded in infiltrating some targets  including at least one energy generator  and conducting reconnaissance on their networks  It was accompanied by six technical documents describing malware used in the attacks  Homeland Security  has confidence that this campaign is still ongoing and threat actors are actively pursuing their objectives over a long term campaign   the report said  The report said the attacker was the same as one described by Symantec in a September report that warned advanced hackers had penetrated the systems controlling operations of some U S  and European energy companies   Symantec researcher Vikram Thakur said in an email that much of the contents of Friday s report were previously known within the security community  Cyber security firm CrowdStrike said the technical indicators described in the report suggested the attacks were the work of a hacking group it calls Berserk Bear  which is affiliated with the Russian Federation and has targeted the energy  financial and transportation industries

42954,264469,NLOK,Special Report  HP Enterprise let Russia scrutinize cyberdefense system used by Pentagon,news,"By Joel Schectman  Dustin Volz and Jack Stubbs
WASHINGTON MOSCOW  Reuters    Hewlett Packard Enterprise  N HPE  allowed a Russian defense agency to review the inner workings of cyber defense software used by the Pentagon to guard its computer networks  according to Russian regulatory records and interviews with people with direct knowledge of the issue 
The HPE system  called ArcSight  serves as a cybersecurity nerve center for much of the U S  military  alerting analysts when it detects that computer systems may have come under attack  Graphic     ArcSight is also widely used in the private sector 
The Russian review of ArcSight s source code  the closely guarded internal instructions of the software  was part of HPE s effort to win the certification required to sell the product to Russia s public sector  according to the regulatory records seen by Reuters and confirmed by a company spokeswoman 
Six former U S  intelligence officials  as well as former ArcSight employees and independent security experts  said the source code review could help Moscow discover weaknesses in the software  potentially helping attackers to blind the U S  military to a cyber attack 
 It s a huge security vulnerability   said Greg Martin  a former security architect for ArcSight   You are definitely giving inner access and potential exploits to an adversary  
Despite the potential risks to the Pentagon  no one Reuters spoke with was aware of any hacks or cyber espionage that were made possible by the review process 
The ArcSight review took place last year  at a time when Washington was accusing Moscow of an increasing number of cyber attacks against American companies  U S  politicians and government agencies  including the Pentagon  Russia has repeatedly denied the allegations 
The case highlights a growing tension for U S  technology companies that must weigh their role as protectors of U S  cybersecurity while continuing to pursue business with Washington s adversaries such as Russia and China  say security experts 
 BACKDOOR VULNERABILITIES 
The review was conducted by Echelon  a company with close ties to the Russian military  on behalf of Russia s Federal Service for Technical and Export Control  FSTEC   a defense agency tasked with countering cyber espionage 
Echelon president and majority owner Alexey Markov said in an email to Reuters that he is required to report any vulnerabilities his team discovers to the Russian government 
But he said he does so only after alerting the software developer of the problem and getting its permission to disclose the vulnerability  Echelon did not provide details about HPE s source code review  citing a non disclosure agreement with the company 
FSTEC confirmed Markov s account  saying in a statement that Russian testing laboratories immediately inform foreign developers if they discover vulnerabilities  before submitting a report to a government  database of information security threats  
One reason Russia requests the reviews before allowing sales to government agencies and state run companies is to ensure that U S  intelligence services have not placed spy tools in the software 
HPE said no  backdoor vulnerabilities  were discovered in the Russian review  It declined to provide further details 
HPE said it allows Russian government accredited testing companies to review source code in order to win the Russian defense certifications it needs to sell products to Russia s public sector 
An HPE spokeswoman said source code reviews are conducted by the Russian testing company at an HPE research and development center outside of Russia  where the software maker closely supervises the process  No code is allowed to leave the premises  and HPE has allowed such reviews in Russia for years  she said 
Those measures ensure  our source code and products are in no way compromised   she said 
Some security experts say that studying the source code of a product would make it far easier for a reviewer to spot vulnerabilities in the code  even if they did not leave the site with a copy of the code 
In a 2014 research paper  Echelon directors said the company discovered vulnerabilities in 50 percent of the foreign and Russian software it reviewed 
Still  security analysts said the source code review alone  even if it yielded information about vulnerabilities  would not give hackers easy entry into the military systems  To infiltrate military networks  hackers would need to first overcome a number of other security measures  such as firewalls  said Alan Paller  founder of the SANS Institute  which trains cybersecurity analysts
Paller also said HPE s decision to allow the review was not surprising  If tech companies like HPE want to do business in Russia   they don t really have any choice   he said 
HPE declined to disclose the size of its business in Russia  but Russian government tender records show ArcSight is now used by a number of state firms and companies close to the Kremlin  including VTB Bank  MM VTBR  and the Rossiya Segodnya media group 
Whether the customer is Russia or the United States  overlooked errors in software code can allow foreign governments and hackers to penetrate a user s computer 
Exploiting vulnerabilities found in ArcSight s source code could render it incapable of detecting that the military s network was under attack  said Allen Pomeroy  a former ArcSight employee who helped customers build their cyber defense systems 
 A response to the attack would then be frankly impossible   Pomeroy said 
The HPE spokeswoman said Reuters  questions about the potential vulnerabilities were  hypothetical and speculative in nature  
HPE declined to say whether it told the Pentagon of the Russian review  but said the company  always ensures our clients are kept informed of any developments that may affect them  
A spokeswoman for the Pentagon s Defense Information Systems Agency  which maintains the military s networks  said HPE did not disclose the review to the U S  agency  Military contracts do not specifically require vendors to divulge whether foreign nations have reviewed source code  the spokeswoman said  
The U S  military agency itself did not require a source code review before purchasing ArcSight and generally does not place such requirements on tech companies for off the shelf software like ArcSight  the Pentagon spokeswoman said  Instead  DISA evaluates the security standards used by the vendors  she said 
 EVERYONE IS HAPPY 
Echelon operates as an official laboratory and software tester of FSTEC and Russia s FSB spy agency  according to Russian government registries of testing laboratories and software certifications reviewed by Reuters  U S  intelligence has accused the FSB of helping mount cyber attacks against the United States and interfering in the 2016 presidential election 
Markov  Echelon s president  defended the reviews  saying that  if a vulnerability is found  everyone is happy  because the detected flaw means laboratory experts are  able to demonstrate their qualifications  and  the developer is happy that a mistake was detected  since by fixing it the product will become better  
Russia in recent years has stepped up demands for source code reviews as a requirement for doing business in the country  Reuters reported in June 
A number of international companies  including Cisco Systems Inc  NASDAQ CSCO   the world s largest networking gear maker  and German software giant SAP  DE SAPG   have agreed to the reviews  though others  including cybersecurity firm Symantec  O SYMC   have refused because of security concerns 
CYBERDEFENSE BULWARK
U S  government procurement records show ArcSight is used as a key cyberdefense bulwark across much of the U S  military including the Army  Air Force and Navy  For example  ArcSight is used to guard the Pentagon s Secret Internet Protocol Router Network  SIPRNet   which is used to exchange classified information  according to military procurement records 
The Pentagon spokeswoman declined to comment on risks posed by specific products to its network but said all software used by DISA is  extensively evaluated for security risks   and continually monitored once deployed 
Created in 2000 as an independent company  ArcSight broke new ground by allowing large organizations to receive real time alerts about potential cyber intrusions 
The software draws activity records from servers  firewalls  and individual computers across a network   up to hundreds of thousands per second  The system then searches for suspicious patterns  such as a high number of failed login attempts within a few seconds  and alerts analysts 
A decade later  ArcSight had become  the core  cyber network defense tool the Pentagon s analysts  rely on to defend DoD networks   DISA said in a 2011 ArcSight procurement request 
Today ArcSight is a virtually irreplaceable tool for many parts of the U S  military  at least for the immediate future  Pentagon records show 
 HP ArcSight software and hardware are so embedded   the Pentagon s logistics agency wrote in April  that it could not consider other competitors  absent an overhaul of the current IT infrastructure    
HPE agreed last year to sell ArcSight and other security products to British tech company  Micro Focus  International Plc  L MCRO  in a transaction that was completed in September 
Jason Schmitt  the current head of the ArcSight division  said the product makes up a little less than half of the  800 million in annual revenue Micro Focus expects to get from the security software business purchased from HPE 

Schmitt said he could not comment on any source code review that took place before this year  when he took the job  but stressed such reviews do not currently take place  Micro Focus did not respond to requests for comment on whether it would allow Russia to do similar source code reviews in the future or whether Micro Focus executives knew of the review prior to the acquisition ",2017-10-02,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/special-report-hp-enterprise-let-russia-scrutinize-cyberdefense-system-used-by-pentagon-535325,535325

 Reuters    Hedge fund Elliott Management Corp s attempt to acquire U S  networking software maker Gigamon Inc has ground to a halt over price disagreements  people familiar with the matter said on Thursday 
The development is a setback for Elliott s private equity arm  Evergreen Coast Capital Partners  as it seeks to become a credible buyer of public companies  Elliott has participated in buyouts of smaller private companies such as Dell s software group but it is best known as an activist shareholder 
Gigamon rejected Elliott s latest offer in the past few weeks after it came in below the company s share price  one of the sources said  Gigamon shares ended trading on Thursday at  43 55  giving the company a market capitalization of  1 6 billion 
Negotiations could resume in the future with Elliott  or Gigamon could receive an offer from another party  the sources said 
The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential  Elliott and Gigamon declined to comment

42958,264473,NLOK,Exclusive  Symantec CEO says source code reviews pose unacceptable risk,news,"By Dustin Volz and Joel Schectman WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  based cyber firm Symantec  O SYMC  is no longer allowing governments to review the source code of its software because of fears the agreements would compromise the security of its products  Symantec Chief Executive Greg Clark said in an interview with Reuters  Tech companies have been under increasing pressure to allow the Russian government to examine source code  the closely guarded inner workings of software  in exchange for approvals to sell products in Russia  Symantec s decision highlights a growing tension for U S  technology companies that must weigh their role as protectors of U S  cybersecurity as they pursue business with some of Washington s adversaries  including Russia and China  according to security experts   While Symantec once allowed the reviews  Clark said that he now sees the security threats as too great  At a time of increased nation state hacking  Symantec concluded the risk of losing customer confidence by allowing reviews was not worth the business the company could win  he said  The company s about face  which came in the beginning of 2016  was reported by Reuters in June  Clark s interview is the first detailed explanation a Symantec executive has given about the policy change  In an hour long interview  Clark said the firm was still willing to sell its products in any country  But  he added   that is a different thing than saying   Okay  we re going to let people crack it open and grind all the way through it and see how it all works    While Symantec had seen no  smoking gun  that foreign source code reviews had led to a cyberattack  Clark said he believed the process posed an unacceptable risk to Symantec customers     These are secrets  or things necessary to defend  software    Clark said of source code   It s best kept that way   Because Symantec s market share was still relatively small in Russia  the decision was easier than for competitors heavily invested in the country  Clark said     We re in a great place that says   You know what  we don t see a lot of product over there    Clark said   We don t have to say yes   Symantec s decision has been praised by some western cyber security experts  who said the company bucked a growing trend in recent years that has seen other companies accede to demands to share source code   They took a stand and they put security over sales   said Frank Cilluffo  director of the Center for Cyber and Homeland Security at George Washington University and a former senior homeland security official to former President George W  Bush   Obviously source code could be used in ways that are inimical to our national interest   Cilluffo said   They took a principled stand  and that s the right decision and a courageous one   Reuters last week reported that Hewlett Packard Enterprise  HPE   N HPE  allowed a Russian defense agency to review the inner workings of cyber defense software known as ArcSight that is used by the Pentagon to guard its computer networks  HPE said such reviews have taken place for years and are conducted by a Russian government accredited testing company at an HPE research and development center outside of Russia  The software maker said it closely supervises the process and that no code is allowed to leave the premises  ensuring it does not compromise the safety of its products  A spokeswoman said no current HPE products have undergone Russian source code reviews  ArcSight was sold to British tech company Micro Focus International Plc  L MCRO  in a sale completed in September       On Monday  Micro Focus said the reviews were a common industry practice  But the company said it would restrict future reviews of source code in its products by  high risk  governments  and that any review would require chief executive approval   SLIPPERY SLOPE  Earlier this year  Beijing enacted a cyber security law that foreign business groups have warned could adversely impact trade because of its data surveillance and storage requirements  The law has further fueled concern that companies increasingly need to choose between compromising security to protect business or risk losing out on potentially lucrative markets  Clark said Symantec had not received any requests to review source code from the Chinese government  but indicated he would not comply if Beijing made such a demand    We just have taken a policy decision to say   Any foreign government that wants to read our source code  the answer is no    Clark said  The U S  government does not generally require source code reviews before purchasing commercially available software  according to security experts    As a vendor here in the United States   Clark said   we are headquartered in a country where it is OK to say no   Some security experts fear heightened requests may further splinter the tech world  leading to an environment where consumers and governments only feel safe buying products made in their own countries

42961,264476,NLOK,North Korea likely behind Taiwan SWIFT cyber heist  BAE,news,"By Jim Finkle
TORONTO  Reuters    Cyber security firm BAE Systems  LON BAES  Plc said on Monday it believes the North Korean Lazarus hacking group is likely responsible for a recent cyber heist in Taiwan  the latest in a string of hacks targeting the global SWIFT messaging system 
 The likely culprit is Lazarus   BAE cyber intelligence chief Adrian Nish told Reuters by telephone 
The British firm has previously linked Lazarus to last year s  81 million cyber heist at Bangladesh s central bank  as have other cyber firms including Russia s Kaspersky Lab and California based  Symantec Corp   NASDAQ SYMC  
BAE s claim that Lazarus is likely responsible for the hack on Taiwan s Far Eastern International Bank demonstrates that North Korea continues to seek to generate cash through hacking 
Nish said he expects the group to continue to target banks 
 They are not just going to go away  They ve built the tools  They are going to keep going back   he said 
Still  he noted that the group appears to have had difficulty in pulling funds out of the banking system  after the massive Bangladesh heist  which prompted SWIFT and banks to boost security controls 
Taiwan s Central News Agency reported last week that while hackers sought to steal some  60 million from Far Eastern Bank  all but  500 000 had been recovered by the bank 
BAE previously disclosed that Lazarus attempted to steal money from banks in Mexico and Poland  though there is no evidence the effort succeeded 
A security executive with SWIFT  a Belgium based co operative owned by banks  last week told Reuters that hackers have continued to target the message system this year  though many attempts have been thwarted by the new security controls 
SWIFT declined comment on the findings  which BAE detailed in a report on its website  
The report provides technical details on malware samples that BAE believes were likely used to target the Taiwan bank

42982,264497,NLOK,Hackers gain entry into U S   European energy sector  Symantec warns,news,"By Dustin Volz
WASHINGTON  Reuters    Advanced hackers have targeted United States and European energy companies in a cyber espionage campaign that has in some cases successfully broken into the core systems that control the companies  operations  according to researchers at the security firm Symantec  NASDAQ SYMC  
Malicious email campaigns have been used to gain entry into organizations in the United States  Turkey and Switzerland  and likely other countries well  Symantec said in a report published on Wednesday 
The cyber attacks  which began in late 2015 but increased in frequency in April of this year  are probably the work of a foreign government and bear the hallmarks of a hacking group known as Dragonfly  Eric Chien  a cyber security researcher at Symantec  said in an interview 
The research adds to concerns that industrial firms  including power providers and other utilities  are susceptible to cyber attacks that could be leveraged for destructive purposes in the event of a major geopolitical conflict 
In June the U S  government warned industrial firms about a hacking campaign targeting the nuclear and energy sectors  saying in an alert seen by Reuters that hackers sent phishing emails to harvest credentials in order to gain access to targeted networks 
Chien said he believed that alert likely referenced the same campaign Symantec has been tracking 
He said dozens of companies had been targeted and that a handful of them  including in the United States  had been compromised on the operational level  That level of access meant that motivation was  the only step left  preventing  sabotage of the power grid   Chien said 
However  other researchers cast some doubt on the findings 
While concerning  the attacks were  far from the level of being able to turn off the lights  so there s no alarmism needed   said Robert M  Lee  founder of U S  critical infrastructure security firm Dragos Inc  who read the report 
Lee called the connection to Dragonfly  loose  
Dragonfly was previously active from around to 2011 to 2014  when it appeared to go dormant after several cyber firms published research exposing its attacks  The group  also known as Energetic Bear or Koala  was widely believed by security experts to be tied to the Russian government 

Symantec did not name Russia in its report but noted that the attackers used code strings that were in Russian  Other code used French  Symantec said  suggesting the attackers may be attempting to make it more difficult to identify them ",2017-09-06,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/hackers-gain-entry-into-us-european-energy-sector-symantec-warns-525960,525960
42992,264507,NLOK,Symantec  SYMC  Reports Next Week  What To Expect,opinion,"Wall Street expects flat earnings compared to the year ago quarter on lower revenues when Symantec  SYMC  reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on November 7  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This security software maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 42 per share in its upcoming report  which represents no change from the year ago quarter 
Revenues are expected to be  1 18 billion  down 0 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 25  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Symantec 
For Symantec  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Symantec will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Symantec would post earnings of  0 32 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 43  delivering a surprise of  34 38  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Symantec doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/symantec-symc-reports-next-week-what-to-expect-200480872,200480872

Still  some analysts haven t yet ruled out more volatility  especially since the Federal Reserve will be communicating with the markets about its interest rate outlook on Wednesday  Though the Fed rate decision is probably the most important event investors will focus on this coming week  there are also some big earnings announcements that shouldn t be ignored  These three large caps might surprise markets when they report quarterly numbers 
1  Costco Wholesale
The retail sector will come under scrutiny once again when Costco Wholesale  NASDAQ COST  reports its fiscal 2020 first quarter results on Thursday  Dec  12  after the close  Analysts are expecting  1 71 a share in profit on sales of  37 36 billion 

Unlike the weak showing by some retailers during their recently concluded quarters  chances are that Costco will provide a strong report  The company has been benefiting from robust consumer spending  which has helped boost the U S  economy for much of the year  even amid worries about slowing global growth and uncertainty related to tariffs 
Comparable sales  meaning from Costco stores open for more than a year as well as online sales  increased 5  in the quarter that ended Sept  1  Online sales on their own were up 22  in the same period

In the latest earnings report  investors will be keen to know whether the company s current strategy  spearheaded by CEO Hock Tan to grow through acquisitions as well as buying software assets that are struggling is paying off 

This past year  Broadcom announced it was acquiring Symantec s  NASDAQ NLOK    which produces software to keep hackers out of corporate systems  for  10 billion  The acquisition marks Broadcom s second big bet on software 
In 2018 the company concluded a  19 billion takeover of CA Technologies  After these deals  more than 80  of Broadcom s sales will now be derived from segments considered stable and sustainable such as cloud  networking  software and storage businesses

  Revenue expectation   5 74 billion
  EPS expectation   5 36
When Broadcom Inc  NASDAQ AVGO  reports its fourth quarter earnings tomorrow  investors can t afford to ignore it  The San Jose  California based chipmaker is considered a key barometer for the semiconductor industry due to its vast customer base and a diversified product line 
Broadcom s earnings report will also be closely scrutinized to see whether the recent rally in chip stocks has any legs  The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index which includes some of the world s largest chipmakers  such as Intel Corporation  NASDAQ INTC   NVIDIA Corporation  NASDAQ NVDA  and Advanced Micro Devices Inc  NASDAQ AMD  has surged about 48  in 2019  far exceeding the S P 500 s 24  rise this year 
The rebound came amid optimism that the slowdown which hit the sector last year was short term in nature despite the mixed signals from some of the largest producers 
Nvidia  the industry s biggest maker of chips for computer graphics cards  last month reported quarterly sales that topped analysts  estimates  but the company offered a weak forecast  suggesting demand for gaming graphics chips is recovering slower than predicted 
Texas Instruments  NASDAQ TXN  in October said  most markets weakened further   in the third quarter and gave a fourth quarter revenue forecast that trailed the lowest estimate on Wall Street 
Investors  Bullish Mood
These warnings have so far failed to temper investors  bullish mood about semis  According to analysts  consensus forecasts  the third quarter likely marked a bottom of the industry s down cycle  Growth will then continue to accelerate  By the third quarter of 2020  semi earnings are expected to expand faster than software companies 
For the same reasons  Broadcom s Q4 earnings report and conference call will come under intense scrutiny by investors  who are keen to know if the broad based weakness that chipmakers were facing is over 
Another reason Broadcom s earnings are closely watched  the company derives almost half of its revenue from China  so its sales growth will provide some clues as to how the trade war between the U S  and China is affecting its business  Huawei Technologies Co   which the U S  government has blacklisted  purchases Broadcom switch chips that are a key component in the Chinese company s networking gear 
Broadcom is also a major supplier of chips to Apple Inc  NASDAQ AAPL   making its commentary on the wireless market s demand outlook too important to ignore 
Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan has built a  100 billion company through a spate of acquisitions  including his purchase of part of  Symantec Corp   NASDAQ NLOK  for  10 7 billion in August 
 We believe demand has bottomed out but will continue to remain at these levels due to the current uncertain environment   Tan said in the earnings statement in September  There s little visibility due to the trade war and no sense of a  sharp recovery around the corner   he added on a conference call 
About half of the chips Broadcom sells are either used in China or sent through factories there on the way to becoming part of electronic devices sold around the world  Last year  Huawei accounted for about  900 million of Broadcom s sales  Tan has said  Broadcom stock  which has gained 24  this year to close yesterday at  315 06  has been lagging the benchmark semiconductor index 
Bottom Line
The company s shares have shown some resilience through the recent sluggish period for chipmakers  In our view  the effects of the Huawei ban and macroeconomic risks are well reflected in the current price  Any improvement in U S  China trade relations  or a possible deal that also involves Huawei  would be a big plus for Broadcom  In the meantime  investors watching tomorrow s earnings announcement should also focus on the company s view on 2020  cloud capex spending and smartphone unit trends ",2019-12-11,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/broadcom-earnings-preview-guidance-on-2020-chip-demand-will-be-crucial-200491687,200491687

43012,264527,NLOK,Under pressure  Western tech firms bow to Russian demands to share cyber secrets,news,"By Joel Schectman  Dustin Volz and Jack Stubbs WASHINGTON MOSCOW  Reuters    Western technology companies  including Cisco  O CSCO    IBM   N IBM  and SAP  DE SAPG   are acceding to demands by Moscow for access to closely guarded product security secrets  at a time when Russia has been accused of a growing number of cyber attacks on the West  a Reuters investigation has found  Russian authorities are asking Western tech companies to allow them to review source code for security products such as firewalls  anti virus applications and software containing encryption before permitting the products to be imported and sold in the country  The requests  which have increased since 2014  are ostensibly done to ensure foreign spy agencies have not hidden any  backdoors  that would allow them to burrow into Russian systems  But those inspections also provide the Russians an opportunity to find vulnerabilities in the products  source code   instructions that control the basic operations of computer equipment   current and former U S  officials and security experts said       While a number of U S  firms say they are playing ball to preserve their entree to Russia s huge tech market  at least one U S  firm  Symantec  O SYMC   told Reuters it has stopped cooperating with the source code reviews over security concerns  That halt has not been previously reported   Symantec said one of the labs inspecting its products was not independent enough from the Russian government  U S  officials say they have warned firms about the risks of allowing the Russians to review their products  source code  because of fears it could be used in cyber attacks  But they say they have no legal authority to stop the practice unless the technology has restricted military applications or violates U S  sanctions   From their side  companies say they are under pressure to acquiesce to the demands from Russian regulators or risk being shut out of a lucrative market  The companies say they only allow Russia to review their source code in secure facilities that prevent code from being copied or altered   Graphic on source code review process    The demands are being made by Russia s Federal Security Service  FSB   which the U S  government says took part in the cyber attacks on Hillary Clinton s 2016 presidential campaign and the 2014 hack of 500 million Yahoo  NASDAQ AABA  email accounts  The FSB  which has denied involvement in both the election and Yahoo hacks  doubles as a regulator charged with approving the sale of sophisticated technology products in Russia       The reviews are also conducted by the Federal Service for Technical and Export Control  FSTEC   a Russian defense agency tasked with countering cyber espionage and protecting state secrets  Records published by FSTEC and reviewed by Reuters show that from 1996 to 2013  it conducted source code reviews as part of approvals for 13 technology products from Western companies  In the past three years alone it carried out 28 reviews  A Kremlin spokesman referred all questions to the FSB  The FSB did not respond to requests for comment  FSTEC said in a statement that its reviews were in line with international practice  The U S  State Department declined to comment   Moscow s source code requests have mushroomed in scope since U S  Russia relations went into a tailspin following the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014  according to eight current and former U S  officials  four company executives  three U S  trade attorneys and Russian regulatory documents   In addition to IBM  Cisco and Germany s SAP   Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co   N HPE  and McAfee have also allowed Russia to conduct source code reviews of their products  according to people familiar with the companies  interactions with Moscow and Russian regulatory records      Until now  little has been known about that regulatory review process outside of the industry  The FSTEC documents and interviews with those involved in the reviews provide a rare window into the tense push and pull between technology companies and governments in an era of mounting alarm about hacking  Roszel Thomsen  an attorney who helps U S  tech companies navigate Russia import laws  said the firms must balance the dangers of revealing source code to Russian security services against possible lost sales       Some companies do refuse   he said   Others look at the potential market and take the risk    WE HAVE A REAL CONCERN  If tech firms do decline the FSB s source code requests  then approval for their products can be indefinitely delayed or denied outright  U S  trade attorneys and U S  officials said  The Russian information technology market is expected to be worth  18 4 billion this year  according to market researcher International Data Corporation  IDC    Six current and former U S  officials who have dealt with companies on the issue said they are suspicious about Russia s motives for the expanded reviews    It s something we have a real concern about   said a former senior Commerce Department official who had direct knowledge of the interaction between U S  companies and Russian officials until he left office this year   You have to ask yourself what it is they are trying to do  and clearly they are trying to look for information they can use to their advantage to exploit  and that s obviously a real problem    However  none of the officials who spoke to Reuters could point to specific examples of hacks or cyber espionage that were made possible by the review process  Source code requests are not unique to Russia  In the United States  tech companies allow the government to audit source code in limited instances as part of defense contracts and other sensitive government work  China sometimes also requires source code reviews as a condition to import commercial software  U S  trade attorneys say   CLEAN ROOMS  The reviews often takes place in secure facilities known as  clean rooms   Several of the Russian companies that conduct the testing for Western tech companies on behalf of Russian regulators have current or previous links to the Russian military  according to their websites   Echelon  a Moscow based technology testing company  is one of several independent FSB accredited testing centers that Western companies can hire to help obtain FSB approval for their products   Echelon CEO Alexey Markov told Reuters his engineers review source code in special laboratories  controlled by the companies  where no software data can be altered or transferred    Markov said Echelon is a private and independent company but does have a business relationship with Russia s military and law enforcement authorities   Echelon s website touts medals it was awarded in 2013 by Russia s Ministry of Defense for  protection of state secrets   The company s website also sometimes refers to Markov as the  Head of Attestation Center of the Ministry of Defense    In an email  Markov said that title is only intended to convey Echelon s role as a certified outside tester of military technology testing  The medals were generic and insignificant  he said   But for Symantec  the lab  didn t meet our bar  for independence  said spokeswoman Kristen Batch   In the case of Russia  we decided the protection of our customer base through the deployment of uncompromised security products was more important than pursuing an increase in market share in Russia   said Batch  who added that the company did not believe Russia had tried to hack into its products   In 2016  the company decided it would no longer use third parties  including Echelon  that have ties to a foreign state or get most of their revenue from government mandated security testing    It poses a risk to the integrity of our products that we are not willing to accept   she said  Without the source code approval  Symantec can no longer get approval to sell some of its business oriented security products in Russia   As a result  we do minimal business there   she said   Markov declined to comment on Symantec s decision  citing a non disclosure agreement with the company   TRUSTED LABS  Over the past year  HP has used Echelon to allow FSTEC to review source code  according to the agency s records  A company spokesman declined to comment        An IBM spokesman confirmed the company allows Russia to review its source code in secure  company controlled facilities  where strict procedures are followed   FSTEC certification records showed the Information Security Center  an independent testing company based outside Moscow  has reviewed IBM s source code on behalf of the agency  The company was founded more than 20 years ago under the auspices of an institute within Russia s Ministry of Defense  according to its website  The company did not respond to requests for comment  In a statement  McAfee said the Russia code reviews were conducted  at  certified testing labs  at company owned premises in the United States  SAP allows Russia to review and test source code in a secure SAP facility in Germany  according to a person familiar with the process  In a company statement  SAP said the review process assures Russian customers  their SAP software investments are safe and secure   Cisco has recently allowed Russia to review source code  according to a person familiar with the matter  A Cisco spokeswoman declined to comment on the company s interactions with Russian authorities but said the firm does sometimes allow regulators to inspect small parts of its code in  trusted  independent labs and that the reviews do not compromise the security of its products   Before allowing the reviews  Cisco scrutinizes the code to ensure they are not exposing vulnerabilities that could be used to hack the products  she said   
A White House official said the administration is generally opposed to broad source code requirements because they impede free trade  but whether or not to comply is  a private business decision  ",2017-06-23,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/under-pressure,-western-tech-firms-bow-to-russian-demands-to-share-cyber-secrets-498596",498596

43024,264539,NLOK,Broadcom Earnings To Provide Key Insight On Chip Demand Outlook  China Risk,opinion,"  Reports Q3 2019 results on Thursday  Sept  12  after the close
  Revenue expectation   5 55 billion
  EPS expectation   5 14
When Broadcom  NASDAQ AVGO  CEO Hock Tan speaks  investors can t afford to ignore him  That s because the company he runs is considered a key barometer for the semiconductor industry due to its vast customer base and a diversified product line 
For the same reason  the San Jose  California based company s third quarter earnings report and conference call will come under intense scrutiny by investors  who are keen to know if the broad based weakness that chipmakers are facing is close to bottoming out 
Another reason  Broadcom s earnings are closely watched  the company derives almost half of its revenue from China  so its sales growth will provide some clues as to how the trade war between the U S  and China is affecting its business  Huawei Technologies Co   which the U S  government has blacklisted  purchases Broadcom switch chips that are a key component in the Chinese company s networking gear 
Broadcom is also a major supplier of chips to Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   making its commentary on the wireless market s demand outlook too important to ignore  Sluggish demand from data centers  another significant source of customers for Broadcom  may also weigh on the company s earnings tomorrow and will provide clues as to whether Tan s prediction for the latter part of 2019 remains intact 
Future Prospects Keep Investors Engaged Analysts  on average  expect Broadcom sales to hit  5 55 billion in the quarter  up from  5 07 billion a year ago  Profit should rise to  5 14 share from  4 98  The chipmaker is maintaining its fiscal year 2019 sales forecast of  22 5 billion  About  17 5 billion of that revenue will come from chips and  5 billion from infrastructure software  the company said in a statement last month 
Despite facing some strong headwinds on the demand side  Broadcom has been successful in keeping investors excited about its future prospects  Its stock  trading at  294 44 at yesterday s close  has outperformed the benchmark index  rising 22  in the last 12 months against the 17  expansion in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index 
The company s latest deal to buy Symantec s  NASDAQ SYMC  enterprise security unit   whose products help corporations to save their networks from hackers   is one such move that s likely to strengthen the company s enterprise offerings and further diversify its revenue base

Flying Stocks Near 52 Week Highs to Scale HigherA 52 week high generally serves as an indicator for investors as stocks near that level are perceived to be winners Notably  investors often wonder if the stock is overpriced considering the high price  While the apprehensions are not absolutely baseless  all stocks hitting a 52 week high are not necessarily overpriced In fact  an investor might miss out on top gainers in an attempt to avoid the steep prices of stocks that are near their 52 week high mark A stock can maintain the momentum and keep scaling new highs  So  one should take a more informed approach to understand if further upside is left Here we discuss a strategy to find the right stocks Borrowing from the basics of momentum investing  this technique bets on  buy high  sell higher  52 Week High  A Good IndicatorMany a time  stocks hitting a 52 week high fail to scale higher despite having potential  This is because investors fear that the stocks are overvalued and a price crash is impending In fact  overvaluation is quite natural for most of these stocks as investors  focus  or willingness to pay premium  has helped them reach the level  But that does not always mean an impending decline  Factors such as robust sales  surging profit levels  earnings growth prospects and strategic acquisitions that encouraged investors to bet on these stocks could keep them motivated if there is no tangible negative  In other words  the momentum might continue Also  when a string of positive developments dominates the market  investors find their under reaction

43028,264543,NLOK,Ford Falls Off Cliff  These 3 Companies Could Be Next,opinion,"It s been a long time coming 

PIMCO  the world s largest bond hedge fund  has been warning investors about this for months  So has Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell 

So I wasn t surprised when the first domino in the corporate debt crisis fell last week 

Credit rating agency Moody s downgraded Ford Motor Company s  NYSE F  bonds from investment grade to  junk  status last Monday 

The downgrade affected Ford s entire  84 billion debt load  according to Bloomberg 

Ford s share price dropped 3  on the news  But don t let the relatively small drop fool you  This is the start of something much bigger 

A recent Moody s report suggests as many as 47 companies are on the edge of the  BBB cliff   just barely above junk bond status  Ford was likely the first of many Fortune 500 companies that will fall over the edge in the months ahead 

As I ll explain shortly  a mass downgrade of corporate debt could force institutional investors to dump hundreds of billions of dollars worth of bonds  leading to a crisis in the bond market 

At the end  I ll tell you about three of the highest risk companies  If you hold any of these stocks in your retirement account  you should sell them fast 
Let s Talk About the  BBB Cliff 

You already know that agencies like Moody s and Standard   Poor s  S P  rate corporate bonds 

Remember  when you invest in corporate bonds  you re effectively loaning the company money  The company s credit rating indicates how risky its bonds are  In other words  how likely the company is to stiff its lenders and default on its bonds 

BBB is S P s lowest possible investment grade rating for corporate bonds  Everything below that is considered  junk  

This is what investors are referring to when they talk about  the BBB cliff   It s the last stop before junk bond status 
An Unprecedented Situation

Of all the investment grade corporate debt  BBB rated bonds are the most vulnerable to a junk downgrade during a recession 

Historically  this hasn t been a big problem  For a long time  BBB rated debt only made up a small sliver of the bond market 

However  in the last 10 years  BBB rated bonds have gone from 34  of the investment grade bond market to over 50  

Source  S P Global Fixed Income Research



Today  the BBB debt market is worth  3 trillion up from  800 billion in 2008  A decade of ultralow interest rates has fueled this massive increase 

Now  recession is likely around the corner  If the economy rolls over and interest rates rise as they do in every recession a lot of this BBB rated debt will get downgraded to junk 

At the same time  pension funds and mutual funds hold huge amount of low grade debt 

But they typically can t hold junk bonds  So a mass downgrade would force them to dump their BBB turned junk bonds on the market 
This Poses a Huge Threat to US Stocks

Think back to the days just before the housing crisis  If only a handful of people had defaulted on their mortgages  it wouldn t have mattered much  But millions of people defaulted  and it triggered a crisis that spread far beyond the housing market 
The same logic applies to the BBB cliff 

When one multi billion dollar company like Ford is downgraded  the junk bond market can absorb its bad debt 

But 50 multi billion dollar companies at once  That would be a disaster 

Pension funds would be forced to sell the downgraded debt on their books  even at a loss   And all of these new junk bonds would overwhelm the market 

Keep in mind  this isn t just a problem for the bond market  A mass downgrade would also tank those companies  stocks  and potentially the entire stock market 

And  considering that Moody s took the unusual step of downgrading Ford without putting it  on watch  first  there could be wave of similar downgrades with little to no notice 
Sell These 3 Toxic Stocks Now

Like I said  the Ford downgrade didn t surprise me 

I m always on the lookout for safe and reliable dividend paying stocks  And Ford s stock is anything but  With a lot of low grade debt and an unstable 6  dividend yield  it was an obvious target 

But remember  there are at least 50 or so other companies at risk of falling off the BBB cliff  Let s take a closer look at three of the riskiest 

Semiconductor giant Broadcom Inc   NASDAQ AVGO  is the largest of the bunch  Before 2018  Broadcom was a pillar of financial responsibility  Then the company surprised investors and bought software company Symantec  NASDAQ SYMC  for  10 7 billion 

Ever since  Broadcom s BBB rated debt and its dividend have been on shaky ground 

US industrial giant  General Electric   NYSE GE  is also at risk  Moody s downgraded GE s bonds last year to three notches above junk  Since then  the company s stock has plunged 28  

If GE is downgraded to junk  it would instantly increase the junk bond market by 10   That s how large its debts are 

This could crush GE s stock price and the entire junk bond market overnight 

Then there s cell tower behemoth American Tower Corp   NYSE AMT   The company has been on a full blown debt binge lately  It issued  1 3 billion in low grade  BBB rated bonds in 2019 alone 

Like Ford  it s at risk of being downgraded without warning 

All of these companies are hanging on the edge of the BBB cliff  Once the economy starts rolling over  these bonds will become toxic  When that happens  it could crush their stock prices 

If you own Broadcom  NASDAQ AVGO   GE  American Tower  NYSE AMT   or any of the other 50 or so at risk companies  it s time to sell before their share prices plummet ",2019-09-25,Robert Ross,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ford-falls-off-cliff-these-3-companies-could-be-next-200467927,200467927

Overall  with interest rates so low  it seems likely that stocks continue to climb  especially the right stocks  With this in mind  we searched using our  for large cap  blue chip technology firms that boast stable  growth businesses 
1  Adobe   NASDAQ ADBE  
Adobe helped revolutionize the modern digital age when it invented the Portable Document Format  better known as the PDF  in the early 1990s  Today  the company sells a variety of offerings  from its suite of creative software such as Photoshop to cloud based subscription solutions for businesses  One of the company s newer units aims to capitalize on the rapid rise of digital media  that has turned everyone into content creators  Adobe Spark allows users to create web pages  graphics  and short videos  in minutes   The firm  which has seen its stock price surge 26  in 2019 to crush S P 500 and its industry s 18  climb  on September 17 topped Q3 fiscal 2019 earnings and revenue estimates 
Looking ahead  our Zacks Consensus Estimates call for Adobe s adjusted fourth quarter earnings to jump 23 5  on 20 5  higher revenue  The company s full year fiscal 2019 EPS figure is expected to pop 16  on 23 5  sales growth that would see it reach  11 15 billion  This would match 2018 s 23 7  surge and mark the continuation of between 22  and 25  sales expansion over the last three years  ADBE s fiscal 2020 earnings are then projected to jump 24  higher on 17  stronger revenue  Adobe has also seen its 2019 earnings estimate revision activity trend heavily upward to help it earn a Zacks Rank  2  Buy

3  Microsoft   NASDAQ MSFT   
Microsoft is the most well known company on this list and its shares have crushed all of the so called FAANG stocks over the last 12 months blowing away second and third placed Facebook   NASDAQ FB   and Google   NASDAQ GOOGL    MSFT is the only company currently in the trillion dollar market cap club  as Apple   NASDAQ AAPL   continues to jump in and out  The Redmond  Washington based company s legacy businesses  such as Office and Windows have evolved and it is now the second largest could computing firm behind only Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN    The company also recently announced that it raised its quarterly cash dividend by 11  and approved a new stock buyback program

43030,264545,NLOK,It s Time To Add Semis Back Into Your Portfolio ,opinion,"Semiconductors have been in a period of negative growth since mid 2018 into 2019 due to the cyclical nature of the sector  Semis are just now beginning to rise from their cyclical ashes creating some cultivating opportunities 
The space is ready to heat back up with resumed hyperscaling and 5G developments  Below are a few stock prospects for semi s jump back into growth 
Broadcom   NASDAQ AVGO  
Broadcom has been on my investment horizon since their shrewd acquisition of CA Technologies  an IT management software   solutions company  back in July of 2018  which created a potent buying opportunity following its dip  This cross sector acquisition turned this once pure play semiconductor firm into an infrastructure technology conglomerates  allowing the firm to enjoy economies of scope 
Business
Broadcom became the second largest publicly traded semi company by market capitalization after its combinations with Avago in 2016  hence the ticker AVGO   This firm has been able to consistently outperform the semi market  with its savvy acquisitions and its first class R D team that is able to push out needed innovations perpetually 
Broadcom s claim to fame is its wired infrastructure used in data centers and embedded network infrastructure  Mobile chips make up the second largest segment  with Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  being this segment s single largest customer 
Next Deal
Broadcom is now in the process of purchasing Symantec   NASDAQ SYMC    a cybersecurity firm  This will further expand the firm s scope beyond the semiconductor space and shield it from some of that sector s cyclicality 
Management s ability to see and execute intelligent acquisitions with seamless integration  all while organically growing the business  gives me immense confidence in their leadership  Hock Tan has been CEO of Broadcom since 2006 IPO and has driven stock returns of over 1 400  since the company went public in 2009 
This firm has shown extraordinary resilience to the semiconductors  cyclical downturn with consistent year over year topline growth since the firm went public  I expect this growth to accelerate as data center scaling and mobile sales escalate 
Opportunity
AVGO has been in a slump over the past 6 months as investors weigh the synergies and cost of the Symantec purchase  I believe that the rational management team knows what they are doing  and it s only a matter of time before a rally in this stock begins 
I have one technical concern with the stock s current level  Looking at the chart below  you will notice that the 50 day moving average  red  just crossed the 200 day moving average  green   which traders call the  death cross   The death cross could be a sign of a further downside  but looking at the company s fundamentals  I am not entirely confident in that technical indicator 

AVGO is trading below at a forward P E of 12x  which is roughly the lowest valuation that AVGO has had in the past 5 years  The stock is trading below its industry average and the broader market 
This stall in share price has created an opportunity to jump into this semiconductor leader with a management team that I would follow into battle  AVGO has some short term volatility risk  but ample long term potential 
Other Semi Bets
AMD   NASDAQ AMD   has had a hell of a run with a 5 year share price appreciation of close to 1000   CPUs and GPUs are the firm s largest segment  AMD is competing with semi powerhouses like Intel   NASDAQ INTC   and Nvidia   NASDAQ NVDA   for market share  They have succeeded in taking some market share from both through their aggressive pricing model 
The aggressive pricing has caused AMD to toe the line of profitability continuously  Investors love AMD  but I am not as convinced  primarily when reflecting on its forward P E of 29x  considerably above its industry average  Analysts are predicting accelerated topline growth and margin expansion if this company can continue to take market share  AMD is a stock to keep an eye on 
My favorite semiconductor stock is Nvidia   NASDAQ NVDA    and any price below  200 looks good to me  This firm s GPU capabilities are unmatched by any in the business and are going to take data center  gaming   VR as well as artificial intelligence to the next level  Nvidia is effectively the only GPU in data centers today because of its top notch functionality that no other firm has been able to match 
Nvidia s leadership in gaming is expanding  with its VR and cloud platforms being on the forefront  GeForce Now  NVDA s cloud gaming platform is still in the beta stage  but analysts and forums are saying this is going to be THE cloud gaming platform of the future  NVDA is a robust long term buy 
Take Away 
The cyclical semiconductor industry is on an upswing  and it is time to add your favorite chip companies back into your portfolio  Above are some of my top chip picks and ones to keep an eye on

43041,264556,NLOK,UK venture firm Notion wins overseas backers to avert Brexit fund gap,news,"By Eric Auchard
FRANKFURT  Reuters    UK based business software venture capital firm Notion Capital has increased funding for European business software start ups by bringing in new investors from the United States and the Middle East  the firm said on Tuesday 
The venture firm said it has brought in additional international investors including Cisco Systems  NASDAQ CSCO   the U S  endowments of Emory University and Texas A M and an unnamed sovereign wealth fund from the Middle East 
These moves means it now draws fully half its funding from outside Europe  ensuring the London based firm has alternative financing sources to the European Investment Fund  EIF   a current major backer  after Britain completes its planned withdrawal from the European Union    
Notion is Europe s largest dedicated financer of business to business  cloud based software firms  with  300 million of assets under management 
It also closed a new  80 million  61 9 million pounds  growth equity fund to make follow on bets on its most successful ventures  rather than turning to outside investors  often from the United States  to fund companies in later stages of growth 
The firm said it had expanded and completed its third venture fund  raising  140 million  a 40 percent increase from its second fund 
Two of its most successful early investments   marketing firm NewVoiceMedia  which has raised  141 million to date  and invoicing platform Tradeshift  with  182 million in funding   are ready to consider stock market flotations over the next two years  Managing Partner Stephen Chandler said in an interview 
Other current investments include money transfer firm Currencycloud  financial contract processor Dealflo  direct debit bill collector GoCardless  hotel booking site TripTease and human resources software maker Workable 
Around 40 percent of the companies Notion funds are located in Britain  with the rest spread across Europe 
The focus on Britain reflects the fact that the country remains the center for business software firms  Chandler said 
The venture firm  led by partners who built security firm MessageLabs and sold it to Symantec  NASDAQ SYMC  for around  700 million  named as new partners Chrys Chrysanthou  formerly of Cisco  Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  Web Services and Accel Partners  and Patrick Norris  a serial entrepreneur and former  Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS  banker

43042,264557,NLOK,Researchers say global cyber attack similar to North Korean hacks,news,"By Ju min Park and Dustin Volz SEOUL WASHINGTON  Reuters    Cybersecurity researchers have found evidence they say could link North Korea with the WannaCry cyber attack that has infected more than 300 000 computers worldwide  as global authorities scrambled to prevent hackers from spreading new versions of the virus  A researcher from South Korea s Hauri Labs said on Tuesday their own findings matched those of Symantec  O SYMC  and Kaspersky Lab  who said on Monday that some code in an earlier version of the WannaCry software had also appeared in programs used by the Lazarus Group  identified by some researchers as a North Korea run hacking operation   It is similar to North Korea s backdoor malicious codes   said Simon Choi  a senior researcher with Hauri who has done extensive research into North Korea s hacking capabilities and advises South Korean police and National Intelligence Service  Both Symantec and Kaspersky said it was too early to tell whether North Korea was involved in the attacks  based on the evidence that was published on Twitter by Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  security researcher Neel Mehta  The attacks  which slowed on Monday  are among the fastest spreading extortion campaigns on record  WannaCry includes hacking tools believed to belong to the U S  National Security Agency which were leaked online last month  A group that has taken credit for the leak threatened to release more recent code to enable hackers to break into the world s most widely used computers  software and phones  A blog post claiming to have been written by the ShadowBrokers group promised from June to release tools every month to anyone willing to pay for access to some of the tech world s biggest commercial secrets  It also threatened to dump data from banks using the SWIFT international money transfer network and from Russian  Chinese  Iranian or North Korean nuclear and missile programs  without providing further details   More details in June   it promised  NO INFORMATION TO SHARE  In China  foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said she had no information to share  when asked about the origin of the attack and whether North Korea might be connected  Several Asian countries have been affected by the malware  although the impact has not been as widespread as some had feared  In Malaysia  cybersecurity firm LE Global Services said it identified 12 cases so far  including a large government linked corporation  a government linked investment firm and an insurance company  It did not name any of the entities   We may not see the real picture yet  as companies are not mandated to disclose security breaches to authorities in Malaysia   said LE Global CEO Fong Choong Fook   The real situation may be serious  In one of the cases  the attack was traced back to early April   Vietnam s state media said on Tuesday more than 200 computers had been affected  but one of the country s leading anti virus companies  Bkav  later put the figure at 1 900  Taiwan Power Co   said that nearly 800 of its computers were affected  although these were used for administration  not for systems involved in electricity generation  EXPERTS URGE CAUTION FireEye Inc  O FEYE   another large cyber security firm  said it was also investigating  but it was cautious about drawing a link to North Korea   The similarities we see between malware linked to that group and WannaCry are not unique enough to be strongly suggestive of a common operator   FireEye researcher John Miller said  U S  and European security officials told Reuters on condition of anonymity that it was too early to say who might be behind the attacks  but they did not rule out North Korea as a suspect  The Lazarus hackers  acting for impoverished North Korea  have been more brazen in their pursuit of financial gain than others  and have been blamed for the theft of  81 million from the Bangladesh central bank  according to some cyber security firms  The United States accused it of being behind a cyber attack on Sony Pictures in 2014  An official at South Korea s Korea Internet   Security Agency said on Tuesday the agency was sharing information with intelligence officials on recent cases reported for damages but was not in position to investigate the source of the attack  The official declined to comment on intelligence related matters  A South Korean police official that handles investigations into hacking and cyber breaches said he was aware of reports on the North Korean link  but said police were not investigating yet  Victims haven t requested investigations but they want their systems to be restored  the official said  North Korea has denied being behind the Sony and banking attacks  North Korean officials were not immediately available for comment and its state media has been quiet about the matter  Hauri researcher Choi said the code bore similarities with those allegedly used by North Korean hackers in the Sony and bank heists  He said based on his conversations with North Korean hackers  the reclusive state had been developing and testing ransomware programs since August  In one case  alleged hackers from North Korea demanded bitcoin in exchange for client information they had stolen from a South Korean shopping mall  Choi added   While the attacks have raised concerns for cyber authorities and end users worldwide  they have helped cybersecurity stocks as investors bet governments and corporations will spend more to upgrade their defenses

43043,264558,NLOK,Companies use kidnap insurance to guard against ransomware attacks,news,"By Suzanne Barlyn and Carolyn Cohn NEW YORK LONDON  Reuters    Companies without cyber insurance are dusting off policies covering kidnap  ransom and extortion in the world s political hotspots to recoup losses caused by ransomware viruses such as  WannaCry   insurers say  Cyber insurance can be expensive to buy and is not widely used outside the United States  with one insurer previously describing the cost as  100 000 for  10 million in data breach insurance  Some companies do not even consider it because they do not think they are targets  The kidnap policies  known as K R coverage  are typically used by multinational companies looking to protect their staff in areas where violence related to oil and mining operations is common  such as parts of Africa and Latin America  Companies could also tap them to cover losses following the WannaCry attack  which used malicious software  known as ransomware  to lock up more than 200 000 computers in more than 150 countries  and demand payments to free them up  Pay outs on K R for ransomware attacks may be lower and the policies less suitable than those offered by traditional cyber insurance  insurers say   There will be some creative forensic lawyers who will be looking at policies   said Patrick Gage  chief underwriting officer at CNA Hardy  a specialist commercial insurer  in London  He added  however  that given that K R policies are geared towards a threat to lives   our absolute preference is that people buy specific cover  rather than relying on insurance coverage that is not specific   American International Group Inc  N AIG    Hiscox  Ltd  L HSX  and the Travelers Companies Inc  N TRV  have been receiving ransomware claims from some customers with K R policies as ransomware attacks become more common  the companies said  The insurers declined to comment on total claims  citing confidentiality and client security concerns   We are seeing claims  over the past 18 months  but not a huge uptick   a Hiscox spokeswoman said   These are within expectations and entirely manageable   She declined to say whether the firm had seen any such claims from the WannaCry attacks though Tom Harvey  an expert in cyber risk management at catastrophe modeling firm RMS  said  insurers with kidnap and ransom books will want to look closely at their policy wordings to see whether they are exposed   A sharp rise in ransomware attacks in the past 18 months has driven companies to use K R policies to cover some of their damages if they do not have direct cyber coverage or cannot meet initial cyber policy deductible costs  insurers said   Symantec Corp    O SYMC   a cyber security firm based in Mountain View in California  observed over 460 000 ransomware attempts in 2016  up 36 percent from 2015  the company said  The average payment demand ballooned from  294 to  1 077  a 266 percent increase  But as the threat mounts  K R insurers are at risk from steeper claims than they had anticipated  They are responding by making changes to their policies  which were not designed around ransomware  insurance brokers said  MORE DAMAGING THEN KIDNAPPING Most of the computers affected by WannaCry were outside the United States  where companies have been slow to buy cyber insurance  Nearly 90 percent of the world s annual cyber insurance premium of  2 5 3 billion comes from the U S  market  according to insurance broker Aon Plc  N AON   Global companies typically buy K R policies without ransomware in mind  But instances of high tech hacks and online ransom demands can hit a company s business more than an executive being held hostage   If your CFO  chief financial officer  gets kidnapped  the company is going to continue to function   said Bob Parisi  cyber product leader for insurance broker Marsh  a subsidiary of Marsh   McLennan Companies Inc   N MMC   If you get a piece of malware in the system  you might have two factories that stop working  The actual damage is probably greater   The K R policies  which typically do not have deductibles  cover the ransom payments as well as crisis response services  including getting in touch with criminal and regulatory authorities  said Kevin Kalinich  global head of Aon s cyber risk practice  Still  K R policies may provide only a quick fix since they were not designed for ransomware  Companies can add coverage for business interruption  but the upper limits for pay outs are usually lower than for a cyber policy  insurers say  K R insurers have been adapting to ransomware related claims   some are modernizing coverage by setting up Bitcoin accounts for clients to speed up ransom payments  brokers said  But insurers are mindful of their own risks  Some have added deductibles  said Anthony Dagostino  head of global cyber risk at Willis Towers Watson PLC  O WLTW  advisory and brokerage  AIG has reduced business interruption coverage for K R policies to a  1 million maximum for cyber extortion events   Insurers didn t anticipate there would be this much ransomware activity   said Tracie Grella  global head of cyber risk insurance at AIG

43047,264562,NLOK,U S  muni market slowly starts paying heed to cyber risks,news,"By Hilary Russ NEW YORK  Reuters    A rise in cyber attacks on U S  public sector targets so far has had little impact in the  3 8 trillion municipal debt market  with no issuer as yet hit by a downgrade or higher borrowing costs because of a cyber security threat  That is beginning to change   S P Global has begun to quiz states  cities and towns about their cyber defenses  and some credit analysts are starting to factor cyber security when they look at bonds  Moody s Investors Service is also trying to figure out how to best evaluate cyber risk  The shift follows a particularly steep rise in ransomware attacks  when criminals hold an entity s computer system hostage until a small ransom is paid  The number of global ransomware detections rose 36 percent in 2016 from the year before  to 463 841  with the United States most heavily affected  according to cyber security firm  Symantec Corp   NASDAQ SYMC   Such attacks  which have also hit companies and federal entities  have spared no kind of municipal issuer large or small  from police departments to school districts and transit agencies  Ransomware attacks on state and local governments and their agencies have risen in proportion with the overall increase  according to cyber insurance provider Beazley Group   State and local governments are a huge target  quite frankly an easy target for bad guys   said Bob Anderson  managing director for information security at Navigant management consulting firm in Washington and a former global cyber investigator at the Federal Bureau of Investigation   Last month s  WannaCry  ransomware attack  which hobbled global businesses and Britain s National Health Service  may also be prompting renewed focus on cyber security  though it had minimal impact in the United States  Considering a potential cyber attack as a similar risk to a natural disaster  S P has already been reviewing cyber security defenses of utilities  hospitals and colleges because they were early public sector targets for hackers  Now it is also beginning to ask cities and states about the costs and level of security measures and the financial impact of successful attacks  said Geoffrey Buswick  who manages S P s public sector ratings   HEAD IN THE SAND The answers feed into broader categories that affect an issuer s ratings  particularly governance  liquidity and operations  Many breaches are handled quickly and financial damage is limited  but not every attack will necessarily end that way  Buswick said   We re trying to get sense of who has their head in the sand and who doesn t   Fitch Ratings said it does not consider cyber security in its ratings  and many investors still are not concerned enough to ask for details   In part  that is because it can be difficult to assess the operational and financial fallout of such attacks  Some high profile breaches so far have also done limited damage to issuers  finances  Case in point is the state of South Carolina  which in August 2012 suffered possibly the worst cyber attack yet of any city or state   When hackers stole the personal data of more than 3 5 million taxpayers  the state had to investigate  provide credit monitoring and consumer fraud protection  and implement a slew of post breach upgrades  according to State Senator Thomas Alexander  The total cost is around  76 million and counting  he said  That is enough to pay for several school programs combined  But against South Carolina s annual general fund budget of roughly  8 billion  the costs made no dent in its standing as a borrower  Many issuers do not disclose any information to potential investors in bond documents about cyber risks or defenses  But a few  particularly hospitals and utilities  have started doing so  In a February prospectus  the Maryland Health and Higher Educational Facilities Authority  the state s largest public debt issuer  included nearly a full page devoted to the growing risk of cyber attacks   Because we re such a large issuer  and because healthcare is often treated much more like a corporate credit  the legal counsels to the transaction weigh in on the bondholder risk section   said Annette Anselmi  the authority s Executive Director  noting that such disclosures also evolve depending on what kinds of questions the market is asking  Hospitals are also ahead on cyber security disclosure because they rely on huge amounts of data  said Court Street Group analyst Joseph Krist  Eventually  he expects others to follow suit  
 We went through this with getting munis to     disclose more pension information  Those were frankly long and painful processes  It just has to get to a critical mass  ",2017-06-14,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/u.s.-muni-market-slowly-starts-paying-heed-to-cyber-risks-495192,495192

43065,264580,NLOK,3 Stocks To Watch In The Coming Week  Broadcom  Kroger  Aurora Cannabis,opinion,"After the U S  and China announced last week that they plan to resume trade negotiations in October  optimism for a resolution to the ongoing trade dispute buoyed markets  Worries about the future of U S  China trade  a slowing economy in Europe  and Brexit turmoil kept shares under pressure last month 

But hope seems to be returning to markets in September including ongoing consumer strength in the U S  and unemployment at near 50 year lows  The services sector continues to expand  helping to ease investor concerns about the future of the U S  economy and markets 
Still  with the macro environment likely to remain uncertain in the short run  these three stocks that could move in the coming week  after each releases earnings reports 
1  Broadcom
The final big chipmaker to release earnings this current season is Broadcom  NASDAQ AVGO   The company reports Q3 2019 numbers on Thursday  Sept  12  after the close  Consensus calls for  5 14 EPS on  5 44 billion in revenue 

The latest downturn in the semiconductor industry has hit some producers hard  but Broadcom seems to be weathering the storm quite well  Its shares  which closed on Friday at  291 91  are up about 26  over the past one year  even as the Semiconductor Index rose about 15  
What s exciting investors about Broadcom is the company s current strategy  spearheaded by its CEO Hock Tan  to grow through acquisitions and buy software assets that are struggling but have growth potential  Last month  the company announced it was acquiring Symantec Corporation s  NASDAQ SYMC  enterprise security division  which produces software to keep hackers out of corporate systems  for  10 billion 
The acquisition marks Broadcom s second big bet in software  following its  19 billion takeover of CA Technologies last year  After these deals  more than 80  of Broadcom s sales will now be derived from more stable and sustainable businesses such as cloud  networking  software and storage segments 
2  The Kroger Co Supermarket behemoth  Kroger  NYSE KR  will report its second quarter earnings on Thursday as well  before the market opens  Analysts are expecting  0 41 a share profit for the period ended June 30 on sales of  28 4 billion 





Shares of Kroger have fallen 24  during the past one year amid investor concerns that Walmart  NYSE WMT  and other rivals are taking market share from the Cincinnati based grocery chain which is struggling to put together a winning strategy in this tough competitive environment 
In the first quarter  its same store sales missed analyst projections  while profit margins decreased because of investments the company has been making to keep pace with the competition  To defend its turf  the largest U S  supermarket chain acquired Home Chef  a meal kit company and expanded its partnership with Instacart  a San Francisco based  same day grocery delivery service which operates in some areas of the U S 
3  Aurora Cannabis Aurora Cannabis   NYSE ACB    TSX ACB   one of the largest marijuana producers  will report Q4 2019 earnings on Wednesday Sept  11  after the close  Analysts are forecasting a loss of  0 04 a share on sales of  81 56 million 




Last month  Aurora said its saleable production during the fourth quarter was at the high end of its previous guidance  or perhaps even above  The Edmonton based company is expecting its revenue from all sources will rise to between  100  107 million  but it didn t provide an estimate on fourth quarter earnings 
Marijuana companies are coming under greater scrutiny as they struggle to achieve profitability after Canada legalized recreational use of cannabis last year  Trading around  6 a share  Aurora shares have lost more than 20  of their value this year  amid a widespread sector sell off that pushed the stocks of many top cannabis producers sharply lower 
Aurora operates in 21 countries with a strong presence in the European Union  The company announced early this year that billionaire investor Nelson Peltz is joining Aurora as a strategic adviser ",2019-09-08,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-stocks-to-watch-in-the-coming-week-broadcom-kroger-aurora-cannabis-200462657,200462657

43077,264592,NLOK,WikiLeaks says it releases files on CIA cyber spying tools,news,"By Dustin Volz and Warren Strobel WASHINGTON  Reuters    Anti secrecy group WikiLeaks on Tuesday published what it said were thousands of pages of internal CIA discussions about hacking techniques used over several years  renewing concerns about the security of consumer electronics and embarrassing yet another U S  intelligence agency  The discussion transcripts showed that CIA hackers could get into Apple Inc  NASDAQ AAPL  iPhones   Google Inc   NASDAQ GOOGL  Android devices and other gadgets in order to capture text and voice messages before they were encrypted with sophisticated software  Cyber security experts disagreed about the extent of the fallout from the data dump  but said a lot would depend on whether WikiLeaks followed through on a threat to publish the actual hacking tools that could do damage  Reuters could not immediately verify the contents of the published documents  but several contractors and private cyber security experts said the materials  dated between 2013 and 2016  appeared to be legitimate  A longtime intelligence contractor with expertise in U S  hacking tools told Reuters the documents included correct  cover  terms describing active cyber programs  Among the most noteworthy WikiLeaks claims is that the Central Intelligence Agency  in partnership with other U S  and foreign agencies  has been able to bypass the encryption on popular messaging apps such as WhatsApp  Telegram and Signal  The files did not indicate the actual encryption of Signal or other secure messaging apps had been compromised  The information in what WikiLeaks said were 7 818 web pages with 943 attachments appears to represent the latest breach in recent years of classified material from U S  intelligence agencies  Security experts differed over how much the disclosures could damage U S  cyber espionage  Many said that  while harmful  they do not compare to former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden s revelations in 2013 of mass NSA data collection   This is a big dump about extremely sophisticated tools that can be used to target individual user devices     I haven t yet come across the mass exploiting of mobile devices   said Tarah Wheeler  senior director of engineering and principal security advocate for Symantec  NASDAQ SYMC   Stuart McClure  CEO of Cylance  an Irvine  California  cyber security firm  said that one of the most significant disclosures shows how CIA hackers cover their tracks by leaving electronic trails suggesting they are from Russia  China and Iran rather than the United States  Other revelations show how the CIA took advantage of vulnerabilities that are known  if not widely publicized  In one case  the documents say  U S  and British personnel  under a program known as Weeping Angel  developed ways to take over a Samsung  KS 005930  smart television  making it appear it was off when in fact it was recording conversations in the room   The CIA and White House declined comment   We do not comment on the authenticity or content of purported intelligence documents   CIA spokesman Jonathan Liu said in a statement  Google declined to comment on the purported hacking of its Android platform  but said it was investigating the matter  Snowden on Twitter said the files amount to the first public evidence that the U S  government secretly buys software to exploit technology  referring to a table published by WikiLeaks that appeared to list various Apple iOS flaws purchased by the CIA and other intelligence agencies  Apple Inc did not respond to a request for comment  The documents refer to means for accessing phones directly in order to catch messages before they are protected by end to end encryption tools like Signal  Signal inventor Moxie Marlinspike said he took that as  confirmation that what we re doing is working   Signal and the like are  pushing intelligence agencies from a world of undetectable mass surveillance to a world where they have to use expensive  high risk  extremely targeted attacks   CIA CYBER PROGRAMS  The CIA in recent years underwent a restructuring to focus more on cyber warfare to keep pace with the increasing digital sophistication of foreign adversaries  The spy agency is prohibited by law from collecting intelligence that details domestic activities of Americans and is generally restricted in how it may gather any U S  data for counterintelligence purposes  The documents published Tuesday appeared to supply specific details to what has been long known in the abstract  U S  intelligence agencies  like their allies and adversaries  are constantly working to discover and exploit flaws in any manner of technology products  Unlike the Snowden leaks  which revealed the NSA was secretly collecting details of telephone calls by ordinary Americans  the new WikiLeaks material did not appear to contain material that would fundamentally change what is publicly known about cyber espionage  WikiLeaks  led by Julian Assange  said its publication of the documents on the hacking tools was the first in a series of releases drawing from a data set that includes several hundred million lines of code and includes the CIA s  entire hacking capacity   The documents only include snippets of computer code  not the full programs that would be needed to conduct cyber exploits  WikiLeaks said it was refraining from disclosing usable code from CIA s cyber arsenal  until a consensus emerges on the technical and political nature of the C I A  s program and how such  weapons  should be analyzed  disarmed and published   U S  intelligence agencies have said that Wikileaks has ties to Russia s security services  During the 2016 U S  presidential campaign  Wikileaks published internal emails of top Democratic Party officials  which the agencies said were hacked by Moscow as part of a coordinated influence campaign to help Republican Donald Trump win the presidency  WikiLeaks has denied ties to Russian spy agencies  Trump praised WikiLeaks during the campaign  often citing hacked emails it published to bolster his attacks on Democratic Party candidate Hillary Clinton  WikiLeaks said on Tuesday that the documents showed that the CIA hoarded serious security vulnerabilities rather than share them with the public  as called for under a process established by President Barack Obama  Rob Knake  a former official who dealt with the issue under Obama  said he had not seen evidence in what was published to support that conclusion  The process  is not a policy of unilateral disarmament in cyberspace  The mere fact that the CIA may have exploited zero day  previously undisclosed  vulnerabilities should not surprise anyone   said Knake  now at the Council on Foreign Relations  U S  officials  speaking on condition of anonymity  said they did not know where WikiLeaks might have obtained the material  In a press release  the group said   The archive appears to have been circulated among former U S  government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner  one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive   U S  intelligence agencies have suffered a series of security breaches  including Snowden s  In 2010  U S  military intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning provided more than 700 000 documents  videos  diplomatic cables and battlefield accounts to Wikileaks

43079,264594,NLOK,Symantec attributes 40 cyber attacks to CIA linked hacking tools,news,"By Joseph Menn SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters    Past cyber attacks on scores of organizations around the world were conducted with top secret hacking tools that were exposed recently by the Web publisher Wikileaks  the security researcher  Symantec Corp   O SYMC  said on Monday  That means the attacks were likely conducted by the U S  Central Intelligence Agency  The files posted by WikiLeaks appear to show internal CIA discussions of various tools for hacking into phones  computers and other electronic gear  along with programming code for some of them  and multiple people familiar with the matter have told Reuters that the documents came from the CIA or its contractors  Symantec said it had connected at least 40 attacks in 16 countries to the tools obtained by WikiLeaks  though it followed company policy by not formally blaming the CIA  The CIA has not confirmed the Wikileaks documents are genuine  But agency spokeswoman Heather Fritz Horniak said that any WikiLeaks disclosures aimed at damaging the intelligence community  not only jeopardize U S  personnel and operations  but also equip our adversaries with tools and information to do us harm    It is important to note that CIA is legally prohibited from conducting electronic surveillance targeting individuals here at home  including our fellow Americans  and CIA does not do so   Horniak said  She declined to comment on the specifics of Symantec s research  The CIA tools described by Wikileaks do not involve mass surveillance  and all of the targets were government entities or had legitimate national security value for other reasons  Symantec researcher Eric Chien said ahead of Monday s publication   In part because some of the targets are U S  allies in Europe   there are organizations in there that people would be surprised were targets   Chien said   Symantec said sectors targeted by operations employing the tools included financial  telecommunications  energy  aerospace  information technology  education  and natural resources  Besides Europe  countries were hit in the Middle East  Asia  and Africa  One computer was infected in the United States in what was likely an accident   the infection was removed within hours  All the programs were used to open back doors  collect and remove copies of files  rather than to destroy anything  The eavesdropping tools were created at least as far back as 2011 and possibly as long ago as 2007  Chien said  He said the WikiLeaks documents are so complete that they likely encompass the CIA s entire hacking toolkit  including many taking advantage of previously unknown flaws   The CIA is best known for its human intelligence sources and analysis  not vast electronic operations  For that reason  being forced to build new tools is a setback but not a catastrophe  It could lead to awkward conversations  however  as more allies realize the Americans were spying and confront them  Separately  a group calling itself the Shadow Brokers on Saturday released another batch of pilfered National Security Agency hacking tools  along with a blog post criticizing President Donald Trump for attacking Syria and moving away from his conservative political base

The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on August 8  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This security software maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 32 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  5 9  
Revenues are expected to be  1 19 billion  up 2 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change

Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Symantec 
For Symantec  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Symantec will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Symantec would post earnings of  0 39 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 39  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Symantec doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-31,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-symantec-symc-q1-earnings-expected-to-decline-200449191,200449191

43103,264618,NLOK,Broadcom To Buy Symantec s Enterprise Security Business  Symantec Earnings After Bell,opinion,"Broadcom   NASDAQ AVGO   and Symantec   NASDAQ SYMC   are back in the boardroom attempting to rehash a deal that fell through last month  This time instead of Broadcom targeting the entire cybersecurity firm  it will only be going after Symantec s enterprise business  Broadcom shares stumbled 1 5  on this news while Symantec shares surge over 12  
Symantic shares have been a rollercoaster of emotions since the initial merger talks at the beginning of July  The early rumors of a full acquisition by Broadcom shot SYMC up over 16  in a few days  When the deal broke down so did share of Symantec  which have fallen over 20  since  The chart below compares SYMC  red  and AVGO  blue  since the initial merger talks were reported 

Symantec investors have been very sensitive to any news about a potential acquisition as the business has been rocky over the past 5 years  2018 s topline was 30  below that of 5 years prior  though the last 2 years have seen some bounce back 
This purchase appears offbeat from an outside perspective  but Broadcom is attempting to broaden its scope of business and diversify its portfolio  I believe that this cross sector acquisition holds synergies that the nimble Hock Tan  Broadcom CEO  plans to leverage in Broadcom s transition into an infrastructure technology conglomerate   
Symantec s entire market value is  12 6 billion  and according to the Wall Street Journal s report  the deal could be valued at  10 billion 
Symantec s Enterprise segment sells its products to corporations and businesses  This segment makes up more than 50  of the firm s topline but less than 30  of Symantec s profits  though the operating margins have improved over the past 3 years 
This could represent a win for both firms  Symantec can get rid of its lower margin enterprise business to focus on its consumer group  selling away less than 30  of its profits for roughly 80  of its total market value  The much larger Broadcom is able to buy out a growing segment with expanding margins which they could leverage with both scale and existing business connections 
The question that AVGO investors need to ponder is whether or not Symantec s enterprise security business is worth  10 billion to Broadcom and to what degree will the semiconductor company be able to capture synergies from a cybersecurity business 
Symantec is releasing its earnings after the bell today  July 8th   and I would expect that management will provide more color for investors in regards to the potential deal with Broadcom 
An Infrastructure Technology Company 
This would not be the first of Broadcom s acquisitions that seemed to fall beyond their scope  Broadcom announced it would be buying CA Technologies  an IT management software   solutions company  for  18 9 billion  23  premium   almost a year ago today 
AVGO plummeted almost 20  on the news that a semiconductor company was acquiring outside of its core competencies  Investors saw a lack of synergies  This ended up being a great buying opportunity with AVGO s strong rally following this announcement 
Broadcom achieved economies of scope with the CA acquisition  The same scope they will be attaining if they can negotiate a deal for Symantec s enterprise security segment successfully   Broadcom is evolving from a pure play semiconductor firm into an infrastructure technology conglomerate  diversifying Broadcom s revenue drivers as well as broadened its customer based  The cyclicality in the semiconductor space can take a toll on revenue consistency and in turn  valuation metrics 
Broadcom s move to purchase a cybersecurity company isn t as big of a shock to investors as the CA deal  with the company already having ventured outside of its perceived scope  Symantec may not have held a place in Broadcom s portfolio 52 weeks ago  but as the company pivots into an infrastructure technology company  the acquisition makes more sense 
Symantec is one of the largest software security segment in the US but has been struggling in recent years with management turnover becoming a systemic issue  This acquisition comes at a good time for SYMC investors and could be opportune for Broadcom as long as the premium they pay isn t overly aggressive 
Take Away
Broadcom s potential purchase of Symantec enterprise security business presents solid long term investment for AVGO and a tremendous short term gain for SYMC shareholders  With this deal already fallen apart once  there is potential for another breakdown in negotiations 
Look for further clarity on the deal during Symantec s earnings call this evening

Symantec shares have added about 8  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 15  
What s Next for Symantec 
While Symantec has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately

Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Symantec was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  0 43 on  1 19 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  1 67 on  4 81 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Computer   Software is currently in the top 33  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2019-08-08,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/symantec-symc-tops-q1-earnings-and-revenue-estimates-200453317,200453317

few decades  activists have primarily focused on buying minority stakes and pushing for changes  which include leadership changes  cash allocation and exploring the sale of the company   Elliott s private equity push promises greater rewards  but also involves bigger risks  Owning the majority of a company that fails to live up to its potential can hurt the fund s bottom line and its reputation far more than a minority stake that underperforms  It also creates potential confusion for CEOs and boards wondering which hat Elliott is wearing when it shows up among shareholders  The multi strategy fund  which also invests in other assets  such as currencies  commodities and government bonds  is alone with its hybrid approach  for now  thanks mainly to its size and resources  Even the largest activists have half or less of Elliott s capital and usually a dozen or so investment professionals compared with more than 150 that work for Elliott  Elliott s strategy is paying off for the fund  whose founder Paul Singer has built a reputation as one of the world s toughest investors  adept at applying relentless pressure on targets that include national governments and some of the largest companies in the world  BLURRING THE LINE Of the 15 companies Elliott has targeted with a more than 5 percent stake since 2015  ten have inked  40 billion worth of deals   including two spin offs  Activist investor Carl Icahn has disclosed nine similar filings in the same period that included two sales and two spin offs   Elliott made an average return of around 30 percent on the deals  according to a Reuters analysis of filings and research firm 13D Monitor     That compares to a 6 percent return from activist funds over a similar period  according to Hedge Fund Research  Still  some investors in public companies may feel uncomfortable blurring the line between the roles of a minority shareholder and a private equity investor  analysts say   It s a conflict because as a shareholder  your goal is to get the maximum return on your investment  As a private equity buyer  you want the best possible price   said Charles Elson  a University of Delaware corporate governance professor who also sits on the board of restaurant chain  Bob Evans Farms  Inc  O BOBE    As a director  he would always wonder if Elliott s interest was as a shareholder or a buyer  Elson said   There is no conflict in these situations  because it is the company s board of directors  not Elliott  that decides whether to sell the company and who to sell it to   an Elliott spokesman said in an emailed statement   Michael Stark  the founder of CrossLink Capital and major LifeLock shareholder  said he had no issue with Elliott acting both as an investor and a bidder  though he was slightly disappointed with the final price Symantec paid   We got the bottom end of a fair price   Stark said   As long as shareholders were fairly represented by the board and management team  I m okay with that    Some activist investors have made buyout bids in the past  but not in a systematic manner  Starboard Value  an activist fund with more than  4 billion in assets  offered in 2014 to buy 3 D technology maker RealD  which sold the following year to private equity  Icahn Enterprises bought auto service and parts chain Pep Boys for  1 billion in early 2016 and is trying to buy Federal Mogul Holdings Corp  another auto parts maker   Advisors to activists told Reuters that several activist funds were considering expanding into private equity but are still assessing whether to make such a move   BUILD UP Last year  New York based Elliott expanded its tech focused private equity practice  adding professionals  naming it Evergreen Coast Capital Corp and opening an office in Silicon Valley   Unlike in the past  when it would occasionally bid for majority stakes  the fund now has a dedicated team chasing buyouts of whole companies   Last June  Evergreen teamed up with Francisco Partners to buy Dell s software assets for more than  2 billion  but Elliott has yet to emerge as the sole owner of any of public companies it offered to buy  While that might raise doubts about Evergreen s credibility as a potential majority owner  merely having a takeover offer in hand has allowed Elliott to fast track what typically would be months of trench warfare between activists and reluctant boards   Directors have a fiduciary duty to shareholders to explore a credible takeover proposal and launching an auction is one way to find out its worth    When you commit to buying a company as a private equity owner  you re putting your money where your mouth is   said Keith Gottfried  a partner at law firm Morgan Lewis who specializes in defending companies from activists   The establishment of a dedicated buyout team follows a gradual effort that started with the launch of Elliott s tech investing arm  overseen by Jesse Cohn  who joined the fund in 2004 from  Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS  as a 24 year old  Cohn  who now oversees Evergreen and Elliott s U S  activist investments  has developed close relationships with Silicon Valley and Wall Street firms  helping Elliott to strike deals where the fund would keep its stakes in companies going private     These roll over stakes allowed Elliot to benefit from the premium a sale would usually command  and later share profits with the private equity firm once it was ready to offload the revamped company  But buyout firms grew reluctant to share the spoils with Elliott  Its latest setback came in early 2015 when buyout firm Thoma Bravo bought software developer Riverbed Technology for  3 5 billion in a sale Elliott helped trigger  but then did not let the fund stay on as a minority investor   After that snub  Elliott s top executives  including Singer  co chief investment officer Jon Pollock and Cohn began laying the ground for Evergreen  which would give Elliott more independence in seeking its own private equity deals  Elliott s investments  including ones made by Evergreen  come from the same general pool of capital shared across the firm  a person familiar with the matter said   Rich McBee  chief executive of business telecommunications company Mitel Communications  O MITL   in which Elliott has owned shares for nearly a decade  said he valued the regular contacts and Elliott s readiness to offer strategic suggestions  
 They don t come with an idea that they have not fully investigated or vetted and talked with a lot of people about   McBee told Reuters in an interview   It s not a random walk with them  ",2017-01-31,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/elliott-turns-up-ceo-pressure-blending-activism-with-buyouts-456766,456766

43133,264648,NLOK,Broadcom Shares Down Following Rumors Of Symantec Buyout ,opinion,Speculation is rife that Broadcom   NASDAQ AVGO    is likely to acquire Symantec Corporation  NASDAQ SYMC   according to a Bloomberg report citing  people familiar with the matter  According to rumors  the deal is likely to be worth more than  15 billion and could be completed in few weeks However  both Broadcomand Symantechave refrained from making any comments the rumored deal  Consequently  the terms of the deal are unknown Symantec  a world leader in Internet security technology  provides a broad range of solutions for content security and information back up to individuals and enterprises  Founded in 1982  the company has operations in more than 45 countries  It provides cyber security products  services and solutions to more than 350 000 organizations and 50 million individuals worldwide Notably  the deals marks Broadcom s second biggest attempt to strengthen foothold in the software market  following its  18 billion agreement to acquire CA Technologies last year  Moreover  the rumors surfaced following President Trump s prohibition of the Qualcomm   NASDAQ QCOM   on grounds of national security concerns Following the news  Broadcom s shares were down almost 4 1  in after hours trade  while that of Symantecwent up approximately 22 28   Shares of Broadcom were down owing to high debt level which the company will incur if the deal materializes  Moreover  its shares have returned just 16 1  on a year to date basis  underperforming the  s rally of 22 6  Why Symantec is in Talks to get AcquireSymantec is facing increased competition from bellwethers such as Cisco  NASDAQ CSCO   Microsoft   NASDAQ MSFT   and Intel   NASDAQ INTC    Moreover  the company which was under investigation owing to accounting misconduct has also faced managerial changes after the stepping down of CEO Greg Clark Last year in August  Symantec also announced that it would cut 8  of its worldwide workforce to bolster profits Symantec also reported a dismal fourth quarter fiscal 2019 results  where the top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate while the bottom line matched the same  Lower than expected bookings resulted in a weak quarter for the Enterprise Security segment  consequently dragging the top line Moreover  in the last reported quarter  the company faced significant headwinds from the ProxySG and Web Security Service product  and the advanced threat detection protection bundle  The ProxySG business  or the Blue Coat hardware proxy bundle  failed quicker than expected owing to the rapid transition of companies to the cloud  This led to a refresh cycle  which was not as large as expected Symantec s weaker than expected outlook for the first quarter and fiscal 2020 makes investors cautious about its near term performance Benefits of the DealThe aforementioned deal is in sync with Broadcom s attempts to expand enterprise software capabilities and substantial customer base  On completion  positive synergies from this deal are likely to drive the company s future growth in cyber security market worldwide Cyber attacks  data losses and compromised networks are constant threats  which in turn make cybersecurity essential for any given country s national security  With the United States being the most technologically advanced country globally  it remains highly susceptible to cybersecurity attacks  We believe the latest buyout will enable the company to secure more cyber security related contracts from the U S  administration in the days ahead Moreover  the cybersecurity market size is expected to grow from  137 9 billion in 2017 to  231 9 Billion by 2022  at a CAGR of 11  during the forecast period  according to Markets and Markets   Further  Software is ubiquitous and has become the focal point of technological innovation  Notably  the new development inspires optimism as there is an abundance of software opportunities in the digital cloud era These factors will pave the way for Broadcom to diversify end markets and customer base  which bodes well for the long haul  This is anticipated to add resilience to Broadcom s current business model Consequently  the latest deal should allow it to capture larger shares in this expanding market  going ahead Our takeBroadcom s expanding product portfolio positions it well to address the needs of rapidly growing technologies like IoT and 5G  We believe that the company s extensive product portfolio is a key catalyst Furthermore  the company pursues an aggressive acquisition strategy  which in turn fortifies its business model by diversifying end markets We remain inquisitive as to how it will integrate Symantec s software business with

43135,264650,NLOK,Broadcom Acquiring Symantec,opinion,"Media reports say that Broadcom   NASDAQ AVGO   is acquiring security software maker Symantec   NASDAQ SYMC   for  15 billion  The formal announcement could be made as soon as today or after the July 4th holiday 
Unfazed by President Trump s move to block its acquisition of Qualcomm   NASDAQ QCOM    the company and its determined CEO Hock Tan proceeded to transfer its headquarters to the U S   so it could continue on its strategy of acquiring technology companies and squeezing efficiencies from the combinations 
But those aspirations have shifted of late away from the semiconductor space that has been battered by trade tensions with China to infrastructure software  particularly hybrid cloud software   where such tensions don t exist and where valuations are also more reasonable  That s what led the company to acquire CA Technologies last year  and if the unconfirmed rumors are right  will lead to its Symantec buy this year 
In a recent note  Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS  analyst Craig Hettenbach said after conversations with Broadcom CFO Thomas Krause  that Broadcom s CA acquisition was already yielding a 14  return on investment  So the alteration in strategy is already successful for the company 
Symantec shares jumped over 20  at the news  still well below their 2017 highs  while Broadcom shares dropped off 

Investors are rightly concerned about Symantec  which while continuing to generate strong cash flows  has been growth strapped  What s more  the company is currently seeing increased competition at enterprise customers that are turning to cloud based providers on the one hand  and new age players offering mobile security on the other 
There have also been a slew of executive departures of late  the highest profile one being CEO Greg Clark in May  Symantec director Richard Hill is taking over as President and CEO  The recent internal investigation into its book keeping irregularities may have had something to do with the turnover 
But these negatives aside  this may be just the right time to buy the company s growing intellectual property in cloud security  especially in hybrid cloud environments covering on premise workloads and those in public and private clouds  Since a large percentage of enterprises looking to transfer their workloads to the cloud are hesitant to go ahead because of security considerations  this is quite an attractive space 
Management said on the last earnings call that Symantec s cloud offerings have been revitalized  so although enterprise losses will likely continue  the negative impact on revenue will be less in the current quarter  and hopefully continue downward thereafter 
This technology is likely what Broadcom is after  and buying the company when it is down  may just mean that it will be paying a lower price

Shares of Coca Cola have increased  14  in the past year  outperforming the Zacks Soft Drinks Beverages industry s  4 1  gain  The Zacks analyst thinks this is largely attributable to the effective execution of strategies aimed at evolving into a consumer centric total beverage company  This approach has bolstered its quarterly performances as is evident from a robust surprise trend  First quarter 2019 marked its seventh positive earnings surprise in the last eight quarters and the seventh straight sales beat  Ongoing productivity efforts and a disciplined growth strategy along with robust performance across segments are aiding top and bottom lines  Innovation and investment in core categories and brands have been the primary focus area  leading to the expansion of retail value share  Moreover  global re franchising initiatives are expected to boost margins  However  Coca Cola expects adverse currency rates to mar comparable revenues and operating income in the second quarter and 2019

43137,264652,NLOK,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Broadcom  Symantec And Qualcomm,opinion,"For Immediate Release
Chicago  IL   July 5  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include Broadcom   NASDAQ AVGO    Symantec   NASDAQ SYMC   and Qualcomm   NASDAQ QCOM   
Here are highlights from Wednesday s Analyst Blog  
Broadcom Acquiring Symantec
Media reports say that Broadcom is acquiring security software maker Symantec for  15 billion  The formal announcement could be made as soon as today or after the July 4th holiday 
Unfazed by President Trump s move to block its acquisition of Qualcomm  the company and its determined CEO Hock Tan proceeded to transfer its headquarters to the U S   so it could continue on its strategy of acquiring technology companies and squeezing efficiencies from the combinations 
But those aspirations have shifted of late away from the semiconductor space that has been battered by trade tensions with China to infrastructure software  particularly hybrid cloud software   where such tensions don t exist and where valuations are also more reasonable  That s what led the company to acquire CA Technologies last year  and if the unconfirmed rumors are right  will lead to its Symantec buy this year 
In a recent note  Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS  analyst Craig Hettenbach said after conversations with Broadcom CFO Thomas Krause  that Broadcom s CA acquisition was already yielding a 14  return on investment  So the alteration in strategy is already successful for the company 
Symantec shares jumped over 20  at the news  still well below their 2017 highs  while Broadcom shares dropped off 
Investors are rightly concerned about Symantec  which while continuing to generate strong cash flows  has been growth strapped  What s more  the company is currently seeing increased competition at enterprise customers that are turning to cloud based providers on the one hand  and new age players offering mobile security on the other 
There have also been a slew of executive departures of late  the highest profile one being CEO Greg Clark in May  Symantec director Richard Hill is taking over as President and CEO  The recent internal investigation into its book keeping irregularities may have had something to do with the turnover 
But these negatives aside  this may be just the right time to buy the company s growing intellectual property in cloud security  especially in hybrid cloud environments covering on premise workloads and those in public and private clouds  Since a large percentage of enterprises looking to transfer their workloads to the cloud are hesitant to go ahead because of security considerations  this is quite an attractive space 
Management said on the last earnings call that Symantec s cloud offerings have been revitalized  so although enterprise losses will likely continue  the negative impact on revenue will be less in the current quarter  and hopefully continue downward thereafter 
This technology is likely what Broadcom is after  and buying the company when it is down  may just mean that it will be paying a lower price 
Both Symantec and Broadcom shares carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of All
Last year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce  the world s first trillionaires   but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early

43139,264654,NLOK,Zacks Investment Ideas Feature Highlights  Broadcom And Symantec,opinion,"For Immediate Release 
Chicago  IL   July 5  2019   Today  Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights  Broadcom   NASDAQ AVGO   and Symantec   NASDAQ SYMC   
Broadcom Seeks Economies of Scope with Symantec Deal
Semiconductor behemoth  Broadcom  is reportedly in late stage talks with software security company  Symantec  regarding a potential deal  The news sent SYMC shares surging this morning with a more than a 14  rally in today s shortened day of trading  Broadcom investors are not as enthusiastic about this ostensible acquisition as shares of AVGO fall close to 4  
An Infrastructure Technology Company 
This would not be the first of Broadcom s acquisitions that seemed to fall beyond their scope  Broadcom announced it would be buying CA Technologies  an IT management software   solutions company  for  18 9 billion  23  premium   almost a year ago today 
The stock plummeted almost 20  on the news that a semiconductor company was acquiring outside of its core competencies  investors saw a lack of synergies  This ended up being a great buying opportunity with AVGO having gained more than 40  since this announcement was priced in 
Broadcom is achieving economies of scope with the CA acquisition as well as a with the potential Symantec deal  Becoming an infrastructure technology company from the pure play semiconductor firm diversified Broadcom s revenue drivers as well as broadened its customer based  The cyclicality in the semiconductor space can take a toll on revenue consistency and in turn  valuation metrics 
Broadcom s move to buy a cybersecurity company isn t as big of a shock to investors as the CA deal  with the company already having ventured outside of its perceived scope  Symantec may not have held a place in Broadcom s portfolio 52 weeks ago  but as the company pivots into an infrastructure technology company  the acquisition makes more sense 
Symantec is one of the largest software security companies in the US but has been struggling in recent years with management turnover becoming a systemic issue  This acquisition comes at a good time for SYMC investors and could be opportune for Broadcom as long as the premium they pay isn t overly aggressive 
SYMC has been trading at 17x P E  which is far below the software sector average of 27x and on the lower side of Symantec s 5 year trend 
Semiconductor Category
The M A activity in the semiconductor space has been ramped over the last few year  The semiconductor category is slowing down with negative EPS growth expectations over the next few quarters  Companies are attempting to hedge this deceleration by acquiring economies of scale  reaching for fatter margins 
The semiconductor segment has been quite volatile over the past 52 weeks with the iShare Semiconductor ETF  SOXX  fluctuating up and down large double digit percentages  SOXX is up 28  since the beginning of the year 
Economies of scope acquisitions aren t common in this sector  Broadcom s quest for the benefits is pioneering with the outcome remaining to be seen 
Take Away
Broadcom s potential acquisition of Symantec could have some benefits for both sides of the equation  but it will all boil down to price  Look for AVGO to fall further once the acquisition is officially announced  This could provide potential investors with a buying opportunity as the CA Technology acquisition did 
Broadcom s attempt to achieve economies of scope is going to be put the test if this acquisition comes to fruition

In testimony to the U S  Congress Joint Economic Committee on November 17  Fed chair Janet Yellen indicated that the central bank s policy decision committee already felt at the prior meeting that a hike could  become appropriate relatively soon if incoming data provide some further evidence of continued progress toward the Committee s objectives  
According to Investing com s Fed Rate Monitor Tool  odds for a December rate hike were last at 95 4  
The dollar lost some ground on Monday  but remained within close distance of a 14 year peak against the other major currencies  as overall optimism over the U S  economy since Donald Trump s election and expectations for an upcoming rate hike continued to support the greenback 
In a day with no major economic data  Fed vice chair Stanley Fischer avoided commenting further on the timing of policy tightening  instead electing to note the  enormous uncertainty  over what direction President elect Donald Trump would take with his policies 
Yet he added that  certain fiscal policies  particularly those that increase productivity  can increase the potential of the economy and help confront some of our longer term economic challenges  
 Some combination of improved public infrastructure  better education  more encouragement for private investment  and more effective regulation all likely have a role to play in promoting faster growth of productivity and living standards   Fischer commented 
On the company front  there were several examples of corporate movements lifting sentiment in equities 
Symantec  NASDAQ SYMC  agreed to buy Lifelock  NYSE LOCK  for approximately  2 3 billion including debt in a deal the firms say will create the world s largest consumer security business  Shares were up 3  and 15   respectively 
Headwaters  N HW  rose nearly 17  after Australia s Boral Ltd  AX BLD  said it would buy the U S  construction and building products maker for  1 8 billion 
Analog chipmaker MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings  NASDAQ MTSI  said on Monday it would buy fellow chipmaker Applied Micro Circuits Corporation  NASDAQ AMCC  for about  770 million to expand its data center connectivity business 
 Oracle Corp   NYSE ORCL  said on Monday it would buy Dyn  a monitor of global internet performance and traffic  though the business software maker did not reveal the financial terms 
Also on the tech front  shares in Facebook  NASDAQ FB  jumped 3  after announcing a  6 billion share repurchase program 
On the downside   Tyson Foods   NYSE NYSE TSN  tumbled 14  after the meat processor reported lower than expected profit and said its chief executive officer would step down 
Meanwhile  oil surged more than 3  on Monday on hopes that OPEC was moving closer to agreeing an output cut when it meets next week 
OPEC experts have made some progress on the first day of a two day meeting to nail down details of their plan to cut oil output  OPEC sources told Reuters on Monday
Additionally  Russian President Vladimir Putin sees a  high probability  that an agreement to curb oil production will be reached at a meeting later this month in remarks made on Sunday 
Reports last week that the cartel had decided to cap Iran s production rather than cut it  also brought a sigh of relief 
Iranian energy minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh pledged on Saturday continued support for the implementation of the Algiers Accord and stated that he remains confident that an all inclusive agreement can be reached during the upcoming OPEC Ministerial Meeting to be held in Vienna on November 30

43168,264683,NLOK,Buy Salesforce  CRM  Stock Heading Into Q1 Earnings ,opinion,"Salesforce   NYSE CRM   stock has lagged its industry in 2019 and is down roughly 6  over the last month as the broader markets faces a U S  China trade deal based pullback  With that said  CRM stock has been strong for years and its cloud based customer relationship management business looks poised to expand as more firms  big and small  modernize and digitize their operations 
Let s take a look to see if investors should consider buying Salesforce stock before it reports its first quarter fiscal 2020 financial results  which are due out after the market closes on Tuesday  June 4 
Quick Overview   Price Movement 
Salesforce at its core offers its business clients a wide range of cloud based platforms to help them run sales  marketing  e commerce  analytics  and much more  The San Francisco based firm s customer relationship management offerings have become essential to many companies and would otherwise require a large amount of in house talent  infrastructure  and maintenance 
CRM s clients include Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN    American Express   NYSE AXP    the U S  Department of Agriculture  and more than 150 000 other firms and agencies  Marc Benioff s company also sells Microsoft   NASDAQ MSFT   Office style products to help compete against the likes of Microsoft and Google   NASDAQ GOOGL    Plus  the software as a service firm has bolstered its Einstein artificial intelligence platform  with new features such as voice controls 
Salesforce stock closed regular trading hours Tuesday at  155 19 per share  down roughly 7 5  below its 52 week intraday trading high of  167 56  CRM shares are now up 23  over the past 12 months to outpace the S P 500 s 5  climb  Jumping back further  investors will notice that shares of CRM have outpaced their peer group s average climb over the last five years this group includes Adobe   NASDAQ ADBE    Oracle   NYSE ORCL    and VMware   NYSE VMW    Intuit   NASDAQ INTU    Symantec Corporation   NASDAQ SYMC    and a few others 
 
 
 
Outlook
Moving on  Salesforce provided adjusted Q1 earnings guidance between  0 60 and  0 61 per share last quarter  with the high side representing a roughly 17  climb from the first quarter of fiscal 2019  Meanwhile  the company expects its adjusted fiscal 2020 EPS figure to come in at the  2 74 to  2 76 range 
At the top of the income statement  our current Zacks Consensus Estimate calls for the company s Q1 revenue to jump by 22 5  to reach  3 68 billion  Last quarter  Salesforce s revenue popped 26   Looking further ahead  the company s full year revenue is projected to climb 21 3  to reach  16 11 billion 
Investors should note that this would end Salesforce s extended run of approximately 25  growth nearly every quarter  This  however  is what happens as companies expand  Peeking further ahead  Salesforce s management projects its revenue will hit between  26 billion to  28 billion by fiscal 2023  This implies an annual growth rate of roughly 19  over the next four years and would see the firm double its fiscal 2019 revenue of  13 28 billion 
 
 
Bottom Line
Salesforce is currently a Zack Rank  3  Hold   CRM s price sales ratio of 8 9 comes in well above its industry s average of 4 2  but falls in line with peers such as VMware and Intuit  On top of that  Salesforce is trading at 58X earnings at the moment  which marks a huge premium compared to its industry s 30 5X average and most of its peers  Therefore  we can say that value investors shouldn t really think about CRM at the moment 
Salesforce does have an impressive history of quarterly earnings beats  including a 130  average beat over the trailing four periods  But buying a stock heading into earnings is not for the faint of heart as it is never clear how Wall Street will react even to a  blowout  quarter 
In the end  Salesforce is a firm that operates a steadily expanding business that has almost zero seasonality  Salesforce also looks set to play a major role in the expansion of business related SaaS  cloud computing  AI  and might be worth considering as a longer term tech holding

43169,264684,NLOK,Symantec  SYMC  Down 13 6  Since Last Earnings Report  Can It Rebound ,opinion,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Symantec  SYMC   Shares have lost about 13 6  in that time frame  underperforming the S P 500 
Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is Symantec due for a breakout  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers  Symantec Reports Weak Q4 ResultsSymantec reported fourth quarter fiscal 2019 non GAAP earnings per share  EPS  of 39 cents that matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate and came within the guided range of 37 41 cents  The figure  however  declined 15 2  year over year On a non GAAP basis  Symantec generated revenues of  1 195 billion  which missed the consensus estimate of  1 208 billion  Moreover  revenues were down 2 2  from the year ago quarter Lower than expected bookings resulted in a weak quarter for the Enterprise Security segment  thus dragging the top line Quarter in DetailConsumer Cyber Safety  previously Consumer Digital Safety  revenues for the quarter were  605 million  flat year over year in constant currency  Direct average revenue per user  ARPU  of  8 83 per month grew sequentially  However  for this segment  reported billings of  620 million fell 6 2  year over year Enterprise Security revenues of  590 million remained flat year over year  Lower than expected hardware and license sales affected revenues from this segment  Enterprise Security reported billings of  712 million declined 24  year over year The company shifted its business model to a more ratable one  For the fiscal fourth quarter  81  of the company s Enterprise Security revenues were ratable under ASC 606 compared with 76  in the previous quarter Contract liabilities totaled  3 07 billion  down 2  year over year  and were negatively impacted by  218 million as a result of ASC 606 Contract length was 18 months during the quarter compared with just below 17 months in the preceding as well as the year ago quarter In the Consumer Cyber Safety business  the company is witnessing improvement in ARPU on the back of successful cross sell and improvement in retention rate for its direct customer base Notably  Symantec s endpoint security products witnessed growth revival However  it faced significant headwinds from the ProxySG and Web Security Service product  and the advanced threat detection protection bundle  The ProxySG business  or the Blue Coat hardware proxy bundle  failed quicker than expected due to the rapid transition of companies to the cloud  This led to a refresh cycle  which was not as large as expected MarginsSymantec reported non GAAP operating income of  347 million  which declined 20 2  from the year ago quarter  Non GAAP operating margin contracted 700 basis points  bps  to 29  Enterprise Security Operating margin of 8  declined from 18  due to lower

revenues in the range of  4 76  4 9 billion  Enterprise Security revenues within  2 3  2 4 billion and Consumer Cyber Safety revenues between  2 46 billion and  2 5 billion are expected This guidance indicates 1 3  revenue growth for the company at mid point  on an organic basis and in constant currency  The guidance also includes revenues from an additional week Non GAAP operating margin is

costs in the Enterprise business are expected to keep the operating margin for the first quarter under pressure A 24  decline in recognized billings and timing differences on tax payments between the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020  among others are expected to lead to a year  over year drop in cash flows for full year fiscal 2020

43170,264685,NLOK,Pre IPO Coverage  CrowdStrike  CRWD ,opinion,"CrowdStrike  NASDAQ CRWD   provider of cloud based cybersecurity  is expected to IPO on Wednesday  June 12  At a price range of  28  30 per share  the company plans to sell up to  540 million with an expected market cap of   5 7 billion  At the midpoint of the IPO price range  CRWD currently earns our Unattractive rating 
CrowdStrike has some impressive credentials in the cybersecurity space  The company s technology helped to identify Russia as the source of the DNC hacks during the 2016 election  and it boasts 44 members of the Fortune 100  including Amazon Web Services  NASDAQ AMZN  as customers  On the other hand  the company has significant losses and will need to grow rapidly to justify an expected market cap that is almost 23 times 2018 revenue 
This report aims to help investors sort through CrowdStrike s financial filings to understand the fundamentals and valuation of this IPO 
Growing Revenue Leads To Growing Losses
CrowdStrike was founded in 2011 with the goal of using artificial intelligence and cloud computing to create a more sophisticated cybersecurity platform  The company s technology has been used to combat many major hacking incidents over the past five years  In addition to the DNC hacks  CRWD helped identify the perpetrators of Chinese spying on the U S  defense sector and linked North Korea to the Sony Pictures hack in 2014 
This positive press has helped the company rapidly acquire new customers  CRWD increased its subscription customers from 450 at the beginning of 2017 to 2 516 in 2019  or 137  compounded annually  The company now counts 44 members of the Fortune 100 as customers 
However  CRWD spends a lot of money to acquire these customers  In fiscal year 2019  which ended on January 31   the company spent  173 million  69  of revenue  on sales and marketing  As a result  the company s net operating loss after tax  NOPAT  increased by 11   from   95 million in 2018 to   106 million in 2019  See Figure 1 

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings
Encouragingly  sales and marketing costs declined as a percent of revenue  down from 88  in 2018  CRWD will need to keep growing revenue faster that marketing costs in order to achieve profitability 
Best In Class Cybersecurity System
CRWD estimates that its addressable market is   25 billion  but it faces significant competition in its industry  Legacy antivirus providers like McAfee and Symantec  NASDAQ SYMC   network security vendors like Palo Alto Networks  NYSE PANW  and FireEye  NASDAQ FEYE  and endpoint security providers BlackBerry Cylance and Carbon Black  NASDAQ CBLK  compete with CRWD 
Even in this crowded field  CRWD has managed to stand out  Gartner Peer Insights recognizes the company as the highest rated vendor for Endpoint Detection and Response Solutions based on customer reviews 
In addition  CRWD s customer retention rate backs up its high level of customer satisfaction  CRWD measures customer retention in two ways  Gross Retention and Net Retention  Gross Retention measures the year over year loss of customers  while Net Retention measures the year over year change in total spending from existing customers  Figure 2 shows that both Gross and Net Retention rates are high and increasing 

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings
CRWD s Gross Retention rate of 98  in Q4 means it lost just 2  of customers year over year  For comparison  competitor Carbon Black had an 87  retention rate last year  Meanwhile  CRWD s Net Retention rate of 147  means it grew revenue by 47  year over year in Q4 before even factoring in the revenue from new customers acquired during the year 
CRWD s superior retention explains how it managed to grow revenue by 110  last year while Carbon Black grew revenue by just 30   The two companies started the year with a similar level of revenue and spent similar amounts on marketing  but CRWD is retaining and attracting customers at a much higher rate 
Building A Moat Around Data
The bull case for CRWD rests on the assumption that the company can leverage big data to turn its current leadership position in the industry into a self reinforcing cycle  As CRWD attracts new customers based on its superior service  it gets more data with which to train its AI  which makes its system even better  which attracts even more customers  and the cycle continues 
At the same time  many of CRWD s competitors are significantly larger and have a major resource advantage  If CRWD can t turn its data into a real competitive advantage  it may struggle to stay ahead of competitors that can afford to spend significantly more on R D 
Public Shareholders Have No Rights
CRWD is going public with a dual class share structure  The Class A shares sold to the public will have one vote per share  while the Class B shares held by insiders and early investors get 10 votes  Upon the completion of the IPO  Class B shareholders will hold  99  of the voting rights in the company  which means public shareholders will effectively have no say in corporate governance 
DCF Model Reveals High Expectations
Our reverse discounted cash flow  DCF  model shows the expectations implied by CRWD s IPO price are high  but achievable 
In order to justify the midpoint of its IPO range   29 share  CRWD must grow revenue by 40  compounded annually for 10 years and achieve NOPAT margins of 10   the same as Fortinet  NASDAQ FTNT  in 2018  the most profitable cybersecurity company we cover 
In this scenario  CRWD would earn  7 billion in revenue in 2029  about  30  of its projected addressable market 
Overall  the expectations implied by CRWD s valuation are high but not as impossibly high as we ve seen with other IPOs  The current valuation presents significant downside risk if the company fails to maintain its leading position in the market

43171,264686,NLOK,CrowdStrike Shares Will Fall On Inflated Execptations,opinion,"I want to like Crowdstrike Holdings Inc  NASDAQ CRWD   and it is clear that a lot of people do  The company s stock exploded in value past its IPO  jumping from an already elevated price of  32 to its current share price of  64 16  CrowdStrike has a solid reputation  good financials for an IPO  and is offering a valuable and different cybersecurity product 
But at this current share price  CrowdStrike has a market cap of  24 billion  which is over twice as large as its competitor Symantec  NASDAQ SYMC  and over 20  the size of Palo Alto Networks Inc  NYSE PANW   IPO stocks are typically expensive  but CrowdStrike takes things to a whole new level  At this current value  anyone who jumps onto CrowdStrike now is a fool  and anyone who was lucky enough to get in on the IPO should be looking to sell as soon as possible 
A Ridiculous Valuation
A good look at the balance sheet should give an idea of how elevated CrowdStrike s stock is  In its SEC report  CrowdStrike reported revenue of  249 million in the 12 months ending January 31  2019  By comparison  Symantec reported a 2019 fiscal year GAAP revenue of  4 7 billion  while Palo Alto was at  2 3 billion for the 2018 fiscal year 
Like many IPOs  CrowdStrike can report extremely high revenue growth  That  249 million figure is up from  118 million in 2018 and  52 million in 2017  representing revenue growth of 125  and 110  respectively  But CrowdStrike would need to keep this revenue growth rate up for another three years in order to catch up with its competitors  which is an incredibly generous assumption  The revenue growth rate will inevitably taper down 
CrowdStrike can point out that the rest of its financial numbers are solid  Gross margin improved from 54  in 2018 to 65  in 2019  thanks in part to the company shifting towards higher margin subscription services  Total assets are higher than total liabilities  and CrowdStrike  in fact  has no financial debt at all  While CrowdStrike reports a net loss of  140 million in 2019  its net loss margin is improving 
But these solid financial numbers are not enough to balance out a current share price  If we assume that CrowdStrike s revenue increases by 95  next year  we would see revenue of  485 5 million in 2020  creating a projected P S ratio of 49 4 compared to 2 63 for Symantec and 6 91 for Symantec  Cybersecurity companies generally have low price to enterprise value ratios  while CrowdStrike s is completely excessive 
Standing up to Challengers
Despite being massively overvalued  there is a lot to like about CrowdStrike s business model  While CrowdStrike is a cybersecurity company which names Symantec and McAfee among its main competitors  it represents the next stage in protecting networks 
Traditional antivirus companies rely on the signatures of known bad files to protect individual devices  But the ever growing popularity of the cloud and  Bring Your Own Device  policies in businesses means that cybercriminals can inevitably find a weak point and access through someone s poorly protected computer  Furthermore  traditional antivirus companies always find themselves a step behind criminals who create new viruses and malware as they are reacting rather than being proactive 
CrowdStrike  by contrast  is a cloud based endpoint security provider  which aims to protect the entire network instead of devices  It uses its Falcon platform as well as data provided by its endpoints to look for the signs of an attack which are much harder for criminals to fake  This approach is more effective and places a much smaller burden on anyone computer compared to traditional antiviral programs 
So what does this all mean  CrowdStrike has a significant growth opportunity  just like Peru tours  and it has a strong reputation in part to its involvement in uncovering past hacks such as Russia s theft of DNC files  But it faces huge amounts of competition from other companies that will be attempting to move into endpoint security as well  and there are risks such as failing to stop cyber attacks and facing competitive pricing pressure  And CrowdStrike at its current valuation cannot accept any mistakes 
The Share Price Will Fall
Anyone who buys CrowdStrike s stock at its current place is declaring that he believes CrowdStrike will continue to explode and nearly double in value continuously over the next three years at least  and become profitable  all in the face of strenuous competitors who are entering the endpoint security market themselves  It could happen  Stranger things have happened with markets and companies  But while I think CrowdStrike will be successful  I do not think it will be that successful

43173,264688,NLOK,CrowdStrike s Stock  Expectations Are Too High,opinion,"I want to like CrowdStrike  NASDAQ CRWD  and it is clear that a lot of people do  The company s stock has exploded in value past its IPO  jumping from an already elevated price of  32 to its current share price of  64 16  CrowdStrike has a solid reputation  good financials for an IPO  and is offering a valuable and different cybersecurity product 
But at this current share price  CrowdStrike has a market cap of  24 billion  which is over twice as large as its competitor Symantec  NASDAQ SYMC  and over 20  the size of Palo Alto Networks  NYSE PANW   IPO stocks are typically expensive  but CrowdStrike takes things to a whole new level  At this current value  anyone who jumps onto CrowdStrike now is a fool  and anyone who was lucky enough to get in on the IPO should be looking to sell as soon as possible 
A Ridiculous Valuation
 A good look at the balance sheet should give an idea of how elevated CrowdStrike s stock is  In its SEC report  CrowdStrike reported a revenue of  249 million in the 12 months ending January 31  2019  By comparison  Symantec reported a 2019 fiscal year GAAP revenue of  4 7 billion  while Palo Alto was at  2 3 billion for the 2018 fiscal year 
Like many IPOs  CrowdStrike can report extremely high revenue growth  That  249 million figure is up from  118 million in 2018 and  52 million in 2017  representing a revenue growth of 125  and 110  respectively  But CrowdStrike would need to keep this revenue growth rate up for another three years in order to catch up with its competitors  which is an incredibly generous assumption  The revenue growth rate will inevitably taper down 
CrowdStrike can point out that the rest of its financial numbers are solid  Gross margin improved from 54  in 2018 to 65  in 2019  thanks in part to the company shifting towards higher margin subscription services  Total assets are higher than total liabilities  and CrowdStrike in fact has no financial debt at all  While CrowdStrike reports a net loss of  140 million in 2019  its net loss margin is improving 
But these solid financial numbers are not enough to balance out a current share price  If we assume that CrowdStrike s revenue increases by 95  next year  we would see a revenue of  485 5 million in 2020  creating a projected P S ratio of 49 4 compared to 2 63 for Symantec and 6 91 for Symantec  Cybersecurity companies generally have low price to enterprise value ratios  while CrowdStrike s is completely excessive 
Standing Up To Challengers
Despite being massively overvalued  there is a lot to like about CrowdStrike s business model  While CrowdStrike is a cybersecurity company which names Symantec and McAfee among its main competitors  it represents the next stage in protecting networks 
Traditional antivirus companies rely on the signatures of known bad files to protect individual devices  But the ever growing popularity of the cloud and  Bring Your Own Device  policies in businesses means that cybercriminals can inevitably find a weak point and access through someone s poorly protected computer  Furthermore  traditional antivirus companies always find themselves a step behind criminals who create new viruses and malware as they are reacting rather than being proactive 
CrowdStrike by contrast is a cloud based endpoint security provider  which aims to protect the entire network instead of devices  It uses its Falcon platform as well as data provided by its endpoints to look for the signs of an attack which are much harder for criminals to fake  This approach is more effective  and places much smaller burden on any one computer compared to traditional antiviral programs 
So what does this all mean  CrowdStrike has a significant growth opportunity  just like Peru tours  and it has a strong reputation in part to its involvement in uncovering past hacks such as Russia s theft of DNC files  But it faces huge amounts of competition from other companies that will be attempting to move into endpoint security as well  and there are risks such as failing to stop cyberattacks and facing competitive pricing pressure  And CrowdStrike at its current valuation cannot accept any mistakes 
The Share Price Will Fall
Anyone who buys CrowdStrike s stock at its current place is declaring that he believes CrowdStrike will continue to explode and nearly double in value continuously over the next three years at least  and become profitable  all in the face of strenuous competitors who are entering the endpoint security market themselves  It could happen  Stranger things have happened with markets and companies  But while I think CrowdStrike will be successful  I do not think it will be that successful 
CrowdStrike for now appears to be the next hot new IPO  but that means its value will fall as investors inevitably pocket their winnings and move on to the next big thing  The share price fall will only accelerate once the lockup period ends and institutional investors cash out  That will be a better time for investors to move in 
CrowdStrike will still be an expensive stock at its IPO price of  30  and investors should ideally aim for a share price in the low to mid 20s  If CrowdStrike can fall that far  that will be a great time to strike and bank on future growth  But while there is a lot to like about CrowdStrike s future  the stock is far too expensive at its present value ",2019-06-21,Alex Newman,https://www.investing.com/analysis/crowdstrikes-stock-the-expectations-are-too-high-200433691,200433691

43186,264701,NLOK,Exclusive  Imperva seeks investment bank to explore options   sources,news,"By Liana B  Baker
 Reuters    U S  cyber security company  Imperva Inc   N IMPV  is seeking to hire an investment bank to help it explore strategic options after coming under pressure from activist hedge fund Elliott Management Corp  according to people familiar with the matter 
The move comes after Elliott unveiled a nearly 10 percent stake in Imperva last month and argued its shares are undervalued  Elliott said in a regulatory filing it was speaking to the company about  strategic and operational opportunities  
Imperva could appoint a financial adviser as early as next week after interviewing investment banks in recent days  the people said on Friday  This adviser will help the company review its options  including a potential sale  and help it deal with Elliott  the people added 
The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential  Imperva  which has a market capitalization of  1 44 billion  and Elliott both declined to comment 
Based in Redwood Shores  California  Imperva offers cyber security solutions to protect critical data of businesses  It taps into a shift away from perimeter defenses such as firewalls to secure data and web applications by detecting and preventing attacks before they reach inside an organization 
Imperva competes with  IBM  Corp  N IBM    F5 Networks Inc   O FFIV  and Akamai Technologies  O AKAM   It was founded in 2002 by three Israelis  including Shlomo Kramer  who co founded network security firm Check Point Software Technologies  NASDAQ CHKP   He owned about a tenth of Imperva as of Dec  31 
The company  which has research bases in Israel and Texas  has struggled this year with slowing growth in its web application firewall business and problems with its sales operations in Europe  where it had to replace a top executive  Its shares are down 29 percent year to date  while the S P 500 Index  INX  is up 4 percent 
Imperva could become the latest company to join the wave of consolidation in the cyber security sector  Last month  technology security firm  Symantec Corp   O SYMC  said it would buy cyber security company Blue Coat Systems Inc from buyout firm Bain Capital LLC for  4 65 billion to ramp up its enterprise security business 
A Morningstar research note said Imperva s position in markets for protecting web applications and databases  could be of strategic value to other security providers  
Imperva is the latest addition to a long list of enterprise technology companies that Elliott has pushed to explore a sale

43206,264721,NLOK,Earnings Preview  Symantec  SYMC  Q4 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"The market expects Symantec  SYMC  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on May 9  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This security software maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 39 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  15 2  
Revenues are expected to be  1 21 billion  down 1 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Symantec 
For Symantec  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 55  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Symantec will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Symantec would post earnings of  0 39 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 44  delivering a surprise of  12 82  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Symantec doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-05-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-symantec-symc-q4-earnings-expected-to-decline-200415891,200415891

43251,264766,NLOK,VTech hack exposes ID theft risk in connecting kids to Internet ,news,"By Jim Finkle and Jeremy Wagstaff BOSTON SINGAPORE  Reuters    Parents who gave their child a Kidizoom smartwatch or a VTech InnoTab tablet may have exposed them to identity theft after Hong Kong based VTech said hackers stole the personal information of more than 6 million children   The breach underscores how digital products aimed at kids often have far weaker security than other computer products  and may pose a threat to a booming industry  Shipments of toys that connect to the Internet will rise 200 percent over the next five years  according to estimates by UK based Juniper Research   It s not clear what the motive was for the VTech breach nor whether it has resulted in any identity theft so far  Still  it s a warning for people who don t understand how much data and sensitive information is in a child s toy    The last thing you would ever imagine is that a toy manufacturer would lose your child s identity   said Liam O Murchu  a  Symantec Corp   O SYMC  researcher known for his work dissecting complex malware produced by nation states   This shows that it s harder and harder to do things safely online   he said   In VTech s case  buyers of the company s cameras  watches and tablets are encouraged to provide names  addresses and birth dates when signing up for accounts where they can download updates  games  books and other content   VTech said the hackers compromised its Learning Lodge app store  which provides content for children s tablets  and its Kid Connect mobile app service that lets parents communicate with those tablets   Toys that gather data on the user  like VTech s line of cameras  watches and tablets and their associated websites  will grow by 58 percent annually  according to Juniper   That category includes dolls like Mattel Inc s  O MAT  recently introduced Hello Barbie  which connects to home wireless networks and communicates with servers to enable conversations by uploading audio and getting responses from the cloud   Mobile security firm Bluebox and independent security researcher Andrew Hay on Friday disclosed that they had jointly uncovered multiple vulnerabilities in iOS and Android apps that work with the device  as well as its cloud servers operated by technology partner ToyTalk  Among their findings  they claimed that the app could be hacked to reveal passwords  could be tricked into connecting to hostile networks controlled by hackers and that the servers were vulnerable to some types of attacks   Mattel spokesman Michelle Chidoni said that the toymaker and Hello Barbie technology partner ToyTalk have taken steps to ensure the products meets security and safety standards   ToyTalk said in a statement that it had already fixed many of this issues raised   It s too soon to say if the breach will hurt VTech s sales  Still  its stock fell 2 6 percent this week as it hired forensic experts  responded to government investigations on three continents and temporarily shut down more than a dozen websites  including a messaging service and kids  app store   Mark Stanislav  a researcher at the security firm Rapid 7 Inc  O RPD   whose wife is expecting their first child in a few weeks  began looking into problems with children s products after hearing about security flaws in baby monitors  and he subsequently found such problems in products from eight baby monitor vendors  After disclosing the flaws to the companies earlier this year  he said most have been fixed  He told Reuters he has since found problems in websites that connect other types of devices to kids  including one from a major manufacturer  He will go public with those findings next month after giving manufacturers time to fix the problems   Identity thieves use compromised data to pose as their victims  get loans or credit cards or apply for services such as utilities  Other types of criminals assume stolen identities to evade capture by police   CLEAN SLATES  Children offer credit slates to fraudsters that can be exploited for years without the victim s knowledge  said Tom Kellermann  chief cybersecurity officer with Trend Micro Inc  T 4704     Kids have a longer life in front of them and they have completely clean credit  which makes them more valuable   Kellermann said   A child s name  birth date  email address and Social Security number are worth  30 to  40 on some underground markets  more than the  20 value of most adult profiles  he said   Research by Carnegie Mellon University in 2011 found that more than 10 percent of a sample of stolen children s social security numbers had some sort of fraudulent activity associated with them  a proportion 51 times higher than adults    A child might not find out that their identity had been stolen until they are in their late teens  said Michelle Dennedy  Cisco Systems Inc s  O CSCO  chief privacy officer who founded an identity theft site for parents  theidentityproject com    It s a pain when you are an adult  but for a child it can have so much more harm   said Dennedy   Somebody might fail a background check for first job  or get arrested because a child molester stole their identity    Still  Vtech has some frustrated customers  even though cyber experts said the stolen VTech data has yet to turn up on forums where such information is sold    My concern is  Myself and other unlucky parents out there buying these products during the holidays and have no warning that they may not be able to use these products now or in the future   said Sarah Brace  a Canadian who commented on VTech s Facebook  O FB  pages   And it may attract U S regulatory scrutiny  U S  rules enforced by the Federal Trade Commission limit how personal information collected online from children under age 13 is treated  That information can include photos  videos and chat logs  just the sort of data that appears to have been collected by VTech  said Phyllis Marcus  a former FTC official now at the law firm Hunton   Williams LLP   
The FTC declined to confirm or deny any probe of VTech  Authorities in Hong Kong  the United Kingdom and the U S  states of Connecticut and Illinois have said they are looking into the breach ",2015-12-06,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/vtech-hack-exposes-id-theft-risk-in-connecting-kids-to-internet-374687,374687

43254,264769,NLOK,Sony Pictures hackers linked to breaches in China  India  Japan  report,news,"By Joseph Menn
SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters    The perpetrators of the 2014 cyber attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment were not activists or disgruntled employees  and likely had attacked other targets in China  India  Japan and Taiwan  according to a coalition of security companies that jointly investigated the Sony case for more than a year 
The coalition  organized by security analytics company Novetta  concluded in a report released on Wednesday that the hackers were government backed but it stopped short of endorsing the official U S  view that North Korea was to blame 
The Obama administration has tied the attack on Sony Corp s  T 6758  film studio to its release of  The Interview   a comedy that depicted the fictional assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un 
Novetta said the breach  was not the work of insiders or hacktivists  
 This is very much supportive of the theory that this is nation state   Novetta Chief Executive Peter LaMontagne told Reuters   This group was more active  going farther back  and had greater capabilities and reach than we thought  
Novetta worked with the largest U S  security software vendor  Symantec Corp   O SYMC   top Russian security firm Kaspersky Lab and at least 10 other institutions on the investigation  a rare collaboration involving so many companies 
They determined that the unidentified hackers had been at work since at least 2009  five years before the Sony breach  The hackers were able to achieve many of their goals despite modest skills because of the inherent difficulty in establishing an inclusive cyber security defense  the Novetta group said 
LaMontagne said the report was the first to tie the Sony hack to breaches at South Korean facilities including a power plant  The FBI and others had previously said the Sony attackers reused code that had been used in destructive attacks on South Korean targets in 2013 
The Novetta group said the hackers were likely also responsible for denial of service attacks that disrupted U S  and South Korean websites on July 24  2009  The group said it found overlaps in code  tactics and infrastructure between the attacks 
Symantec researcher Val Saengphaibul said his company connected the hackers to attacks late last year  suggesting the exposure of the Sony breach and the threat of retaliation by the United States had not silenced the gang 

The coalition of security companies distributed technical indicators to help others determine if they had been targeted by the same hackers  which Novetta dubbed the Lazarus Group ",2016-02-24,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/sony-pictures-hackers-linked-to-breaches-in-china,-india,-japan:-report-386245",386245

43257,264772,NLOK,Exclusive  Jefferies restructures junk debt business  bankers leave   sources,news,"By Olivia Oran and Greg Roumeliotis
NEW YORK  Reuters    Jefferies Group LLC will merge its junk rated loans and bonds business with the junk debt unit of its joint venture with MassMutual Financial Group  according to people familiar with the matter  in the biggest reorganization by a U S  investment bank since the leveraged finance markets seized up last year 
As a result  Kevin Lockhart  global head of leveraged finance  and Adam Sokoloff  global head of sponsors  have left Jefferies  the sources said  asking not to be identified as the moves have not been announced 
A spokesman for Jefferies  a unit of Leucadia National Corp  NYSE LUK   declined to comment on Saturday  Sokoloff did not respond to a request for comment  and Lockhart could not be reached for comment 
Banks have had trouble selling debt related to leveraged buyouts since late last year  Junk bond markets seized up on concerns about the prospect of higher interest rates  the health of the U S  economy  and how those two factors would affect companies with the shakiest financial footing 
In November  Jefferies and other banks failed to successfully syndicate the financing provided to  Carlyle Group   NASDAQ CG  LP for its  8 billion acquisition of Symantec  NASDAQ SYMC  Corp s data storage unit Veritas 
According to the people familiar with the matter  Jefferies  leveraged finance business will be combined with the junk debt origination team of Jefferies Finance LLC  the joint venture between Jefferies and U S  life insurer MassMutual 
Jefferies  management presented the changes internally as a way to boost efficiency and focus on clients  rather than a response to troubled deals  the sources said  It was not immediately clear if the combination would offer Jefferies more financial resources to increase lending 
Lockhart has been replaced by James Walsh  Jefferies  global head of consumer and retail investment banking  the sources said  Walsh will also serve as chairman of consumer and retail investment banking  with John Tibe and Steve Tricarico named U S co heads of this group  the sources added 
Robert Fullerton  previously U S co head of sponsors  was named U S  head of leveraged finance  according to the sources  The other U S co head of sponsors  Jeffrey Greenip  was promoted to global head of sponsors  putting him in charge of Jefferies  relationship with private equity firms  they said 
The leveraged finance business of Jefferies and Jefferies Finance will continue to report to Ben Lorello  head of investment banking and capital markets  and Carl Toriello  president of Jefferies Finance  the sources added 
RISE IN LEAGUE TABLES
Jefferies had benefited from a U S  regulatory drive that started in 2013 to curb the issuance of risky junk rated loans  because the firm is not regulated by the Federal Reserve  the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 
Last year  Jefferies ranked second in league tables for leveraged buyout financing with a 7 8 percent market share  according to Thomson Reuters Loan Pricing Corp data  It barely cracked the top 10 position in the league tables just two years earlier 
But with a higher market share came more risk  Jefferies does not specifically break out revenue or profits for its leveraged finance business in its earnings reports  But its debt capital markets division  which includes leveraged finance  showed signs of weakness in the last fiscal year  which ended Nov  30 
Jefferies posted  398 2 million in net revenue in debt capital markets in that period  representing 16 percent of total net revenue  In fiscal 2014  that figure was  627 5 million  or 21 percent of overall net revenue 
Among the junk debt deals that Jefferies struggled to syndicate was Sycamore Partners   3 billion purchase of department store chain Belk Inc and drugmaker Concordia Health Corp s  3 5 billion acquisition of peer Amdipharm Mercury Ltd

43301,264816,NLOK,IBM Blockchain Network To Aid NCC Simplify Registry Dealings,opinion,International Business Machines Corporation   NYSE IBM   devised a blockchain network  which was recently deployed by French National Council of Clerks   NCC   of Commercial Courts The blockchain network is aimed at enabling NCC to accelerate management processes of legal economic transactions involving corporate and commercial registry  In fact  under experimental trial process  NCC could reduce the time to update registry for a few complex cases to one single day compared with several days required previously Notably  the first tests  involving four court clerks and IT providers  were successful  This compelled NCC to deploy blockchain network in commercial courts based out of France  as early as first half of 2019 IBM s blockchain solutions will be utilized to record  share  manage and update local registries data in secure  transparent  efficient and coordinated manner Overall  the blockchain network is aimed at improving efficiency of the Clerks in service in commercial courts via improved court clerks  interactions and enhanced visibility of updates pertaining to legal changes IBM s blockchain network is also expected to fortify the presence of French Commercial and Corporate Registry across the European Union Notable Benefits of BlockchainBlockchain is much faster than legacy technologies in completing a transaction as there is no need for manual processing or authentication by intermediaries The secured storage and transmission of data through a decentralized database is the most attractive feature of the blockchain technology  Originally utilized for cryptocurrency transactions  the system is transparent and incorruptible  and meant to provide unaltered information Since blockchain utilizes a distributed consensus  tampering with its records without being noticed by an entire network is difficult  This makes the system extremely secure  With minimum chances of double counting and hacking  the possibility of monetary losses is also low In fact  per Orbisresearch com data as revealed by Reuters  blockchain technology is anticipated to be used by 65  of enterprises by 2020  Given its market presence and growing collaborations  IBM is well positioned to reap the benefits compared with other key players in this domain like Microsoft   NASDAQ MSFT

43344,264859,NLOK,User mistakes aid most cyber attacks  Verizon and Symantec studies show,news,"By Joseph Menn  Reuters    When a cyber security breach hits the news  those most closely involved often have incentive to play up the sophistication of the attack  If hackers are portrayed as well funded geniuses  victims look less vulnerable  security firms can flog their products and services  and government officials can push for tougher regulation or seek more money for cyber defenses  But two deeply researched reports being released this week underscore the less heralded truth  the vast majority of hacking attacks are successful because employees click on links in tainted emails  companies fail to apply available patches to known software flaws  or technicians do not configure systems properly  These conclusions will be in the minds of executives attending the world s largest technology security conference next week in San Francisco  a conference named after lead sponsor RSA  the security division of EMC Corp  NYSE EMC   In the best known annual study of data breaches  a report from  Verizon Communications  Inc  NYSE VZ  to be released on Wednesday found that more than two thirds of the 290 electronic espionage cases it learned about in 2014 involved phishing  the security industry s term for trick emails  Because so many people click on tainted links or attachments  sending phishing emails to just 10 employees will get hackers inside corporate gates 90 percent of the time  Verizon found    There s an overarching pattern   said Verizon scientist Bob Rudis  Attackers use phishing to install malware and steal credentials from employees  then they use those credentials to roam through networks and access programs and files  he said  Verizon s report includes its own business investigations and data from 70 other contributors  including law enforcement  It found that while major new vulnerabilities such as Heartbleed are being used by hackers within hours of their announcement  more attacks last year exploited patchable vulnerabilities dating from 2007  2010  2011  2012 and 2013   Another annual cyber report  to be released on Tuesday by  Symantec Corp   NASDAQ SYMC   found that state sponsored spies also used phishing techniques because they work and because the less sophisticated approach drew less scrutiny from defenders  Once inside a system  however  the spies turned fancy  writing customized software to evade detection by whatever security programs the target has installed  Symantec said   Once I m in  I can do what I need to   said Robert Shaker  an incident response manager at Symantec  The report drew on data from 57 million sensors in 157 countries and territories  Another troubling trend Symantec found involves the use of  ransomware   in which hackers encrypt a computer s files and promise to release them only if the user pays a ransom   Some 80 percent of the time  they do not decrypt the files even then   The new twist comes from hackers who encrypt files  including those inside critical infrastructure facilities  but do not ask for anything  The mystery is why  Shaker said it is not clear whether the attackers are securing the information for resale to other spies or potential saboteurs  or whether they plan on making their own demands in the future  RSA CONFERENCE At next week s RSA Conference  protecting critical infrastructure systems under increasing attack will be a major theme  Another theme will be the need for more sharing of  intelligence  about emerging threats   between the public and private sectors  within the security industry  and within certain industries  While many of the biggest breaches of the past two years involved retailers  the healthcare industry has figured heavily in recent months  Former FBI futurist Marc Goodman said that both spies and organized criminals are likely at work  the former seeking leverage to use in recruiting informants and the latter looking to cash in on medical and insurance fraud  Verizon s researchers said that to be most effective  information sharing would have to be essentially in real time  from machine to machine  and cross multiple sectors  a daunting proposition  Another section of the Verizon report could help security executives make the case for bigger budgets  The researchers produced the first analysis of the actual costs of breaches derived from insurance claims  instead of survey data  Verizon said the best indicator of the cost of an incident is the number of records compromised  and that the cost rises logarithmically  flattening as the size of the breach rises  According to the new Verizon model  the loss of 100 000 records should cost roughly  475 000 on average  while 100 million lost records should cost about  8 85 million  Though the harder data will be welcome to number crunchers  spending more money cannot guarantee complete protection against attacks

43350,264865,NLOK,Out of the shadows  China hackers turn cyber gatekeepers,news,"By Paul Carsten and Gerry Shih BEIJING  Reuters    China  long accused by the United States of rampant cyber aggression  may be synonymous with hacking exploits these days  but that doesn t mean every Chinese hacker is out to pilfer and destroy  As Chinese companies grapple with a sharp increase in the number of cyber attacks  many hackers are finding it increasingly lucrative to go above board and join the country s nascent cyber security industry   Zhang Tianqi  a 23 year old Beijinger  cut his chops in high school trying to infiltrate foreign websites  skirting domestic law by probing for vulnerabilities on overseas gaming networks   Now  after a stint working at internet bluechip  Alibaba   NYSE BABA  Group Holding Ltd  he is the chief technology officer of a Shanghai based cyber security firm which owns Vulbox com  a site offering rewards for vulnerability discoveries  and internet security media site FreeBuf com    I d been messing around in the field in my early years  but luckily it just so happens now that there s this trend of China taking information security very seriously   Zhang said on June 18  from his office in a high tech development in eastern Shanghai  China s President Xi Jinping has made cyber security a national priority as the country starts to feel the impact of rapid economic growth occurring without a corresponding development in data protection   In May  China s National Computer Network Emergency Response Technical Team  a non profit agency  said it had recorded 9 068 instances of data leaks in 2014  three times as many as in 2013  reflecting the  grim challenges  of Chinese cyber security  according to the official Xinhua news agency  To try and tackle this  dozens of cyber security companies are now cropping up across China according to industry observers  populated by young techies with bona fide security skills and work experience at firms like Alibaba  Tencent Holdings Ltd and Baidu Inc  NASDAQ BIDU   China is hoping that eventually domestic cyber security groups will provide most of its companies with defenses against hacking  rather than them relying on foreign firms like Symantec  NASDAQ SYMC   Kaspersky and EMC  NYSE EMC  Corp s RSA   The gradual professionalism of China s bedroom hackers traces the country s rise as an economic and technological force  and its sometimes conflicted position in the escalating global data security arms race  The U S  government has attributed sophisticated attacks   including the large scale data theft this month from the Office of Personnel Management  OPM    to increasingly advanced state affiliated teams from China   But former hackers say the majority of their peers are joining a burgeoning industry to help China firms fend off the numerous attacks they face themselves   China has denied any connection with the OPM attack and little is known about the identities of those involved in it  The Cyberspace Administration of China told Reuters in a June 19 fax that it opposes  any form of network attack  and does  not allow any groups or individuals to engage in network attacking activities  within its borders   CRACKDOWN The cyber security industry s growth was partly spurred by a government crackdown on China s hacking community five years ago   around the same time Beijing passed a series of laws banning hacking and spamming tools and requiring telecom operators to help suppress attacks  Government sweeps largely silenced once raucous online forums like kanxue com  where hackers traded tips and boasted about their conquests  Many chose to shift from  black hat  activities to  white hat  ones  using their skills to find network vulnerabilities so that they can be fixed   Many people feel that now white hats have some space to do things  or make money  while hackers can t do bad things anymore   said one hacker who asked not to be identified because of his former work with the government   Aside from companies like Alibaba  Tencent and Baidu beefing up their defenses  China s government has also been working to ramp up the data security of the country as a whole  Agencies including the Cyberspace Administration of China have led educational efforts around promoting data security   Still  many  white hats  say Chinese companies continue not to take the matter of information security seriously enough  neglecting to hire enough people in house to protect themselves    I hope we can give people a wake up call   said the former government hacker   Even with the current progress  it s likely to be a long and laborious effort  with China saying it is often the target of sophisticated attacks from overseas  Last month  Chinese security company Qihoo 360 Technology Co Ltd issued a report saying it had discovered a series of cyber intrusions against important Chinese targets that lasted for years  These include a government maritime agency  research institutions and shipping companies  Zhang says that while the finger is often pointed at China for hacking attacks  the country is still playing catch up with the United States on both the cyber security  and cyber espionage fronts   
 When China s measured up against the American giants  the level of their hacks  their data security  the scale and the harm they can do is all much greater  ",2015-06-29,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/out-of-the-shadows,-china-hackers-turn-cyber-gatekeepers-348735",348735

the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  579 million The year over year increase in revenues was driven by robust growth in Weibo s ad and marketing revenues and user base expansion Quarter DetailsAdvertising revenues  84 9  of total revenues  increased 14  year over year to  484 3 million  primarily driven by an increase of  84 7 million in Weibo advertising and marketing revenues  However  the decline in portal advertising revenues and unfavourable currency translation partially offset the increase Non advertising  non GAAP  revenues increased 12 7  year over year to  88 7 million  The increase was

43415,264930,NLOK,China refutes claim of government ban on Apple purchases,news,"By Gerry Shih and Paul Carsten BEIJING  Reuters    Apple Inc  O AAPL  products such as laptops and tablets are not banned from Chinese government procurement lists  according to the country s chief procurement center  refuting a report claiming Apple was blacklisted on national security concerns 
According to a Bloomberg News report published on Wednesday  10 Apple products  including MacBook laptops and iPad tablets  were taken off a government list of approved hardware due to security concerns 
The Central Government Procurement Centre  as well as the finance ministry and Apple  said the company never applied to be on the list in the first place 
The list that created the confusion this week involves energy saving products  and is just one of a multitude of government procurement lists in China  Apple has never been on that list  the company said in emailed comments on Friday  declining to give more details 
 Even though Apple has the certification for energy saving products    it has never provided the necessary verification material and agreements according to the regulations   said a Finance Ministry fax sent to Reuters on Thursday evening  a statement closely mirrored by the Central Government Procurement Centre in their own announcement on Friday 
The government can still purchase Apple products  even if they are not on the energy saving list  according to the Central Government Procurement Centre website 
This week  many of the products mentioned were available for purchase on the website  except for a brief period late Thursday when sales were temporarily halted for a monthly price adjustment 
Multiple suppliers  who declined to be identified because they did not want to damage their business with the government  told Reuters that the price adjustments were routine  They said they did not believe the stoppages were due to national security concerns based on their conversations with the central procurement agency 
 They didn t say once that it had anything to do with national security   said an employee at a Beijing based government supplier 
The government website resumed selling Apple products including laptops as of Friday afternoon  The most popular model was bought 23 times between Thursday and Friday 
 Every month we have one price adjustment to make sure the prices are aligned with market prices   said a person familiar with the procurement process  who attributed the confusion to a misunderstanding   We ll stop purchases and then restart after they re aligned  
The uncertainty and speculation surrounding Apple s procurement status reflects the heightened anxiety among foreign technology firms in China amid what they perceive as a multi pronged  official campaign to curb their business 
Chinese regulators recently launched an anti monopoly probe into Microsoft Corp  O MSFT   That came after China said in May it would ban Microsoft s Windows 8 operating system citing security concerns 
The central procurement agency also recently delisted foreign anti virus software vendors Symantec Corp  O SYMC  and Kaspersky Lab due to security concerns  according to the state run Xinhua news agency 

Mutual suspicions between China and the United States over hacking have escalated over the past year following revelations by Edward Snowden that U S  intelligence planted  backdoor  surveillance tools on U S  made hardware  The U S  Justice Department  meanwhile  indicted five Chinese military officers in May on counts of extensive industrial espionage

43416,264931,NLOK,Home Depot in contact with Secret Service over alleged breach  source,news,"WASHINGTON  Reuters    Home improvement retailer Home Depot Inc  N HD  has been in contact with the U S  Secret Service about an alleged major breach of customer and credit card data that came to light this week  a law enforcement source told Reuters on Thursday 
Any investigation by the Secret Service appears to be at a very early stage  the source said 
The Secret Service  which declined comment  usually is the lead agency in federal criminal investigations into complex breaches of credit card and other consumer data 
Another law enforcement source said the FBI  which also sometimes participates in such investigations  does not appear to be involved  It is unclear whether the U S  Department of Justice is playing any role 
Customer data could have been stolen from nearly all of Home Depot s 2 200 stores in the United States  according to information released on Wednesday by security blog KrebsonSecurity 
Home Depot has not confirmed that a breach occurred and it remains unclear whether or how many customers were impacted 
If confirmed  the Home Depot incident could be among the most widespread in the string of security breaches at U S  retailers in the recent past 
Spokeswoman Paula Drake on Wednesday said the retailer is working with IT security firms  including Symantec Corp  O SYMC  and FishNet Security  to investigate whether there has been a data breach 
A Symantec spokeswoman confirmed that Symantec was assisting with the investigation but did not elaborate 
Home Depot sought to comfort its consumers  promising free identity protection services  including credit monitoring  to any potentially impacted customers and reassuring that the retailer or the banks that issued the cards will be responsible for any fraudulent charges 
Home Depot shares were up 1 6 percent at  90 39 on Thursday morning on the New York Stock Exchange 

Concerns about a potential Home Depot data theft follow a major breach at retailer Target Corp  N TGT   where hackers late last year stole at least 40 million payment card numbers and 70 million other pieces of customer data

43448,264963,NLOK,UPDATE 2 Obama picks Republican senator for commerce job,news," Adds details throughout 
 By Thomas Ferraro
 WASHINGTON  Feb 2  Reuters    President Barack Obama will
name a third prominent Republican to his cabinet on Tuesday 
nominating Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire as commerce
secretary  a White House official said on Monday 
 A respected lawmaker and accomplished negotiator  Gregg 
61  is the senior Republican on the Senate Budget Committee and
could help the Democratic Obama administration achieve its goal
of moving Congress from partisan bickering to consensus
building 
  The president plans to nominate Senator Gregg as his
nominee for commerce secretary tomorrow   said a White House
official who spoke condition of anonymity 
 Gregg could help Obama soften resistance among Republicans
opposed to the terms of an  800 billion plus economic stimulus
package the new president is trying to push through Congress 
 Gregg has a reputation as a fiscal conservative respected
by both sides of the political aisle  He helped craft the Wall
Street bailout last year and was one of a handful of
Republicans who voted to release the second half of the  700
billion financial rescue package to Obama 
 If confirmed by the Senate  Greg would join two other
prominent Republicans in what will be Obama s 15 member
cabinet 
 They are Defense Secretary Robert Gates  a holdover from
the Bush administration  and Transportation Secretary Ray
LaHood  a former member of the House of Representatives    As
head of the Commerce Department  Gregg would help promote U S 
business at home and around the world and would have a voice in
crafting administration policy 
 POLITICAL CALCULATIONS
 Although Gregg said he would not take the cabinet job if it
would give the Democrats a legislative advantage in the Senate 
New Hampshire Governor John Lynch appeared to clear the way for
his Gregg s cabinet appointment  at least politically 
  I have made it clear to the Senate leadership on both
sides of the aisle and to the governor that I would not leave
the Senate if I felt my departure would cause a change in the
makeup of the Senate   The New York Times quoted Gregg as
saying 
 Lynch  a Democrat  indicated in a brief statement that he
would yield to Gregg s demands and appoint a Republican to
replace him in the Senate 
 If Gregg was replaced by a Democrat and Minnesota s Al
Franken survives a court challenge of his apparent victory 
Democrats would have 60 seats in the Senate  enough to ram
through Republican procedural roadblocks 
 Obama s first pick for commerce secretary  New Mexico
Governor Bill Richardson  withdrew from consideration in
January in the face of a legal inquiry in an embarrassing
misstep for the the incoming administration 
 Until last week  Silicon Valley executive John Thompson 
the chairman and chief executive of Symantec Corp  had been
described as the leading candidate but Obama later turned from
him to Gregg

 By David Gaffen
 NEW YORK  May 7  Reuters     World stock markets pulled
back as investors readied for the release of the U S 
government s stress tests on the largest U S  financial
institutions after the close of trading 
 With stocks having rallied steadily for about two months 
fund managers reduced holdings even though leaked reports
suggest that bank balance sheets may be in better shape than
expected 
 In addition  a better than anticipated report on weekly
U S  jobless claims showed that the pace of job losses is
abating  The U S  dollar fell against the euro and other
currencies  and bond prices were also lower as investors
shifted away from traditional safe haven assets such as
Treasuries 
 Bank stocks were lower  after the KBW Banks Index more than
doubled after hitting a low on March 6  The banks have been at
the forefront of this 35 percent rally in the Standard   Poor s
500 stock index  and investors are now left wondering whether
the gains will persist  even with this event out of the way 
  People have made a lot of money    even if you got into
this rally late  you made a lot of money   said Sean Peche 
portfolio manager at hedge fund BlueAlpha Investment Advisory
Ltd  in London   The pullback just hasn t arrived  
 Technology shares dropped on Thursday  as investors
expressed disappointment with earnings from security software

2 3   
 The euro strengthened as investors reacted positively to
news that the European Central Bank would purchase up to 60
billion euros in debt securities outright in order to help
revive the struggling euro zone economy  The news came as the
European Central Bank elected to reduce the bank s main
interest rate to 1 0 percent from 1 25 percent  The moves mark
a more aggressive move by the ECB to boost money supply in the
euro zone  which ECB President Jean Claude Trichet said is
growing at a slower pace than desirable

pending supply weighed on the market  while jobless claims data

The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits 
Symantec has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Pegasystems has a Zacks Rank of  5  Strong Sell  right now  The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates  so investors should rest assured that SYMC has an improving earnings outlook  However  value investors will care about much more than just this 
Value investors analyze a variety of traditional  tried and true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
SYMC currently has a forward P E ratio of 13 28  while PEGA has a forward P E of 161  We also note that SYMC has a PEG ratio of 1 68  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  PEGA currently has a PEG ratio of 20 13 
Another notable valuation metric for SYMC is its P B ratio of 2 19  The P B ratio is used to compare a stock s market value with its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  PEGA has a P B of 6 93 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to SYMC s Value grade of B and PEGA s Value grade of F

43489,265004,NLOK,Top Stock Reports For United Technologies  Lockheed Martin   NextEra Energy ,opinion,"Wednesday  January 30  2019
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including United Technologies  UTX   Lockheed Martin  LMT  and NextEra Energy  NYSE NEE   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Buy ranked United Technologies  shares have lost 5 1  over the past three months  underperforming the Zacks Diversified Operations industry  which has declined 1 8  over the same period  However  United Technologies  fourth quarter 2018 earnings and revenues surpassed expectations by a wide margin  
The Zacks analyst thinks strength in commercial and military aftermarket businesses and impressive contribution from its acquired Rockwell Collins  NYSE COL  business sales will likely continue to boost United Technologies  near term revenues  Also  improved revenues and cost cutting measures are expected to enhance profitability  going forward  
Backed by these positives  the company has given bullish full year 2019 revenue guidance  Further  the Rockwell Collins buyout is likely to boost sales in 2019  Moreover  separation of the company s existing business will create higher values and customer satisfaction 
 You can   
Shares of Lockheed Martin have lost 17 7  in the past year  underperforming the Zacks Aerospace Defense sector  which has declined 8 8  over the same period  Lockheed Martin ended 2018 on a mixed note  While the company s fourth quarter earnings came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  revenues surpassed the consensus mark  Year over year results were impressive  
The Zacks analyst thinks that being the largest defense contractor in the world  Lockheed enjoys strong demand for its high end military equipment in domestic and international markets  Consequently  strong order growth has been a primary growth driver for this company  The F 35 program continues to be a primary growth driver for the company  
However  it faces intense competition for its broad portfolio of products and services in both domestic and international markets  It remains subject to interest rate risk related to the issuance of debt  With current U S  economic conditions favoring higher rates  the credit market may not be favorable for Lockheed Martin 
 You can   
Buy ranked NextEra Energy s shares have outperformed the Zacks Electric Power industry in the past year  gaining 9 1  vs 3 4   However  NextEra Energy s fourth quarter earnings and total revenues missed expectations  But strong execution of operational and financial plans allowed NextEra Energy to report solid year over year results 
The Zacks analyst thinks investments to strengthen its infrastructure and ongoing capital projects  on completion  will help in serving the expanding customer base more efficiently  The expansion of business through strategic acquisitions positively impacted earnings  
The company s nature of business is subject to complex and comprehensive federal  state and other regulations  Substantial investments are undertaken to ensure the safety of nuclear operations  That said  the risk of unplanned outages remains  which could derail its normal operations and impact profitability

43515,265030,NLOK,SYMC Vs  PEGA  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors interested in stocks from the Computer   Software sector have probably already heard of Symantec  SYMC  and Pegasystems  PEGA   But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors  We ll need to take a closer look to find out 
Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities  but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank  The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits 
Symantec has a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy   while Pegasystems has a Zacks Rank of  5  Strong Sell  right now  Investors should feel comfortable knowing that SYMC likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than PEGA has recently  However  value investors will care about much more than just this 
Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics  including the tried and true P E ratio  the P S ratio  earnings yield  and cash flow per share  as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use 
SYMC currently has a forward P E ratio of 12 04  while PEGA has a forward P E of 81 03  We also note that SYMC has a PEG ratio of 1 52  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  PEGA currently has a PEG ratio of 10 13 
Another notable valuation metric for SYMC is its P B ratio of 1 99  The P B ratio pits a stock s market value against its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  PEGA has a P B of 5 95 
These metrics  and several others  help SYMC earn a Value grade of B  while PEGA has been given a Value grade of F 
SYMC has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than PEGA  so it seems like value investors will conclude that SYMC is the superior option right now ",2018-12-26,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/symc-vs-pega-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200371347,200371347

43522,265037,NLOK,Earnings Preview  Symantec  SYMC  Q3 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"The market expects Symantec  SYMC  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 31  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This security software maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 39 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  20 4  
Revenues are expected to be  1 18 billion  down 2 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Symantec 
For Symantec  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Symantec will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Symantec would post earnings of  0 33 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 42  delivering a surprise of  27 27  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Symantec doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-symantec-symc-q3-earnings-expected-to-decline-200378982,200378982

43543,265058,NLOK,Intel To Reportedly Offload McAfee Business  Key Takeaways,opinion,Co owners Intel Corporation   NASDAQ INTC   and TPG Capital are reportedly considering the sale of McAfee  an antivirus software company Thoma Bravo is reportedly in early talks to buy McAfee business from TPG and Intel  Reportedly  the private equity firm has been actively looking for cyber security firms to acquire  The firm acquired Imperva in October and has reportedly approached Symantec   NASDAQ SYMC   The aggressive acquisition strategy of Thoma Bravo to consolidate cyber security domain adds weight to the rumored McAfee divestiture deal  Citing a few people familiar with this development  CNBC informed that Thoma Bravo intends to offer  a significant premium  compared with McAfee s  4 2 billion valuation  as of 2016  Further  one of the informers disclosed to CNBC that Intel considers itself a financial investor for McAfee business  In case the divestiture talks lead to fruition  Intel  which owns 49  stake in McAfee business  seems well poised to partially recover the loss incurred due to the declining valuation of McAfee Notably  shares of Intel have returned 6 3  year to date against the  s decline of 6 7  Intel s Chaotic Experience With McAfeeIntel had acquired the antivirus software maker back in 2010 with a view to secure its chips and improve their threat detection power  Notably  Intel concluded the acquisition of McAfee for approximately  7 68 billion in cash  or  48 per share  The original plan to integrate McAfee s cyber security technology in Intel s chips remained incomplete  The deal fell through as McAfee unit  rebranded as Intel Security in 2014  was unable to contribute significantly to Intel s revenues Around September 2016  Intel divested 51  stake in its security division to alternative asset fund manager TPG for approximately  3 1 billion The deal was valued at  4 2 billion with TPG infusing  1 1 billion in the standalone business  eventually renamed McAfee  following the closure of the transaction Reduction of 45 3  in McAfee business value post takeover is touted as a major integration failure for Intel However  after divesting the majority stake to TPG  McAfee s business is transforming for the better with inorganic additions  McAfee concluded the buyout of Skyhigh Networks around January 2018  Notably  Skyhigh Networks enables enterprises to supervise the cloud services leveraged by their employees Further  McAfee closed Tunnelbear buyout in March  this year  Tunnelbear offers virtual private networks to facilitate a secure data environment for shared WiFi account users Will Intel Benefit if Divestiture Leads to Fruition Notably  McAfee has to compete in a number of areas such as network  risk management  end point and data security  Given the intensifying competition in the consolidating cyber security space  Intel has to allocate sufficient resources to maintain and enhance its McAfee business with robust new capabilities Furthermore  the recent business trajectory of Intel suggests company s efforts to redirect its resources into areas with better growth prospects such as the data center  memory and Internet of Things  IoT  businesses The company s strategy to expand TAM beyond CPU to adjacent product lines like silicon photonics  fabric  network ASICs and 3D XPoint memory is bearing fruit Intel s acquisition of Israel based   an autonomous vehicle technology provider enabled the company to penetrate the autonomous car technology market  dominated by the likes of NVIDIA  NASDAQ NVDA  and Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM   The buyout provides Intel with access to Mobileye s technologies related to cameras  in car networking  sensor chips  roadway mapping  cloud software  machine learning and data management Notably  Mobileye revenues of  191 million were up approximately 50  on a year over year basis  primarily driven by strength in its advanced driver assistance system  ADAS  and autonomous driving platforms based solutions  Mobileye garnered eight new design wins from notable US and global automaker companies in the third quarter of 2018  taking the total to 20 on a year to date basis Moreover  Intel is strengthening its PSG product portfolio with  buyout  The company introduced the new Programmable Acceleration Card  PAC  with Intel Stratix 10 SX FPGA in the recent past To ConcludeWith the closure  we believe  Intel will be well positioned to focus on its data center business in an effective manner Instead of blocking resources on the development and enhancement of the McAfee unit  the company is expected to fortify its foothold in the rapidly growing ADAS market  which per recent data from MarketsandMarkets  is expected to reach a whopping  91 83 billion  witnessing CAGR of approximately 21  between 2018 and 2025 Additionally  a stable PC market and growth in Client Computing Group or CCG revenues bode well for the company s growth prospects Zacks Rank

43631,265146,NLOK,Ambarella s  AMBA  Q3 Earnings Top  Revenues Meet Estimates,opinion,Ambarella Inc    NASDAQ AMBA   reported third quarter fiscal 2019 results wherein earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate while revenues were in line with the same However  on a year over year basis  both the top  and bottom line results registered a decline  The top line  however  was within the company s previously projected range The company s non GAAP earnings came in at 21 cents per share  much higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 9 cents  However  it witnessed a substantial decrease from the year ago quarter s level of 85 cents due to lower revenues and elevated operating expenses Ambarella  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise   Quarter in DetailThe company s third quarter fiscal revenues plunged 35 7  year over year to  57 3 million  Transition of the business away from consumer electronic applications  which comprised less than 15  of total revenues in the reported quarter  toward computer vision product manufacturing coupled with geopolitical and macroeconomic challenges took a toll on the company s revenues GoPro   NASDAQ GPRO   revenues persisted to be insignificant in the fiscal third quarter  An expected softness in revenues from non GoPro sports cameras and wearables  particularly in the second half of the fiscal  has been a concern  The company also predicted that considerably weak revenues from the drone market will adversely impact the reported quarter s top line performance However  management notes that the company s strategy to focus on computer vision applications in the IP security  automotive and robotics AI markets is an upside During the last leg of the quarter under review  Ambarella demonstrated its newly designed CV2 and CV22 System on Chips  SoC  plus home monitoring cameras among others at the 2018 Security China Exhibition on Public Safety and Security in Beijing Growing demand for single chip solutions with integrated computer vision processing in the surveillance camera market bodes well for the company s CVflow architecture based SoC solutions Management notes the reluctance of non China security camera manufacturers to design SoC for HiSilicon of Huawei  Ambarella s main competitor  This  along with its technical expertise  has helped the company grab HiSilicon s market share The company also announced a string of corporate entities during the reported quarter  which have adopted its products and solutions to expand and enhance respective business capabilities MarginsOn a non GAAP basis  the company reported gross margin of 60 9   which came in 310 basis points below the year ago quarter s figure  This was primarily due to the shift of the company s revenue mix from high margin consumer revenues to low margin surveillance revenues in China However  on a sequential basis  we observe that non GAAP operating expenses for the quarter under consideration totaled  28 7 million  down 4  sequentially  thanks to lower employee related expenses and cost control measures undertaken by Ambarella Non GAAP net income plunged to  7 million from  29 4 million reported in the year ago

guidance is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  54 92 million Fall in demand for consumer and other products coupled with macroeconomic factors are anticipated to persistently keep the fourth quarter revenues under pressure An estimated increase in the U S  tariff to 25  and the chances of new export restrictions will presumably loom on the fiscal fourth quarter results Additionally  a sluggish light vehicle production is a concern for the fiscal fourth quarter Non GAAP gross margin is projected between 59  and 60 5   It is slightly stressed due to the change in revenue mix Non GAAP operating expenses are envisioned in the range of  29  31 million on account of increased employees in engineering The company also predicts the downtrend in consumer electronics business to remain

Nearly everywhere I go  or every event I attend  people are looking down at their cellphones or tablets  This practice becomes more frequent  and probably will ownly accelerate in the future  Are kids and teenagers going to become less attached to these devices  Probably not  As such  and given the dramatic rise in value given to those who dominate the digital domain  every business  especially if you are publicly traded entity  is thinking about their digital strategy  Taking the big picture  if every organization has made this a priority  how much different is one approach going to be from another  Is there a competitive advantage there  Some of this depends on the position of the entity  so something like an Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   which has access to billions of bits of data about its customers that spans decades  has plenty more to work with in anticipating buying patterns than a startup  Still  Amazon competes with the Costco  NASDAQ COST  s  Walmart Inc  NYSE WMT   and Target Corporation  NYSE TGT  of the world that are pouring resources into its artificial intelligence capabilities  So they each have to think about the amount of data  the quality of it  and what unique insights can be gleaned from those who mine it  How might this apply to a smaller entity  which might not necessarily be in a retail business 
For those of us in smaller organizations  data should obviously be used to help drive all kinds of productivity gains in terms of making more effective decisions and improving operational efficiency  From a longer term perspective  I wonder how effective it is to compete with larger organizations on terms that favor them  In my case  the idea that I can create an algorithm that has the ability to compete with Vanguard  Fidelity  and Schwab is probably far fetched  I am not going to even think about that  I do compete with any entity which operates in equity analysis and investing in areas of the market where I think I have as good a chance of understanding that management team  their strategy  and the business  By limiting the sphere of what I am trying to accomplish for clients  the objective is to obtain better results for them  Over the long term  if I do this well enough  at some point  maybe I can consider building a data driven strategy to enhance what I currently do  Just something to ponder as we go into the summer  of which I am looking forward to and I hope you are too 
In the markets this week  import prices rose less than expected  which helped ease inflation fears  The dollar remains strong  which has helped European equities but remains a headwind for those invested in emerging markets  On the earnings front  NASDAQ heavyweight Nvidia had a monster quarter  which helped offset problems at security concern Symantec  NASDAQ SYMC  and a miss by Dropbox Inc  NASDAQ DBX  and Zillow Group Inc  NASDAQ ZG  early in the week  On the consumer side  Marriott International Inc  NASDAQ MAR  posted a nice beat  as did footwear officianado Crocs Inc  NASDAQ CROX   how is that for a blast from the past    In the oil market  the long anticipated decision by the US to say sayonara to the nuclear deal with Iran sent prices higher  There is a great deal of debate on how that action will effect the energy market  My own feeling is there are many cross currents  but long term  the reduction of capital spending over the last few years by the largest integrated oil companies  as well as national oil producers  will be hard to overcome by the increased production in the US shale areas  In combination with demand growth at the margin of 1 5 million barrels a day or more per year  I suspect oil at the current levels is going to be hard to sustain  Of course  the energy market is massive and plenty can happen  like an escalating conflict with Iran by any number of parties  especially Israel and Saudi Arabia  so take my guess with a grain of salt

43647,265162,NLOK,Trump Extends  Olive Branch  To China  Italian Politics Monitored,opinion,"Here are the latest developments in global markets 

FOREX  The US dollar index is lower by 0 15  on Monday  extending the losses it posted on Friday  The disappointment in the US core CPI last week appears to have taken the wind out of the greenback s sails  with yields on 10 year US Treasuries unable to sustain a foothold above the widely touted 3 0  level 
STOCKS  US markets closed mostly higher on Friday  The Dow Jones and the S P 500 rose by 0 37  and 0 17  respectively  but the tech heavy Nasdaq Composite closed marginally lower   0 03    dragged down mainly by cybersecurity software maker Symantec   33 1    The company announced an internal investigation will delay its annual report and may lead to a restatement of its earnings  As for today  futures tracking the Dow Jones  S P 500  and Nasdaq 100 are all pointing to a higher open  probably due to encouraging news over the weekend regarding the US China trade talks  see below   The positive sentiment was evident in Asia today  with Japan s Nikkei 225 and Topix climbing by 0 47  and 0 61  correspondingly  In Hong Kong  the Hang Seng advanced 1 12   In Europe  futures following the major indices were mixed  though all were close to neutral territory 
COMMODITIES  Oil prices are lower on Monday  after having retreated on Friday as well  WTI Crude Oil and Brent are down by 0 3  and 0 4  respectively  The retreat may be partly owing to comments from the UAE oil minister  who said OPEC has enough spare capacity to offset any crude lost due to sanctions on Iran  Another marked increase in the Baker Hughes rig count on Friday may have played a role too  In precious metals  gold is 0 2  higher today  remaining close to the  1 320 ounce mark  The yellow metal has been unable to assume a clear direction lately  trading between its 100 day and 200 day moving averages  A potential break of either of these technical barriers may determine the next directional wave in the metal  Major movers  Dollar corrects lower  risk sentiment buoyed by Trump s  olive branch 

The US currency was on the back foot on Monday  extending the losses it posted on Friday  The optimistic sentiment surrounding the dollar looks to have cooled for now  as the disappointing US inflation data last week probably scaled back some bets for aggressive rate hikes by the Fed this year 
Euro dollar   0 15   crossed back above 1 1950  with the common currency remaining largely unfazed by political developments in Italy  where the next government looks increasingly more likely to be formed by anti establishment parties 
Sterling dollar was up by nearly 0 1   having recovered nearly all of its BoE induced losses from last week  That said  the recovery appears to be owed more to dollar weakness than sterling strength  considering that euro sterling has remained elevated following the BoE meeting  with the pound unable to gain ground versus the euro 
Dollar Loonie rebounded on Friday  after it touched a three week low of 1 2730  following the release of soft employment data out of Canada  While the unemployment rate held steady as expected  the net change in employment turned negative  while the labor force participation rate ticked down  Despite the miss  markets did not materially pare back expectations for near term BoC rate increases  Investors currently assign a 40  probability for a rate hike at the May meeting  and a 74  chance for that to occur in July 
On the trade front  President Trump extended an  olive branch  to China by ordering the US Commerce Department to help Chinese telecommunications giant ZTE  HK 0763  to  get back into business  fast   The firm had suspended its operations last month after the Commerce Department banned US companies from selling it components  Also  China s vice premier and top economic adviser Liu He will visit the US for further negotiations  It thus appears both sides are committed to finding solutions through talks  which diminishes the likelihood of the situation escalating  in the near term at least  This may support risk appetite in the coming days  potentially helping stocks advance and weighing on safe haven assets like the yen  Day ahead  Italian politics eyed  geopolitics and trade remain a consideration
The calendar is practically empty of major releases out of the world s largest economies for the rest of the day  In the absence of economic data  attention is likely to be diverted elsewhere  such as on the potential outcome in negotiations to form a government between Italy s major anti establishment parties 
Any updates on the political situation in Italy will be closely watched as they definitely have the capacity to act as euro drivers  In this respect  anti establishment parties 5 Star Movement and far right League spent the weekend attempting to find common ground to govern the country  The two parties said they made progress towards that goal 
Other topics that might gain attention in an empty calendar are geopolitical developments in the aftermath of the Trump administration s decision to leave the Iran nuclear deal  as well as any updates on global trade  Relating to the latter  China is planning to send Vice Premier Liu He to Washington for more talks 
In equities  the final leg of the earnings season is taking place  One of the notable names releasing results this week is retail giant Walmart  NYSE WMT   Thursday  
Today s calendar features numerous policymakers making appearances  including BoE Governor Mark Carney  ECB Chief Economist Peter Praet  and St  Louis Fed President James Bullard  a non voting FOMC member in 2018   However  the topics of discussion are such that are unlikely to lead to market sensitive comments  Technical Analysis  Gold short term bullish  though positive momentum seems to be easing
Gold is trading not far below a near three week high of 1 325 82 hit on Friday  The Tenkan  and Kijun sen lines are positively aligned  pointing to a bullish short term picture  Notice though that the latter has flatlined  with the implication being that positive momentum is easing 
Increasing political  geopolitical or trade uncertainty can boost the safe haven perceived asset  Immediate resistance could be taking place around the current level of the Tenkan sen at 1 321 53  with last week s high of 1 325 82 being eyed next in the event of stronger bullish movement 
On the downside and in case of receding uncertainty that diverts funds out of the yellow metal and into riskier instruments  support could come around the current level of the 100 period moving average at 1 318 77  and further below from the region around the Kijun sen at 1 315 00

43649,265164,NLOK,Top Analyst Reports For Home Depot  Merck   Raytheon ,opinion,"Wednesday  May 16  2018
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Home Depot  NYSE HD   Merck  NYSE MRK  and Raytheon  RTN   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Home Depot s shares have gained  20 5  over the last year  outperforming the Zacks Retail Building Products industry s  14 1  increase  The Zacks analyst thinks that this performance is attributable to its five year long trend of beating earnings estimates  which continued in first quarter fiscal 2018  
Further  both the top and bottom line improved year over year in the first quarter  Results gained from strength in core business as well as relentless focus on affording innovative products  boosting interconnected customer experience and driving productivity  Steady housing market recovery and strong customer demand also remain tailwinds  
Going into the fiscal second quarter  the company continues to witness strength in all lines of business in the first few weeks of May  Consequently  it provided an optimistic view for fiscal 2018  However  the top line lagged estimates mainly due to colder than normal weather that led to softness in the spring season categories  particularly garden  This softness also resulted in a decline in comparable transactions 
 You can   
Shares of Merck have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry year to date  gaining  5 2  versus a loss of  4 0   Merck beat estimates for earnings while missing the same for sales in Q1  
The Zacks analyst thinks that new products like Keytruda  Lynparza  and Bridion should continue to contribute meaningfully to the top line in 2018  Keytruda sales are gaining momentum with approval for additional indications especially in the first line lung cancer setting as it is the only anti PD 1 approved in this setting  The Animal Health unit is also strong and remains a core growth driver for Merck  
Meanwhile  Merck will continue to focus on cost cutting initiatives to drive the bottom line  However  generic competition for several drugs and pricing pressure will continue to be overhangs on the top line  Rising competitive pressure on the diabetes franchise and on products like Isentress  HIV   Zepatier  HCV  and Zostavax  vaccine  will remain headwinds in 2018 
 You can   
Raytheon s shares have risen around  14 5  over the last six months  outperforming the Zacks Defense Equipment industry  which has increased  10 7  over the same period  However  Raytheon kick started 2018 on a solid note  The company s first quarter earnings and revenues comfortably surpassed expectations   
The Zacks analyst thinks the company is one of the best positioned large cap defense players due to its non platform centric focus  Due to its wide range of combat proven defense products  the company continues to receive numerous orders from both Pentagon as well as foreign allies  Raytheon s Patriot missile defense systems have seen a number of buyers in recent times including international customers from Europe as well as the Middle East  
However  factors like tough competition and political uncertainty continue to be major headwind for Raytheon  Moreover  the company is overvalued compared to its broader industry in terms of EV EBITDA ratio

Key Events of May 
The month was packed with global events  which more or less impacted Wall Street too  There was Italy s political crisis  which sparked fears of the region leaving the Eurozone  although tensions subsided at the end 
Oil prices were on a roller coaster ride thanks to the push and pull between two opposing forces   one is the fear of rising output by Saudi and Russia and the other is the report of   and U S  sanctions on Iran and Venezuela 
Then there was uncertainty in diplomatic ties between North Korea and the United States  Trump first pulled out of the scheduled June meeting with North Korea s Kim Jong Un on May 24  citing North Korea s    toward Washington  But after North Korea expressed keenness to resolve the issue  an effort to retrieve the canceled summit between the duo was launched  The jostle weighed on the broader stock market for a while 
Trade tensions flared up between China and the United States as the latter announced that it will levy 25  tariffs on  50 billion worth of goods from China and impose  in the United States  Trump also plans restrictions on imported steel and aluminum from Europe 
Developments at home were upbeat with President Trump announcing a drug plan which is in line with the best interest of drug makers and  in the banking sector which especially ease rules for smaller financial institutions  Several U S  economic data also came in better than other developed economies 
Against this backdrop  several sectors and their stocks came in upbeat in May while many have fallen apart  So  it would be intriguing to know which stocks gained and which ones lost in in May

You can see 
Buy rated Microsoft s shares have outperformed the Zacks Technology sector over the last one year  up  44 2  versus  25   Microsoft reported stellar second quarter results  Both earnings and revenues increased year over year  due to strategic growth investments in cloud business and AI along with robust sales implementation  
The company recently unveiled Surface LTE and a new generation of Windows 10 PCs from its OEM partners  Also  Microsoft s recent blockchain deals with Hapoalim and Accenture and its Coco framework are tailwinds  The Zacks analyst thinks rapid adoption of Azure and Office 365 will remain the key catalysts in the near future  Azure has been selected by the likes of United Technologies  NYSE UTX  and Columbia Sportswear  
Additionally  collaborations with the likes of Amazon  Red Hat  Symantec  NASDAQ SYMC   Cray and PAREXEL are positive for the company s growth prospects  Further  Microsoft s strategic initiatives to enter the augmented reality and virtual reality market will be positives

Shares of Amazon have outperformed the broader market in the last one year  the stock is up  77  vs  the  21 1  gain for the S P 500 as a whole   Amazon is benefiting from strong growth in all its businesses and especially the retail business remains very hard to beat on price  choice and convenience  
Amazon has a solid loyalty system in Prime and its FBA strategy and content addition continue to add selection to Prime memberships  AWS generates much higher margins than retail  thus significantly impacting Amazon s profitability  
Devices and IoT are also potential growth areas  However  increased operating expenses to support expansion of its business into new markets and territories  localize the availability of products and grow its content will keep margins under pressure 
 You can   
Buy rated Facebook s shares have outperformed the S P 500 index over the past year  gaining  44 1  vs   21 1   The Zacks analyst likes Facebook s efforts in mobile and live videos  which continue to pay off in a big way  Instagram remains another important revenue stream  
Apart from mobile and video  the monetization opportunities of the company s other subsidiaries   Messenger  WhatsApp and Oculus   and a huge user base higher engagement levels are expected to drive growth going ahead  Facebook is also dabbling in AR VR and AI technologies  which bodes well for long term growth  
However  the recent uproar caused by apparent use of the platform by Russian elements for interfering in the presidential elections has put Facebook in a spot  As a result  Facebook CEO has said that it will make sizable investments to tighten security on the platform  which  along with continued investments in video  AR VR and AI  will dent operating margins going forward 
 You can   
Shares of Buy rated Shell have outperformed the Zacks Integrated Oil industry over the last year   24  vs   11 6    The performance was supported by the company s impressive earnings surprise history  having surpassed expectations in three of the trailing four quarters  
Shell ended 2017 on a solid note with the integrated behemoth s fourth quarter upstream unit profit soaring from the year ago period thanks to steady commodity price recovery  The Hague based supermajor was also able to reduce operating costs on increased synergies with BG Group  apart from progressing on its large divestment program  
Importantly  the Anglo Dutch company generated healthy cash flows yet again  allowing it to cut debt and cover its cash dividend   Consequently  the Zacks analyst thinks Shell offers substantial upside potential from the current price levels and views it as a preferred energy play to own now

growth prospects  Further  Microsoft s strategic initiatives to enter the augmented reality and virtual reality market will be positives Shares of Amazon have outperformed the broader market in the last one year  the stock is up  77  vs  the  21 1  gain for the S P 500 as a whole   Amazon is benefiting from strong growth in all its businesses and especially the retail business remains very hard to beat on price  choice and convenience Amazon has a solid loyalty system in Prime and its FBA strategy and content addition continue to add selection to Prime memberships  AWS generates much higher margins than retail  thus significantly impacting Amazon s profitability Devices and IoT are also potential growth areas  However  increased operating expenses to support expansion of its business into new markets and territories  localize the availability of products and grow its content will keep margins under pressure Buy rated Facebook s shares have outperformed the S P 500 index over the past year  gaining  44 1  vs   21 1   The Zacks analyst likes Facebook s efforts in mobile and live videos  which continue to pay off in a big way  Instagram remains another important revenue stream Apart from mobile and video  the monetization opportunities of the company s other subsidiaries   Messenger  WhatsApp and Oculus   and a huge user base higher engagement levels are expected to drive growth going ahead  Facebook is also dabbling in AR VR and AI technologies  which bodes well for long term growth However  the recent uproar caused by apparent use of the platform by Russian elements for interfering in the presidential elections has put Facebook in a spot  As a result  Facebook CEO has said that it will make sizable investments to tighten security on the platform  which  along with continued investments in video  AR VR and AI  will dent operating margins going forward Shares of Buy rated Shell have outperformed the Zacks Integrated Oil industry over the last year   24  vs   11 6    The performance was supported by the company s impressive earnings surprise history  having surpassed expectations in three of the trailing four quarters Shell ended 2017 on a solid note with the integrated behemoth s fourth quarter upstream unit profit soaring from the year ago period thanks to steady commodity price recovery  The Hague based supermajor was also able to reduce operating costs on increased synergies with BG Group  apart from progressing on its large divestment program Importantly  the Anglo Dutch company generated healthy cash flows yet again  allowing it to cut debt and cover its cash dividend   Consequently  the Zacks analyst thinks Shell offers substantial upside potential from the current price levels and views it as a preferred energy play to own now Today s

43673,265188,NLOK,Tech Earnings Roundup  AAPL  FB  MSFT  GOOGL  AMZN  More,opinion,"With earnings reports from Apple   NASDAQ AAPL    Facebook   NASDAQ FB    Microsoft   NASDAQ MSFT    Alphabet   NASDAQ GOOGL   and Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN    last week was without a doubt the biggest one for technology earnings  As may be expected  all these companies were impacted by the new tax law  but some gained more than others 
Most tech companies provided for the tax on cash held overseas while baking in a lower future tax rate into the guidance  Excluding the tax impact  results were generally better than expected  Here are the details  
Earnings
Apple  Apple reported a customary strong quarter despite fears of weaker than expected demand for the iPhone X  So its revenue and earnings were both well ahead of the respective Zacks Consensus Estimates  A  100  year over year increase in the iPhone ASP indicates that the iPhone X did in fact do quite well  but may have been impacted by the slightly delayed launch 
At the same time  guidance came in below expectations  which could mean that management is being conservative  or there really is weaker demand for the much more expensive device  What falls to the bottom line is however more significant for a company  so a more profitable business model where higher prices offset volume declines may not be so bad 
Another thing to keep in mind is the incremental stability in Apple s revenues stemming from a steadily growing services business where the installed base continues to grow  China was also strong in the last quarter  and Apple saw some traction in iPads  So  nothing at all to complain about  Read More  
Facebook  Facebook also reported a very strong quarter with both revenue and earnings topping the respective Zacks Consensus Estimates and growing double digits from the year ago quarter  While newsfeed modifications to facilitate community building over content consumption lowered the time spent on Facebook by 50 million hours a day  ad impressions  up 4    the price per ad  up 35    and daily and monthly active users  both up 14   were robust  which means that there s no reason to panic 
On the other hand  today  Facebook has built revenue opportunities outside the social network including WhatsApp  where business messaging has started   Messenger  which is being built up as a multi service platform like We Chat   Stories  Watch  a video offering that s still in its very early stages  and Marketplace  where there are already 700 million users   Facebook generally starts monetizing a platform once it already has around a billion users  so its goal is to offer global scale and scope for advertisers sellers  And this is exactly why its platforms are so valuable 
The company should continue to see increasing average revenue per user and profitability despite near term pressures  whether regulatory or company policy based   
Microsoft  Microsoft s second quarter revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a sliver although its earnings beat comfortably  The company met its target of  20 billion in annualized commercial cloud revenue by 2018  Driving the business was the productivity segment where LinkedIn  NYSE LNKD   Office 365 and Dynamics 365 all contributed  Strengthening ARPUs suggest that the company is successfully transitioning to the SaaS model 
Also encouraging was the Intelligent Cloud business with particular strength in Azure  Despite the seasonal strength in gaming  the Xbox One X launch and momentum around Xbox Live where a gaming as a service platform seems to be in the making  the more personal computing segment didn t do as well because of weakness in Windows  
Alphabet  Alphabet reported a mixed quarter with revenue squeezing past the Zacks Consensus Estimate but earnings coming up short  Strength in mobile and increasing traffic acquisition costs  TAC  related to this strength were notable points this quarter  Mobile TAC is higher because the company needs to pay to remain as the default search engine  on Apple devices  for example  
Management didn t say on the call whether Google has inked more longer term deals to limit TAC expansion  but they did say that the net effect of market dynamics and the company s own measures would lower the rate of increase in TAC post Q1  Alphabet continues to trade CPCs for volumes  which is also affecting the gross margin 
Holiday seasonality also drove up marketing costs in the last quarter  which impacted operating profits  Read More  
Amazon  Amazon s revenue and earnings grew strongly in the fourth quarter  blowing past our expectations  The company leads all others in both the retail and cloud sides of the business  so it s encouraging to see it growing so strongly from such a large base  Amazon has started talking about its advertising revenue  which means this is on the verge of becoming another major growth driver 
Then  of course  there s Alexa    which enabled it to become the leading provider of voice controlled devices by building an ecosystem around it  Google may try to catch up  but Amazon is no Apple  Google s Android came from behind to become the leading mobile OS   it isn t as interested in profits as growth  so this market won t be so easy to wrest from Amazon 
The competition in the cloud and also voice controlled devices will mostly gain from market growth and not so much from wresting share from Amazon  All that being said  it may be a good idea to keep in sight Amazon s long term debt and obligations as well as FCF net of long term obligation repayments as they represent increasing risk  Read More

43674,265189,NLOK,Tech Investors Keeping A Close Eye On Zscaler s IPO,opinion,"While established tech companies like Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL  and Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  continue to gobble up media headlines  and other tech IPOs like Dropbox have seized the market s attention  savvy tech investors everywhere are keeping a close eye on Zscaler s forthcoming IPO  which some expect could be one of the biggest of the year  The security software company is heading full throttle towards a mammoth valuation that could price it at more than  1 5 billion  and analysts from Wall Street to Beijing are scrambling to find out all they can about the company before it debuts on the market  
What should you expect from Zscaler s IPO  and how might it impact the broader tech market for the rest of 2018  A quick glance at the security software company s record shows that it has serious potential  but that it needs to cut back on its losses before the market starts taking it seriously 
The cybersecurity market is heating up
It goes without saying that the burgeoning cybersecurity industry is one of today s biggest allures in the market  but companies like Zscaler Inc  NASDAQ ZS  are continuing to wow investors with how vital they could prove to be in the future  As billions of global consumers flock to the internet and purchase more of their favorite digital gadgets en masse  cybersecurity software firms like Zscaler are the only thing standing between them and the hackers trying to gain access to their lucrative data  meaning the company and its early backers should expect to enjoy a thriving industry for the immediate future  
Despite the rosy future surrounding cybersecurity software  however  Zscaler won t have an easy time of it in the market at first  its industry is getting increasingly crowded as tech experts realize the profits there are to be made defending consumer s data  and the company has been hemorrhaging money for the last few years in such a way that will turn off many investors  The last three fiscal years have seen Zscaler posting greater and greater losses  and despite the company s  that it s been breaking growth records  it s yet to turn a serious profit  
Not everything is doom and gloom for the cybersecurity company  of course  the fact that its revenue figures have been steadily rising just behind its losses should convince some analysts that it s still capable of turning things around in the future  and when Zscaler hits the market on Friday it could cement a market valuation of some   a hefty sum that will impress many investors looking to throw their weight behind the latest tech unicorn  Coupling its impressive market valuation with the money it gains from its IPO  which could reap the software firm more than  160 million  it stands to reason that Zscaler will be able to expand its services and invest more in its IT infrastructure to help cut down on its current losses  
Zscaler could end up selling some 12 million shares at a price range of  13 to  15  provided investors still see a bright future for the cybersecurity company  and it will doubtlessly put much of the money it gains towards improvements to help it in its fight against its biggest competitors like Cisco and Symantec  NASDAQ SYMC  offering a to businesses  The company initially field to sell 10 million shares at a price range of  10 to  12  so the upping in the number of shares offered and the increase in price per share could reflect the confidence its executives have that things are about to turn around for the company 
Tech unicorns continue to enthrall the market
Despite the hubbub that always surrounds so called tech unicorns  labeled that because of their  1 billion plus valuations  investors should remain cautious when it comes to backing Zscaler until it s done enough to assure them that its current series of losses are coming to an end  Despite increasing revenue figures  which saw the company leap from  53 million in 2015 to  125 million by the end of fiscal 2017  its increasing net losses aren t likely to abate anytime soon  according to the prospectus it filed with the SEC  
This should be a warning to investors who are looking for immediate returns on their investments  and the intense competition the firm will be facing from the likes of Cisco will likely only be growing worse in the future  too  As the market tilts more and more towards a digitally dominated future  other companies are sure to step in on Zscaler s turf  meaning the company will have to struggle for every last dollar if it s to one day make it out of the red  Tech investors shouldn t totally shun Zscaler  given the company s potential to make it big in a rapidly growing industry  but they need to keep a close eye on its accruing losses if they want to keep their cash in the long run  Despite the bright future its industry possesses  Zscaler is sailing into some fierce headwinds  and will need a steady hand at the wheel to steer the company towards success ",2018-03-15,Alex Newman,https://www.investing.com/analysis/tech-investors-are-keeping-a-close-eye-on-zscalers-ipo-200298537,200298537

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Microsoft  MSFT   Merck  NYSE MRK  and Union Pacific  UNP   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Microsoft s shares have outperformed the Zacks Technology sector over the last year  up  37 7  versus  16 1   Microsoft has a dominant position in the desktop PC market  with its operating systems being used in the majority of PCs worldwide  The company s strategic growth investments in cloud business and AI are a positive  The launch of Surface LTE and the new generation of Windows 10 PCs from its OEM partners bodes well for the company  
Also  Microsoft s recent blockchain deals with Hapoalim and Accenture and its Coco framework are tailwinds  The Zacks analyst thinks rapid adoption of Azure and Office 365 to remain the key catalysts in the near future  Further  collaborations with Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   Red Hat  Symantec  NASDAQ SYMC   Cray and PAREXEL are positive for the company s growth prospects  
Microsoft s strategic initiatives to enter the augmented reality and virtual reality market are other positives  However  its business reorganization and  cloud first mobile first  execution risks remain  Competition remains stiff 
 You can   
Shares of Merck have underperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year  losing  14 7  versus a gain of  5 2   The Zacks analyst thinks Merck s new products like Keytruda  Lynparza and Bridion should continue to contribute meaningfully to the top line in 2018  Keytruda sales are gaining strong momentum with approval for additional indications especially in the first line lung cancer setting 
The Animal Health unit is also strong and remains a core growth driver for Merck  Meanwhile  Merck will continue to focus on cost cutting initiatives to drive the bottom line  However  generic competition for several drugs and pricing pressure will continue to be overhangs on the top line  
Rising competitive pressure on the diabetes franchise and on products like Isentress  HIV   Zepatier  HCV  and Zostavax  vaccine  will remain headwinds in 2018  Estimates have gone up slightly ahead of the company s Q1 earnings release  Merck has a positive record of earnings surprises in the recent quarters 
 You can   
Union Pacific s shares have outperformed the Zacks Rail industry   21 vs   11 9   as well as fellow railroad operator Norfolk Southern Corporation  NYSE NSC    12   over the last year  The Zacks analyst thinks higher freight revenues will boost Union Pacific s first quarter results  scheduled to be released on Apr 26  The metric is expected to increase on the back of overall volume growth  among other factors  
Moreover  the intermodal unit is anticipated to continue with its impressive performance in the soon to be reported quarter  The company s efforts to reward shareholders are also encouraging  The  3 3 billion capital plan announced by the company earlier in the year is impressive as well  
A bulk of the amount will be spent toward promoting safety and enhancing productivity  However  weakness pertaining to the automotive sector is concerning  In fact  automotive volumes are also expected to be soft in the first quarter  Union Pacific s high debt levels also remain a woe

43677,265192,NLOK,Zscaler And A Key Departure,opinion,"Zscaler  NASDAQ ZS  shares fell Thursday on news that its COO William Welch will be departing the company  In a press release submitted to the SEC  Welch stated that he was leaving  to take on a more senior role at a leading technology company   and declared that Zscaler  is extremely well positioned   Zscaler CEO Jay Chaudhry said that Welch s departure would have no impact on their third quarter financial results which will be released on June 6 
Yet despite these reassurances  Zscaler s shares fell by almost 10 percent to finish at  27 57 at the end of trading Thursday  Its all time post IPO low was  26 54  Overall  Zscaler s shares declined shortly after reaching an initial spike of  33 in March  and have hovered from  26 to  30 ever since 
This initial decline is likely due to negative sentiments about Welch s departure as opposed to anything concrete  The stock will likely go back up shortly and continue to stay around its present value until the next quarterly financial results report  Zscaler itself appears to have a bright future  but its stock value even factoring in the recent decline is already on the high end of what it should be valued 
Zscaler s Potential Future
Zscaler is a technology company which proposes to change how businesses approach the matter of cloud security  Businesses today are more worried about whether the cloud is truly safe and whether cloud providers can be totally trusted  Protecting the on premises corporate network is irrelevant in a world where more workers are storing critical data on the cloud and are not working directly in the office 
Zscaler uses its cloud network to route the traffic of its clients through its data centers and rejects traditional on premises security appliances  The end result is a safer  more useful security platform that will almost certainly grow in popularity as more businesses understand the importance of cloud security 
A look at Zscaler s pre IPO  shows its growth potential  as revenue increased from  53 million in 2015 to  125 million in 2017  Zscaler works on a subscription model  which is good for ensuring long term sustainability  And while the company does report increasing net losses  this is not an immediate concern given its cash on hand  Emphasizing growth is the right strategy  and Zscaler could absolutely become a preeminent player in the highly important field of cloud security 
Overvalued
Everything listed above should make clear that Zscaler has a solid future and room to grow  But the company s upside potential is already factored in  making this stock rather overvalued compared to its competitors 
For example  Zscaler at its current reduced share price has a market cap of about  3 billion  meaning a price to sales ratio of 24  By comparison  two of its main competitors in Cisco  NASDAQ CSCO  and Symantec  NASDAQ SYMC  have a price to sales ratio of less than five  Furthermore  Barron s reports that Deutsche Bank s Gray Powell notes that  ZS is trading at almost 12x 2019E EV sales vs the top tier of the 20  high growth peers we track at closer to 8 0x 2019E EV sales  
Yes  Zscaler has more room to grow than its competitors  but this potential is already factored into the stock  And the company does face some real challenges  In addition to the increasing net losses as well as negative cash flow  Zscaler also faces a lawsuit from Symantec who alleges that Zscaler has infringed on their intellectual rights  And as more businesses grow more concerned about cloud security  there is no doubt that competition will increase 
There is certainly a lot to like about Zscaler s long term future  But a good company can still have an expensive valuation which makes buying it an unnecessary gamble 
A Betting Man s Stock
Zscaler is very much a high risk  high reward stock given how its expensive valuation clashes with its potential and revenue growth  That risk did get a little smaller with the recent share price decline thanks to Welch s departure  but I do not expect this temporary dip to last long enough for most investors to consider taking advantage of it 
It is possible that investors buy now  see Zscaler report good financial numbers next month  and watch as their investment soars  But it is just as possible that Zscaler stumbles early on and investors find out they should have waited later to buy  In the immediate short term  investors should not take anything away from Welch s departure and view it as a temporary  meaningless blip  Holding is the best course of action for now  and investors should wait for more information such as Zscaler s upcoming earnings report ",2018-05-04,Alex Newman,https://www.investing.com/analysis/zscaler-and-a-key-departure-200313088,200313088

Technology sector over the last year  up  38 6  versus  28 1   The company is dealing with the recent security bug which poses a huge risk for users  In this context  it is rolling out patches to fix Windows kernels in order to address the vulnerability Additionally  Microsoft s recent blockchain deals with Hapoalim and Accenture and its Coco framework are tailwinds  The Zacks analyst expects rapid adoption of Azure and Office 365 to remain the key catalysts in the near future  Further  collaborations with the likes of Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   Red Hat  Symantec  NASDAQ SYMC   Cray and PAREXEL are beneficial for the company s growth prospects Microsoft s strategic initiatives to enter the augmented reality and virtual reality market with the acquisition of Altspace VR and launch of mixed reality headsets are other positives  However  intense competition from Sony s PS4 is a headwind Shares of Intel have gained  21 8  year to date  underperforming the broader Zacks Technology sector as well as the red hot semiconductors space  which are up  28 1  and  49 1   respectively  But Intel is benefiting from robust performance of the Data Center Group  Internet of Things Group  Non Volatile Memory Solutions and Programmable Solutions Group   These segments form the crux of Intel s data centric business model Further  the launch of Xeon Scalable  Core 8 chips  Myriad X and next generation desktop processors are key catalysts  The new desktop processors are expected to help Intel s gaming endeavors amid stiff competition from AMD and NVIDIA  NASDAQ NVDA   Moreover  the Core 8 launch is expected to boost Intel s PC market share However  recently  the company has encountered a major security issue  The bug is apparently present in nearly every Intel CPU made within the last decade  The security flaw could provide attackers with access to security keys  passwords  and cached files of a device s kernel memory  Stiff competition from peers adds to its woes UnitedHealth s shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical Insurance industry in the last six months  up  20  vs   18 9    The Zacks analyst likes the company s robust Government business and continued strong performance at Optum  International business and strong capital position are its other positives The recent announced acquisition of a Chilean company will further expand its overseas business  It has been witnessing an increase in membership for the past many years On the back of its impressive earnings in the first nine months  the company raised its 2017 guidance  Its strong guidance for 2018 also instills investors  confidence in the company  It has reduced exposure to the troubled public exchange business  Though this move will shield it from losses in this business  premium revenues are likely to be affected  Charges related to Penn Treaty are other causes of concern Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Mondelez and Deere Zacks Editor in Chief Goes  All In  on This

43701,265216,NLOK,Tech Roundup  INTC  NFLX   LRCX Earnings  FB  TWTR   GOOGL Statements,opinion,"The top news for last week included earnings reports from Intel   NASDAQ INTC    Netflix   NASDAQ NFLX   and Lam Research   NASDAQ LRCX   as well as published statements from the senate committee investigation into Facebook   NASDAQ FB    Twitter   NYSE TWTR   and Alphabet   NASDAQ GOOGL   to determine Russian meddling on their platforms  Here are the details  
Earnings
Intel  Intel reported strong fourth quarter numbers  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimates on both the top and bottom lines  The Data Center Group  DCG  was the primary driver  and at nearly a third of the business grew 19 6   The Internet of Things Group  IOTG   Non Volatile Memory Solutions Group  NSG  and Programmable Solutions Group  PSG  segments that together contributed around 13  also grew strongly 
At over half its total sales  the PC centric Client Computing Group  CCG  remained the primary drag with desktop volumes and prices being down significantly and notebook volume growth coming at the cost of much weaker pricing  The outlook remains more or less consistent with ongoing trends of a stronger data centric business partially offset by weaker PCs 
The company provided for taxes on previously untaxed foreign earnings payable over eight years  which raised the GAAP tax to  5 4 billion  Tax reform has however lowered the tax rate significantly and allowed the company to raise the annual dividend by 10   Read more  
Netflix  Netflix reported solid numbers that beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate on the top line and met the estimate on the bottom line  Being a subscription service  the company s results are driven by the subscription charge and the number of subscribers  So the 10  increase in subscription charges in the U S  and Europe for some plans and the 24 1  increase  international grew 41 6   in the subscriber base both contributed to the results  International subscribers now make up the larger group 
Netflix s focus on growing its roster of original and regional content as well as its acquisition of popular movies and shows has enabled it to raise the subscription charge and helped it attract more customers  Read more  
Lam Research  Lam Research topped the Zacks Consensus Estimates on both revenue and earnings  Guidance was also much better than expected  The company expects continued strong spending this year  driven by increased adoption rates of 3D NAND  FinFETs and multi patterning that it expects will generate continued growth  Cost cutting will ensure higher profitability  Read more  
The Russian Hand in U S  Presidential Elections
A senate committee has called upon social networks Facebook  Twitter and YouTube owner Google to offer written statements on if and to what extent their technology platforms facilitated Russian meddling in the U S  presidential elections  President Trump has called the effort a witch hunt  Nonetheless  the companies appeared before the committee to submit comments that were published last week  And they seemed to have a lot to say 
Facebook  Facebook stated that Russian agents created 129 events on its platform during the 2016 U S  election campaign  that 338 300 different Facebook accounts viewed the events  that 62 500 agreed to attend and that it wasn t aware how many events actually took place  The events were apparently on controversial and divisive issues 
As regards evidence of collusion between Trump and a Russian group on social media  Facebook said it  does not believe it is in a position to substantiate or disprove  such allegations  As far as making money from content produced by Russia s Internet Research Agency  or IRA is concerned  it said   Ads generally did not run on IRA Pages  and we expect that any revenue from such ads would be immaterial  
Facebook has also released an online tool that tells users if they followed or liked Facebook pages or Instagram accounts associated with the IRA that it would notify its users about in the coming days  Facebook said it no longer promotes Kasperky s antivirus offerings because of the government s espionage concerns although it is still in the process of phasing out a Kaspersky product it uses internally that doesn t transmit data back to Kasperky Lab  It can t however determine how many Facebook users downloaded Kaspersky software 
Twitter  Twitter said that there were 2 12 million automated  election related tweets from Russian linked accounts that garnered 455 million impressions within the first seven days of posting  It mentioned 677 775 people in the U S  that followed  retweeted or liked content from IRA associated accounts at election time  Twitter will be emailing these people the facts 
These accounts engaged in various activities like masquerading as local American news sources  content from which were then quoted by more than 100 news outlets  they also apparently attempted to organize rallies and demonstrations  and some were even abusive and resorted to harassment  Moreover  Russia linked Twitter bots retweeted  realDonaldTrump posts 470 000 times  constituting 4  of the re tweets he received from Sept  1 to Nov  15  2016  and Hillary Clinton s account nearly 50 000 times 
In September  Twitter suspended about 200 Russia linked accounts and in October  suspended ads from media outlets Russia Today and Sputnik  It is now in the process of setting up a  transparency center  that will display how much political campaigns spend on advertising  the organization funding the campaign and the targeted demographics  Twitter did say it wasn t aware of  any specific state sponsored attempts to interfere in any American elections in 2017  including the Virginia and New Jersey gubernatorial elections   Twitter said it doesn t use products made by Kaspersky Lab 
Alphabet  Alphabet earlier told the Congress that it had discovered that Russian agents spent about  4 700 on ads and launched 18 channels on YouTube  posting more than 1 100 videos that had been viewed about 309 000 times  Google also doesn t use products made by Kaspersky Lab  Like the others  it is building a new dashboard displaying information about who buys some campaign advertisements 
Amazon Go Launches
Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN   chose Seattle to launch the first of its checkout free convenience store concepts dubbed Amazon Go  Built on computer vision  sensor fusion and deep learning  the store promises a unique and hassle free shopping experience  people download the app and scan it as they pass through a turnstile at the entrance to the store  Cameras and sensors fitted all over the store keep track of what they pick up or put down until they leave the store 
The shoppers  Amazon accounts are charged for whatever they take with them  That s it  The concept is interesting  and Amazon has picked up enough real estate with its book stores and the Whole Foods acquisition  although it isn t saying Go will reach those places yet  to roll it out more broadly  But one thing to note is that it places a lot of reliance on those cameras  which can malfunction or be deliberately turned off  or simply generate incorrect results because of a heavy traffic situation  impacting the security of the store merchandise and the customer experience  But Amazon no doubt has those details ironed out given that it has been testing the concept with its employees over the past year or so

Corporate
MS Lowers Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  Price Target  Katy Huberty and other analysts of Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS  lowered their price target to  200 from  205 while maintaining an upbeat view on the company s prospects  The analysts say that rumors about weak supply chain orders in the first half of the 2018 calendar year are  largely noise  and higher end phones will make up a larger part of the mix  They therefore have their blended average selling price at  815  much higher than the consensus  752 
Apple Rating Downgrades  Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell lowered his rating to neutral from overweight  but retained the  190 price target because of signs that iPhone demand is starting to soften and  limited visibility into the potential for future iPhone cycles   Instinet s Jeffrey Kvaal pointed to Verizon s earnings release comments about its upgrade rate of 7 2   which is meaningfully below what it has been after other recent iPhone launches 
Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said that based on checks with supply chain vendors  Apple s iPhone shipments are likely to decline about 33  sequentially in the March quarter to 51 57 million units  last year it sold 51 million units   A 30  decline in the March quarter is normal seasonality  indicating that iPhone X didn t result in any super cycle  JP Morgan was more pessimistic  saying the sales decline would be as much as 50  
Google Invests in Spain  France  Google will open a new support center for Europe  Middle East and Africa in the town of Oeiras on the outskirts of Lisbon in Portugal this year  The amount of Google s investment remains unknown  but the center will create up to 500 high skill tech jobs  according to Prime Minister Antonio Costa  Separately  CEO Sundar Pichai wrote in a blog post that Google will also be expanding operations in France 
First  it will add 6 000 square meters of office space  64 500 square feet  to its Paris headquarters  taking the total headcount to a thousand  Second  it will open a new research center dedicated to artificial intelligence to tap into the local talent  Third  it will be creating Google Hubs with local partners around France  the first of which will be in Rennes  Three other hubs at unspecified locations will also be coming up soon with the goal of teaching people digital skills 
Alphabet s New Cybersecurity Unit  Alphabet has spun out a new cybersecurity unit called Chronicle from its moonshots factory called X Labs  The goal of the company is to increase  the speed and impact of security teams  work by making it much easier  faster and more cost effective for them to capture and analyze security signals that have previously been too difficult and expensive to find  
Based on the Google infrastructure and delivered through its cloud  Chronicle s security intelligence and analytics platform will leverage the company s own machine learning and search capabilities so businesses can analyze their security data more efficiently  The company also has an online virus malware scanner on offer that came through Google s 2012 acquisition of VirusTotal 
Amazon Banking in India  Mexico  Amazon has already been offering some banking services such as more than  3 billion in loans to small businesses that sell on its platform since 2011  according to a new research report by CB Insights via Bloomberg  Moreover  over 33 million people currently use its payments service and its recently introduced Amazon Cash service allows customers to load cash into their Amazon accounts 
But Amazon has apparently made more aggressive moves in India and Mexico  In India for example  it has launched a system for customers to load cash into their digital wallets at their doorstep  It has also acquired or invested in several startups like Emvantage Payments and BankBazaar  In Mexico  Amazon s cash payment service works as an alternative to using a debit or credit card 
Amazon Pharmacy Team  Amazon s recent job listings have hinted at its growing ambitions in the pharmacy business  Now  a new research report from Leerink via CNBC states that Amazon s team of specialized persons for that market has grown from 7 8 people to 30 40  Its initiatives make perfect sense given its successful platforms  the marketplace as well as the Echo and Dash devices  and the fact that it s a  3 billion opportunity  according to Leerink 
Unlike other markets  Amazon s goal for this market will be to match the lowest price rather than beat it  Amazon has been meeting with generic drug makers for some time now  so there must be good reason for this  It appears that Amazon will make for the generics market first simply because it will be easier to capture 
Twitter COO Departure  Anthony Noto is resigning from his position as Twitter s Chief Operating Officer in order to accept the CEO role at troubled finance startup SoFi from Mar 1  Noto has been the most important executive at Twitter after founder CEO Jack Dorsey and inspired Twitter s live video push  so the departure will be a blow for the company  His role will be played out by existing Twitter executives 
HPE Aruba Growth in India  HPE owned wireless networking company Aruba is looking to generate double digit revenue growth in India this year  on top of the 67  growth last year  according to top company officials  The strength was attributed to mobile growth in the country  Aruba focuses on sectors like education  health care  hospitality  retail and manufacturing in the country and even has an R D center in India s Bengaluru  It is particularly strong in the government vertical that contributed 48  of its 2017 business  according to Santanu Ghose  Country Manager  HPE Aruba 
MS Upgrades HPE  Morgan Stanley s Katy Huberty raised her rating on HPE stock to Overweight from Equal Weight and also bumped up her target price from  14 to  19  The main reason for the upgrade is the impact of the new tax law on HPE financials where the average effective tax rate goes down to 9  and repatriated cash increases financial flexibility

EU Fines Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM   At the end of its investigation  initiated in 2015  into Qualcomm s business practices between 2011 and 2016  the European Commission has come to the conclusion that the company s agreement with Apple to pay it to use only its own chips and not those by rivals like Apple  was anti competitive  The EU has therefore fined Qualcomm 997 million euros   1 23 billion  
Qualcomm has seen turbulent times of late as governments all over the world took it to task for misusing its dominance in mobile technology for anti competitive deals and arrangements  Apple in particular has played a big role in getting its customers together to stop making payments  Meanwhile  chipmaker Broadcom  NASDAQ AVGO  is trying to take hostile control over the company  promising shareholders improved relations with key players like Apple 
Facebook Privacy Settings Hub  In an attempt at compliance with the EU s very comprehensive General Data Protection Regulation  GDPR  mandate that goes into effect on May 25  Facebook has brought a new privacy center that will put the core privacy settings for Facebook in one place and make it much easier for people to manage their data 
It is also publishing its privacy principles for the first time and rolling out educational videos that will help users choose who has control over their information  The GDPR drastically increases the level of fines for companies found to be in breach of data protection law  which can be as high as 4  of their global annual turnover or 20 million euros  whichever is higher 
The new law also allows users to export their data and delete it and makes it mandatory for companies to report data breaches within 72 hours among other things  So users are currently seeing  privacy checkup  prompts in their newsfeeds that will direct them to make their choices

Apple Insider says that Apple s iBooks name may also be changed to simply Apple Books like Apple Music  Amazon has the lion s share of the ebooks market  which has kind of stagnated since 2013  Apple s actions may have something to do with Tim Cook s stated goal of generating  50 billion in annual revenue from its services business by 2021  up from  30 billion last year  Apple doesn t say how much of services revenue comes from ebooks  or how that business is tracking

Amazon Monthly Subscriptions Rise  Amazon just raised its monthly Prime subscription charges from  10 99 to  12 99  meaning that monthly subscribers are now required to pay  156 for a year  compared to the annual membership charges of just  99  This definitely seems to be a move to lock in the more sticky customers while forcing the fence sitters to take a decision to go or not to go with Prime  It can also check the churn inherent in a monthly system 
Cowen   Co estimates that 30  of Amazon s 60 million Prime subscribers in the U S  pay monthly  including students and low income users who pay a lower rate   which works out to an additional annual income of  300 million for Amazon

43722,265237,NLOK,Symantec  SYMC  Down On Dismal Q2 Earnings  Tepid FY18 View,opinion,Shares of Symantec Corporation   NASDAQ SYMC   dipped nearly 9  during yesterday s after hour trade after the company reported lower than expected results for second quarter fiscal 2018  Furthermore  revenues matched the mid point of the company s guidance range  while non GAAP earnings came in at the lower end The company noted that its booking mix is shifting faster than expected toward more  ratable revenue recognition   which resulted in lower than expected revenue growth Per the company   Adoption of our Integrated Cyber Defense platform is leading to an increase in the number of larger and multi product deals  which is a strong validation that customers are designing Symantec into their future security architectures  These trends are however also affecting our in period revenue recognition  The mix of our bookings is shifting towards more ratable revenue recognition as customers are increasingly adopting our cloud  subscription and virtual appliance products in multi product deals  Notably  over the past year  Symantec has returned 26 4   significantly underperforming the  s gain of 39 3   to which it belongs to Quarter in DetailSymantec s revenues of  1 240 billion jumped 26 7  year over year and came in line with the mid point of its guidance range of  1 225  1 255 billion  mid point  1 240 billion   The robust top line result was mainly driven by acquisitions  On a constant currency adjusted for acquisitions basis  revenues were flat year over year On a non GAAP basis  the company generated revenues of  1 276 billion  up 26  from  1 015 billion reported in the year ago quarter  The figure also came in at the mid point of management s projection of  1 260  1 290 billion  mid point  1 275 billion  However  quarterly revenues  on a GAAP and non GAAP basis both  fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 278 billion Segment wise  the Consumer Digital Safety and Enterprise Security divisions witnessed a 42  and 14  year over year increase  respectively  However  on constant currency adjusted for acquisition basis  Consumer Digital Safety registered 1  growth  while the Enterprise Security division s revenues were flat year over year Symantec s non GAAP gross profit of  1 075 billion was up 26 3   primarily attributable to a higher revenue base  However  as a percentage of revenues  gross margin contracted 20 basis points  bps  on a year over year basis to 86 7   as the benefit of increased sales was more than offset by elevated cost of goods sold Furthermore  non GAAP operating income surged 47  year over year to  435 million  while margin expanded 490 bps to 35 1   Moreover  non GAAP operating margin was approximately at the mid point of the company s guidance range of 34 36   The year over year increase was mainly driven by strong revenue growth  and benefited from better execution of the company s cost saving initiatives and synergies from acquisitions Per Symantec  it has realized over  580 million of cost through its cost restructuring initiatives and cost synergies from the acquisitions of Blue Coat and LifeLock  which is way ahead of its planned time of the end of fiscal 2018  Till fiscal 2017  the company has achieved more than  300 million in net cost efficiencies Non GAAP net income for the reported quarter came in at  268 million compared with  192 million recorded in the year ago quarter  Non GAAP earnings per share climbed 33 3  year over year to 40 cents and came at the lower end of the company s projected range of 40 44 cents Symantec Corporation Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Balance Sheet   Cash FlowSymantec exited the fiscal second quarter with cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of  2 026 billion compared with  2 306 billion recorded in the prior quarter  It should be noted that the company had repaid  2 billion of its debt during the fiscal first quarter  as a result of which its cash  cash equivalents and short term investments had declined to  2 306 billion in the previous quarter from  4 247 billion reported at the end of fourth quarter fiscal 2017  Long term debt  including current portion  was  6 079 billion at the end of the fiscal second quarter During the first half of fiscal 2018  Symantec generated operating cash flow of  390 million  It paid  114 million as dividend during the period GuidanceConsidering the effect of faster than expected booking mix shift toward more  ratable revenue recognition   the company lowered its revenues and non GAAP earnings outlook for fiscal 2018 For the fiscal  Symantec now expects GAAP revenues in the range of  4 877  4 977 billion  mid point  4 927 billion  and non GAAP revenues in the range of  5  5 1 billion  mid point  5 05 billion   down from the previous guidance ranges of  5 037  5 137 billion  mid point  5 087 billion  and  5 160  5 260 billion  mid point  5 210 billion   respectively  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal is pegged at  5 19 billion Non GAAP earnings per share are now projected to come between  1 66 and  1 76  down from the earlier forecast of  1 79  1 89  The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at  1 81 The company provided guidance for the third quarter as well  For the quarter  Symantec anticipates GAAP and non GAAP revenues in the range of  1 227  1 257 billion  mid point  1 242 billion  and  1 250  1 280 billion  mid point  1 265 billion   respectively  The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at  1 34 billion Non GAAP operating margin is projected in the range of 36 37   However  on a GAAP basis  it expects to report negative operating margin in the range of 2 3   Further  management predicts reporting earnings between 42 cents and 46 cents on a non GAAP basis for the fiscal third quarter  The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 51 cents Website Security Business Divestment CompletedSymantec announced that it has completed the sale of its Website Security and related PKI business to privately owned DigiCert Inc  The company received  950 million in cash and approximately a 30  stake in DigiCert s business  Symantec s Website Security solution verifies the identity of websites We believe the recent move is an effort by Symantec to end the ongoing dispute with Alphabet s   NASDAQ GOOGL   Google which has accused it for mis issuing over 30 000 of web certifications Our TakeWe predict that the faster than expected booking mix shift toward more  ratable revenue recognition  will continue to drag down the company s near term results  However  over the long run  this initiative will result in higher number of large and multi product deal wins  thereby boosting its top line performance Furthermore  we consider that although the sale of its certified authority business will avoid conflicts with Alphabet  the high margin of the sold business may depress Symantec s near term profitability Additionally  smaller companies like Kaspersky are constantly launching comparable products  These  along with competition from the likes of Microsoft   NASDAQ MSFT    remain headwinds Currently  Symantec carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  A better ranked stock in the same industry is Adobe Systems Inc    NASDAQ ADBE    which sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see  The stock has a long term expected earnings growth rate

43723,265238,NLOK,8 Undervalued Data Protection Tech Stocks,opinion,"Symantec and Check Point Software are among the technology stocks with the most upside potential 
Data Breaches On The Rise
Data breaches have unfortunately become a fact of digital life and it appears they re only getting bigger  In early September  Equifax  NYSE EFX  revealed that hackers had gained access to the personal information of 143 million U S  consumers after exploiting a vulnerability on its website  That means that personal data had been stolen on nearly half of the entire U S  population 
The following month  Verizon  NYSE  VZ  reported that the 2013 data breach of its Yahoo  NASDAQ AABA  business  which it acquired in June  had actually affected all 3 billion of its accounts  Yahoo had previously estimated in December that the hack only affected 1 billion accounts 
As a result of these revelations  the Senate Commerce Committee held a hearing on consumer data security yesterday  Among those who testified included interim CEO of Equifax  Paulino do Rego Barros Jr   previous CEO Richard Smith  and former Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer 
It was disturbing to hear in yesterday s hearing that Mayer did not have additional information to share other than that Yahoo was hacked  She said that they still have not been able to identify the intrusion that led to the theft  Mayer also disclosed that Yahoo was not even aware of the cyber attack until nearly three years later in November 2016 
After hearing this  Senator Ben Nelson went on to say that  rigorous  data security rules must be implemented  Nelson further explained that stiffer enforcement and stringent penalties are the only way to incentivize companies to properly protect consumer information  Mayer even compared the fight with hackers to an arms race 
Stocks That Help Protect Your Data
Cybersecurity companies are best positioned to benefit from increased public awareness of data breaches  Whether legislation is passed or not  companies  as well as individuals  will likely commit additional resources in order to protect their data  The simple truth is that potential hackings are now a growing concern in our everyday digital life

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Microsoft  MSFT   Johnson   Johnson  NYSE JNJ  and ExxonMobil  XOM   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Microsoft s shares have outperformed the Zacks Technology sector in the year to date period  up  37 3  versus  27   The Zacks analyst expects rapid adoption of Azure and Office 365 to remain the key catalysts for Microsoft in the near future  This  along with lower spending will drive operating margin expansion in fiscal 2018  Further  collaborations with the likes of Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   Red Hat  Symantec  NASDAQ SYMC   Cray and PAREXEL are positive for the company s growth prospects  
Microsoft s strategic initiatives to enter the augmented reality and virtual reality market with the acquisition of Altspace VR and launch of mixed reality headsets will be other positives  Additionally  its recent blockchain deals with Hapoalim and Accenture and its Coco framework are tailwinds  However  intense competition from Sony s PS4 is a major headwind  Additionally  declining PC shipments doesn t bode well for the company 
 You can   
Shares of Johnson   Johnson have gained  24 1  in the year to date period  outperforming the  17 7  gain of the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry  Sales in J J s domestic Pharma segment decelerated in the first half of 2017 as a number of key growth drivers like Remicade and Concerta are facing competition   However  sales growth accelerated in Q3 and the positive trend is expected to continue in Q4  
The Zacks analyst thinks new products in all segments  label expansion of drugs like Imbruvica and Darzalex and contribution from recent acquisitions    mainly Actelion    can support top line growth  Meanwhile  share buybacks and the restructuring initiative should provide bottom line support  J J is also making rapid progress with its pipeline and line extensions  
However  headwinds like generics  pricing pressure and soft global market conditions remain  Sluggish growth in the Consumer segment is also a concern 
 You can   
ExxonMobil s shares have underperformed the Zacks Integrated Oil industry   7 9  vs   5 2   as well as peer Chevron  NYSE CVX    1 9   in the year to date period  However  ExxonMobil has a leading position in the energy industry owing to the size and diversity of its asset base  both in terms of business mix and geographical footprint  With a stable cash position  the company s balance sheet is one of the best in the industry  reflecting declining debt load over the first nine months of 2017  
The Zacks analyst likes ExxonMobil s plans to combine its refining   marketing businesses as this will allow the company to take better decisions and boost performance  ExxonMobil will generate more cashflow from downstream activities  also helping it counter the volatility in its upstream business  However  dependence on costly offshore drilling might dent ExxonMobil s cashflow

  as well as peer Chevron  NYSE CVX    1 9   in the year to date period  However  ExxonMobil has a leading position in the energy industry owing to the size and diversity of its asset base  both in terms of business mix and geographical footprint  With a stable cash position  the company s balance sheet is one of the best in the industry  reflecting declining debt load over the first nine months of 2017 The Zacks analyst likes ExxonMobil s plans to combine its refining   marketing businesses as this will allow the company to take better decisions and boost performance  ExxonMobil will generate more cashflow from downstream activities  also helping it counter the volatility in its upstream business  However  dependence on costly offshore drilling might dent ExxonMobil s cashflow

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Microsoft  MSFT   Intel  INTC  and UnitedHealth  UNH   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Buy rated Microsoft s shares have outperformed the Zacks Technology sector over the last year  up  38 6  versus  28 1   The company is dealing with the recent security bug which poses a huge risk for users  In this context  it is rolling out patches to fix Windows kernels in order to address the vulnerability  
Additionally  Microsoft s recent blockchain deals with Hapoalim and Accenture and its Coco framework are tailwinds  The Zacks analyst expects rapid adoption of Azure and Office 365 to remain the key catalysts in the near future  Further  collaborations with the likes of Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   Red Hat  Symantec  NASDAQ SYMC   Cray and PAREXEL are beneficial for the company s growth prospects  
Microsoft s strategic initiatives to enter the augmented reality and virtual reality market with the acquisition of Altspace VR and launch of mixed reality headsets are other positives  However  intense competition from Sony s PS4 is a headwind 
 You can   
Shares of Intel have gained  21 8  year to date  underperforming the broader Zacks Technology sector as well as the red hot semiconductors space  which are up  28 1  and  49 1   respectively  But Intel is benefiting from robust performance of the Data Center Group  Internet of Things Group  Non Volatile Memory Solutions and Programmable Solutions Group   These segments form the crux of Intel s data centric business model  
Further  the launch of Xeon Scalable  Core 8 chips  Myriad X and next generation desktop processors are key catalysts  The new desktop processors are expected to help Intel s gaming endeavors amid stiff competition from AMD and NVIDIA  NASDAQ NVDA   Moreover  the Core 8 launch is expected to boost Intel s PC market share  
However  recently  the company has encountered a major security issue  The bug is apparently present in nearly every Intel CPU made within the last decade  The security flaw could provide attackers with access to security keys  passwords  and cached files of a device s kernel memory  Stiff competition from peers adds to its woes 
 You can   
UnitedHealth s shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical Insurance industry in the last six months  up  20  vs   18 9    The Zacks analyst likes the company s robust Government business and continued strong performance at Optum  International business and strong capital position are its other positives  
The recent announced acquisition of a Chilean company will further expand its overseas business  It has been witnessing an increase in membership for the past many years  
On the back of its impressive earnings in the first nine months  the company raised its 2017 guidance  Its strong guidance for 2018 also instills investors  confidence in the company  It has reduced exposure to the troubled public exchange business  Though this move will shield it from losses in this business  premium revenues are likely to be affected  Charges related to Penn Treaty are other causes of concern

43747,265262,NLOK,3 Hot Cybersecurity Stocks In Focus Post Equifax Data Breach,opinion,Cybersecurity stocks were seen soaring last Friday  after Equifax Inc    NYSE EFX   reported a massive data breach  Per the company  highly sensitive personal data of approximately 143 million consumers has been stolen from its database  Reportedly  nearly two third of the adult U S  population has been affected due to this cyber attack The company late last Thursday announced that a data breach occurred between mid May and July this year  which was discovered on Jul 29  Apart from some sensitive personal information  hackers have stolen credit card numbers of about 209 000 U S  consumers and  certain dispute documents with personal identifying information  of nearly 182 000 U S  consumers This is not the first instance when consumer data has been stolen from a company s data base  However  sensitivity of the information exposed in Equifax s data breach case makes it one of the worst in recent times  The latest data breach at the company will likely have a lasting impact as criminals can use the stolen resources for opening new accounts  applying for credit cards or loans  buying insurance  renting an apartment or even for tax frauds Shares of Equifax plunged nearly 14  last Friday after news of the cyber attack surfaced Cybersecurity Stocks SoarThe recent cyber attack at Equifax proved that most organizations across the world lack proper security measures Nonetheless  believe it or not  there is a positive side to this episode   A cyber attack is good news for cybersecurity companies because it increases the chances of security related purchases by the companies and governments  Hence  investors flock to these shares  shooting up share prices Equifax s Thursday s announcement gave a sharp boost to cybersecurity stocks  particularly identity protection security providers Symantec Corporation   NASDAQ SYMC    which has been enhancing its identity theft protection capabilities through acquisitions like LifeLock  gained the most with its shares witnessing a 3 4  rise This was followed by FireEye  Inc    NASDAQ FEYE    which is specialized in providing web security  email security  file security and malware analysis  The stock gained 1 5  last Friday Another cybersecurity company  Proofpoint  Inc    NASDAQ PFPT    went up 5 8  during trading hours  But it lost its momentum later to close at just 0 3  higher  The company is one of the leading security as a service providers and focuses on cloud based solutions for threat protection  compliance  archiving   governance  and secure communications Computer and Technology Sector 5YR   ReturnFresh Boost for Security StocksSo far  the year 2017 has witnessed massive cyber attacks  including the two ransomware attacks   WannaCrypt or WannaCry in May and Petya in June   which created global havoc  However  the silver lining to this entire episode will be the further rise in demand for security related products among enterprises and governments across the world  This is anticipated to drive share prices to new highs in the rest of 2017 Furthermore  with rapid technological advancement  organizations are increasingly adopting the  bring your own device   BYOD  policy to enhance employee productivity with anytime anywhere access  This trend  in turn  calls for stricter data security measures We believe the urgency for stricter security measures will compel enterprises  as well as governments to increase spending on cyber security software  According to a Markets and Markets report  worldwide cybersecurity spending will likely reach  101 billion in 2018 and  170 billion by 2020 Here we pick three stocks that are expected to benefit from this higher spending  Moreover  these have a favorable combination of a solid Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy   with a  of A or B  Back tested results show that this combination can handily beat other stocks Imperva Inc    NASDAQ IMPV   is engaged in the development of protection software and services for business applications and databases  The stock flaunts a Zacks Rank  1 and has a Growth Score of B  You can see  Leidos Holdings  Inc    NYSE LDOS    along with its subsidiaries  provides technology and engineering services and solutions in the defense  intelligence  civil and health markets  The stock sports a Zacks Rank  1 and has a Growth Score of B Varonis Systems Inc    NASDAQ VRNS   provides an innovative software platform that allows enterprises to map  analyze  manage and migrate unstructured data  The stock carries a Zacks Rank  2 and a Growth Score of B Bottom LineConsidering the above discussed factors  it makes sense to invest in this hot industry group as cybersecurity players are likely to witness sturdy growth in the near term More Stock News  This Is Bigger than the iPhone It could become the mother of all technological revolutions  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years  creating a  1 7 trillion market Zacks has just released a Special Report

Shares of Coca Cola have underperformed the Zacks Soft Drinks Beverages industry since the beginning of the year    9 7  vs   11    Coca Cola s sales are affected by declining demand in certain emerging and developing markets and a shift in consumer preference  Also  severe macroeconomic challenges in certain international markets have impacted results for the cola giant  which generates about half of its sales abroad

    To Benefit From Rising DemandCybersecurity companies stand to gain from data breaches as chances of security related purchases shoot up  The demand for cybersecurity related products have got fresh momentum by the two back to back ransomware attacks   WannaCry or WannaCrypt in May and Petya in June   which created global havoc Apart from this  data breach at Equifax Inc    NYSE EFX    which was discovered this September  is likely to have a positive impact on cybersecurity related products  demand  particularly identity protection security providers  Symantec  which has been enhancing its identity theft protection capabilities through acquisitions like LifeLock  will surely have cashed on this opportunity Acquisitions to Drive RevenuesSymantec has taken the acquisition route to redeem its struggling business  In the last few quarters  the company acquired businesses like Blue Coat  LifeLock  Skycure and Fireglass  The acquisitions have helped Symantec broaden its product portfolio and enhance the company s capabilities in areas such as identity  mobile and web protection  which is currently a huge concern for almost every sector  be it financials  retail or technology The buyouts have helped it reduce its dependency on the PC market and strengthen position in the enterprise security market  It should be noted that the company was facing severe competition from Palo Alto Networks and FireEye in the enterprise segment market Additionally  the acquisitions have broadened Symantec s customer base  Therefore  we anticipate this strategy to drive the company s to be reported quarters  revenues and earnings Website Security Divestment Might Hurt profitabilityDuring the first quarter fiscal 2018 results  Symantec announced that privately owned DigiCert Inc  has agreed to buy its Website Security business for  950 million in cash and approximately a 30  stake in the latter s business  Symantec s Website Security solution verifies the identity of websites  We believe the latest move is Symantec s effort to end the ongoing dispute with Alphabet s   NASDAQ GOOGL   Google  which has accused it for mis issuing over 30 000 of web certifications  However  it should be noted that the company s certified authority business was a very high margin business  Therefore  we are increasingly cautious that the loss of high margin associated with this business may drag Symantec s profitability in the near future What the Zacks Model Unveils Our proven model does not conclusively show that Symantec is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or at least 3  Hold  for this to happen  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our Symantec has an Earnings ESP of  0 78  but carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   Notably  we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Stock With Favorable CombinationAs per our model  NVIDIA Corp    NASDAQ NVDA   has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter  The stock has an Earnings ESP of  0 53  and a Zacks Rank  1  You can see  Zacks  Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website  our best recommendations and most in depth research are not available to the public Starting today  for the next month  you can follow all Zacks  private buys and sells in real time  Our experts cover all kinds of trades  from value to momentum       from stocks under  10 to ETF and option moves       from stocks that corporate insiders are buying up to companies that are about to report positive earnings surprises  You can even look inside exclusive portfolios that are normally closed to new investors ",2017-10-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/key-factors-to-decide-symantecs-symc-fate-in-q2-earnings-200257065,200257065
43755,265270,NLOK,Top Analyst Reports For Microsoft  Chevron   Intel ,opinion,"Tuesday  October 31  2017
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Microsoft  MSFT   Chevron  CVX  and Intel  INTC   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see 
Buy rated Microsoft shares have outperformed the Zacks Technology sector in the year to date period  up  35  versus  25 3   on greater appreciation for the company s reorganization and repositioning  Microsoft reported impressive first quarter fiscal 2018 results driven by rapid adoption of Azure and Office 365  
The Zacks analyst thinks these factors will be the key catalysts in the near future  which along with lower spending is anticipated to drive operating margin expansion in fiscal 2018  Additionally  collaborations with the likes of Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN   Red Hat  Symantec  NASDAQ SYMC   Cray and PAREXEL are positive for the company s growth prospects  
Microsoft s upcoming console  Xbox One X  has significant growth potential  as evident from the record pre orders  However  lack of exclusive games on the platform as compared with Sony s PS4 is a concern  At the same time  stabilizing PC shipments bodes well for the company 
 You can 
Shares of Buy rated Chevron have risen  7 4  in the past year  underperforming the Zacks International Integrated Oil industry s  10 5   while larger rival ExxonMobil  NYSE XOM  has gained only  0 3  over the same time period  The second largest U S  oil producer beat expectations in the third quarter amid the recovery in commodity prices and robust refining profits  
More importantly  Chevron was able to cover its investment and payouts with cash from operations   something investors really want right now  With crude prices firming and Chevron being one of the most oil weighted majors  the company s profits got an expected boost  Stronger refining margins also helped increase earnings  
As it is  its current oil and gas development project pipeline is among the best in the industry  boasting large  multi year projects  Consequently  we think Chevron offers substantial upside potential from the current price levels and view it as a preferred energy play to own now 
 You can  
Strong Buy rated Intel shares have gained  22 3  year to date  underperforming the broader Zacks Technology sector as well as the red hot semiconductors space  which are up  25 3  and  38 6   respectively  But Intel reported strong third quarter 2017 results driven by robust performance from the Data Center Group  Internet of Things Group  Non Volatile Memory Solutions and Programmable Solutions Group   These segments form the crux of Intel s data centric business model  
Management revised its 2017 outlook based on double digit growth expectation from data centric businesses  The Zacks analyst thinks anticipated improvement in cost structure and lower spending  primarily due to improving operational efficiency will aid in expansion of margins  
The launch of Xeon Scalable  Core 8 chips  Myriad X and next generation desktop processors are key catalysts  The new desktop processors are expected to help Intel s gaming endeavors amid stiff competition from AMD and NVIDIA  NASDAQ NVDA   Moreover  the Core 8 launch is expected to boost PC market share

43774,265289,NLOK,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Cisco  Symantec  Check Point And F5 Networks,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   July 28  2017   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog includeCisco  NASDAQ   NASDAQ CSCO       Symantec  NASDAQ   NASDAQ SYMC       Check Point  NASDAQ   NASDAQ CHKP      and F5 Networks  NASDAQ   NASDAQ FFIV      Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations    Here are highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog  Why You Should Keep an Eye on the Mobile Security SegmentMobile devices  the chunky things that allowed us to take a call without getting up  were such a big deal just a few years ago  But as the days go by  they seem to be getting more and more capable  all the while becoming slimmer and cooler as well  No wonder then that today  they are being snapped up by kids  oldies and pretty much everyone in between Considering their broad adoption and usefulness  one would have thought that there d be a ton of companies out there  taking care of security as we browse the net  shop  play  socialize  read  watch video  listen to music  or work  or any of the other stuff I forgot to mention    But that isn t the way we function it seems because most individuals are comfortable enough even without security and have limited knowledge of the consequences  So mobile security hasn t really gained momentum  even in places like the U S   where 70   of the population has a device Why Things Are Changing TodayThe first and biggest reason is the increasing usefulness of smart devices  Because these devices are always connected  they are more accessible to viruses  unsafe sites  etc  Moreover  people increasingly use them for shopping  entertainment  to consume media  or make payments  and tend to save passwords on the device itself  This also increases the danger of identity theft  The fact that they are moveable items that can easily be stolen or misplaced makes them all the more susceptible So as the number of devices continues to increase  with smartphones  tablets  phablets  chromebooks  surfaces  smart watches  AR VR devices  connected dashboards  smart  home products and other IoT devices  more information gets online with greater scope for infection or attacks  IDC expects smartphone shipments to grow 4 2  in 2017 and 4 4  in 2018 with a 3 8  CAGR over the 2016 2021 time period Shipments are forecast to reach 1 53 billion units in 2017 and grow to 1 77 billion in 2021  Gartner expects global mobile phone shipments to grow less than a point this year and 1 6  in 2018 with the ongoing migration from feature phones to basic smartphones  especially from Chinese players  continuing As the personal stuff on them continues to increase  they start moving some of it to Alphabet s or Apple s  Microsoft s  MSFT  or Amazon s cloud  meaning that increasingly  personal information is moving on the network  from where it might be tampered with  According to the Cisco  NASDAQ      Visual Networking Index  global mobile data traffic grew 63  in 2016  of which video traffic accounted for 60   The Middle East grew 96   Asia Pacific 71   Latin America 66   Central and Eastern Europe 64   Western Europe 52  and North America 44  It forecasts global mobile data traffic increase of 7x between 2016 and 2021  representing a 47  CAGR with nearly three quarters of all devices on the network being smart by the end of the period  The Middle East will grow strongest at a 65  CAGR  followed by Asia Pac at 49  and Latin America at 45   China traffic will outpace the U S  this year The digitization of banking services and online storage of healthcare information are two megatrends that also increase the risk of information loss  In fact  these two segments deal with critical information and are therefore under greater pressure from both regulators and customers to maintain a high level of security and privacy The virtualization of corporate workloads and bring your own device  BYOD  megatrend will completely change security as we know it  That s because hackers  ransomware  and other Internet crooks can t make as much money from individuals as they can from companies  governments and government bodies Moreover  organizations have more to lose than individuals in case of data breaches  i e  data  reputation  business loss from incapacitation   so they are more concerned about protection  In fact  companies like Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT  and Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  have regular hackathons to identify weaknesses in the programs they develop  So hacking has become good money Security Stocks That Should Be on Your RadarMobile security companies are still in their startup phase and it is the established players like Cisco  Symantec  NASDAQ       VMware  Microsoft  McAfee  Infineon and Dell that are gradually increasing investment in the area  Security pure plays like Check Point  NASDAQ        Fortinet  F5 Networks  NASDAQ       FireEye and Palo Alto

Our Take
Iron Mountain s diversified revenue base is a positive  It is noteworthy that 95  of the Fortune 1000 companies are on Iron Mountain s client list  Additionally  its strong product portfolio  increasing market share  and promising international business are the primary growth catalysts  Moreover  the company s entry into the data center market is likely to be a growth driver 
Furthermore  the company has an aggressive acquisition strategy to supplement organic growth in storage revenues  The acquisition of Recall Holdings has been positive for the company  Apart from generating synergies worth  105 million  the buyout also expanded its footprint in international markets 
However  the costs of such initiatives are expected to weigh on financials  especially as the company already has a highly leveraged balance sheet  Also  volatile currency environment and intensifying competition remain overhangs

    Balance Sheet   Cash FlowSymantec exited the quarter with cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of  2 306 billion compared with  4 247 billion last quarter  The company repaid  2 billion of its debt during the quarter  as a result of which its cash  cash equivalents and short term investments declined sequentially  Long term debt  including current portion  came down to  6 202 billion from  8 186 billion at the end of the previous quarter During the quarter  Symantec generated operating cash flow of  213 million  In addition  it paid  66 million as dividend during the period GuidanceBeating its own guidance range at every point made the company optimistic about its solid prospects and therefore  it raised its fiscal 2018 revenue and non GAAP earnings outlook  For the fiscal  Symantec now expects GAAP revenues in the range of  5 037  5 137 billion  mid point  5 087 billion  and non GAAP revenues in the range of  5 160  5 260 billion  mid point  5 210 billion

privately owned DigiCert Inc  has agreed to buy its Website Security business for  950 million in cash and approximately a 30  stake in the latter s business  Symantec s Website Security solution verifies the identity of websites We believe that the recent move is an effort by Symantec to end the ongoing dispute with Alphabet s  GOOGL  Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  which has accused it for mis issuing over 30 000 of web certifications Our TakeSymantec reported mixed first quarter results  wherein the bottom line came ahead of our expectations  while the top line missed the same  However  the company has surpassed its own expectation at every point  which makes us confident that its turnaround efforts are in the right direction  Also  the impressive third quarter guidance and upbeat fiscal 2018 outlook make us optimistic about its growth opportunities Going ahead  the prospects of cybersecurity companies look bright as the recent global hackings  like WannaCry and Petya  have started to adversely affect the top  and bottom line results of various organizations like Mondelez  FedEx  NYSE FDX  and Merck  NYSE MRK    Co  The silver lining in this entire episode will be the rise in demand for security related products among companies and governments  in our opinion We believe that this could bring Symantec back into the limelight  Moreover  the recent deal to acquire Israel based Fireglass will further strengthen Symantec s leadership position in Secure Web Gateway and Email protection  both delivered on premises and in the cloud Also  investment in growth areas such as Enterprise Backup  Storage Management and Security businesses are likely to boost Symantec s long term prospects  Additionally  restructuring initiatives and synergies from acquisitions are likely to support the company s bottom line Nonetheless  smaller companies like Kaspersky are consistently launching comparable products  These  along with competition from the likes of Microsoft   NASDAQ MSFT

43781,265296,NLOK,Lost In The Fire And Fury   Promising Earnings From Shotspotter ,opinion,"As North Korean President Kim Jung Un and U S  President Donald Trump shot barbs and threats at each other   threats which included Trump s    Shotspotter Inc  NASDAQ SSTI   a gunfire detection and location technology company  reported earnings  I think the promising results were lost in the crossfire and   SSTI s first earnings results as a publicly traded company suggest this is a unique opportunity to invest into the early stages of what could be a tremendous growth trajectory 

ShotSpotter  SSTI  experienced a strong post earnings gap up  but the downtrending 20 day moving average  DMA  provided too much resistance  The stock still trades just above its IPO price of  11 
From a technical standpoint  SSTI s chart shows that the sellers currently hold the advantage over buyers  SSTI was not able to make much progress after its first day of trading  Once the stock hit a new intra day all time low on August 1st  sellers rushed in and pushed the stock as low as  9 33 before the current rebound  A post earnings gap up was met by fresh sellers who quickly filled the gap  Once SSTI can manage a new post earnings high  I will assume interest has returned  However  I am not going to wait and will start accumulating shares as soon as the coming week of trading 
SSTI is a very small company  Based in tiny Newark  CA  SSTI has a market cap of  110M and about 70 full time employees  The company s IPO on June 7  2017 raised  32 2M with 3 2 shares issued  The vast majority  95   of its revenue   5 8M in the second quarter of 2017  comes from its public safety solution which helps police departments detect  identify  locate  and respond quickly to gunfire  The revenue from its security solutions sold to six university campuses so far is minimal  the University of Alabama just went live   An innovative integration in General Electric s  GE  smart city  has generated  250K so far and depends on GE s success with its partnership with AT T  NYSE T   The following promotional video below explains how the San Francisco police department is using SSTI technology to reduce gun related homicides in the city 

SSTi s  5 8M in revenue in Q2 represented 48  year over year growth and 28  quarter over quarter growth  The revenue included a one time uptick from the development project with GE  SSTI added  1 6M in deferred revenue for a total of  17M  Of this total   13 9M is short term   Live miles  starts revenue recognition  SSTI added 45 net square miles of product coverage in Q2 on top of the existing 450 square miles  The company does not disclose backlog or bookings  SSTI gave the following revenue guidance 

 The company expects revenue for the full year 2017 to be within a range of  21 5 million and  22 5 million  revised upward from previous revenue guidance of a 35  increase over 2016 revenue  which equates to revenue of approximately  21 0 million  

SSTI is not yet profitable  The Q2 net loss of  4 3M included a  3 7M expense from a preferred stock warrant liability  The net loss represents  1 16 per share based on 3 7 million basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding and is down from last Q2 s  1 44 per share  Gross margins increased to 54  from 38  in 2016 s Q2  Gross margin was 41  in Q1 2017  SSTI is targeting a gross margin of 65   Research and Development  R D  declined as the company released R D consultants 
Going forward  R D should consume 13 to 15  of revenue  Sales and marketing was 23  of revenue  a large drop from last Q2 s 34  of revenue  SSTI expects sales and marketing to consume 21 to 24  of revenue going forward  The company added two highly experienced sales directors who are expected to help drive sales growth in the U S  The company is looking to add one sales rep each in EMEA  Europe  Middle East  and Africa  and in its South American Caribbean market by the end of Q1 2018  G A expense was 17  of revenue  The increase from last Q2 s 14  share of revenue came from the expense of operating as a public company  G A should consume 18 to 22  of revenue going forward 
Thanks to the IPO  SSTI s balance sheet looks pretty good  The company is sitting on  35 1M in cash and cash equivalents  That balance will drop by at least  13 5M after it pays down its outstanding debt  Prepayment penalties prevented SSTI from paying off the debt right after the IPO  The interest rate on this debt must be very high otherwise I am surprised SSTI is in a rush to pay it down  Normally  I would assume this kind of small company needs its free cash to help fund aggressive growth plans  SSTI expects positive operating cash flow by the end of 2017 and profitability by the second half of 2018  These will be key milestones to hit to assure investors that the company s growth potential is on track 
There were several good questions posed during the Q A session of   Here are the additional items I learned and concluded from the answers to those questions 
Seasonality  Q1 and Q3 tend to be lower than Q2 and Q4 
Product cycle  90 to 120 days from booking to a typical deployment 
GE integration  no visibility into the rollout 
Sales cycle  Hard to define  Tends to be long and complicated  Combined with normal seasonality  I interpret this reality to mean that SSTI could experience very lumpy revenues  This business dynamic will increase the odds of trigger finger stock sell offs  aka buying opportunities  when the company misses guidance from time to time  However  the relative size of the deferred revenue suggests that the company may be able to smooth the lumpiness for now  Net new miles may not be recognized for one or two quarters after sales commissions get paid on a successful booking 
So SSTI earnings provided a solid start to the company s life as a public company  Still  this is a small beginning compared to the reported opportunity  SSTI cited a total addressable market of 1600 cities worldwide and 6800 campuses  train stations  and airports for a total of  1 4B in potential annual subscription revenues  For comparison  at the end of Q1 2017  SSTI had 74 public safety customers in 89 cities and municipalities  Its system sent alerts on 80 000 gun fire incidents  The international story will soon become a focus because the the U S  has been making significant progress in the last 25 to 30 years in reducing gun violence 
The Pew Research Center provided a report two years ago titled    which included the following two telling charts about the reduction of gun violence in America 

Gun violence has dropped dramatically since the 1990s but the rate of improvement has notably slowed in recent years 
For another perspective   show that murders by any firearm have dropped from about 8 900 in 2010 and 2012 to 8 454 in 2013 and 8 124 in 2014 
Perhaps ShotSpotter implementation will be a key tool in helping the U S  close the gap with other rich countries in the Western World  The chart below  shows the tremendous gap between the U S  and other countries where the gun culture is of course not nearly as strong 
The U S  has a lot of work to do to bring gun related homicides down to the rates seen in other rich  Western countries 
Ultimately  I think ShotSpotter will be acquired by another security safety oriented company that has the global reach to take this technology to the next level  For example  if ShotSpotter is successful with General Electric  NYSE GE   I could easily see GE making the move to simplify its implementation by buying the company  Time will tell of course but the odds are in favor of SSTI    a Harvard trained Business School graduate  led his last company to an acquisition by Symantec  NASDAQ SYMC  
Be careful out there

43804,265319,NLOK,Top 3 Cybersecurity Stocks,opinion,"It seems like every day we hear about another data breach at a major company or hackers taking over websites and holding them ransom  Just last week  hackers tried to break into Parliament records in Britain  With the attacks seemingly never ending  now is a good time to look into cybersecurity stocks 
When I first started to research for this post  I was amazed at how many firms out there are battling hackers  But after doing some analysis  it became clear to what cybersecurity stocks were the best of the bunch and worth investing in 
Below you will find the top 3 cybersecurity stocks you should be investing your money in 
Top 3 Stocks You Should Own
 1  Symantec  NASDAQ SYMC 
You probably have heard of Symantec  They are the creator of Norton Anti Virus  which many individuals have running on their personal computers  In fact  Symantec is the only pure play of the cybersecurity stocks out there  This is because they do business with both individuals and businesses 
And see just how large of a footprint they have in the corporate world  Norton products are used in 70  of the global Fortune 500 companies 
Now the stock has suffered in recent years  As people shunned personal computers  Symantec took a hit to their bottom line  They tried some strategic moves that backfired  but have seemed to find their ground recently 
They first purchased LifeLock  This is an identity theft firm that for a small monthly fee  will monitor and protect users personal information 
Then they purchased BlueCoat  which offers security to networks and cloud applications 
These two additions to the bottom line will help Symantec grow  In fact  the company is holding firm on their full year outlook  When they recently reported earnings  revenue matched estimates but was an increase of 35  compared to last year  Earnings per share also met estimates  coming in at  0 28 
What is the major issue right now with Symantec  Costs  They need to start a cost cutting plan after these acquisitions so that they can increase their profit margin and really start making a lot of money  Management knows this and is starting to work on a plan  As such  now is a good time to get in 
 2  FireEye  NASDAQ FEYE 
FireEye is one of the cyberseurity stocks I had never heard of  But after learning about them  I am impressed  The company focuses on zero day attacks  To anyone not in this field  that means they find holes in security that where unknown to cybersecurity firms at the time 
Earnings per share came in at a loss of  0 09 but this beat estimates by  0 17  Revenue came in at  173 million  which beat estimates by  10 million and was an increase of 3  compared to the previous year 
The reason to like FireEye is that it is growing and more and more hackers are breaking into systems using zero day attacks  As FireEye grows its network  it will be even better equipped at finding these holes and patching them before any harm is done 
Finally  FireEye is a Department Of Homeland Security certified technology partner 
 3  Fortinet  NASDAQ FTNT 
Fortinet focuses its power to helping small  medium and large size companies protect their systems from attacks  The company offers protection in the form of anti malware  anti virus  virtual private networks  firewalls and application controls 
With the rapid pace Fortinet is signing up new clients  this is a stock you want to get into now  When they reported earnings recently  revenue was up 20  compared to last year and net income was up 410   That isn t a typo 
In fact  when it comes to earnings  Fortinet matched or beat estimates every quarter since 2014  and all signs point to this trend continuing 
The company reaffirmed guidance for the full year as well 
Final Thoughts
The threat of hackers on our computer systems is not going away  So while these cybersecurity stocks will pop when news breaks of another attack  know that these companies are good investments for the long term 
There will always be a need to protect both individual and corporate computer systems and these 3 companies are poised to be able to offer the best protection out there

43805,265320,NLOK,Top Research Reports For Eli Lilly  NVIDIA   AmEx,opinion,"Tuesday  July 11  2017
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Eli Lilly  LLY   NVIDIA  NVDA  and American Express  AXP   These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today  You can see 
Pharmaceutical stocks have been under pressure since last year on pricing and regulatory concerns and Eli Lilly shares have been no different  That said  the stock has done modestly better than the peer group  it is up  3 3  over the last 12 months vs   1 4  loss for the Zacks Pharma industry and  0 6  gain for the Zacks Medical sector as a whole 
Lilly s recent high profile pipeline setbacks are a concern for investors  But the Zacks analyst is encouraged by the fact that Lilly expects to launch 20 new products in a 10 year time frame ranging from 2014 to 2023 and could launch at least 2 new indications line extensions on average every year 
Moreover  Lilly returned to annual dividend hikes in Dec 2016 and plans to return excess cash through share buybacks  Estimates have remained stable ahead of the company s Q2 release  The company has a negative record of earnings surprises in recent quarters   You can   
Shares of Strong Buy rated NVIDIA have surged this year  gaining in excess of  191  versus the general semiconductors industry s  29  gain  The Zacks analyst likes NVIDIA s innovative product pipeline and strength in gaming and high end notebook GPUs 
NVIDIA s sustained efforts toward attaining robust position in several emerging industries such as Artificial Intelligence  AI   deep learning and driverless cars are other positives  The company s focus on GRID platforms can increase GPU adoption in data centers  giving it an advantage against its competitors   You can   
American Express shares have gained  33 8  over the last year  higher than the broader finance sector s gain of  21 1   The Zacks analyst likes its solid market position  strength in card business and significant opportunities from the secular shift toward electronic payments  Its strategic initiative focusing on platinum card portfolio and OptBlue program will drive business volume 
It is also benefiting from cost reduction efforts  and return of significant amounts of capital to shareholders through dividend and share buyback programs  However  increase in provision for losses  a strong U S  dollar  loss of Costco  NASDAQ COST  as a client and intense competition remain major near term concerns 
The company is scheduled to report second quarter results on July 19  The stock has witnessed a downward revision in earnings estimate over the past 30 days   You can   
Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include NIKE  NKE   Crown Castle  CCI  and State Street  STT

43806,265321,NLOK,Why You Should Keep An Eye On The Mobile Security Segment,opinion,"Mobile devices  the chunky things that allowed us to take a call without getting up  were such a big deal just a few years ago  But as the days go by  they seem to be getting more and more capable  all the while becoming slimmer and cooler as well  No wonder then that today  they are being snapped up by kids  oldies and pretty much everyone in between 
Considering their broad adoption and usefulness  one would have thought that there d be a ton of companies out there  taking care of security as we browse the net  shop  play  socialize  read  watch video  listen to music  or work  or any of the other stuff I forgot to mention    But that isn t the way we function it seems because most individuals are comfortable enough even without security and have limited knowledge of the consequences  So mobile security hasn t really gained momentum  even in places like the U S   where 70   of the population has a device 
Why Things Are Changing Today
The first and biggest reason is the increasing usefulness of smart devices  Because these devices are always connected  they are more accessible to viruses  unsafe sites  etc  Moreover  people increasingly use them for shopping  entertainment  to consume media  or make payments  and tend to save passwords on the device itself  This also increases the danger of identity theft  The fact that they are moveable items that can easily be stolen or misplaced makes them all the more susceptible 
So as the number of devices continues to increase  with smartphones  tablets  phablets  chromebooks  surfaces  smart watches  AR VR devices  connected dashboards  smart  home products and other IoT devices  more information gets online with greater scope for infection or attacks  IDC expects smartphone shipments to grow 4 2  in 2017 and 4 4  in 2018 with a 3 8  CAGR over the 2016 2021 time period 
Shipments are forecast to reach 1 53 billion units in 2017 and grow to 1 77 billion in 2021  Gartner expects global mobile phone shipments to grow less than a point this year and 1 6  in 2018 with the ongoing migration from feature phones to basic smartphones  especially from Chinese players  continuing 
As the personal stuff on them continues to increase  they start moving some of it to Alphabet s   NASDAQ GOOGL   or Apple s   NASDAQ AAPL    Microsoft s   NASDAQ MSFT   or Amazon s   NASDAQ AMZN   cloud  meaning that increasingly  personal information is moving on the network  from where it might be tampered with  According to the Cisco   NASDAQ CSCO   Visual Networking Index  global mobile data traffic grew 63  in 2016  of which video traffic accounted for 60   The Middle East grew 96   Asia Pacific 71   Latin America 66   Central and Eastern Europe 64   Western Europe 52  and North America 44  
It forecasts global mobile data traffic increase of 7x between 2016 and 2021  representing a 47  CAGR with nearly three quarters of all devices on the network being smart by the end of the period  The Middle East will grow strongest at a 65  CAGR  followed by Asia Pac at 49  and Latin America at 45   China traffic will outpace the U S  this year 
The digitization of banking services and online storage of healthcare information are two megatrends that also increase the risk of information loss  In fact  these two segments deal with critical information and are therefore under greater pressure from both regulators and customers to maintain a high level of security and privacy 
The virtualization of corporate workloads and bring your own device  BYOD  megatrend will completely change security as we know it  That s because hackers  ransomware  and other Internet crooks can t make as much money from individuals as they can from companies  governments and government bodies 
Moreover  organizations have more to lose than individuals in case of data breaches  i e  data  reputation  business loss from incapacitation   so they are more concerned about protection  In fact  companies like Microsoft and Google have regular hackathons to identify weaknesses in the programs they develop  So hacking has become good money 
Security Stocks That Should Be on Your Radar
Mobile security companies are still in their startup phase and it is the established players like Cisco  Symantec   NASDAQ SYMC    VMware  Microsoft  McAfee  Infineon and Dell that are gradually increasing investment in the area  Security pureplays like Check Point   NASDAQ CHKP    Fortinet  F5 Networks   NASDAQ FFIV    FireEye and Palo Alto are other stocks to watch  See how the industry did versus the S P 500 year to date 

Symantec is the only to buy right now since it has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and has been buying up mobile security companies of late  You can see

43821,265336,NLOK,Here s Why Cybersecurity Stocks  FEYE  PANW  SYMC  Are Soaring Today,opinion,"Shares of the world s largest cybersecurity companies including FireEye   NASDAQ FEYE    Palo Alto Networks   NYSE PANW    and Symantec   NASDAQ SYMC   are soaring on Monday morning thanks to a massive cyberattack that affected at least 150 countries over the weekend 
Today s gains were exacerbated by the fear that the  WannaCry  malware attack would worsen this week after people returned to their computers on Monday  Cybersecurity stocks tend to gain in response to largescale hacks because companies are more likely to bolster their protection 
Palo Alto Networks gained as much as 4 8  in morning trading hours  while fellow industry leaders FireEye and Symantec were up 8 8  and 5 3   respectively  Barracuda Networks   NYSE CUDA   was up as high as 6   Fortinet   NASDAQ FTNT   gained 5 6   and Check Point Software   NASDAQ CHKP   moved about 2 7  higher 
Overall  the PureFunds ISE Cyber Security ETF  opened with a 4 2  gain  hitting a new 52 week high in the process 
This latest attack  which started last Friday  compromised an estimated 200 000 computers around the world  The malware operates like a worm  scanning other machines within the same system for a Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT  defect that it can take advantage of 
The defect is particularly present in older Microsoft software like Windows XP and Windows Server 2003  Microsoft has discontinued support for these outdated programs  but the company did say it was working on special patches to block the attack 
The attack commenced just one day after the Trump administration announced a new executive order aimed at beefing up the nation s cybersecurity  While the order is short on actionable details  it does push for new deadlines for recommendations from experts  In fact  the plan is similar to the Obama administration s approach and is rooted in a push to the cloud

    Downward Estimate RevisionsOver the last 30 days  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal first quarter and fiscal 2018 witnessed downward revisions  For the fiscal first quarter  the Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at 11 cents per share  which is lower than earnings of 25 cents projected 30 days ago  Similarly  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 is currently pegged at  1 09 per share compared with  1 28 projected 30 days ago Bottom LineSymantec s top and bottom lines have been under pressure due to persistent weakness in PC sales  which hurt its core Norton Anti virus software business  Apart from this  intensifying competition from Palo Alto Networks   NYSE PANW   and FireEye Inc    NASDAQ FEYE   has been eroding its market share in the enterprise segment As a result  the company has been aggressively restructuring its business  In doing so  over the last one year  the company divested its non core asset   Veritas   and simultaneously acquired Blue Coat and LifeLock to enhance its capabilities in enterprise market The aforementioned acquisitions have helped it in boosting top line performance  however  the sustained decline in bottom line results remains a major concern Although  the company is on track to realize over  550 million of cost savings by the end of fiscal 2018 through its cost restructuring initiatives and synergies from the acquired businesses  we believe that these initiatives will not be enough to restrain the declining earnings Currently  Symantec carries a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  A better ranked stock in the Computer Software industry is ACI Worldwide  Inc    NASDAQ ACIW    which sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  You can see  ACI Worldwide has a long term expected EPS growth rate of 11 5  Zacks  2017 IPO Watch ListBefore looking into the stocks mentioned above  you may want to get a head start on potential tech IPOs that are popping up on Zacks  radar  Imagine being in the first wave of investors to jump on a company with almost unlimited growth potential  This Special Report gives you the current scoop on 5 that may go public at any time One has driven from 0 to a  68 billion valuation in 8 years  Four others are a little less obvious but already show jaw dropping growth ",2017-05-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-symantec-(symc)-declined-over-12-in-the-last-10-days-200190596,200190596

43853,265368,NLOK,Symantec s LifeLock Purchase Shows Proactive Approach,opinion,"Antivirus company Symantec  NASDAQ SYMC   best known for its Norton antiviral software  announced on Sunday that it would be purchasing identity protection company Lifelock Inc  NYSE LOCK  for  2 3 billion  Symantec will pay with cash and  750 million in new debt 
In a   Symantec CEO Greg Clark called LifeLock  a leading provider of identity and fraud protection services  and said that  with the combination of Norton and LifeLock  we will be able to deliver comprehensive cyber defense for consumers   However  Symantec has stated that the acquisition  which will probably close in the 2017 1Q  will not have a significant impact on its financial numbers until 2018 
Symantec will pay a premium of  24 per share for LifeLock compared to the Monday morning opening price of  20 75  The company had to make a move in response to declining anti virus computer sales  and is betting that idea focusing on identity protection and mobile over desktops is the way to go 
There are concerns about whether merging with LifeLock in particular is a good idea  given that it has been hit with fines by the FTC for false advertising failing to protect consumers  But while there are concerns about how well Symantec and LifeLock will work to protect consumers on a technological level  the idea behind the merger remains sound and investors should look to buy  Fighting Cybercriminals
Symantec s stock has risen over the past year  bolstered by surpassing earning reports in the last quarter  But despite these good financial numbers  Symantec and other cybersecurity firms are dealing with serious problems fighting cyber criminals   noted in a recent report that over 50 million Europeans were attacked by cyber criminals in the past year  whether in the form of explicit ransomware or malicious e mail links  But despite the major publicity coming from incident like the recent Democratic Party hackings  ordinary citizens are incredibly complacent about this potential threat 
One reason for this complacency is because citizens are switching away from laptops and desktops and more towards mobile devices  For some reason  many individuals are unwilling to install even basic protections that they would on their computer  seemingly confident that they will never get attacked 
These trends are problematic for Symantec  Symantec s Norton anti virus is often bundled with computers  and declining computer usage is bad for Norton and by extension Symantec  Furthermore  hackers these days are more interested in stealing information which can be used to fake your identity 
These factors mean that the idea of buying a mobile software company which focuses on protecting your tablets and computers  like LifeLock is sound  Symantec can bundle LifeLock and Norton together and then sell the two as a protection package  This would bolster Symantec s customer sales number  revenue  and allow it to adapt to a changing market  LifeLock  Image vs Reality
Symantec is betting on the LifeLock acquisition as a means to get into the mobile protection market  But the big elephant in the room is that while LifeLock may talk a lot about its commitment towards customer identity protection  its actual results are much more mixed 
As noted above  LifeLock recently was forced to settle with the FTC and pay the government  100 million in December 2015  While this would be problematic under normal circumstances  this is made even worse by the fact that LifeLock  violated the terms of a 2010 federal court order that requires the company to secure consumers  personal information and prohibits the company from deceptive advertising  
For example  former LifeLock CEO and current executive vice chairman Todd Davis would often post his own social security number in advertisements and bragged that LifeLock s security software was so good that they would not be able to use his identity even with that information  But in fact  Davis s identity was compromised  
It is possible that these concerns are in the past  Furthermore  Lifelock s revenue and membership has continued to grow and it managed to  in its most recent earnings report despite the aforementioned controversies  The fact that it can do so is a sign of the high demand for mobile anti identity theft software  something which it will be more capable of as part of Symantec  A Sensible Merger
Despite LifeLock s past struggles  the fact is that they are a major player in the mobile identity protection market  This is Symantec s weak point  which should be able to use its larger consumer base to further the appeal of LifeLock and persuade others of the importance of protecting their phones 
Symantec has been doing well as a stock over the past 12 months even as it was held back by declining anti viral sales  Acquiring LifeLock will help assuage that problem and this is a good time for investors to jump on the stock as so many have done on Monday  Whatever the technological concerns  it is rare to see a merger which fits so hand in glove ",2016-11-21,Alex Newman,https://www.investing.com/analysis/symantec’s-lifelock-purchase-shows-proactive-approach-200165916,200165916

A new lifetime high in the NASDAQ as well as the S P  That s what a trillion  with a  T   dollar infrastructure proposal from Congress did  And  after all  it s easy to conjure up the money  since we re already  20 trillion in debt  why not pile on another trillion  Hell  that s only 5  more debt 
 As a side note  I can assure you that throwing a trillion dollars at  infrastructure  for make work projects and bridges to nowhere is going to be every bit a ringing success as the  here in California  which will never get finished  but only after costing billions more than pledged  
So anyway  I don t like doing this  but I d feel awkward otherwise    so here are some interesting long term bullish patterns amongst equities

43857,265372,NLOK,Earnings  5 Stocks To Watch On Wednesday,opinion,"Facebook  NASDAQ FB 
Advertising remains the company s biggest source of revenue since going public at the turn of the decade  In the third quarter  ad revenue jumped from  4 3 billion to  6 82 billion  marking a 60  change on a year over year basis  Much of the increase came on the back of a nearly 80  increase in mobile advertising  driven by 20  growth in Mobile DAUs and MAUs  As of September  1 79 billion users visited the Facebook platform on a monthly basis  In separate reports Facebook also indicated 1 billion monthly active users on Messenger and WhatsApp and 600 million on Instagram 
By opening up advertising revenue for the three other platforms  investors believe Facebook can add to its already robust top line  eMarketer estimates that ad revenue on Instagram could add  3 6 billion to total revenue by the end of 2017  Instagram s new stories  which essentially mimics SnapChat  should offset the growing threat that SnapChat poses in the social media space  In only 5 months since launch  initial report claim that 150 people use Instagram stories on a daily basis 
Facebook also started testing out a news feed style streams to Messenger s 1 billion users  Additional efforts to monetize videos on the core Facebook platforms already appear to be doing well  The quick cooking videos that became popular during the quarter will help drive user growth and engagement moving forward 
As always  Facebook faces the serious threat of a slowdown  Any signs of weakness will surely hammer the stock in the coming days  Meanwhile  SnapChat s IPO in the coming month and an unlikely Twitter  NYSE TWTR  turnaround might pose a problem for Facebook down the road  Facebook must also continue to address the idea of fake news and harassment that arose in the days following the recent election 
Best Buy  NYSE BBY 
Like many of its peers  Best Buy became one of Amazon s  NASDAQ AMZN  many victims on its path to the top  Consumers used Best Buy as a showroom for a purchase that ended up being made on Amazon  thereby causing financial performance to free fall in recent years  Despite a bleak looking future  Best Buy instilled new confidence in investors following two consecutive earnings reports  The company s 5 point Renew Blue program achieved remarkable success over this time  It includes strengthening vendor relationships  renovating stores  eliminating unnecessary costs  increasing same store sales and ramping up Best Buy s online business  Best Buy also uses deep discounts to compete with retail giants like Amazon and Wal Mart  NYSE WMT   While many of these initiatives provide some near term support that investors love  the long term sustainability remains unclear 
NXP Semiconductors  NASDAQ NXPI 
Chipmakers that support high growth markets made some of the biggest gains in 2016  One of those being NXPI Semiconductors  which through the acquisition of Freescale Semiconductor became the largest automotive solutions provider  surpassing Wall Street favorites like NVIDIA  NASDAQ NVDA   But more importantly  the company agreed to a sale to Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM  for a mere  47 billion  That deal now appears in limbo thanks to President Trump s hardened stance on both China and massive mergers  Any insight on the deal during the call will impact how investors react tomorrow afternoon  Nonetheless  strong adoption rates for mobile products and the emergence of wearables provides layer of support to the top line 
Cirrus Logic  NASDAQ CRUS 
Cirrus has the most to lose from weak iPhone sales  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  is hands down the company s largest customer  accounting for nearly two third of the company s revenue as of the last report  That figure dropped considerably from previous quarters when it was closer to 80 percent  Cirrus maintains its commitment to diversifying its product portfolio and client base by investing in the audio segment and making acquisitions

43858,265373,NLOK,ETF Watch  It s All About Cyber Security,opinion,"Personally  I don t fear a nuclear attack 
Despite all the scripted drama and political rhetoric over a terrorist group getting its hands on a nuclear device  the reality is nukes are cost prohibitive  even for the most well heeled groups 
Remember  Saddam Hussein tried to develop them and failed 
North Korea has dumped billions into successfully producing a nuclear device    and that s basically at slave labor costs  But it took decades to build  and the country still can t fit it on a missile 
Sure  I ll be entertained by a show or movies about a terrorist organization trying to steal a nuke or buy one    But the immense costs of attaining one make it a less likely reality 
A cyberattack though    that s much more reasonably priced    and getting cheaper by the day  In this article  we ll examine what that means for you and look at some steps you can take to protect yourself    and potentially profit from the threat 
Even Toasters And Teddy Bears Aren t Safe
One of my top investment trends this year is the  Internet of Things   IoT  and artificial intelligence 
These disruptive trends are changing the world    for better or for worse  And they ll impact every single one of our lives  In fact  they already have 
They ll also continue to provide investors opportunities to score big gains 
There are already more than 6 billion devices  excluding smartphones  computers or tablets  connected to the internet  These  smart  things include refrigerators  televisions  security cameras  toothbrushes  toys  etc 
By 2020  the number of devices connected to the internet is expected to swell to more than 20 billion  according to the consulting firm Gartner 
These things are designed to make our lives easier   for example  a refrigerator that knows you re out of milk or eggs and is programmed to order more from an online grocer 
But of course  there s a problem with all of this 
The more devices connected to the internet  the more opportunities there are for hackers to break in  Not matter how much you trust it  your fridge will give up your Gmail account password    and possibly more 
That means there is a greater need for cybersecurity 
Just think about how much disruption was caused by the outage at Amazon s  NASDAQ AMZN  Web Services unit last week  which shut down the cloud computing platform that powers sites like Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX   Tinder  Airbnb and Reddit for several hours 
And that incident was the result of a  fat finger  human error  not a cyberattack where the trends are really troubling  According to DMR  a digital marketing resource 
Last year  51  of U S  adults suffered some sort of security incident  And globally  the number of data security breaches rose 40  
From 2013 to 2015  the cost of cybercrime quadrupled  And it s expected to quadruple from 2015 to 2019 and reach  2 1 trillion 
In just one attack last October  1 5 million connected cameras and DVRs were used to take down the website of a cybersecurity journalist 
That same month  sites like Twitter  NYSE TWTR   Amazon  Spotify and Airbnb were taken down by a massive  distributed denial of service   DDoS  attack  This attack was launched using tens of millions of CCTV cameras  webcams  DVRs and other internet connected devices 
And just this week  WikiLeaks released documents suggesting the CIA wanted to turn smart TVs into remote surveillance devices 
If that isn t scary enough  even teddy bears aren t safe 
In February  Spiral Toys said that its internet connected teddy bears were hacked  More than 800 000 customer credentials and more than 2 million message recordings were exposed 
And there s a dire prediction from LogRhythm that in 2017  the internet will go dark for an entire 24 hour span because of an attack 
To show how vulnerable everyone is  there was a great experiment in The Atlantic last year by Andrew McGill 
He connected a toaster to the internet and wanted to see how quickly it would be hacked 
Security experts believed the first attack might happen in a week    at the quickest  maybe a day  And possibly never 
The first attack on McGill s toaster happened 41 minutes after being connected to the internet  The second was 14 minutes later  And then another three minutes after that  That s three attacks in the first hour 
And from 1 12 p m  to 11 59 p m   more than 300 IP addresses tried to attack McGill s toaster 
Defense Is the Best Offense
I believe cyberdefense spending should be our nation s top priority 
It won t be  But as investors  we can make it one of ours 
So far in 2017  the PureFunds ISE Cyber Security ETF  NYSE HACK  has outperformed the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S P 500 

The ETF is made up of companies like Fortinet  NASDAQ FTNT   Symantec  NASDAQ SYMC   Check Point Software  NASDAQ CHKP   Splunk  NASDAQ SPLK  and Qualys  NASDAQ QLYS   as well as others 
And there are companies like NetScout s  NASDAQ NTCT  Arbor Networks division that specialize in preventing DDoS attacks  which are on the rise 
Part of this is everyone must stop thinking that hackers are loners sitting in rooms furiously plucking away at code  That s such an outdated view  Hackers now lead botnet armies that are for rent 
Just as everything else has been automated    so has hacking 
There are robot hordes programmed to travel from one end of the internet to the other  tapping on everything along the way  looking for vulnerabilities 
That s why breaches are increasing at the rates they are 
You re Part Of The Problem
In one of my favorite movies  and arguably Mel Brooks  best   Spaceballs  we learn a very important lesson about security 
Planet Druidia s King Roland finally relents to the evil Dark Helmet s demands  and he gives up the combination to the air shield    1  2  3  4  5 
Dark Helmet famously responds   So  the combination is 1  2  3  4  5    That s the stupidest combination I ve ever heard in my life  That s the kind of thing an idiot would have on his luggage  
The frustrating thing is that most people are just as stupid  The most common password in 2016 
 123456  
Nearly one in five people   or 17    have set that as their password  according to password management company Keeper Security 
In fact  there s a list of the 25 most common passwords  and they account for 50  of all users  passwords  The third most common is  qwerty  with the actual word  password  ranking No  8 
In the attack on the security journalist s website  most of the devices had the passwords  1234  or  password  
In the attacks on McGill s toaster  many of the attempts used the password  xc3511   That s the factory default password for a webcam  And those were the same webcams used in the DDoS attack in October of last year 
Even worse  Spiral Toys  CloudPets collected information in a database that wasn t behind a firewall or password protected 
You can use a password manager to protect yourself  but the easiest thing to remember is this  When it comes to passwords  size does matter  The longer the better  It s also helpful to mix numbers and special characters into your passwords  like using the number 1 for  i  or   for  s  for example  And  obviously  if your password is one of the top 25 most common  you want to change it right away 
There s an old saying     The internet wasn t built with security in mind   And it wasn t  In the early days  there was a published directory of all the people on the internet  In the beginning  it was a very small community  and no one concerned themselves with security because everyone knew each other 
And violators would be ostracized or excluded 
The internet is now ingrained in everything  It s an integral part of our lives  our businesses  our government and our world  Cybersecurity must be the No  1 priority for defense  But each of us must make sure we re not the weakest link in the chain as well

43862,265377,NLOK,Symantec  SYMC  Down On Q4 Earnings Miss And Tepid View,opinion,Shares of Symantec Corporation   NASDAQ SYMC   plunged in yesterday s after hour trade after the company reported dismal fourth quarter fiscal 2017 results  wherein the company s top and bottom lines  both fell short of our estimates  Moreover  lower than expected revenue guidance for the June quarter adds concerns to the company s long term prospects The company s adjusted earnings  excluding deferred revenues fair value  amortization  restructuring and other one time items but including stock based compensation  of 5 cents per share came significantly lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 20 cents  On a year over year basis also  the figure plummeted 68 8  mainly due to higher operating expenses Due to overall tepid performance and poor first quarter fiscal 2018 revenue outlook  shares of Symantec fell over 7  in yesterday s after hour trade  Nonetheless  the stock has outperformed the Zacks categorized  industry in the year to date period  Symantec s shares gained 38 7  in the said period  while the industry s gain was just 15 9  However  on a non GAAP basis  Symantec s earnings came in at 28 cents per share  which was at the mid point of its own guidance range of 27 29 cents  but also marked a year over year increase of 27 3  Quarter in DetailSymantec s revenues of  1 115 billion jumped 27 7  year over year  mainly driven by strong performance at the company s Enterprise Security segment  as well as benefit from the acquisitions of Blue Coat and LifeLock businesses  However  the figure fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 165 billion Excluding the benefit of LifeLock acquisition  the company s revenues came in at  1 076 billion  which was below the mid point of its guidance of  1 070  1 090 billion  mid point   1 080 billion   Notably  Symantec s guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter provided on Feb 1 did not include the contribution from the LifeLock acquisition which was completed on Feb 9  LifeLock contributed  100 million to the company s total revenue Segment wise  the Consumer Security division witnessed a 21  year over year increase in non GAAP revenues  while non GAAP revenues at Enterprise Security surged 49  on a year over year basis Symantec s adjusted gross profit of  910 million was up 24 3   primarily attributable to a higher revenue base  However  as a percentage of revenues  gross margin contracted 220 basis points  bps  on a year over year basis to 81 6   as the benefit of increased sales was more than offset by higher cost of goods sold Furthermore  adjusted operating income slumped 74 1  year over year to  44 million  as the benefits from increased revenues were more than offset by higher cost of goods sold and a 54 1  jump in adjusted operating expenses  Consequently  adjusted operating margin declined to 3 9  from 19 5  in the year ago quarter On a non GAAP basis  operating income grew 47  year over year to  314 million  while margin improved 220 bps to 26 7   However  non GAAP operating margin was lower than the company s guidance range of 27 28  As per Symantec  it remains on track to realize over  550 million of cost savings by the end of fiscal 2018 through its cost restructuring initiatives and synergies from the recently acquired businesses  Blue Coat and LifeLock  Till fiscal

Intel Corporation  NASDAQ INTC    Semiconductors  Intel shares have edged down after the company gave slightly disappointing guidance  despite reporting an earnings beat this past week  The chipmaker said it expects  15 7 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter against analyst s forecast of  15 87 billion in revenue  Shares are now down 7  in the past 5 days and are showing signs of making further losses  It started with a bearish crossover in the MACD in early October that was aggravated by the third quarter report  Share prices are currently below the 20  and 50 day moving average as it approaches the longer term 200 day average  Its volume profile for the year indicates that the stock is more consistently priced near  32  about  3 below where its trading today 
eBay Inc   NASDAQ EBAY    Ecommerce  The online marketplace plunged in the rankings this week after management issued a weak Q4 outlook following its recent earnings report  Average user ranks dropped from 5 2 to 6 59 this week on weak guidance and in anticipation of further declines  This is now the third lowest ranked company just ahead of Ctrip and Groupon  NASDAQ GRPN   Shortly following its report we saw a massive selloff that spurred a bearish crossover in its 20 and 50 day moving average and also the MACD  The stock s one year volume profile is consistent with a  24 price point  nearly  5 below its current trading price  Beyond technicals  eBay is still fundamentally challenged  Growth remains threatened by heavy competition  particularly the growing dominance of online retailer Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  
Zendesk Inc   NYSE ZEN    Small Enterprise Software  Zendesk s freefall started almost 2 weeks ago and has yet to taper  Shares are down almost 11  in the past 30 days as many of its technicals edge down  Current share prices are well below its 20  and 50 day averages as it pushes toward the long term average  Forcerank users have maintained pessimism this month  continually pushing the stock down the ranks each week  Zendesk is now the worst ranked stock in the small enterprise software contest  below perennial losers in Box  NYSE BOX  and Tableau  NYSE DATA

43901,265416,NLOK,Symantec  SYMC  Earnings In Line With Estimates In Q2,opinion,Symantec Corporation   NASDAQ SYMC   reported modest second quarter fiscal 2017 results wherein its revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate while its adjusted earnings  excluding deferred revenues fair value  amortization  restructuring and other one time items but including stock based compensation  matched the same  The company s adjusted earnings came in at 15 cents per share Quarter in DetailSymantec s revenues of  979 million increased 8 1  year over year and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  966 million  Moreover  quarterly revenues were above the mid point of the company s guidance range of  960 million to  990 million  mid point   975 million   The robust top line growth was mainly driven by strong performance at the company s Enterprise Security segment Furthermore  adjusted for deferred revenues fair value  revenues were  1 015 billion compared with  906 million in the year ago quarter Segment wise  the Consumer Security division witnessed a 4  year over year decline in revenues  while revenues at Enterprise Security increased 18  on a year over year basis  Moreover  adjusted for deferred revenues fair value  Enterprise Security revenues surged 26  Symantec s adjusted gross profit of  851 million was up 11 5   primarily due to a higher revenue base and lower cost of goods sold  Consequently  as a percentage of revenues  gross margin improved 270 basis points  bps  on a year over year basis to 86 9  However  adjusted operating income declined 11 3  year over year to  211 million due to higher adjusted operating expenses  Consequently  adjusted operating margin contracted 470 bps year over year to 21 6  On a non GAAP basis  operating income grew 5  year over year to  296 million while margin contracted 200 bps to 29 2   However  non GAAP operating margin was 520 bps higher than the upper end of the guided range of 21  to 24  The better than expected margin was mainly driven by strong top line growth and realization of cost savings ahead of time  As per Symantec  it realized  100 million of cost savings through its cost restructuring initiatives and synergies from the newly acquired business  Blue Coat Adjusted net income for the quarter came in at  98 7 million or 15 cents per share compared with  160 8 million or 23 cents  The year over year decline was mainly due to higher operating expenses  which were partially offset by increased revenues and gross profit However  on non GAAP basis  the company posted earnings of 30 cents per share which was a penny higher than the year ago quarter and also came in better than the guided range of 18 cents to 21 cents SYMANTEC CORP Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Balance Sheet   Cash FlowSymantec exited the quarter with cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of  5 619 billion  compared with  6 118 billion last quarter  Long term debt was  6 576 billion  up from  2 605 billion in the previous quarter During the first half of 2016  Symantec used operating cash flow of  717 million  Moreover  it paid  120 million as dividend during the period GuidanceThe company reiterated its non GAAP revenues guidance but raised non GAAP operating margin and earnings per share outlook for fiscal 2017  For fiscal 2017  Symantec still expects revenues in the range of  4 040 billion to  4 120 billion  mid point  4 08 billion   The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at  4 08 billion Non GAAP operating margin is now anticipated in the range of 27  to 29   previously 26  28    Non GAAP earnings per share are now expected to be  1 12 to  1 18  previously  1 08 to  1 14  For the third quarter of fiscal 2017  Symantec expects non GAAP revenues in the range of  1 070 billion to  1 090 billion  mid point   1 080 billion   The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at  1 11 billion Non GAAP operating margin is projected in the range of 27  28   Management expects non GAAP earnings per share of 27 cents to 29 cents Blue Coat AcquisitionDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2017  Symantec completed the acquisition of Blue Coat  Inc   a leading web security solution provider  from private equity firm Bain Capital Symantec and Blue Coat had entered into a definitive agreement in June this year  per which Symantec paid a cash consideration of  4 65 billion for the acquisition The addition of Blue Coat is expected to enhance Symantec s capabilities significantly  As per Symantec  the acquisition will not only provide economies of scale and bolster its existing portfolio  but will also provide necessary resources to develop solutions to  protect large customers and individual consumers against insider threats and sophisticated cybercriminals  The transaction is anticipated to help Symantec realize approximately  150 million of cost synergies by the end of fiscal 2018  This will be in addition to cost savings of  400 million under its previously announced cost efficiency program  Hence  the total planned cost savings and synergies aggregate to  550 million Our TakeSymantec reported modest second quarter results wherein its top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the bottom line came in line with the same  We are encouraged by the company s overall performance as it exceeded the guidance on all metrics According to Thomas Seifert  Symantec CFO   Our Q2 results exceeded guidance on all metrics including both our Consumer Security and Enterprise Security segments  and we have realized more than  100 million of our planned  550 million cost savings and synergies  With the notable progress we re making in improving our cost structure and integrating Blue Coat  we are on track to achieve the cost efficiencies and synergies to which we guided by the end of fiscal year 2018 while maintaining a strong investment in our product road map and R D  Moreover  Symantec s guidance for the full year as well as third quarter were encouraging wherein it expects strong revenue and margin improvements  However  revenue expectation for the third quarter was below the Zacks Consensus Estimate Going ahead  investment in growth areas such as Enterprise Backup  Storage Management and Security businesses are expected to boost Symantec s long term prospects  Moreover  restructuring initiatives and synergies from acquisitions are expected to support its bottom line However  smaller companies like Kaspersky are consistently launching comparable products  These  along with competition from the likes of Intel   NASDAQ INTC   and

43904,265419,NLOK,Symantec Confirms Buying ID Protector LifeLock For  2 3B,opinion,The week long speculation is finally over as cybersecurity firm Symantec Corporation   NASDAQ SYMC   confirmed yesterday that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Arizona based LifeLock Inc    NYSE LOCK    The transaction is anticipated to close in the first calendar quarter of 2017  subject to customary closing conditions The offer is valued at  24 a share or  2 3 billion in enterprise value which Symantec will pay fully in cash  The acquisition will be funded partly with available cash and partly with a new debt of  750 million Citi and J P  Morgan Securities  LLC are acting as co lead financial advisors for Symantec while Goldman Sachs Group Inc    NYSE GS   has been hired by LifeLock as the financial advisor With this  the company has outbid other players like TPG Capital  Permira and Elliott Management Corp  that participated in the bidding race  Financial data provider Bloomberg was the first to break the news on Nov 11  when it revealed that LifeLock is in talks with several parties and TPG Capital is one of them Following the Nov 11 Bloomberg report  shares of LifeLock gained 17 6   At last Friday s closing price of  20 75  the offer price is valued at a premium of approximately 15 7  LIFELOCK INC Price   About LifeLockFounded in 2005 by Robert J  Maynard and Todd Davis  LifeLock offers identity theft protection services primarily in the United States  The company got itself listed in 2012 and currently has over 4 4 million customers  In June  Elliott Management Corp  unveiled that it owns an 11  stake in the company The company  under its consumer segment  protects subscribers through monitoring identity related events  such as new account openings and credit related applications  Under the enterprise segment  it protects customers by delivering on demand identity risk and authentication information about consumers Its customers include financial institutions  telecommunication and cable services providers  government agencies  technology companies  large retailers  automobile and mortgage lenders  and e commerce providers Deal Makes SenseIn our opinion  the acquisition will be a strategic fit for Symantec  which is trying hard to expand its business in the high growth area of next generation cybersecurity  The acquisition will help Symantec enhance its capabilities in identity protection which is currently a huge concern for almost every sector  be it financials  retail or technology Per Symantec  over 650 million people worldwide  including one third of American citizens  were victims of cybercrime last year  The company also revealed that the digital safety market is anticipated to be approximately  10 billion while in the United States alone the total addressable market is projected to include 80 million people Therefore  we believe that the acquisition will enhance Symantec s capabilities in identifying theft protection solutions  thereby enabling it to capitalize the growing opportunities in the space Apart from this  the acquisition will broaden Symantec s customer base  The company has an existing customer base of over 65 million  Therefore  we believe that the buyout will not only enhance the value of Symantec s identity management platform but will also be accretive to its top  and bottom line results  Symantec expects the acquisition to be accretive to its non GAAP earnings per share in fiscal 2019 Per the company press release   Symantec s acquisition of LifeLock brings together the  1 leader in consumer security with a leading provider of identity protection and remediation services  The combination will create the world s largest consumer security business with over  2 3 billion in annual revenue based on last fiscal year revenues for both companies  Bottom LineOf late  Symantec s top and bottom lines have been under pressure due to persistent weakness in PC sales and loss of market share in the data storage segment to other rivals  Additionally  intensifying competition from Palo Alto Networks and FireEye has been eroding its market share in the enterprise segment As a result  the company has been aggressively restructuring its business  In doing so  on Jan 29  the company closed the sale of its Veritas business for  7 4 billion to Carlyle Group  NASDAQ CG   We believe that the deal has provided Symantec with the much needed funds to invest in fast growing markets The sale of the Veritas business provided Symantec with the financial flexibility to take the acquisition route to transform its struggling business  In August  the company completed the acquisition of Blue Coat  a leading web security solution provider  from private equity firm Bain Capital for a total cash consideration of  4 65 billion  Blue Coat s security solutions allow organizations to protect their web gateways from cyber attacks We believe that these acquisitions will enable Symantec to strengthen its position in the enterprise security market SYMANTEC CORP Price   Currently  Symantec carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  A better ranked stock in the broader technology sector is

43939,265454,NLOK,Here s Why FireEye  FEYE  Stock Is Soaring Today,opinion,"Shares of network security company FireEye   NASDAQ FEYE   are up nearly 11 5  on Thursday after new speculation about a possible takeover  as well as the widely publicized DNC hacks bringing cybersecurity into the national spotlight once again 
FireEye has been the subject of takeover rumors for some time now  and although there doesn t seem to be any new reports right now  today s price action has investors talking once again  At Wednesday s closing price of  16 49  shares were down over 83  from an all time high of  97 35 reached in March of 2014 
According to a Bloomberg report from June  FireEye has recently rebuffed two separate buyout offers  including one from Symantec Corp    NASDAQ SYMC    Despite shares trading near their 52 week low of  11 35  FireEye apparently felt that both offers were too low  Symantec would later go on to boost its cybersecurity suite by purchasing Blue Coat Inc  for  4 65 billion 
As Symantec s purchase of Blue Coat shows  companies are looking to add to their cybersecurity portfolios for the right price  With FireEye s market cap taking such a hit over the last two years  it comes as no surprise that the company would be one of the biggest takeover targets in the industry 
Moreover  FireEye and other cybersecurity companies tend to trade higher when there are national cybersecurity scandals  The public tends to be surprised when major organizations get hacked  and that puts the spotlight on companies like FireEye and the services that prevent these hacks 
The  hack of the week  centers on the Democratic National Committee  DNC   which is currently the subject of a massive email leak that shows coordination between top DNC officials and the Clinton campaign  Long story short  political parties are typically supposed to remain neutral during the primaries  and that didn t happen 
The reason cybersecurity stocks sometimes benefit from these scandals is the chain reaction that can often come from them  If I m an executive at a major organization or company without a strong security plan  I m a little bit worried that something as big as the Democratic Party is vulnerable to a hack 
In reality  hacks happen all the time  Federal agencies and important individuals are always the targets of attacks  and you have to be prepared before you become the victim  The cost of solid protection is much less than the costs associated with a massive hack  and that s where companies like FireEye get their business ",2016-07-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/here's-why-fireeye-(feye)-stock-is-soaring-today-200144802,200144802

43942,265457,NLOK,These 2 Stocks Prove The Future Is Bright For Cybersecurity Investors,opinion,"Last February  a hospital was held hostage 
No one was killed  Nary a shot was fired  The hijacker didn t even go inside the building 
From the comfort of his home  he locked down the hospital s computer systems with a few key strokes   
And demanded a  17 000  ransom  
He got it  too  The hospital was left with no other choice  It paid the hacker in bitcoin  the anonymous cryptocurrency 
It s a frightening reminder of the    not just in the U S   but worldwide 
Today  we ll look at two of the globe s leading cybersecurity companies  As they expand their services  shareholders will profit from their war on cyberterrorism 
An Industry Giant
Hackers are constantly making newer  deadlier viruses  Customers  understandably  want software that can protect them from all angles 
Fortinet Inc   Nasdaq  FTNT  has a hand in every pot  Computers  cell phones  tablets    you name it 
In 2008  it  a malicious bug in the form of Facebook s  Secret Crush  app  Three million people fell victim to the scam prior to Fortinet exposing it 
Since then  the company s CEO  Ken Xie  has formed a partnership with competitors to help each other stay aware of the latest bugs  The group is called the Cyber Threat Alliance  The fellowship includes Fortinet Inc  NASDAQ FTNT   Symantec  Nasdaq  NASDAQ SYMC   McAfee and Palo Alto Networks Inc  NYSE PANW  
It goes to show Fortinet s devotion to finding solutions   and pleasing buyers 
According to the latest numbers  customers are very pleased  Fortinet s second quarter earnings report showed a revenue of  311 4 million  That s up 30  year over year 
Year to date  shares are up more than 15  

Within the cybersecurity sector  Fortinet is a fairly safe play  It s well established  and analysts are bullish about its future 
Our next company is a slightly different story  But it could generate some wild gains   

An Underdog With a Secret Weapon
As you can see below  shares of MGT Capital Investments Inc  NYSE MGT  have skyrocketed in 2016 

Year to date  the stock has shot up 1 492  
A big reason for this surge is MGT s announcement of its new CEO  John McAfee 
McAfee is perhaps the only household name in the cybersecurity game  Having developed the first anti virus program in 1987  McAfee is a pioneer 
Industry insiders are curious to see what innovations he ll bring to MGT

43977,265492,NLOK,Imperva By The Numbers,opinion,"When the   the results can be ugly  After falling over 20  on May 6  2016  this week s Danger Zone pick has since rebounded and might have investors thinking now is the time to buy  Unfortunately  the fundamentals of this company reveal a different story  Growing losses  misleading non GAAP metrics  and significant competition land Imperva  NYSE IMPV  in the Danger Zone this week 
Businesses Don t Succeed Because of Revenue Growth
Like many newer technology companies  Imperva impressed investors with robust revenue growth despite increasing profit losses  From 2011 2015  Imperva has grown revenue by 31  compounded annually while Imperva s   the true cash flows of the business  declined from   13 million in 2011 to   83 million over the last twelve months  Figure 1 highlights the discrepancy between revenue and economic earnings  See the reconciliation of Imperva s GAAP net income to economic earnings  

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings
In addition to negative economic earnings  Imperva s return on invested capital  ROIC  has been negative each year since IPO and is currently a bottom quintile  18   Not surprisingly  Imperva is burning through cash  losing a cumulative   416 million in free cash flow from 2011 2015 
Non GAAP Earnings Create A False Picture
As is increasingly well known  non GAAP earnings are not a reliable indicator of a company s operations  Here are the expenses IMPV removes to calculate its non GAAP metrics  including non GAAP operating income and non GAAP net income 
Stock based compensation expense
Acquisition related expense
Amortization of purchased intangibles
By removing these costs  Imperva paints a wildly different view of its business compared to the true economics  For example  since 2011  Imperva s non GAAP net income has improved from   8 million to  3 million in 2015  Meanwhile  Imperva s GAAP net income has fallen from   10 million in 2011 to   49 million in 2015  Economic earnings have declined even further  from   13 million in 2011 to   68 million in 2015  See Figure 2 

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings
The main driver behind higher non GAAP results is exclusion of Imperva s heavy use of stock based compensation  In 2015  Imperva removed  51 million  22  of revenue  in stock based compensation expense to calculate non GAAP net income  2014 was more of the same  as the company removed  37 million  23  of revenue  in stock based compensation expense to calculate non GAAP net income  Stock compensation is a real cost of doing business and should not be excluded when calculating net income 
Negative Profitability Creates Competitive Disadvantages
Imperva operates across multiple segments of the cyber security industry and faces significant competition across its business lines  IBM  NYSE IBM   Intel  NASDAQ INTC  Security Group  formerly McAfee and now owned by Intel  INTC   and Oracle  NYSE ORCL  operate in database security  EMC Corp  NYSE EMC  and Symantec Corp  NASDAQ SYMC  operate in file security  Lastly  Akamai Technologies  NASDAQ AKAM  and F5 Networks  NASDAQ FFIV  operate in web application security  Imperva identifies each of these firms as direct competition  and each of them is significantly more profitable in regards to ROIC and NOPAT margin  per Figure 3 

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings 
Bull Hopes Ignore Reality  Acquisition Risk To Bear Case
IMPV saw its price soar through much of 2015  Many high profile cyber attacks pushed the entire industry higher  including peers such as Palo Alto Networks  NYSE PANW  or Fortinet  NASDAQ FTNT   which saw similar increases in stock price  Now that the hysteria has died down  the fundamental case for Imperva looks rather weak  Much of the bull case rests on Imperva s continued ability to grow its revenue without regard to profits  It is hard to see how Imperva will grow profits given how poor its margins are and how strong its competition is 
Particularly troubling for bull arguments is the pace at which Imperva s costs are rising  Research   development costs  sales   marketing costs  and general   administrative costs grew by 32   34   and 38  compounded annually from 2011 2015   all of which are higher than Imperva s 31  revenue CAGR over this same time 
Further undermining the bull case  the stock is already priced for perfection  The current stock valuation implies that Imperva will grow revenues at a significantly faster pace than the industry average and make major market share gains  For reference  the cyber security market is expected to grow by 10  compounded annually from 2015 2020  yet IMPV s current valuation implies the company can grow revenues by 30  compounded annually for well over a decade  We ll highlight Imperva s overvaluation in greater detail below 
The biggest risk to our thesis is that a larger competitor or firm looking to grow its security business acquires Imperva at a value at or above today s price  As we ll show below  unless a competitor is willing to destroy shareholder value  an acquisition at current prices would be ill advised 
Acquisition Hopes Rest on A Buyer Wiling To Overpay
We don t think Imperva is an attractive acquisition target at its current price  To begin  IMPV has liabilities that investors may not be aware of that make it more expensive than the accounting numbers suggest 
 35 million in outstanding employee stock options  3  of market cap 
 27 million in off balance sheet operating leases  2  of market cap 
After adjusting for these liabilities we can model multiple purchase price scenarios  Unfortunately for investors  only in the most optimistic of scenarios is IMPV worth more than the current share price 
Figures 4 and 5 show what we think Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT  should pay for IMPV to ensure the deal is truly accretive to MSFT s shareholder value  Microsoft could be a potential acquirer of Imperva to bolster cloud security and was once named as a possible acquirer back in 2014  We think Microsoft has limits on how much it will pay for IMPV to earn a proper return  given the NOPAT or cash flows being acquired 
Each implied price is based on a  goal ROIC  assuming different levels of revenue growth  In each scenario  we conservatively assume that Microsoft can grow Imperva s revenue and NOPAT without spending on working capital or fixed assets  We also assume Imperva achieves a 10  NOPAT margin  similar to competitors EMC and SYMC  Imperva s current TTM NOPAT margin is  20  

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings  
Figure 4 shows the  goal ROIC  for MSFT as its weighted average cost of capital  WACC  or 8   Only if IMPV can grow revenue over 35  each year for the next five years while also raising its NOPAT margin from  20  to 10  is the firm worth more than its current price of  39 share  For reference  consensus estimates expect Imperva to grow revenue by 30  in 2016 and 24  in 2017  We include this scenario to provide a best case view  Note that any deal that only achieves an 8  ROIC would be only value neutral and not accretive  as the return on the deal would equal MSFT s WACC 

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings  
Figure 5 shows the next  goal ROIC  of 30   which is Microsoft s current ROIC  Acquisitions completed at these prices would be truly accretive to MSFT shareholders  Even in the best case growth scenario  the most MSFT should pay for IMPV is  9 share  77  downside   Management teams should be held accountable for capital allocation decisions that hurt investors  Any deal above  9 share would lower MSFT s ROIC 
Without A Takeover  Growth Expectations Remain Overly Optimistic
Barring acquisition  to justify its current stock price of  39 share  IMPV must immediately achieve positive NOPAT margins of 1   compared to  20  over the last twelve months  and grow revenue by 30  compounded annually for 23 years 
Even if we assume Imperva can achieve 5  NOPAT margins  well above current margins but below entrenched competitors  the stock is still overvalued  If IMPV can achieve 5  NOPAT margins and grow revenue by 30  compounded annually for the next decade  the stock is worth only  27 share today    a 31  downside  Each of these scenarios also assumes the company is able to grow revenue without spending on working capital or fixed assets  an assumption that is unlikely  but allows us to create a truly best case scenario 
Catalyst  Unmet Expectations Will Sink Shares
As noted earlier  IMPV fell over 20  when the company issued revenue guidance that came in below consensus estimates  However  the stock has already rebounded 15   despite no change in company operations  This pickup in momentum could be setting up investors for another disappointment 
The lowered guidance should concern investors  especially since it s the second consecutive quarter where guidance has come in on the low end  or even below  consensus expectations  IMPV is a stock that is built on revenue growth  When the revenue growth slows  the poor underlying fundamentals will have no where to hide  Moving forward  look for a slowdown in revenue growth  as competition creeps in on IMPV s business  At that point  investors will realize that growing revenue at all costs is not a sustainable business model 
Additionally  the waning  love for all things cyber security  represents a trend that could put pressure on IMPV  The stock initially ran up in price as the cyber security industry was pushed to the forefront of investors  minds  However  as the exuberance wears off  investor perceptions will readjust  fundamentals will matter again  and the firms that are generating a decent return on invested capital will be the beneficiaries  Unfortunately  IMPV is not such a firm  and its share price could adjust accordingly at the first sign of trouble 
Insider Sales and Short Interest Remains Low
Over the past 12 months five thousand shares have been purchased and 606 thousand have been sold for a net effect of 601 thousand insider shares sold  These purchases represent 2  of shares outstanding  Additionally  there are 1 9 million shares sold short  or just over 6  of shares outstanding 
Executives Are Incentivized To Ignore Profits
Apart from base salaries  executives at Imperva receive cash bonuses  paid quarterly  for reaching specific revenue targets  The revenue growth targets must be met  provided the goal is achieved cost effectively   However  we question what Imperva deems  cost effective   In each quarter of 2015  executives received the max bonus available  despite operating expenses being higher than the operating plan target  Creating further concern  the compensation committee states in its proxy statement that being a  profitable company with little or no growth was not acceptable  
The best way to create shareholder value  and align executives with the best interest of shareholders  is to tie performance bonuses to ROIC  The reason for using ROIC as the target metric is that there is a clear correlation between ROIC and shareholder value 
Impact of Footnotes Adjustments and Forensic Accounting
In order to derive the true recurring cash flows  an accurate invested capital  and a real shareholder value  we made the following adjustments to Imperva s 2015 10 K 
Income Statement  we made  4 million of adjustments with a net effect of removing  2 million in non operating expenses  1  of revenue   We removed  3 million related to non operating expenses and  1 million related to non operating income 
Balance Sheet  we made  139 million of adjustments to calculate invested capital with a net decrease of  81 million  The most notable adjustment was  27 million  10  of net assets  related to operating leases 
Valuation  we made  61 million of adjustments with a net effect of decreasing shareholder value by  61 million  There were no adjustments that increased shareholder value  One of the largest adjustments was the removal of  34 million  3  of market cap  due to outstanding employee stock options

With the most recent alleged terrorist attack on U S  soil  as well as the many recent cyber security breaches being announced by U S  multinational corporations  it appears as though the cyber security and security stocks in general that operate to protect Americans here and abroad may be ripe for consolidation and buyout offers  as the area is fragmented with equity companies that can benefit from mergers of equals  According to Gartner  companies that operate on  line will have to increase their spending on cybersecurity  which is estimated to reach more than  100 billion dollars in 2019  Leading cyber security company McAfee said that cyber warfare and espionage will increase in the next few years due to substantial growth in the number of connected devices used This makes the cybersecurity area potentially one of the fastest growing segments to invest in as of now

For those who believe in the bible  the above description of the end of the world is closely linked to the end of a one thousand year period known as the millennium  The current time period on earth is known for the rise of the millennial generation  so the similarity is more than trivial  Based on the weather predictions in our lovely land over the next week for temperatures approaching the 120 degrees level  maybe the world is indeed going to end  as predicted many moons ago  If one is following the financial markets recently  you would certainly consider the possibility of the planet going bye bye  When you have German bund yields going negative at the ten year duration  similar yields in Japan  and the investment community and the world at large focused on whether Britain will dump the European Union  fear is prevalent all over the globe  In many ways  the current financial environment reminds me a little of the internet bubble  only in this situation  stocks are not the instrument which are vastly overpriced  Those would be bonds  of every  length  type  issue  and from nearly every country all over the world  The demand for credit and safety is enormous  led of course  by our all knowing central bankers  who are large participants in buying up debt obligations 
Janet Yellen weighed in this week on the current state of affairs and proceeded to talk about the  new normal   a phrase given to the acceptance of a slowing economy by the good folks at PIMCO  naturally the largest bond fund in the globe  The phrase was rolled out over five years ago  so it is nice to see our Fed head stays current after considering all the data  Anyway  the Brits will decide Thursday do they stay or go  The betting money is saying stay  the polls say leave  If you talk to the good folks from the island  you usually get the feeling the will leave because of immigration concerns  As an investor  my sense is to anticipate a leave and get your buying lists ready  Many analysts believe there is a ton of cash waiting on the sidelines for the flush in order to grab up bargains  One place to look at is in the European banking sector as some of the largest financial institutions in the world are trading at five year lows  Unless the world really does end  at least a few of these have a better than average chance of being around  at least I think so  Of course  owning bank stocks is kind of like the having the world end anyway  based on returns over the last ten years 
Elsewhere in capital markets  Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT  agreed to buy LinkedIn  NYSE LNKD  for twenty six billion big ones  Plenty of analysts are weighing in on both sides on the merit of the deal  and Microsoft does not exactly have a great track record with its history of acquisitions  Skype  Nokia  HE NOKIA   a few advertising companies  and large write downs  The key issue is going to be synergies and whether migrating the massive job platform of over 400 million users onto the various parts of Microsoft will bring further revenue opportunities and efficiencies  Twenty six billion is a big number  even for a group with 100 billion of cash in their pocket so this one matters to Nadella  Gates and company  Another deal in the red hot cyber security and SaaS space was Symantec  NASDAQ SYMC  buying Blue Coat Systems for  4 65 billion  With Marketo Inc  NASDAQ MKTO  being acquired recently  it remains to be seen if leaders like Splunk Inc  NASDAQ SPLK   Palo Alto Networks Inc  NYSE PANW   and Fireeye Inc  NASDAQ FEYE  also get snapped up  Private equity groups remain flush with cash so keep your eyes peeled 
I would be in error to not mention the tragedies in Orlando last week  My sympathies go out to the families of the slain night club victims  In addition  it is heartbreaking to read of the little boy who was snatched at a Disney theme park in Orlando  In thinking about these situations  the Disney one should have been prevented with more security and precaution  The terrorist shooting at the night club also had signs which alert officials would have followed up with  The attack shows you what is lacking from the current leadership of our government  as well as the party on the other side of the isle  An easy compromise would be to ban all semi or automatic assault weapons  and temporarily suspend any immigration from countries where one suspects terrorists might be coming from  It is the responsibility of those who are running these bodies to not make speeches but to do their jobs  I suspect as a country we will continue to expect too much in this regard  Next week will be hot  so stay cool and maybe drink a lot of water  or some other refreshing beverage

Europe lower following U S  employment report  Asia mixed to close out the week

Stocks in Asia finished mixed ahead of the January employment report in the U S   while Japanese markets continued to drop and volume remained light in China ahead of next week s weeklong lunar new year holidays that will have mainland markets closed  Equities trading in Japan fell  with the yen extending its rally to pressure export related stocks  capping off the largest weekly gain for the currency since 2009  per Bloomberg  The yen has jumped as the U S  dollar has been routed with economic data and the global market volatility dampening expectations of further rate hikes in the U S  Japanese stocks have given back all of a two day surge that began last Friday as the Bank of Japan announced the adoption of a negative interest rate policy  Meantime  Australian securities dipped amid weakness in financials and as the nation s December retail sales missed forecasts  more than offsetting some strength in commodity related stocks

As noted in the Schwab Market Perspective  Watching and Waiting  markets are still recession obsessed  but we believe if we are in the midst of a cyclical bear market  it s of the  non recession  variety  The U S  economy remains bifurcated  with manufacturing in a slump  but services hanging in there  although weaker service sector growth helped to further expectations that the Fed is in no rush to raise rates again  Recent economic readings from around the world also suggest that the globe is not slipping into a recession 
Consumer data headlines next week s economic calendar 
Amid heightened uncertainty regarding further Fed rate hikes and the recession drumbeat picking up tempo  Friday s January retail sales and preliminary February University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index reports will headline next week s U S  economic calendar and shed some light on the all important consumer 
Schwab s Brad Sorensen notes in his latest Schwab Sector Views  positives for consumers include  reduced debt loads  continued improving job market and signs wages are starting to increase  Also  energy costs have fallen  which boosts the amount consumers have to spend although to what extent has been somewhat disappointing to this point  However  consumers seem to be cautious and Americans  willingness to take on consumer debt appears to have waned

44014,265529,NLOK,Higher Margins Would Benefit Symantec Corporation ,opinion,"Symantec Corporation  NASDAQ SYMC  s earnings failed to meet expectations in three of the four quarters last year  The last quarter earnings  as well as  top line came in above the expectations of the Wall Street  The outlook provided by the company was also in line with the estimations  Above all  there is an expectation that the company could benefit from higher margins  The company is a leader in endpoint security with the threat increasing as rapidly as it can  The security firm is currently focusing on four priority areas  The first one was to realize its unified security tactics while the second was in respect of building its enterprise security sales pipeline GTM  The third and fourth priorities were improving its cost structure and efficiently managing the capital  The company is also getting money to create an advanced security platform  All of a sudden  the shares of the company have become important to watched  The current year could see things if everything goes according to its plan 
Consumer Security Products Line
One of the issues that Symantec Corporation  NASDAQ SYMC  had to face was the consumer security product line as it was considered a weakness  However  things are not likely to remain in the same perspective in the upcoming months  There appears to one thing certain that this segment will not likely have bad things or only fewer bad things even if it meant that things will not be better  That was partly because of the feeling among the investors that consumer drop could moderate  In the fiscal year 2015  the division witnessed a drop of 7  
According to the RBC Capital Markets analyst  Mathew Hedberg  the drop in the division was the fall in re activation of the auto renewal option of Symantec Corporation  NASDAQ SYMC   Hedberg said that he was confident that it would happen in the current month in the United States  Similarly  the analyst believes that it would happen later in the summer in the European Union  The company has also been involved in reaching agreements with telecom companies in Japan  German  and India  That should help to grow in the on line channel while expecting flat average selling prices  ASP   The company also has a good chance of grabbing an OEM contract from one of the biggest PC makers  which comes up for bid in March end  There was a belief that the security service provider would take the deal without hurting its margins  That means it should be an advantageous one  Also  the reports indicated that the trends of consumer billings were positive until now  and that is a good sign for revenue generation 
Lower Costs To Boost Profit
Another area for Symantec Corporation  NASDAQ SYMC  to earn an advantage was the realization of the better margins in the upcoming quarters  There appears to be enough room to reduce costs for the upcoming fiscal year 2017 thus lifting the profitability  On a comparable basis  margins might drop two percentage points because of the Veritas Infrastructure  which was divested recently  RBC Capital expects margins to trend higher throughout the fiscal year 2017 close to 30  and enter the following year with 30   The company is likely to gain  400 million from some identified cost savings  and half of it should allow margins to reach 30  level while the remaining half might indicate reinvestment or additional leverage 
Symantec Corporation  NASDAQ SYMC  stands to gain from cost cutting measures by higher margins  According to estimation  for every  100 million reductions in operational expenditures  the company could add earnings of nearly 13 cents a share in the fiscal year 2018  That means the security service provider might gain a maximum of 52 cents a share when it realizes  400 million from cost reduction measures  That also meant that for every quarter  its earnings could add 13 cents a share  The company would have also spent enough time in reviewing its operations following the divestiture of Veritas  as well as  the alliance with AlixPartners and Silver Lake Partners 
Capital Return Program
There is the potential for merger and acquisitions for Symantec Corporation  NASDAQ SYMC  following the sale of its Veritas divestments  Its CEO  Michael Brown  indicated before the closure of the sale that it was planning to focus on information and threat protection apart from the cyber security services  He gave hints that it was the area where the company could probe any acquisitions  The CEO was categorical that it was not looking into any other areas for M A  However  he expressed his concerns about the pricing of the technology firms currently  which  he termed it  as expensive  The company could afford to spend its money only once 
Therefore  Symantec Corporation  NASDAQ SYMC  appears to have kept the M A on the sidelines  at least  for the time being  That was because the company decided to use the money from the sale of Veritas for its capital return program  which would be completed before the fiscal year 2017 ends  According to its plan  it would pay a special dividend of  4 a share costing  2 7 billion to the company s exchequer  The remaining  2 3 billion would be used to buy back its shares  The company has also received a  500 million investment from Silver Lake Partners  as well as  AlixPartners 
Valuation
As far as valuation for Symantec Corporation  NASDAQ SYMC   the stock is trading cheap in terms of price to earnings  price to book and price to sales ratios compared to the industry average  For instance  its PE for the trailing twelve month period was 12 4 times whereas the industry average was 87 1  Similarly  its price to book was 2 2 times compared to the industry s 4 9 times while price to sales was only 2 0 times versus 4 5 times for the industry average  Its return on assets  and equity were 4 9  and 11 0  compared to the industry average of 2 7  and 5 3  respectively  It was because of such reasons  brokerages like RBC have a price target of  23 
Conclusion
Symantec Corporation  NASDAQ SYMC  appears to be on a strong path to deliver better performance in the upcoming quarters  There is potential for upside rewards  The valuation supports while margin expansion would add further value

44015,265530,NLOK,Stock Of The Day  Will IBM Ever Be Able To Reinvent Itself ,opinion,"by Clement Thibault
Something unsettling has been going on at IBM over the past three years  A DJIA stalwart and renowned blue chip company and stock  International Business Machine Corporation  NYSE IBM  founded over 100 years ago in 1911  and often referred to as Big Blue has been noticeably hurting 
IBM manufactures and markets computer hardware and software  as well as offers hosting and consulting services in a variety of technological areas  The company s distress is evident when looking at its monthly chart for the past few years 
After hitting and hovering around  200 per share in 2012 2013  the company s stock fell as low as  117 this past February  That s more than 40  off the  200 mark 

The life cycle of any business is pretty straightforward  At the beginning there s the idea  With any luck  that becomes a startup  If everything goes well  there s a period of fast growth  If successful  this ends in maturity and profitability  After a stable period  which can take years   a plateau is usually hit  inevitably signalling the approach of a decline 
A company in decline has two options  Either it doesn t change and ultimately becomes obsolete  or it manages to reinvent itself and rise again  into a new period of growth 
Over the past two years IBM has hit its decline phase  Its revenues are down for each of the past three years  In 2012  Big Blue s revenues were  102B  In 2013  that number fell to  98B  falling further  to  92B in 2014  Revenue fell yet another 12  in 2015  to  81B 
IBM s operating income has also suffered  slipping steadily from  22B in 2012 to  16B in 2015  With an eye toward stanching the downward trajectory  the company has cut its cost of revenue  its selling and general expenses  even its R D expenditures  Unfortunately  none of these efforts have been enough to stop the fall  and IBM is struggling to acknowledge and commit to the changes it needs  much like big bureaucratic entities often do 
IBM has shown that it s ready to reorganize itself in order to survive in this new cloud era  In 2015  it is estimated that IBM laid off some 70 000 employees  trying to     according to an IBM spokesperson  These efforts followed previous layoffs in 2014 which  according to a company spokesman  were meant to allow IBM s  aggressive positioning  towards new technologies 
 that those 70 000 employees were almost all replaced by the company  Still  with a headcount of 377 000 employees worldwide  staffing cuts and changes are a process that will take some time to play out 
Luckily for IBM it still has a few things going for it  First  its approximately  700 million in revenues from patents remain a sticky source of income in the form of royalties that continue to quietly benefit the company s bottom line  Correctly  IBM is very protective of this resource  They recently filed a lawsuit against Groupon  NASDAQ GRPN  alleging patent infringement  proving that this legacy revenue means a lot to the company and continues to be an important revenue generator 
Indeed  last year alone  IBM registered a world leading 7 355 patents over two and a half times more than second place Google  NASDAQ GOOGL   Since the company s inception  it s estimated that IBM has generated over  20 billion in revenue related to the 88 000 patents it has registered 
Aside from its patent revenue  IBM is fairly positioned in a few additional areas  including cyber security software which generated  2B in revenue for the company last year and experienced 12  growth  IBM is number 3 in this niche  trailing Symantec  NASDAQ SYMC  and Intel  NASDAQ INTC  
Another area of strength for IBM is artificial intelligence  with its Watson machine learning technology competing head to head with Microsoft s  NASDAQ MSFT  Oxford and Google s DeepMind 
Within the infrastructure as a service market  which includes the all important cloud computing segment  IBM holds a 12  market share  lagging way behind Amazon s  NASDAQ AMZN  dominant 27   But even as IBM continues inking deals to boost its presence within this niche  it s is also seeing Google make major moves  That s not great news 
Perhaps though  the ace up IBM s sleeve is not surprisingly its tolerant ownership  Just a few days ago  activist hedge fund Starboard Value moved to overthrow the entire Yahoo   NASDAQ YHOO  board  Starboard has just a 1  ownership stake in Yahoo  proving that not much is needed in order to stir up trouble for a publicly traded company 
Luckily  IBM has stronger backing than Yahoo   As of the end of last year  Warren Buffett s Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa  has an 8 59  ownership stake in Big Blue  Buffett bought into IBM in 2011  after being won over by the company s  Steadfast stakeholders mean the IBM board has the time and peace of mind it needs in order to plan long term and sacrifice immediate revenue if needed  a luxury not many companies public or private can afford   Nevertheless  it s always possible that even Mr  Buffet will grow tired of the company s lack of growth and eventually admit he may have made a bad investment  
All told  the future remains unclear for IBM  It is declining  and to date it doesn t seem as if there s a grand  transformative strategy in place in order to right the ship 
IBM s CEO Ginni Rometty has said that the company s strategic plan currently focuses on  cloud  analytics  mobile  social and security    all newer technologies than IBM s original  traditional businesses  But a detailed  revamped business plan if one even exists is currently safely concealed within the company s headquarters 
What appear to be initial steps  such as replacing a significant portion of the workforce and taking steps to enter new businesses  seem rather tentative and hardly convincing  Each business IBM has entered is already crowded  and not by small  acquirable startups  Rather the fields are currently dominated by other tech giants 
If IBM wants to avoid obsolescence and be reborn  it needs something convincing to distance itself from the competition  We are still waiting for a clear plan showing how this will happen  even after two years of what the company has called  aggressive  repositioning  From our vantage point  IBM s shareholders should be concerned 
So  IBM s present is uncertain  even with the company taking what it considers drastic measures  and the future is even murkier  With all due respect to Mr  Buffett  there s is absolutely no guarantee of  or reasonable time frame for  a turnaround  This is not to say that IBM will ultimately fold  But if we were to invest in the company and its 3 5  dividend is in fact quite tempting we d wait for the numbers to at least stabilize for a quarter or two before pulling the buy trigger ",2016-03-29,Clement Thibault/Investing.com ,https://www.investing.com/analysis/stock-of-the-day:-ibm-200123022,200123022
44016,265531,NLOK,Trading Chances  KLAC  MNST  SYMC  And EUR USD,opinion,"KLA Tencor Corp   NASDAQ  KLAC  Two trends can be seen here  The priority trend  green  is pointing upwards and is in the movement  but very far into it  The possibility of a correction is highly likely  With this in mind  the minor trend  red  is able to continue  The correction zone runs between  71 04 and  71 34  The last correction in this trend size travelled up into its correction zone  and it seems as though a new movement is about to start 

Monster Beverage Corp   NASDAQ  MNST 
This value appears to be more promising  We see two trends facing the same direction  The priority and the minor trend are both facing downwards  The one disadvantage is the maturity of the priority trend  since it is in its 9th arm already  A trend continuation is not really likely  but it is possible that it will run down to the last point two at  113 08  In any case  we are able to ride the minor trend downwards with a stop above  135 49 and a first target at the point two at  129 25 

Symantec Corp   NASDAQ  SYMC 
This value is displaying a similar situation  After the last move down to  16 15  the price corrected up into its first possible correction zone  red rectangle   where within this zone several reversal signals then occurred  and now it seems likely that a new movement will develop  With this in mind  we can speculate that the trend will be able to continue  A first target may be located at the current low at  16 15 

EUR USD
An almost perfect situation is occurring in the forex pair EUR USD  The crucial trend sizes   medium and small   are on their way to continuing their trends  Both trends have emerged from their correction zones and were able to start a new move  With stops below the green zones  we can carry out a long trade  A first target may be placed at the last point two at  1 1343

44018,265533,NLOK,Symantec  SYMC  Stock Down On Q4 Earnings   Sales Miss,opinion,Shares of Symantec Corporation   NASDAQ SYMC   fell nearly 3 5  during yesterday s after hours trading session after the company announced lower than expected results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016  A cautious outlook further raised investor concerns Quarter in DetailThe company s adjusted earnings  excluding amortization  restructuring and other one time items but including stock based compensation  of 16 cents per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 18 cents  On a year over year basis too  adjusted earnings plunged about 58  On a GAAP basis  Symantec reported a loss of  1 56 per share  In the year ago quarter  the company had earned a profit of 8 cents per share  The year over year decline was mainly due to lower revenues and higher expenses Moreover  Symantec s revenues of  873 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  879 million and declined 2 9  year over year  Last month  the company had revealed that during the fiscal fourth quarter  revenues suffered as  a shift in enterprise security customer buying preferences is resulting in less license revenue during the quarter and more revenue being deferred to future periods   Apart from this  unfavorable exchange rates impacted the top line by  3 million Segment wise  License revenues plunged 37  year over year  while Content  Subscription and Maintenance revenues dropped 5  The company s realigned business segments include Consumer Security and Enterprise Security  The Consumer Security segment witnessed a 7  year over year decline in revenues  while revenues at Enterprise Security fell 5  Symantec s adjusted gross profit  excluding amortization  restructuring and other one time items but including stock based compensation  of  7732 million was down 5 2   primarily due to a lower revenue base and higher cost of goods sold  Consequently  as a percentage of revenues  gross margin was down 210 basis points  bps  on a year over year basis to 83 5  Adjusted operating margin  excluding amortization  restructuring and other one time items but including stock based compensation  was down 850 bps year over year to 19 5   primarily due to lower revenues and increased expenses as a percentage of revenues Balance Sheet   Cash FlowSymantec exited the quarter with cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of  5 983 billion  compared with  2 269 billion last quarter  Long term debt was  2 207 billion  up from  1 746 billion in the previous quarter In fiscal 2016  Symantec generated operating cash flow of  838 million  The company paid dividends worth  3 030 billion  Moreover  it spent  1 868 billion for share repurchases GuidanceThe company provided a tepid outlook for first quarter fiscal 2017 and the full fiscal year  For fiscal 2017  Symantec expects revenues of  3 49 billion to  3 58 billion  mid point   3 535 billion   The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at  3 542 billion Non GAAP operating margin is anticipated in the range of 26 5 27 5   Non GAAP earnings per share are expected to be  1 06 to  1 10 For the first quarter of fiscal 2017  Symantec expects revenues in the range of  865 million to  895 million  mid point   880 million   The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at  881 million Non GAAP operating margin is projected in the range of 24 5 26 5   Management expects non GAAP earnings per share of 24 cents to 26 cents  mid point  25 cents  Veritas Business Spun OffDuring the quarter  the company completed the much awaited divestment of its Veritas business to The Carlyle Group   NASDAQ CG   for a total consideration of  7 4 billion  Notably  the companies revised the terms of the deal in this January  when the total consideration amount was reduced to  7 4 billion from  8 billion   Read    Also  the companies have raised the amount of offshore cash remaining with Veritas to  400 million from  200 million Therefore  net consideration for Symantec comes to  7 billion  including  6 6 billion in cash and an equity interest of  400 million in Veritas  The transaction resulted in the reduction of  1 billion in after tax cash proceeds to Symantec  Thus  upon completion of the deal  Symantec will receive after tax cash proceeds of  5 3 billion  instead of  6 3 billion as agreed earlier Restructuring PlanIn addition to fiscal fourth quarter results  the company unveiled a  400 million cost efficiency program  Under this program  Symantec expects to save  400 million of costs each year  To achieve this  the company will reduce headcount and close facilities during fiscal 2017  Symantec expects to incur restructuring charges of  230 million to  280 million related to these actions Our TakeSymantec delivered weaker than expected results during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016  The year over year comparisons were unfavorable for both the top and bottom line as well  Revenues declined in mainly due to a shift in consumer buying preferences and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates Furthermore  the company issued a tepid outlook for first quarter fiscal 2017and the full fiscal year  Additionally  continued investments in product development and launch could impact margins in the near term Nonetheless  investment in growth areas such as Enterprise backup  Storage Management and Security businesses are expected to boost Symantec s long term prospects Moreover  restructuring initiatives and share buyback plans are expected to support its bottom line However  smaller companies  like Kaspersky  are consistently launching comparable products  These  along with competition from the likes of Intel   NASDAQ INTC   and Microsoft   NASDAQ MSFT    remain headwinds  The uncertainty over PC sales adds to its woes Currently  Symantec carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  ,2016-05-12,Zacks Investment

44019,265534,NLOK,Technology Stock Roundup  AAPL Down  ORCL  GOOGL In Court,opinion,"Last week  which was light in terms of tech earnings  saw a number of negative reports on Nikkei that pulled down Apple shares  NASDAQ AAPL   At the same time Alphabet   NASDAQ GOOGL   and Oracle   NYSE ORCL   found themselves heading to court again 
Here are the top stories 
Nikkei Reports Pulling Down Apple
Back to back negative reports from the Nikkei impacted Apple shares last week  The first of these mentioned falling iPhone shipments based on estimates from IHS  smartphone part makers and manufacturing equipment makers  all of which see increasing demand for cheaper Chinese smartphones from Huawei  Xiaomi  Lenovo  ZTE  Vivo  etc  While Huawei is currently expected to be the biggest gainer  to grow 20 30  this year   the top 10 Chinese smartphone makers are together expected to grow 15  to 550 million 
The other reports focused on weak sales of Apple component suppliers and measures taken by Japanese and Taiwanese part makers to target Chinese phone makers  Since Apple is already dealing with its first quarter of shipment decline  the Nikkei reports had more of a negative impact 
Oracle Has Some New Numbers for Alphabet
Oracle lawyer Peter Bicks says that Alphabet s Google made  42 billion in revenue and  21 billion in profits from Android based smartphones and is therefore seeking  8 8 billion in damages  or around 11 7  of its balance sheet cash  It s a huge amount even for Google  but it s as yet unclear if Google will have to pay for it  Google used 37 application programming interfaces  APIs  or software code that enables interoperability between programs  that belonged to Sun  which was subsequently taken over by Oracle 
The last time the case was tried  the court held that the technology wasn t copyrightable  Moreover  Google argued that the inability to use APIs and making them negotiable and licensable  especially in the given circumstances  such as Sun encouraging Java use to ensure its proliferation  would limit innovation  App and hardware makers building on Android would also be affected and there would be cost escalation for all 
HP  Red Hat and Yahoo  NASDAQ YHOO  submitted papers supporting Google while Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT   EMC  NYSE EMC  and NetApp  NASDAQ NTAP  sided with Oracle at the time  Both sides argued for innovation  Microsoft said that failure to protect APIs would lead software makers to reveal less about them  which would in turn affect innovation 
But that was a long time ago  Oracle now says it has numbers to support its claims  Google of course doesn t make anything from Android but from software it has developed on it that people use to search  download apps  etc  It doesn t even sell those  earning only from the ads and commissions they generate  
So after Google was granted victory in 2012  the decision was overturned on appeal  when Google asked the Supreme Court to hear the case  When they refused  the case went for retrial  Now there s a jury of 8 women and 2 men to decide Google s fate Other stories you might have missed 
Corporate
iPhone Manufacturing in India  Confirming earlier reports about possible iPhone manufacturing in India  last week saw a fresh report from ET saying that Apple supplier Foxconn was ready to sign a contract for a  10 billion facility covering 1200 acres in India s Maharashtra state  Apple s plans of selling refurbished phones in the country were hit by regulatory authorities on account of competitive concerns 
A manufacturing facility in the country aligns with the government s plans of creating 6 million manufacturing jobs through the  Make in India  initiative  If Apple resorts to India only prices as this facility might enable and as manufacturers in other industries already do  it has a much better chance of tapping the Indian market where the average smartphone costs around  150  
Apple on 10nm Chips  Apple s supplier of choice is Taiwan Semiconductor  which has reportedly started taping out the design for its 10nm A11 chip  It s currently expected that the chips will be qualified by the end of the year with samples shipping in the first quarter of 2017  It was earlier thought that Taiwan Semiconductor would secure an exclusive contract  which made sense since it is more focused on developing leading edge technology that Apple can make use of in the future  But it now appears that Samsung  KS 005930  is likely to get a quarter share of orders 
Facebook  NASDAQ FB  Trouble in Sweden  27 Swedish broadcasters  publishers and media associations have objected to Facebook s deal with partly state owned telecom Telia  The deal offers Facebook to customers without charging them for the data used  The concept hasn t been popular in a number of places  most notably India where it was objected to on the grounds of net neutrality  Swedish companies are objecting on the same grounds 
Intel  NASDAQ INTC  Refinances Debt  Intel refinanced some debt that matures this year and in 2017  It sold  2 75 billion in bonds with five  ten and thirty year maturities and carrying an S P rating of A   The 30 year part is the biggest one through which it raised  1 25 billion at 1 55   The company will also repay  1 5 billion of its 1 95  percent notes due in October and a portion of the 1 35  notes due next year 
Google  Yahoo Apps Banned  News reports last week said that the Yahoo Mail and Google appspot com had been banned in the lower house of Congress on security concerns  In Yahoo s case  it was because the mail was allowing ransomware attacks  in which hackers attach malicious software to emails  In Google s case  it was because appspot continues to host remote access tools that were capable of stealing personally identifiable information and a trojan named BLT   The FBI issued warnings on these in June 2015 
Microsoft Cloud in Canada  Microsoft has announced that its Canadian cloud is now open for operation  This is a big deal because it allows businesses and governments to store their data within the country while using Microsoft solutions such as its IaaS  PaaS  SaaS and hybrid platforms  Microsoft has said that Office 365 is already available for data residency and Dynamics CRM is coming in September 
Alibaba  NYSE BABA  Fights Counterfeiting  Brands Unimpressed  Alibaba s entry into the Washington DC based International Anti Counterfeiting Coalition  IACC  last month has ruffled many  Gucci and Michael Kors already quit the lobby group in protest and last week saw an anonymous letter to the board that there would be mass exits unless Alibaba was ousted  The relationship between IACC President Robert Barchiesi  who has held Alibaba shares since its IPO  and Matthew Bassiur  who took over as Alibaba s head of intellectual property enforcement this January  has also been called into question 
China s leading ecommerce company has battled with counterfeits on its Taobao platform for long and many brands are unhappy with its limited success  Taobao has announced fresh rules to crack down on counterfeit items including new requirements for luxury goods sellers that require them to upload proof of authentic goods by May 20  failing which they can have their fund balances frozen 
WDC Closes SNDK Acquisition  Following the approval of the Ministry of Commerce of China  MOFCOM   the deal  which was already approved by other regulatory bodies and company shareholders  came to a close  Western Digital  NASDAQ WDC   which specializes in HDDs and San Disk  which specializes in the new age NVM are perfectly complementary to each other with broad product and industry experience  So the acquisition is a boon for shareholders  SanDisk  NASDAQ SNDK  co founder  President and CEO Sanjay Mehrotra joins the Western Digital board of directors  Western Digital CEO Steve Milligan continues as CEO of the combined company

Facebook Meets Conservatives  Facebook has been anonymously accused of suppressing news stories that offer a conservative view point  Zuckerberg said an investigation was in progress although there was no evidence of this happening and that he would meet conservative leaders through the week  Facebook also confirmed that it will remain a sponsor of the GOP s July convention in Cleveland despite pressure from liberal activists  Separately  U S  Magistrate Judge Paul S  Grewal has left the bench to become global litigation head at Facebook 
FTC Investigates Google Search  A new report from Politico indicates that Alphabet s Google is in for some fresh investigation into its search practices  The report says that the investigation is in its early stages  so details are limited  But the idea is to see if Google has misused its dominant position in search to favor its own products  A previous investigation found it not guilty back in 2013 
Both search and Android OS are being scrutinized by European authorities  The British newspaper The Sunday Telegraph reported yesterday that Google was looking at a fine of up to  3 4 billion  or up to 10  of its annual sales  plus a ban on favoring itself over rivals in search but that the bill had not been finalized 
Groupon Suing IBM  NYSE IBM   Groupon has sued IBM in Chicago district court for infringing on its software patent  Specifically  Groupon alleges that IBM s WebSphere Commerce platform infringes on a patent that Groupon holds  This follows IBM s suing the company for infringement of four of its patents  which said that Groupon s lawsuit is without merit 
New Technology Products
WhatsApp for Desktops  Possibly in order to better target business users  WhatsApp has now spread to Macs and PCs  The app is now available on the broadest range of operating systems including iOS  Android  Blackberry  TO BB  and Windows and has the reach of other leading messaging services  such as iMessage and Skype  Facebook Messenger is close on its heels with apps for mobile  web and as a Windows 8 or 10 app 
Facebook at Work in India  Business Insider reports that India comes first as far as Facebook At Work adoption is concerned and says that it s because of its high mobile dependence  Users can typically toggle between their personal and official accounts  with Facebook serving ads on the first one and giving companies total control over the other one which is ad free  First users are happy with the product calling out its intuitive feature 
Microsoft Wants More Apps on Windows  Microsoft is courting corporate technology buyers by allowing them to make bulk purchases of third party apps from its Windows Store for Business launched last November  While there s no incentive yet  volume discounts are reportedly on the way 
That s not all    it is removing the option to block the purchase of apps using Windows 10 Pro devices  This is a cheaper version of its OS  usually used by SMBs  If the IT departments want greater control over company devices  they have to upgrade to its pricier product  All this is expected to interest developers to make more apps for Windows  which is absolutely necessary if it is to succeed against Android and iOS    
Google s Chirp  Google has a developers  conference this week where we might learn more about a new device along the lines of Amazon s popular Echo  Re code s Mark Bergen says the device will be called Chirp and is in all probability being developed by its Nest group  Nest has some earlier success with smart thermostats and security cameras and has something of a cool design team  So we should get ready for a smart device answering questions  fetching mail  turning on music  etc but hopefully Google will think of a sexier name than OK Google 
Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  Video  Amazon has launched a YouTube killer competitor called Amazon Video Direct that will live on user generated content the way YouTube does  But Amazon may get it to profit sooner since it can advertize the millions of items it sells on the platform  It also has a fairly large and loyal user base that it feeds through Prime  so uptake could be quick  Just how Amazon hopes to tie this in with the rest of what it does isnt something it s talking about yet  but the possibilities are exciting 
Also  note that Amazon has some fairly successful original content that sets it apart from other video providers except Netflix  NASDAQ NFLX   Still  YouTube has many more years of experience in video distribution and also has brand value  so it should be a good fight  
M A
Salesforce to Use Amazon s AWS  Salesforce will build its IoT cloud on AWS according to the WSJ  This is a big win for Amazon  which also recently helped Netflix move to its cloud  While Amazon remains the largest online retailer with significant growth prospects  all the excitement in recent times has been about AWS 
Its cloud infrastructure business  while making a single digit contribution to revenue  generates nearly half its profit  Note that Salesforce s flagship CRM offering competes with Microsoft s Dynamics CRM  Microsoft is second in the IaaS segment  so Amazon  the market leader  is the best company it could have gone to 
Apple Invests in Chinese Ride Sharing Company  Apple has invested a billion dollars in Chinese ride sharing company Didi Chuxing Technology  Company president Jean Liu has said that the two companies would  benefit each other on product  on technology  on many other levels   but no other details are available 
Apple s only known interest in cars is with respect to its autonomous electric car technology  which is another secret project with few details available  It s extremely hard to understand Apple s move here  If it had been a manufacturing alliance  Apple would have tied with car makers  instead its tied with technology companies  SO Didi could be interested in using these cars when they become available  This could be a goal of the Chinese government as well as it moves to reduce China s carbon footprint 
Alibaba Softbank Team Up  Alibaba and Softbank have formed a joint venture  called SB Cloud  to offer cloud services in Japan  Softbank s goal is to develop the perfect cloud for Japanese companies and multinationals with data residency in Japan  Alibaba brings its secure  scalable cloud computing technology to the JV so the companies can deliver data storage and processing services  enterprise level middleware and cloud security services 
Some Numbers
Micron Shares Down  Micron said it was expecting a third quarter loss of 5 12 cents per share on revenue of  2 8 billion to  3 1 billion  Analysts expect Micron to report a loss of 4 cents per share on revenue of  3 2 billion  The softness at Micron is because it is focused on memory chips for the PC market where prices continue to slide  The company does have new products in the pipeline  but they aren t expected to make a contribution yet

44020,265535,NLOK,Symantec Well Poised On Growth Initiatives  Time To Hold ,opinion,On May 17  2016  we issued an updated research report on Symantec Corporation   NASDAQ SYMC   Symantec provides a broad range of content security and information backup solutions to individuals and enterprises  Moreover  the company s mobile and cloud security products are gradually gaining market acceptance  The storage and server management business provides recovery solutions and heterogeneous storage end server platforms  We believe these innovative products and solutions will help Symantec win customers  thereby increasing its business volume Months of hard work and negotiations paid off in early 2016 when Symantec finally completed the sale of its information management division   Veritas to the Carlyle Group   NASDAQ CG    Selling Veritas to the Carlyle Group reflects the company s strategy of refocusing on the security market while lessening its dependence on antivirus  We believe that the divestment is likely to streamline Symantec s operations and maximize shareholders  value  Renewed focus on the core business can also revive the company s operational performance Symantec has made a big play in the endpoint security market  Lately  cyber security has been a growing threat for organizations of all sizes  The growing security threats and potential hacking attacks led the company to unveil a new method for advanced threat protection  ATP   thereby delivering more complete attack prevention solutions  Symantec Managed Security Services   Advanced Threat Protection will help organizations to assess the level of vulnerabilities  detect threats and mitigate intellectual property theft Moreover  Symantec has been returning cash through share repurchases and dividend payments  During fiscal 2015  Symantec spent  413 million on dividends and  500 million on share repurchases  Continuing with the strategy  Symantec returned a total of  4 9 billion through share repurchases and dividend payments in fiscal 2016  These activities not only boost investor confidence but also provide support to earnings per share It is worth mentioning that the Internet security market is an attractive area even during recessionary times because of increasing online traffic  According to research firm  Research and Markets  the global IT security spending market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 9 29   2012 2016   Moreover  tech research firm Gartner predicts that by 2018 more than half of the enterprises will use security service companies that emphasize on data protection  security risk management and security infrastructure management to help manage their security network infrastructure  The increase in security spending is therefore likely to be beneficial for this leading vendor of solutions into the market However  Symantec delivered weaker than expected results during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016  The year over year comparisons were unfavorable for both the top and bottom line as well  Revenues declined mainly due to a shift in consumer buying preferences and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates  Furthermore  the company issued a tepid outlook for first quarter and fiscal 2017  Additionally  continued investments in product development and launch could impact margins in the near term Going further  smaller companies  like Kaspersky  are consistently launching comparable products  These  along with competition from the likes of Intel   NASDAQ INTC   and Microsoft   NASDAQ MSFT    remain headwinds  The uncertainty over PC sales adds to its woes Currently  Symantec carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  ,2016-05-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/symantec-well-poised-on-growth-initiatives;-time-to-hold-200130736,200130736
44021,265536,NLOK,NDX Breaks Above Long Term Resistance  Euro Tests Critical Support,opinion,"VIX may be forming what is known as a Broadening Bottom formation that is marked by successive higher highs and lower lows  If correct  this decline may be the last  These formations are hard to identify  since they are rare and are not identifiable until the fifth and final point  likely to be beneath 12 50  In the meantime  it has given several false buy and sell signals  The Cycles Model suggests a probable low on Tuesday  Broadening formations  tops and bottoms  are often known as reversal patterns 
   With Goldman suggesting VIX should be in the upper teens based on  fundamentals  and event risks galore on the horizon  FOMC  Brexit  Spain elections  US elections  etc   Geneva Swiss Bank suggests it is time to BTFVIX   
SPX rises to round number resistance 

When SPX broke beneath its critical shelf of support at 2044 00  it gave a bear signal  However  a week later it is challenging round number resistance at 2100 00  Should it break above that resistance and make a new high above 2111 05  a bull signal may develop  However  a critical Pivot day may occur early next week  so caution is the byword 
   By one measure  U S  stocks are even more expensive than they were during the tech bubble of 2000 
While price to earnings ratios  which can be manipulated by financial engineering  aren t at alarming levels  price to sales ratios indicate stocks are well beyond being merely fully priced  as the chart from Ned Davis Research below shows 
The price to sales ratio divides a company s stock price by revenues  The price to earnings ratio divides the price by earnings 
The median price to sales ratio on S P 500 SPX   0 43   or the P S of the 250th stock on the index is at 2 2  according to Ned Davis Research  above the 2007 and 2000 levels  when stocks were arguably in bubble territory 
NDX breaks above Long term resistance 

NDX broke above Long term resistance at 4433 09 in a show of rare seasonal strength  However  this may be a false breakout  as a major pivot may be about to happen Should the NDX turn without making a new high  the Head and Shoulders formation may be in play once NDX declines through its mid Cycle support at 4248 65

 TheJapanNews  Japanese banks are facing a sharp jump in dollar funding costs and a blow to their investment returns as the Federal Reserve s plan to raise interest rates puts paid to an era of cheap dollars 
The strong U S  employment data has increased the likelihood of the Fed raising rates at its Dec  15 16 meeting and that has pushed yen dollar swap costs sharply higher

But now  as investors have suddenly grown skittish  some big Wall Street banks have been stuck with piles of debt that they are struggling to sell  As a result  they are starting to book multimillion dollar losses as they write down the value of these positions 
 ZeroHedge  Given how awesome everything appears to be  judging by stocks and the tidal wave of FedSpeak of the last week confirming that rates are rising in December  we found it at least marginally  odd  that out of the blue  The Fed would announce an  expedited  closed  meeting on Monday   ",2015-11-22,Anthony M.

44088,265603,NLOK,Stocks Complete Their Summer Recovery After May Sell Off,opinion,We re coming down to the final sleepy weeks of a relatively uneventful summer in the equity markets  Volume is quite low  as is expected this time of year with investment managers in vacation mode  Nevertheless  the S P 500 has now recovered all of its losses since the  Sell in May  crowd hit the market hard  sending the S P 500 falling 9  from a close of 1406 on May 1 to 1278 on June 1  Since then  stocks have steadily climbed in the face of frightening global headlines within a clearly defined bullish rising channel On Wednesday  the S P 500 closed at 1405 53 to challenge technical resistance at that May 1 high  Bulls have been valiantly shoring up intraday weakness each day to ensure markets hold their psychologically important support levels of Dow 13 000  Nasdaq 3 000  S P 500 1400  and Russell 2000 800 Curiously  the selection of Congressman Paul Ryan as Mitt Romney s running mate has served to re energize both parties  which I think has been bullish for the markets  Republicans feel that he enhances Mitt Romney s conservative stripes while adding a poised  rational  intelligent  and engaging personality to the ticket  while Democrats believe that his budget proposals have been so radical that it will make re election easier for the incumbents  So  everyone has been given a dose of optimism Overall  corporate revenues have been struggling to grow year over year  while earnings growth has been more robust as costs have been cut to the bone and productivity continues to improve  In this slow growth world  it is particularly important for investors to take a hard look at the aggressiveness of a company s accounting practices On this topic  I have pointed out periodically that Sabrient subsidiary Gradient Analytics  which produces in depth forensic accounting research  has been particularly successful at rooting out firms with questionable earnings quality and revenue recognition practices by examining trends in things like accruals  receivables  payables  inventories  cash flow  margins  allowance for doubtful accounts  pension liabilities  effective tax rates  etc   as well as anomalous insider trading behavior  particularly with their equity incentives and SEC Rule 10b5 1 plans  This is more important than ever these days  Indeed  many of Gradient s negatively rated stocks have fallen recently after their earnings reports  including Ritchie Bros  RBA   comScore  SCOR   FARO Technologies  FARO   and Innophos Holdings  IPHS   Moreover  a growing number of   often because of accusations of improper accounting or because of U S  insistence on examining their China based auditors Looking at the SPY chart  it closed Wednesday at 140 95 and has been trading since mid May within a bullish rising channel   Note that I am showing two different sets of possible boundaries for the channel   There is really no change in the chart from last week  SPY is still dealing with technical resistance from the convergence of the top of the rising channel and the April May closing highs  The 50 day simple moving average has turned up and is crossing up through the 100 day SMA in a bullish manner  Price sits comfortably above the 20   50   100   and 200 day SMAs  As I suggested the last two weeks  if SPY can t break out through the top of the rising channel  it might cycle back down towards the bottom of the channel for a sixth time  Some technicians are calling this a triple top sell signal  but I m not at all convinced  It just needs more volume  We ll see if it can hold up long enough for the reinforcements to come back from vacation  Perhaps in the meantime it will continue to work off some of those overbought indicators  The VIX  CBOE Market Volatility Index a k a   fear gauge   continues to fall  closing Wednesday at 14 63 after coming within a whisker of taking out the 52 week lows from March at 13 66  I suggested last week that it appeared ready to make a push down through 15 to challenge the lows  No signs of the investor anxiety you would expect  given the global economic situation  Latest sector rankings  The table ranks each of the ten U S  industrial sector iShares  ETFs  by Sabrient s proprietary Outlook Score  which employs a forward looking  fundamentals based  quantitative algorithm to create a bottom up composite profile of the constituent stocks within the ETF  In addition  the table also shows Sabrient s proprietary Bull Score and Bear Score for each ETF  High Bull score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended recently toward relative outperformance during particularly strong market periods  while a high Bear score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended to hold up relatively well during particularly weak market periods  Bull and Bear are backward looking indicators of recent sentiment trend  As a group  these three scores can be quite helpful for positioning a portfolio for a given set of anticipated market conditions  Observations  1  Technology  IYW  regains the second spot with an Outlook score of 77  Stocks within IYW are displaying relatively low forward P Es  strong projected long term growth  and solid return ratios  Healthcare  IYH  moves up to second place with a 74  while Financial  IYF  falls to third this week with an Outlook score of 67  The mild shuffling is primarily due to shifting support among analysts  who have been revising earnings estimates up and down during earnings season  2  There is a 19 point gap down to fourth place Consumer Goods  IYK  at 48  Only IYW  IYH  and IYF are scoring above the 50 mid point level  and the range from top to bottom is only 54  which is relatively narrow  Also  defensive sectors like IYK and Utilities  IDU  are scoring in the middle of the pack  I think all of this reflects a cautious tone among analysts  particularly given recent market strength and the slow growth economy  You no doubt have been reading about lowered earnings projections  and it is reflected here  as well  as most of the sectors are seeing net downgrades  Overall  I would say these rankings are neutral  rather than bullish or bearish   3  Telecom  IYZ  stays at the bottom of the Outlook rankings this week with an Outlook score of 23  It retains surprisingly good support from Wall Street  but stocks within IYZ are held back by the highest forward P E and the worst return ratios  Basic Materials  IYM  is in the bottom two with a score of 28 as it continues to be hampered by cuts in Wall Street s earnings estimates  but still reflects the lowest forward P E  4  Looking at the Bull scores  Energy  IYE  is the clear leader on strong market days  scoring 63  Utilities  IDU  is still by far the weakest on strong days  scoring 39  In other words  Energy stocks have tended to perform the best when the market is rallying  while Utilities stocks have lagged  5  Looking at the Bear scores  Utilities  IDU  remains the strong investor favorite  safe haven  on weak market days  scoring 64  Materials  IYM  has been abandoned  relatively speaking  by investors during market weakness  as reflected by its low Bear score of 41  followed by Energy  IYE  at 42  In other words  Materials stocks have tended to sell off the most when the market is pulling back  while Utilities stocks have held up the best  6  Overall  Technology  IYW  now shows the best all weather combination of Outlook Bull Bear scores  Adding up the three scores gives a total of 175  Materials  IYM  is the worst at 126  As for Bull Bear combination  Materials  IYM  and Tech  IYW  share the worst at 98  while Telecom  IYZ  and Energy  IYE  tie for the best with 105  These scores represent the view that the Technology and Healthcare sectors may be relatively undervalued overall  while Telecom and Materials sectors may be relatively overvalued based on our 1 3 month forward look  Top ranked stocks within Technology and Healthcare sectors include Western Digital  WDC   Symantec  SYMC   United Therapeutics  UTHR   and PDL BioPharma  PDLI     About SectorCast  Rankings are based on Sabrient s SectorCast model  which builds a composite profile of each equity ETF based on bottom up scoring of the constituent stocks  The Outlook Score employs a fundamentals based multi factor approach considering forward valuation  earnings growth prospects  Wall Street analysts  consensus revisions  accounting practices  and various return ratios  It has tested to be highly predictive for identifying the best  most undervalued  and worst  most overvalued  sectors  with a one month forward look    Bull Score and Bear Score are based on the price behavior of the underlying stocks on particularly strong and weak days during the prior 40 market days  They reflect investor sentiment toward the stocks  on a relative basis  as either aggressive plays or safe havens  So  a high Bull score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended recently toward relative outperformance during particularly strong market periods  while a high Bear score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended to hold up relatively well during particularly weak market periods  Thus  ETFs with high Bull scores generally perform better when the market is hot  ETFs with high Bear scores generally perform better when the market is weak  and ETFs with high Outlook scores generally perform well over time in various market conditions  Of course  each ETF has a unique set of constituent stocks  so the sectors represented will score differently depending upon which set of ETFs is used  For Sector Detector  I use ten iShares ETFs representing the major U S  business sectors    About Trading Strategies  There are various ways to trade these rankings  First  you might run a sector rotation strategy in which you buy long the top 2 4 ETFs from SectorCast ETF  rebalancing either on a fixed schedule  e g   monthly or quarterly  or when the rankings change significantly  Another alternative is to enhance a position in the SPDR Trust exchange traded fund  SPY  depending upon your market bias  If you are bullish on the broad market  you can go long the SPY and enhance it with additional long positions in the top ranked sector ETFs  Conversely  if you are bearish and short  or buy puts on  the SPY  you could also consider shorting the two lowest ranked sector ETFs to enhance your short bias  However  if you prefer not to bet on market direction  you could try a market neutral  long short trade that is  go long  or buy call options on  the top ranked ETFs and short  or buy put options on  the lowest ranked ETFs  And here s a more aggressive strategy to consider  You might trade some of the highest and lowest ranked stocks from within those top and bottom ranked ETFs  such as the ones I identify above Disclosure  Author has no positions in stocks or ETFs mentioned ,2012-08-16,Scott

44089,265604,NLOK,Pandemic Cyber Security Failures  Historic Opportunity for Investors,opinion,Cyber Security failures in the Western World have reached a pandemic stage  Research conducted by the National Security Agency  NSA   in conjunction with the Department of Defense  FBI  Department of State  local law enforcement  civilian security agencies  and large security providers such as Mandiant and McAfee have shown that government and industry alike suffer from poor security practices  The result of the research  published by the Center for Strategic and International Studies at the request of Congress  led to the establishment of the for government and private networks alike  The data used in the study consisted of actual verifiable attacks  and only controls designed to stop those attacks were included in the framework  The US Department of State implemented these controls in 2009  and confirmed an 88  attack threat mitigation across their network systems For security professionals  these 20 critical security controls will not look new  Indeed  the NSA recommended security practices conjoin many top traditional security practices already codified in leading professional security standards such as National Institute of Standards and Technology  NIST    The alarming aspect of the study is that while competent security standards for protecting America s networks and systems had already been developed  the standards have been poorly implemented across the country Some examples of large security breaches resulting from poor security practices include a recent Distributed Denial of Service Attack which clogged Internet lines leading Matthew Prince  Chief Executive of Cloud Flare  to compare the attack to a nuclear bomb Sony in a 2011 Playstation network security breach  Sony has lost over total due to compromised network security Here is a graphic showing some of the largest reported data breaches to date Security experts note that the majority of security breaches never go reported  What s more alarming is that for networks lacking proper diagnostic tools and well seasoned and trained security professionals  many security breaches go undetected From my discussions with top security professionals at leading security organizations  including Big 4 consulting and assurance companies  software such as Antivirus and Intrusion Detection and Prevention  IDS IPS  are currently only marginally effective at catching security threats  Some estimate that software stops malware only 15 20  of the time  The reason for this is that programmed security solutions can only address known attack methods  Variants of popular attacks and new malware creations slide by many popular security software products  In addition  many security solutions are installed out of the box with little modification or customization to the needs of each network  leading to reduced or ineffective defense Sophos has estimated that a new virus or malware is created every half second  which adds up to more than   While hackers previously sought notoriety for their exploits  many different types of hackers exist now  Many of them are quietly looking for network security weaknesses to commit industrial espionage  steal secrets from computing governments  get paid for finding weaknesses  or become hacktivists protesting perceived societal wrongdoing  These attackers aren t going to publicize their methods  which is why reports of popular viruses like Melissa have all but disappeared in the mainstream television media  Reports of security breaches have once again been relegated to security journals and online blogs  away from the purview of most Americans Other Security StandardsIn addition to the NSA research  the  collects community vulnerability information in order to enumerate that information into automated vulnerability management  measurement  and police compliance  SCAP has found similar vulnerabilities as determined in NSA research  Australia s Defence Signals Directorate  DSD  found 4 primary and 35 secondary security controls that effectively mitigate security attacks  The 4 primary controls can be implemented at a a relatively small cost for most organizations  While the cost of security can be effectively streamlined  the cost of security breaches is rising significantly A recent that breaches involving social security numbers or credit cards cost companies  7 million per incident  A large part of the cost included a patchwork of state and federal requirements to report and respond to security threats  Congress has been trying to set a unified standard in 2009  but the bill has yet to pass What now Recent developments by some leading security companies show promise in thwarting Internet attacks  For instance  Fireeye has developed a learning system that collects data on existing attacks from their subscribers using their custom tools  While hackers previously had the upper hand in combining security known weaknesses into highly complex attacks  Fireeye tools use the same method of sharing security breaches with each other to raise the defense profile of each of the subscribers on the network quickly In addition  HP has developed software to link operational system logs with security event logging  enabling network operations and security to unite in common defense of corporate networks  Eliminating functional silos in network operations and security means more coordinated and efficient defenses against attackers Lastly  Cisco and VMware have teamed up to develop networking gear that integrates network firewall defenses with virtual computing used in cloud deployments  Current cloud configurations have patchwork security systems pulled from legacy network technologies  Security holes plague these legacy network implementations  but that is about to change as new technologies are adopted InvestmentsInformed technology investors promise to benefit from companies that develop next generation security technology  Any development that specifically addresses efficient security threat mitigation while being kind to corporate bottom lines will capture market share quickly  While companies want better security  they have to balance expenditures with product results VMware  VMW  provides a cloud solution for companies wanting to reduce data center expenditures by virtualizing systems to maximize computing power over available hardware resources  VMWare has a very mature product  that is well documented and used by thousands of companies  This market dominance ensures properly trained VMware administrators are in abundant supply  The company sports a very solid healthy balance sheet with much higher assets than liabilities  In addition  they trade at a reasonable multiple to their book value VMware has raised their security profile in ESXi version 5  including improvements to the administrative access module and system patching efficiencies  In addition  VMware s partnership with Cisco hardware networking products provides a robust  integrated security solution with a hardware provider that dominates the corporate LAN network device space Competitors include the hot OpenStack open source cloud computing software  based upon the Linux operating system  Costs for adoption of OpenStack software are cheaper than VMware  but the system is newer and not as well documented  Costs for OpenStack are shifted from licensing to Engineering  In addition  OpenStack is not a hypervisor  so it will rely on other software such as VMware or KVM  For larger cloud implementations  OpenStack is expected to reduce costs  VMware provides advanced features that the company feels warrant their licensing fees and will likely appeal to more small to mid size adopters of cloud technology VMware has already done a good job of reducing costs for its platform as well  At the end of the day  this battle reminds of Windows versus Linux in the server market  Both platforms have seen robust growth and have served needs in the marketplace alongside each other  Most companies run both Linux and Windows servers  and I expect in a similar way VMware and OpenStack will coexist as solutions in the cloud space VMware has solid upside and the company has announced higher profitability targets for 2014   2015  Recent earnings have disappointed  but these include divestitures and R D expenditure that position the company for robust future growth Sourcefire  FIRE  provides IDS IPS subscription software for Intrusion Detection and Prevention  The company has a large market share and is a quality  proven product  As far as intrusion prevention goes  Sourcefire is a top quality product  They have not developed a community based approach to threat updates like Fireeye  which should emerging as a key threat to Sourcefire s business  Right now the stock is too expensive  but the company is key to the current security marketplace Symantec  SYMC  owns domestic corporate software  a storage division  and consulting services  The company has been losing share in the corporate market and therefore revenues and profits have been flat  On the plus side  this company is very well positioned financially and is still recognize as an industry leader  The company has begun focusing on their consumer market by renewing relationships with distributors  They have also announced entry into the mobile device security market which is crowded with several AV providers including names like McAfee and AVG  Symantec will have to figure out how to differentiate them in the mobile market while they strengthen consumer and corporate offerings  Symantec can avoid a RIMM type collapse by increasing product innovation and avoiding unnecessary acquisitions Fortinet  FTNT  offers an integrated suite of soft and hardware security products for IDS  firewall  VPN  network load balancing  application management  and vulnerability scanning  This product mix concentrates on sensitive security control areas highlighted by NSA research  However  there are many other vendors in the same product space  Fortinet has won the efficiency of firewall and IDS security products  Fortinet  strategy is to become an end to end network layer management and security provider and has recently moved up in market share  The balance sheet is fantastic  but revenues are expected to flat line in 2013 as the company concentrates on developing their cloud portfolio TakeAwaysCompanies that innovate and fill holes in the security sector should profit handsomely  Government and corporate networks are in dire need of effective security practices performed efficiently  and will look to leading security firms to provide scalable solutions  In addition to a maturing product portfolio  IT leaders would do well to strengthen focus on security by hiring technicians with a proven security background  such as Information Assurance and Security professionals  Alignment of Information Security Officers atop corporate IT systems will drive mature security practices ,2013-04-05,Robert

145307,366822,NLOK,Analysts Estimate NortonLifeLock  NLOK  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"The market expects NortonLifeLock  NLOK  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 6  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This security software maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 08 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  81 8  
Revenues are expected to be  607 03 million  down 50 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2 22  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for NortonLifeLock 
For NortonLifeLock  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  12 50  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that NortonLifeLock will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that NortonLifeLock would post earnings of  0 42 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 18  delivering a surprise of  57 14  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported
