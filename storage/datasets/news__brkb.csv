155958,377474,BRKb,Gold Firms On Trade Concerns  Saudi Arabia To Increase Oil Production,opinion,"Typically  after a week of intense market moves following a volatile FOMC day and a booming nonfarm payroll number  the next trading week has lots of follow through momentum  That is not this week  as President Trump intensifies the pressure for securing a trade deal this week  otherwise  China will see tariffs rise from 10  to 25   The weekend also produced major updates from Warren Buffett s Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKb   NYSE BRKa  earnings  which saw more stock repurchases and a surging stock cash pile which is ready for more acquisitions  and their annual meeting  continued tensions in Venezuela and missile testing returns from North Korea  Busy geopolitical events will likely cloud a week that is full of important live rate decisions from the RBA and RBNZ 
Trade   Trump s tariff increase threat
RBA And RBNZ   Easing watch alert
Korea   The North tests missiles again
Oil   Saudis to increase production
Gold   Firms up on trade concerns
Trade
It appears the trade truce between China and the US is coming to a close  as President Trump decided to press on the tariff accelerator  in hopes of expediting a framework agreement for a trade deal to be outlined by Friday  Trump s tweet shows his frustration with the speed of talks and China s attempts to renegotiate  Talks resume in Washington DC on Wednesday when China s top negotiator Liu He meets Lighthizer and Mnuchin for what is hoped to be the last round of talks before a final meeting between Xi and Trump 
Markets have heavily priced in a trade deal and Trump s increased tariff threat may be unsettling for risk appetite for the start of the trading week  If talks completely fall off a cliff  we could see major pressure for US stocks  who are just a stone s throw from record highs 

RBA And RBNZ
Commodity currencies are trading sharply lower following Trump s tariff threat and growing bets that we could see a fresh round of rate cuts from the RBA and RBNZ  Both central banks are having live meetings  while expectations are slightly higher for the RBNZ to cut  while the RBA may decide to push it off to the next meeting 
The RBA decision happens Wednesday  and the bank could downgrade their forecasts following softer Australian and Chinese data over the past month  While inflation has softened  economic growth and building approvals saw steep declines  retails sales  consumer confidence and employment change all posted significant rebounds 
The RBNZ has seen there domestic economy deteriorate a little worse than what the RBA has seen for their own  The labor market is showing signs of weakening and dismal wage growth might warrant two rate cuts this year by the RBNZ 

Korea
North Korea fired short range ballistic missiles over the weekend  the first time since 2017  North Korean leader Kim Jong un attended the test which is a new type of tactical guided weapon  Kim appears to be trying to get Trump s attention to return to the table for sanction relief  Talks fell apart in February and many analysts do not expect a successful return of denuclearization talks between the US and North Korea  US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo stated there is still a path forward for negotiations and that the tests this week did not pose a threat to the US or South Korea 
Oil
Saudi Arabia is expected to deliver an increase in production to make up for the Iran disruptions  Saudi Aramco has raised their prices to Asia and Europe while cutting prices to the US  Crude prices for Arab light are at the highest premium since July and current demand seems to be strong enough to handle the increase in Europe and Asia 
The focus has now shifted back to what will OPEC and allies do regarding their production cut agreement  OPEC not only needs to worry about a major reversal with oil prices  but they need to make sure they stay relevant and do not see members abandon the cartel  Crude prices may only stabilize on the announcement of a production cut extension by OPEC   
Improving demand globally will prevent any major selloff  but it appears bullish bet on crude may be over positioned and we could see an easier path lower for prices  Production is expected to increase from the big three  American  Saudis and Russians  an environment that will be difficult for crude trade much higher  despite a slowly developing rebound in global demand 
On the Venezuelan front  opposition leader Juan Guaido noted he will not rule the option of working with US military  a move that would be frowned by most of the nation s neighbors  Last week s failed attempt by Guaido to overthrow Maduro was a major blow  The talk of working with the US may just be political posturing  but it could do Guaido political harm in long run  If he is to defeat Maduro with US help  it would undermine his presidency 

Gold
The precious metal got a slight boost from the market concerns that a trade deal between China and the US should not be fully priced in  The yellow metal has underperformed on the overall improvement with global growth concerns and accommodative stances from most of the major central banks  Further easing from the RBA and RBNZ could provide an additional backdrop for higher gold prices  but it may be short lived if we continue to see a rebound in Europe

155962,377478,BRKb,Does Warren Buffet Believe The Market Will Crash ,opinion,"Warren Buffett s flagship firm Berkshire Hathaway B  NYSE BRKb  reported its second quarter earnings on August 3rd  2019  Earnings per share  EPS  came in lower than the expected 2 71  at 2 50  This makes the most recent report for the company a  miss  by 7 75  
Despite this  revenues went up relative to 2018 s Q2 and thanks to the general market s highly positive second quarter their stock portfolio performed quite well 
Everything considered  BRK s earnings flew under the radar 
But truly  they should not have  Because hiding under the surface  Buffett s hugely bearish sentiment was revealed by a mountain of cash 
Coming in at a record breaking  122 4 billion  it s the largest cash reserve ever maintained by Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa  
This is something that really ought to have caught analysts off guard  In order to make money  Buffett needs to put that cash into capital  His company based in Omaha  Nebraska is an investment firm  after all 
What other purpose would the cash be used for 
During the past three and a half years since acquiring Precision Castparts  Buffett hasn t made any significant purchases 
Instead  they ve been slowly hoarding dollars since then 
But investors didn t see such all time high cash and cash equivalent numbers until the 2019 Q2 earnings report was announced  illustrating that there s been considerable cutbacks on direct investments and acquisitions from Berkshire Hathaway 
Because over anything else  Buffett believes a serious equity crunch is on its way  Certainly something that could scatter bulls to the wind  but maybe not a full blown recession  
During the course of his illustrious as perhaps the most successful investor in the world  Buffett s empire was built by finding value where others could not 
Undoubtedly  being able to identify undervalued investments is the thing he does best 
And nowadays  his large cash reserves could be interpreted to mean that he doesn t see value anywhere in the market 
We ve talked about this here before   the idea that across the board  equities are undervalued  In spite of tech reckoning at the hands of the FTC and a lukewarm earnings season  investors continued to buy in Q1 and Q2 2019 
 The needle couldn t even be tipped by a  5 billion fine imposed against Facebook  NASDAQ FB   one of the NASDAQ Composite biggest companies  In fact  Nasdaq stocks rose even higher 
That is  until the late July rate cut  which could possibly have returned equities down to a level that finally has Buffett ready to go long  Berkshire Hathaway was actually a net seller of stocks during the first half of the year  meaning Buffett might have been selling in preparation for a damaging correction 
Which  as you ve now noticed  has run the market ragged during the past week 
So  while Q2 s earnings demonstrated that the  Oracle  NYSE ORCL  of Omaha  wasn t buying the recovery hype  it does not translate to him being at the point of bailing on the market altogether 
Instead  it indicates that he s just waiting for prices to fall before he makes his move  We ll likely see Berkshire Hathaway leverage their cash reserves in a significant way once stocks fall into undervalued territory  however low that may be  
Of course  the company s Q3 earnings report will tell the tale  and it wouldn t be all that surprising if that s what s revealed by the financials   a strategy involving buying big after a rough patch 
Interest rate uncertainty along with trade war drama has equities enduring hard times  But in Buffett s eyes  that s something to be celebrated 
Because when everyone else has cashed out their chips  he ll still be doubling down  and betting that the general market went overboard yet again  It s been a winning play for him and his company for decades 
And for as long as he s able to identify big time value  there s nothing to suggest that it won t continue to achieve impressive gains going forward ",2019-08-09,Michael James,https://www.investing.com/analysis/does-warren-buffet-believe-the-market-will-crash-200453877,200453877

155972,377488,BRKb,3 Stocks To Watch In The Coming Week  Macy s  Home Depot  Berkshire Hathaway,opinion,"Next week will bring a mix of both company and macro specific news for investors  It will be the week when President Trump has to decide  before March 1  whether he wants to extend the tariff deadline on Chinese goods  depending on the progress on crucial trade negotiations between the two global powers 
Investors will also be focusing on the the two days of economic testimony from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to get some idea about his latest thinking on the direction of interest rates  He appears before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday  then a House committee Wednesday for the semiannual testimony 
On the corporate side  most of the major earnings reports are out of the way  but there remain a few closely watched companies which have to prove that they are on the right track as far as future growth 
1  Macy s
The U S  retail store giant  Macy s Inc   NYSE M  is scheduled to report its fourth quarter results on Tuesday  Feb  26 before the market opens  On average  analysts are expecting  2 52 a share profit  down from  2 82 a year ago  Sales are expected to fall 2 5  to  8 45 billion 

Its fourth quarter earnings report will be an important one for investors hoping to determine whether this national department store chain is on track to show a sustainable turnaround after many years of disappointing performance  In particular  growth in same store sales will be the critical number that must show improvement  especially since U S  consumer sentiment remained strong last year  In our view  the company s future guidance will hold the key to Macy s stock performance after its report 
Shares of the retailer  which closed Friday at  24 06  have lost more than 42  of their value since reaching the 52 high of  41 99 in early August  suggesting investors don t have much faith in the company s future  To attract more customers to its stores and combat e tail giants such as Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   Macy s has increased its online offering  added in store  off price sections called Backstage to its brick and mortar venues  and expanded its Bluemercury beauty chain 
Tuesday will provide yet another chance for Macy s to show that its turnaround is durable 
2  Home Depot
The hardware and household improvement chain  Home Depot  NYSE HD   will also be reporting fourth quarter earnings on Tuesday before the open  Analysts  on average  expect a 28  jump in earnings to  2 16 a share on sales of  26 57 billion 

The world s largest home improvement chain has pursued a variety of successful strategies during the past few years to fuel growth and benefit from strong consumer spending  In the third quarter  Home Depot beat estimates for the 18th straight quarter  dating back to the beginning of 2014 
Going forward  it might not be such smooth sailing  Cost pressures are rising and housing markets are softening in many regions of the U S 
After a remarkable run over the past five years  during which Home Depot shares which closed on Friday at 192 39 gained more than 162   the stock has weakened since September  Though shares are down 3  in the past six months  they re still up 134  from where they started in 2014  In our view  another blowout quarter and strong forecast for 2019 might break the current bearish spell 
3  Berkshire Hathaway
The world s most successful value investor  Warren Buffett  released his annual letter to investors over the weekend  It also contained the quarterly earnings report of his diversified insurance and investment firm  Berkshire Hathaway Inc   NYSE BRKa   NYSE BRKb  

The investment arm of Buffett s company suffered a whopping  25 billion net loss in the past quarter  mainly driven by  27 6 billion in unrealized losses from Berkshire s investment portfolio 
The Oracle of Omaha has warned investors to pay more attention to underlying operating figures  since accounting rules now incorporate unrealized gains and losses from stocks into net income 
The number is too big to ignore  As well  it might affect the company s shares which are struggling to continue their upward trajectory as Buffett confronts the problem of finding his next big acquisition  At  201 91 per share as of Friday s close  Berkshire s stock has barely budged in the past one year 
 Prices are sky high for businesses possessing decent long term prospects   Buffett wrote in his annual letter to investors  Still he says his firm may buy more publicly traded shares in 2019   We continue  nevertheless  to hope for an elephant sized acquisition  
Despite Buffett s soothing words to investors  it s hard to ignore the effect to Berkshire s investment portfolio of such troubled assets as consumer staple Kraft Heinz  NASDAQ KHC   where writedowns in Q4 touched  15 4 billion  As its biggest shareholder  Buffett s stake took a  2 7 billion markdown ",2019-02-24,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-stocks-to-watch-in-the-coming-week-macys-home-depot-berkshire-hathaway-200391866,200391866

156000,377516,BRKb,Comparing Berkshire Hathaway A And B Shares,opinion,"Since Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa  A shares are currently valued at about  250 000 per share  the overwhelming majority of the purchasers are likely to be institutions such as pensions funds  mutual funds  hedge funds  or ETF s  with the remainder being purchased by relatively wealthy individuals  However  this has not always been the case  In 1980  for example  Berkshire sold for only about  300 per share  and in 1985 for  2 000 per share  Individuals likely comprised a majority of early investors in Berkshire 
Since Warren Buffett has mentioned that Berkshire attracts long term investors and has the lowest turnover of shares of any company traded on the New York Stock Exchange  a large percentage of these shares may still reside with individual investors The Berkshire Hathaway B  NYSE BRKb  shares were first issued in May  1996 at  1 000 per share  with the original Berkshire shares  now referred to as A shares  valued at  30 000 per share  In effect  the B shares represented a 30 to 1 stock split  In January  2010  the B shares were then split again  this time 50 to 1 in conjunction with Berkshire s acquisition of Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad 
At that time  Berkshire s A shares sold for  120 000 per share  and the B shares sold for  80 per share  As a result  each Berkshire A share is valued at 1 500 times each B share  Berkshire s B shares were then included for the first time in the S P 500 Index because of their increased liquidity resulting from a much lower price and many more shares outstanding  Currently  about 200 shares of Berkshire A are traded each day  With an approximate market value of  250 000 per share  that represents a daily dollar volume of about  50 million  By contrast  approximately 4 million shares of Berkshire B are traded each day 
At a recent price of  167 per share  this represents a daily dollar volume of  670 million  or approximately 13 times that of the A shares  There are currently 1 64 million Berkshire A shares  including B share equivalent shares  outstanding resulting in a total market capitalization of  410 billion  which recently resulted in Berkshire being ranked as the fifth largest company in the S P 500 According to Yahoo  NASDAQ YHOO  Finance  the major holders of Berkshire A shares are

Similarly  the major holders of Berkshire B shares are

Breakdown

From these tables  institutions and mutual fund holders own only 27  of the A shares  but 64  of the B shares  That can be explained by insiders and 5  owners holding 41  of the A shares and less than 1  of the B shares  According to Berkshire s Notice of Annual Meeting of Shareholders May 6  2017  Warren Buffett beneficially owned 38 3  of the A shares as of March 8  2017  The insiders primarily accumulated their shares in the 1960 s and 1970 s when Berkshire traded at less than  100 per share 
It should be noted  however  that these tables imply that individuals  other than insiders  hold about 31  of the A shares and 35  of the B shares  The 1 500 to 1 stock split has resulted in opening up ownership in Berkshire to individual investors for as little as  167  May  2017  for one class B share vs   250 000 per class A share

156001,377517,BRKb,Why Is Warren Buffett Holding So Much Cash ,opinion,"Warren Buffett s Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa   NYSE BRKb  has a few dollars burning a hole in its pocket 
And it s sending a strong message to Mr  Market  In Buffett s view  the valuations of large cap and megacap companies are too high 
But that doesn t mean the rest of the market is  There are still a few value plays available to regular investors  You just have to think smaller 
As this week s chart shows  Berkshire Hathaway s cash position has more than doubled since 2008  It now sits at  96 5 billion  Cash on the balance sheet has been steadily rising for the last five quarters 
A Victim of Its Own Success
Buffett likes to keep  20 billion in cash on hand  That way  Berkshire Hathaway always has plenty of firepower available when it runs across an attractive acquisition candidate 
It s having trouble finding companies to buy  That s why the company has 4 8 times its preferred stockpile sitting on the books 
Berkshire Hathaway is a victim of its own success 
Its market cap has grown to around  400 billion  And as the company has gotten bigger  so  too  have the sizes of the companies it must acquire to move the needle  Today  Berkshire Hathaway s target acquisition size is  5 billion to  20 billion 
It s been 15 months since the company made a significant acquisition 
This led some Buffett watchers to speculate that the legendary value investor is done making megamergers 
And at Berkshire Hathaway s annual meeting  Buffett fanned the flames when he hinted that the company s stock might pay a dividend soon 
If Buffett can t grow his shareholders  money by investing it  then eventually  he ll have to return it to them 
But that doesn t mean Berkshire Hathaway isn t making any acquisitions  It s still buying quality companies at compelling prices 
Berkshire Hathaway s Silent Additions Signal Midcap Opportunities
The company makes dozens of smaller acquisitions each year  Most of the time  though  the public never hears about them 
These acquisitions are typically  bolt ons  or  tuck ins  made by Berkshire Hathaway s subsidiaries  Their sizes fall below Berkshire Hathaway s  5 billion threshold 
In other words  these midcap acquisitions aren t large enough to require Buffett to disclose the details to shareholders  So most investors don t hear a lot about them 
But Berkshire Hathaway s operating CEOs buy dozens of them every year 
This shows that Buffett is still finding deep value plays in this market  The businesses are just smaller 
So ignore the bearish sentiment surrounding Berkshire Hathaway s growing cash hoard    and take a hint from the company instead 
Rather than trying to squeeze value out of expensive megacap stocks  look downstream to midcap shares  You ll find many of them are priced right 
Alexander Green shares Buffett s outlook on value investing  He knows that in today s market  midcap stocks have much more room to grow than blue chips do  That s why Alex created the   It s a collection of fundamentally sound midcap stocks whose prices are set to rise 10 fold or more ",2017-05-21,Investment U,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-is-warren-buffett-holding-so-much-cash-200190373,200190373
156002,377518,BRKb,Store Capital  Warren Buffett s REIT Pick,opinion,"Thank you  Mr  Warren Buffett 
On Tuesday  up and coming triple net retail REIT STORE Capital  NYSE STOR  got a major boost when the company announced that Buffett s Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa   NYSE BRKb  recently purchased nearly 10  of the company 
Prior to the announcement  STORE had been having a rough year  Amazon s  NASDAQ AMZN  assault on traditional brick and mortar retail has been unrelenting and investors have responded by dumping high quality  triple net retail REITs like STORE 
Hey  I get it  As we saw with Spirit Realty Capital  NYSE SRC   a struggling retail tenant can cause major headaches for a landlord  and investors worry that this is only the tip of the iceberg  But as is typical  they ve overreacted and thrown out the baby with the bathwater 
To start  about two thirds of STORE s portfolio is invested in properties that cater to services  including everything from movie theaters to preschools  The remaining third is split roughly evenly between retail properties and light industrial properties 
Unless Jeff Bezos can find a way to deliver your children via aerial drone to Amazon operated preschools   it could happen   STORE would seem pretty close to Amazon proof 
It s also worth noting that STORE s insiders have been steady buyers of the stock 

While I would never buy a stock purely because its insiders were buying  I definitely see it as a major positive  The people running the company are generally going to have a better grasp of its competitive challenges than passive investors reacting to news headlines 
At any rate  it will be interesting to see if Mr  Buffett s purchase causes a wide scale reevaluation of triple net retail REITs or if this was simply a one off event that will quickly fade  But while we re waiting for the market to handicap all of this  I m happy to continue collecting the 5 6  dividend indefinitely

156003,377519,BRKb,Time For Berkshire Hathaway To Start Final Wave 5,opinion,"The price formation  ratios are text book impulsive in Berkshire Hathaway B  NYSE BRKb  and I believe there are many chances wave 4 is complete and we have started a wave 5 move that will eventually bring price towards 200   First target is around 193   Wave 3 is 161 8  of wave 1  wave 4 retraced wave 3 by 38   wave 5 is expected to move close or higher from the 61 8  wave 1 to 3 distance  The entire upward move from 2016 lows looks incomplete and a new high is needed to complete the sequence 




Wave 5 could also have different targets according to the relationship it may have with wave 1  Below is the most probable area where I expect wave 5 of 5 to complete

156004,377520,BRKb,Berkshire s Double Divergence Spells Trouble,opinion,"Berkshire Hathaway s  NYSE BRKb  shareholders are not like the owners of other public companies  By following Warren Buffett s long term approach  most of them stay with the company in good times and bad  regardless of what the market is doing with the price of the stock  Nevertheless  it pays to be prepared 
The last time we wrote about Berkshire was on November 25th  2016  Almost nine months ago  while the stock was trading slightly below  160 a share   analysis suggested the bulls should be able to reach  170  only to complete the five wave  pattern  which has been in progress since the low in 2009  According to the theory  every impulse is followed by a three wave correction in the opposite direction 
 is already approaching the  180 mark  so obviously we underestimated the strength of the uptrend  But does this mean the overall outlook has changed and we should no longer expect a decline  The updated chart below might help us find out 

The monthly chart of Berkshire stock shows that the entire advance since March 2009 still looks like a textbook impulse  Furthermore  the relative strength index shows the typical bearish divergence between waves  5  and  3   indicating the bulls are slowly but surely running out of power 
Usually  the negative phase of the cycle drags the price back to the support area of the fourth wave  Here  this means that once wave  5  ends  BRK B stock should plunge to the zone between  130 and  120 a share  What is left of wave  5  then 

The weekly chart above allows us to take a look at the wave structure of wave  5   As you can see  it too looks like a complete five wave pattern  The sub waves of wave 3 of  5  are also clearly visible  And  just like on the previous chart  the RSI indicator shows a bearish divergence between the last two high in wave 5 and 3 of  5  
Even the best of companies  one of which Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa  undoubtedly is  are not immuned to market declines  as the 2007 2009 period clearly demonstrated  Long term shareholder should probably stay true to they philosophy and hold BRK B no matter what  but for those  who are yet to join Mr  Buffett s boat   180 might turn out to be a very inappropriate level to buy in ",2017-08-07,EWM Interactive,https://www.investing.com/analysis/berkshires-double-divergence-spells-trouble-200205619,200205619
156005,377521,BRKb,Berkshire Hathaway Class A Shares At  1 000 000 In 16 Years  ,opinion,"At a recent celebration of the 100th Anniversary of Forbes Magazine   that the Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJIA  will reach 1 000 000 in 100 years  Since the DJIA is currently at 22 350  this would require a compounded annual return of 3 9  over this time period 
If the DJIA will reach 1 000 000 in 100 years  then how long will it take for Warren Buffett s Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa   class A  shares to reach  1 000 000  At their closing price of  273 139 on September 22  2017  these shares will reach this target price in 16 years if Berkshire matches its compounded annual gain in its price per share of 8 5  that it has achieved over the past 10 years  If its growth rate matches that of the S P 500 with dividends included over the past 50 years of 9 7   Berkshire will reach  1 000 000 in 14 years 
Berkshire s compounded growth rate in share price over its 52 year history has equaled 20 8  per annum  Since this performance has more than doubled that of the S P 500 over this time period  it is not unreasonable for Berkshire to continue to outperform this index and reach  1 000 000 per share sooner 
Berkshire Hathaway s assets are largely comprised of over 90 largely autonomously managed companies in numerous industries  Its businesses are well managed as is its portfolio of common stocks  With  100 billion in cash on its balance sheet and generating over  1 billion in free cash flow per month  Berkshire is likely to make major additions to both its stable of companies as well as its common stock portfolio  These additional investments will provide a steady source of growth in earnings as well as to its share price over time 
Warren Buffett s magic number of 1 000 000 will be achieved for Berkshire s common stock long before it is attained for the DJIA 
 Note  Berkshire Hathaway class B shares  NYSE BRKb  closed on September 22  2017 at  181 86  Since they are valued at 1 1 500 of each class A share  their price when Berkshire class A shares reach  1 000 000 would be  666 67 per class B share  ",2017-09-24,David Kass,https://www.investing.com/analysis/berkshire-hathaway-class-a-shares-at-1000000-in-16-years-200215005,200215005

So far  the form of BRK B s rise is almost identical to text book formations  Too good to be true  Well it is what it is  So what s next 
Even if we zoom in closer  the price formation of the wave 5 seems very close to completion  if it has not already done so 

Wave 4 does not overlap with the high of wave 1  What will indicate that this trend is over  The first warning we got is from the RSI in the daily chart 

Important bearish divergence signs in the RSI and MACD  Another bearish sign will be if price breaks below  185 97 and an even stronger one will come if price breaks below  183 80  In case price confirms our view and starts the bearish reversal  we should pay attention to the form of the decline because an impulsive decline will be a bearish sign  while a corrective form of a pull back could imply that we are just seeing a correction and the up trend will resume

156037,377553,BRKb,Why Stocks May Be Even Less Attractive Than Record Low Bonds,opinion,"I recently detailed why using the  Fed Model  to buy stocks has never been more dangerous  In this post  I want to demonstrate another method that shows why stocks aren t attractive relative to bonds right now 
Way back in 1992  Warren Buffett wrote about   In his letter to Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKb  shareholders that year  he suggested investors ought to simply weigh the valuations of stocks versus bonds and buy whichever is more attractive  That only sounds rational  right 
Looking at bonds today  the 10 Year Treasury currently yields 1 6   Not great but it is what it is  And that s the easy part of this two fold process  Determining what stocks are likely to return over the next decade is a bit more difficult 
But Warren gives us an effective tool for this process as well  His favorite valuation indicator for the broad stock market total market cap to GDP is very highly correlated with future 10 year returns in the stock market  Whenever stocks have been very highly valued  forward returns have been very poor and vice versa 

Right now  this indicator once again shows the broad stock market to be very highly valued  In fact  it is so highly valued that it forecasts a negative average annual return over the coming decade  So while bonds  super low yields appear to be very unattractive  according to this measure  stocks  prospective returns are even worse 

Of course nobody really knows what the coming decade holds for these or any other asset classes  That said  history suggests that both are very highly valued and likely to disappoint investors expecting any sort of real return at all 
So the real question investors should be asking themselves is   what sort of risk am I taking in heavily owning stocks or bonds in attempting to achieve little or no return over the next 10 years  ",2016-06-15,Jesse Felder,https://www.investing.com/analysis/warren-buffett’s-favorite-valuation-tool-shows-stocks-are-even-less-200136004,200136004

Berkshire s Earnings  A Surprise Boost From Kraft Heinz  But an Off Year at Geico
Warren Buffett Attacks Wall Street Over  Phony  Earnings   

Buffett says it s possible that the offending analysts  don t know better   But more likely  Buffett says  the analysts go along with the phony numbers because they fear losing access to management  which is key to a Wall Street analyst s job these days  Buffett also says analysts may be swept up by a herd mentality and go along with these inflated financials because everyone else is doing it  None of these reasons lets them off the hook  Buffett says 

 Whatever their reasoning  these analysts are guilty of propagating misleading numbers that can deceive investors   Buffett writes 
Based on pro forma earnings  profits for the S P 500 rose an average of 0 4  in 2015  But if you stick with figures that conform to official accounting rules  profits actually plunged nearly 13  




Oddly  Buffett s denouncement of executives who doctor their earnings comes during a section of the his annual letter in which he does a bit of his own selective accounting  Buffett says that Berkshire shareholders would do better ignoring a portion of the company s amortization costs  Buffett acknowledges the slight contradiction by saying that he gives that advice with  some trepidation   But he says amortization  unlike compensation  is not a real expense  What s more  Buffett says investors when calculating Berkshire s true earnings should include depreciation  which he says is a often true expense  but doesn t normally get counted 
 When CEOs or investment bankers tout pre depreciation figures such as EBITDA as a valuation guide  watch their noses lengthen while they speak   writes Buffett 

And  by the way  to anyone who doubts the value of compounding those slow  steady gains 

I guess I really need to stress this more often because it s so hard for people to get their heads around the value of this strategy because  in the first 5 years   it simply doesn t seem that sexy  Even if you make a steady 20  a year for 5 years  you go from  100 000 to  120 000 to  144 000 to  172 000 to  207 000 to  250 000 and there will be many points along the way when the market is going against you or when you have a friend tell you their guy has them up 50  that year or whatever and that s TEMPTATION which you have to avoid 
Look at   for example  his fund was up 40  in 2014 but last year  and already this year it s down another 17 3  and the gains are all gone   two wasted years  Why  Because he s arrogant and he didn t cash out and he stuck with a winning strategy for too long  Hedge fund managers are often like gamblers at a casino who bet black on the roulette wheel and  if they get a win  they let it ride and then again they let it ride and  if they get black 3 or 4 times in a row  they get to go on TV and act like geniuses and people will throw money at them and they will be treated as heroes  Even if the 5th time is red and wipes them and their investors out   they simply close down that fund and start another one using their famous name and one time win to attract new investors 
Think about it  I just told you this but next time Bill Ackman s on TV you ll listen to him as if he knows something  It s the same thing with Venture Capital firms  they only want to swing for the fences because there s no glory in hitting a bunch of singles and doubles   they all chase the fabled 10 bagger so they can brag about it to their big swinging friends and  sadly  that s just the truth of human nature 
Barry Bonds  cheater   Hank Aaron and Babe Ruth are very  very famous because they are the top 3 home run hitters and yes  we all know Ty Cobb   366 lifetime  but what about Ed Delahanty   346   Billy Hamilton   344   Harry Heilmann   342   Peter Browning   341   Those guys are all in the top 10 hitters of all time but no home runs so no one remembers  You have to go really far down the list of home run hitters to find one you ve never heard of    
Anyway  home runs put fans in the seats and  for hedge funds and VCs  they bring in the investors but home run hitters also tend to lead the league in strikeouts as well   as you have to commit big to swing for the fences  That s fine in baseball  because after you re wiped out they give you another turn at the bat but it s not fine for individual investors  who spend a lifetime building their investment savings and can t afford to have it wiped out  right 
Babe Ruth isn t wrong and his attitude is fine  he also had a  342 lifetime batting average  he simply missed big when he did miss    if you are going to get another chance  The marginal cost of striking out for Babe Ruth is low because he was going to get 8 399 at bats in his lifetime so his 1 330 strikeouts were a cost of doing business along the way 
If we allocate our portfolios correctly and avoid putting all of our eggs in one basket  we too can swing for the fences once in a while because getting wiped out on a small investment is not a big deal compared to the occasional 10 bagger BUT   you have to be realistic about your chances of both and that is where most investors  and fund managers  fail 

One thing people tend to forget about Berkshire Hathaway is that they made  17 4Bn from the companies they actually run and  only   6 1Bn in their stock portfolio  Nothing is better than having a steady flow of income and that allows Berkshire to take the occasional risk in the market  without worrying about seriously impacting the company s future if it doesn t work out  It also allows Berkshire to ride out market downturns with more cash coming in to press  losing  bets on the way down 
PSW Investments has a similar structure  using the cash flow from PSW to fund long term investments in start up companies  We don t gamble with money we can t afford to lose but that doesn t mean we don t gamble at all  It s also the strategy we preach at this site   playing a conservative  long term growth strategy with the bulk  80   of your investing capital and taking shorter term  opportunistic trades with your remaining investment money  That way  even if you are wiped out of the short term funds   20  of 20    4    if you make just 5  on the long term funds  5  of 80    4    you still don t lose 
In Buffett s recent letter to shareholders  link above   he mentions that the company s growth really took off in the  90s BECAUSE he moved away from the investing model and more into the ownership model  As Buffett notes  he learned from experience 
Buffett talks about  normalized  earning power and that too is something we teach our Members  When we are very bullish in our portfolios  generally that would be 70  bullish and maybe  in an extreme  like 2009   80  but we always leave room for the possibility we could be wrong  If you are 70 30 bullish and the market drops 50  then your 70 becomes 35 but  because we leverage our hedges  the 30 becomes 60 and your net is 95 while the rest of the market is on a half priced sale 
If the market  however  goes up 50  then your 70 becomes 140 and your 30 is maybe 15 and that s 155 and you are only slightly ahead of the S P but we d rather make 50  in good years and 5  in bad years than go up and down like a yo yo  Of course  that s when we re wrong   sometimes we get it right in either direction   as we have for the past two years 
As Buffett notes 

 At Berkshire  we much prefer owning a non controlling but substantial portion of a wonderful company to owning 100  of a so so business  It s better to have a partial interest in the Hope Diamond than to own all of a rhinestone  Our appetite for either operating businesses or passive investments doubles our chances of finding sensible uses for Berkshire s endless gusher of cash  

Similarly  when people ask me what s an appropriate amount of money to have to retire I tell them to just keep working as long as they can and let the investment income grow on the side  The bigger you let your retirement savings get  the less work they will have to do in your golden year and the less risk you will have of having to downgrade your lifestyle down the road  see     
Buffett likes to tend to his core holdings and add  bolt on  acquisitions  which compliment his core businesses but he makes it clear how pleased he is to make large acquisitions and outright invites any Fortune 500 company to call him if they are interested in selling  Buffett will not go hostile   And  as Buffett wisely notes 

Of course  a business with terrific economics can be a bad investment if it is bought at too high a price  We have paid substantial premiums to net tangible assets for most of our businesses  a cost that is reflected in the large figure we show for goodwill and other intangibles  Overall  however  we are getting a decent return on the capital we have deployed 

Patience is  by far  the hardest thing we have to teach  Having a long term outlook is much easier when you are an 85 year old Billionaire and  keep in mind  Buffett has been doing this since the 60s  It s not just about age  it s about the experience of actually trading the markets for  let s say 100 000 hours  Buffett has put in his time in spades ",2016-02-28,Philip Davis,https://www.investing.com/analysis/berkshire-hathaway’s-q4-earnings-show-buffett-still-has-it-200119660,200119660
156070,377586,BRKb,The Week Ahead  Can A Rebounding Economy Support Stock Prices ,opinion,"This week s economic calendar is loaded with all of the most important data  In addition  Super Tuesday might provide a defining event to the political campaign  Oil remains volatile  and Fed Speakers are on the loose  Despite the political stories  I expect the punditry to be asking 
Can the strengthening U S  economy support the rebound in stocks  
Prior Theme Recap
In my last WTWA  two weeks ago  I predicted a focus on the biggest market worries  That guess was not very successful  since the market immediately began a nice  two week rally  The list of topics was still good preparation  since stories quickly turned to  what could derail the rally   As Doug Short notes  Friday s market did not respond even when  an avalanche of economic data surprised to the upside   Once again  a modest decline in oil prices accompanied a modest decline in stocks  You can see the story in Doug Short s weekly chart   With the ever increasing effects from foreign markets  you should also add Doug s World Markets Weekend Update to your reading list  

Doug s update also provides multi year context  See his  for more excellent charts and analysis 
We would all like to know the direction of the market in advance  Good luck with that  Second best is planning what to look for and how to react  That is the purpose of considering possible themes for the week ahead  You can make your own predictions in the comments 
This Week s Theme
Earnings season continues  and the political stories will be dominant  at least through Tuesday s elections and Wednesday morning s news  In a non political season  this week would be all about the economy  We have more of the important reports squeezed into a single week  helped by Leap Year   than we have seen in many months 
Recent economic news suggests improvement  at least in the U S  At some point  a better economy will lead to better earnings and more support for stock prices  By the end of the week I expect politics to be a sideshow with focus on the economic data  Market observers and pundits will be asking 
Can economic improvement provide a foundation for equity markets  
Background 
Doug Short s observations about Friday s trading highlight the ambivalent response to  good news  
Q1 GDP is tracking higher  as much as 2 5  according to the Atlanta Fed s GDP now reports    looks at this source and others  
Are first quarters a  one off  over the last few years  Brian Gilmartin writes 

Has anyone else noticed how volatile the first quarter has been the last 3 years  


In 2014  it was Russia driving tanks into Ukraine  the Venezuelan devaluation and profit taking after the 32  increase in the SP in 2013 


In 2015  it was falling crude oil  falling commodities  West Coast Port slowdown  strong dollar and even weather in February  15 


In 2016  the volatility is the result of Financial stock volatility  European bank worries  negative interest rates  etc 


Not one of the last three Q1 s seems to be driven at all by the US economy and worries therein  Jobless claims remain strong 


So what gives  What is it with the first quarter every year 


I don t know  but it is always something 


Viewpoints 
I expect the following to be the principal positions  with the usual vigorous support for each  ranging from bearish to bullish 
The reported data are flawed   a fluke  faked  subject to poor seasonal adjustments  etc  The economy is much weaker than the government claims 
Good news for the economy just means that the Fed will tighten sooner  Only central banks have kept the market afloat 
It is all about oil  Oil prices are the best economic barometer 
Positive economic news will reduce recession fears  helping many stock sectors 
Stronger economic news will lead to higher earnings estimates 
As always  I have my own opinion in the conclusion  But first  let us do our regular update of the last week s news and data  Readers  especially those new to this series  will benefit from reading the  
Last Week s Data
Each week I break down events into good and bad  Often there is  ugly  and on rare occasion something really good  My working definition of  good  has two components 
The news is market friendly  Our personal policy preferences are not relevant for this test  And especially   no politics 
It is better than expectations 
The Good
On balance the news was very good last week  despite the market reaction 
Initial jobless claims remained low at 272K 
Q4 GDP was revised higher  This is backward looking  of course  but the revision to 1  growth suggests that the base for 2016 was a bit better 
Existing home sales remained strong and beat expectations   5 47M versus 5 3M    
Durable goods reversed nicely from the recent slump   up 4 9  overall and 1 8  on the core  ex transportation  
Low oil prices are starting to show benefits 
Gas prices continue to fall   1 gallon coming this summer    
Reduced food costs around the world  Quartz has the story and plenty of charts showing the relationship  Christopher Groskopf calls it a  huge hidden upside  

While the global economy s biggest players are reeling  there is a less visible group of people who stand to benefit tremendously  those without enough to eat 


The security of the world s poor is inseparable from the price they pay for food  especially the grains that constitute most of their diet  Oil prices are a significant factor in determining the price of other commodities  including food  Tractors and other farm machinery require fuel  as does the manufacture of fertilizer  Once crops are harvested  oil prices dictate the transportation costs to get them to market  whether that s down a highway or over an ocean 




Michigan sentiment improved over January and slightly beat estimates   But see Consumer Confidence below  
Personal income and spending both surprised with 0 5  growth  This is good news for housing and the consumer sectors  Maybe the improved employment picture and lower gasoline costs are finally having an effect 
The Bad
Some of the news was negative 
Leadership worries  Early primary results have favored  outsider  candidates  In my 2016 preview I said that it was far too soon to draw conclusions about the Presidential election  Things are shaping up faster than I expected  Most observers note that markets prefer establishment candidates and stable leadership  We can and should each express our own viewpoints and vote our consciences  but our personal choices may not be  market friendly    has an interesting interactive GOP simulator  You can plug in your own assumptions and use it to follow the news this week  They lead off with a favorable Trump scenario 

Consumer confidence  Doug Short puts the disappointment in context 

New home sales disappointed  The annualized level of 494K missed expectations by 25K and was down 50K from December 
Signs of the  wealth effect  hit earnings  Restoration Hardware  N RH  blames its earnings miss on the stock market   Fortune  
The Ugly 
University bond ratings  Three Illinois state universities were downgraded to junk or just above   Illinois is especially bad  but state revenues nationwide have been slow to rebound from recession levels 
Some Fun 
For those watching the Academy Awards this weekend  missing the important basketball game between Michigan where I did my grad work and Wisconsin  where I taught and from which Mrs  OldProf graduated  here is some fun 
Which nominated films   either overall or on a percentage   The winner should be easy  
What about The Big Short  Here are some  from Brookings  which hosted an event including interviews   the director  some of those involved in real life  and also other financial professionals 
The Silver Bullet 
I occasionally give the Silver Bullet award to someone who takes up an unpopular or thankless cause  doing the real work to demonstrate the facts  Think of The Lone Ranger  No award this week  Nominations are always welcome 
Quant Corner
Whether a trader or an investor  you need to understand risk  I monitor many quantitative reports and highlight the best methods in this weekly update 
Beginning last week I made some changes in our regular table  separating three different ways of considering risk  For valuation I report the equity risk premium  This is the difference between what we expect stocks to earn in the next twelve months and the return from the 10 Year Treasury note  I have found this approach to be an effective method for measuring market perception of stock risk  This is now easier to monitor because of the excellent work of   whose analysis of the Thomson Reuters data is our principal source for forward earnings 
Our economic risk indicators have not changed 
In our monitoring of market technical risk  I am now using our new model   Holmes   Holmes is a friendly watchdog in the same tradition as Oscar and Felix  but with a stronger emphasis on asset protection  We have found that the overall market indication is very helpful for those investing or trading individual stocks  The score ranges from 1 to 5  with 5 representing a high warning level  The 2 4 range is acceptable for stock trading  with various levels of caution 
The new approach improves trading results by taking some profits during good times and getting out of the market when technical risk is high  This is not market timing as we normally think of it  It is not an effort to pick tops and bottoms and it does not go short

How to Use the Weekly Data Updates 
In the WTWA series I try to share what I am thinking as I prepare for the coming week  I write each post as if I were speaking directly to one of my clients  Each client is different  so I have six different programs ranging from very conservative bond ladders to very aggressive trading programs  It is not a  one size fits all  approach 
To get the maximum benefit from my updates you need to have a self assessment of your objectives  Are you most interested in preserving wealth  Or like most of us  do you still need to create wealth  How much risk is right for your temperament and circumstances 
WTWA often suggests a different course of action depending upon your objectives and time frames

Other Advice 
Here is our collection of great investor advice for this week 
If I had to pick a single most important source for investors to read  it would be Philip Van Doorn s  on how to enhance returns with covered calls  This is a great job of demystifying the subject  He writes 

I promise to explain a  covered call  option strategy as painlessly as possible 


If you re an investor seeking income  buying quality securities that pay high dividends or interest is a prudent strategy  But covered call options can boost income while providing downside protection  And that s important nowadays  as some analysts are predicting a bear market for stocks  and traders expect low interest rates for quite a while 

There are many ways of implementing this strategy  with a significant effect on risk and returns  I have been using it for years  emphasizing the sale of near term calls with the fastest time decay  Interested readers might enjoy my free report comparing this approach to other income programs like bonds  REITs  and dividend investing   info at newarc dot com

Final Thoughts
There is plenty of negative sentiment right now  despite the recent stock rebound  I do not expect any single news release   or even a series of them   to have a dramatic impact on stocks  Until a stronger economy influences earnings  most people will remain skeptical  We might well be three months away from seeing that evidence  even if the Q1 data continue to improve 
The recessionistas will be proven wrong on the current call  and that will gradually help to improve earnings estimates  Many analysts are building recessions into their forecasts  second guessing their own top economists 
It is difficult to be patient  but it is often rewarding  Take what the market is giving you   a trading range with some sector and stock specific opportunities

156071,377587,BRKb,This Is What s Wrong With Berkshire Hathaway,opinion,"A Peruvian wedding and the recent Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa    NYSE BRKb   annual meeting have a lot in common  That might not sound immediately obvious  but it s true  I ve been in Peru for the past week  By lucky coincidence  the national Peruvian Paso horse competition  which my father in law won this year  and the wedding of my son s godmother were both in Lima  So it was a solid week of obligatory celebrating  it s been tough   The thing is  it wasn t your typical wedding 
The bride was a Peruvian Catholic of Jewish ancestry and the groom an Indian American Hindu who spent most of his formative years in Oman  The guest list looked a little something like a model UN meeting  And they somehow managed to make all of that gel in a single ceremony  Somehow  somewhere  they managed to find a Spanish speaking Hindu priest in Lima to perform the Hindu ritual in a mixture of Sanskrit and Spanish 
And they also managed to find a bilingual Catholic priest to perform the Christian wedding in English and Spanish  The only thing missing was the bilingual English Yiddish rabbi to preside over the ceremonial breaking of a wine glass  It was a delightful melding of mismatched everythings  Which brings me back to how it was just like the recent Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting 
You see  Warren Buffett is in the twilight of his career  His masterpiece   Berkshire Hathaway   doesn t quite generate the returns it used to anymore  And while there might be a couple of reasons for that  the single biggest one is that it s gotten too big and too unfocused  There s a hodgepodge of everything and it s not doing investors any good  Buffett generated the returns that made him famous in the 1950s to 1970s by concentrating and making just a handful of very large  very successful bets at any given time 
That s because successful investing needs focus  But given the size of Berkshire Hathaway today  Buffett is effectively locked out of his own game  He s said a few times in recent years that  were he running a small  100 million hedge fund  he d deliver 50  annual returns like clockwork  Running a  360 billion conglomerate makes that impossible 
At that size  you re essentially limited to mega cap stocks  If you were to take a meaningful position in a smaller company  you d end up owning the whole thing outright  So my advice to you today is this  if you re wanting a good party  then mix it up  A Catholic Jewish Hindu wedding in South America is a blast  But if you re wanting decent portfolio returns  stay narrow and focus  Don t follow the Berkshire Hathaway model  Instead  pick a strategy or a small handful of strategies that you feel comfortable mastering  and stick with them  Variety might be the spice of life  But when it comes to investing  stick with what you know

156103,377619,BRKb,Warren Buffett s Asset Allocation  Skimpy On Bonds,opinion,"It seems I ve been writing a lot about Warren Buffett lately 
Earlier in May I used one of his favorite valuation tools to determine if U S  stocks are significantly more expensive than their overseas peers  and a few weeks before that I considered a letter he wrote back in 1999 that would suggest U S  stocks are priced to deliver pretty crummy returns going forward 
Today  rather than dwell on the Oracle s words  let s take a cold  hard look at what he is actually doing with his money 
The following chart  courtesy of   tracks the stock and bond holdings of Buffett s holding company  Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa  NYSE BRKb   going back to 1995 

Give credit to the straight talking Midwesterner  Buffett  s actions seem to hold true to his words  His exposure to stocks has crept upward in recent years  as the raging bull market has pulled the value of virtually all stocks higher  But it s only slightly higher than the average of the past several years  and it is far below the levels of the late 1990s 
But what I find far more interesting is Buffett s allocation to bonds  labelled  fixed maturity  here   Bond prices too have massively increased over the past several years as yields have scraped along near all time lows  Yet Buffett s allocation to bonds  red line  has been in steady decline since the 2008 financial crisis  As recently as 2002  Buffett had half his portfolio in bonds  Today  that number is just 14  
What conclusions can we draw from this 
Buffett is one of the best value investors to ever play the game  and it speaks volumes that he has been reducing his allocation to bonds for years now  While bond yields are likely to stay very low for another several years  I would agree with Buffett that  at current yields  the value just isn t there  Buffett began reducing his allocation to bonds at yields far higher than those we see today  even after the recent surge  At best  bonds can make for a good short to medium term trade  But buying at today s yields  you can t expect much in the way of long term returns ",2015-05-20,Charles Sizemore,https://www.investing.com/analysis/warren-buffett’s-asset-allocation:-skimpy-on-bonds-252344,252344
156104,377620,BRKb,Why Growth ETFs Continue To Beat Value,opinion,"When building out an ETF portfolio  many investors prefer to slant their large cap U S  stock exposure towards growth or value characteristics 
The benefit to this methodology is that you have greater flexibility to hone in on a specific theme that you  or your advisor  believe will outperform over the long run  The downside is that you may choose wrong and end up leaving money on the table versus a traditional broad based index such as the iShares S P 500 ETF  ARCA IVV  
Now fear of making a wrong choice should never hold you back from implementing a structured ETF portfolio  In fact  there is a commonly held belief that if you aren t worried about something in your account  then you aren t diversified enough  Meaning that a truly broad array of assets should always have something underperforming based on the prevailing market environment  Diversification is meant to smooth out peaks and valleys in your returns  not fire on all cylinders at all times 
A quick look at the performance comparison between the iShares S P 500 Growth ETF  NYSE IVW  and iShares S P 500 Value ETF  ARCA IVE  over the last year shows a marked disparity in total return  Growth stocks have exhibited strong relative momentum  while value companies have plodded along at a slower pace 

Interestingly enough  this same story repeats itself if you widen the scale to 3 or 5 year time frames  Despite the steady gains in value stocks  growth has simply been the place to be 
So what caused that divergence and what factors may ultimately lead to resurgence in value stocks 
An in depth look at IVW  growth  shows that the basket of 325 stocks is heavily weighted towards technology and health care companies  Together these two groups make up more than 50  of the assets and have continued to be top performing areas of the market  Health care in particular has been one of the most resilient sectors overall and continues to demonstrate remarkable comparative momentum 
On the flip side  IVE  value  is comprised of a healthy dose of financial and energy companies in its 360 holdings  Financial stocks make up 24  of the total underlying sector allocation  with Berkshire Hathaway Inc  NYSE BRKa  BRKb  being the largest stock in this group  The financial sector has struggled to make any positive headway this year and has clearly been a drag on the return in IVE  In addition  the well documented energy sector woes have weighed on returns in this ETF over the last 12 months 
The low interest rate environment coupled with deflating commodity prices has been a drag on a significant number of stocks that make up IVE  Ultimately  a change in tenor that sees energy prices surge or banking stocks breakout would lead to a transformation in comparative leadership  A scare in the market that prompts an exit from high momentum stocks would also likely send money towards more stable value oriented companies as well 
Those that have owned IVE or other value indexes for some time should still be satisfied with the overall gains and low volatility that this segment has produced  In addition  because of the length in time of growth leadership  we may be nearing a  for value stocks 
The Bottom Line
The point of this analysis is to call attention to how these indexes are constructed and what factors may influence overall performance moving forward  Understanding what you own and why you own it is an important component to a successful investment plan  You should be keenly aware of how your own portfolio is constructed and where areas of potential strength and weakness may lie  With that knowledge you can  to lower volatility and improve your returns overall

156131,377647,BRKb,Warren Buffett s Stellar Record In Defying Economic Gravity,opinion,"One of the more intriguing observations in Berkshire Hathaway s  NYSE BRKa NYSE BRKb  new  is Warren Buffett s reference to what I like to call economic gravity  aka the  There are several ways to keep it at bay  maybe   but in the end it wins no matter what you do  Buffett and company  of course  have an extraordinary history of excelling where so many others have stumbled in this regard  But an unusually long run of success is taking its toll  As Buffett himself recognizes  gravity s pull is increasing on Berkshire s prospects  The observation inspires some brief ruminating on how to think about economic gravity generally in the realm of designing and managing investment portfolios  Let s begin with the salient fact that deserves to precede any discussion of investing that ties in with Buffett  namely  he s an anomaly in terms of his investment record  That s something to cheer about if you ve been a Berkshire shareholder over the last 50 years  But he s managing expectations down these days 

The bad news is that Berkshire s long term gains   measured by percentages  not by dollars   cannot be dramatic and will not come close to those achieved in the past 50 years  The numbers have become too big  I think Berkshire will outperform the average American company  but our advantage  if any  won t be great 
Eventually   probably between ten and twenty years from now   Berkshire s earnings and capital resources will reach a level that will not allow management to intelligently reinvest all of the company s earnings  

Success ultimately plants the seeds of its own destruction  or mediocrity  Buffett  of course  has skirted this curse quite spectacularly through the decades  largely through an uncanny mix of raw talent and steely discipline  A handful of other investors have achieved something similar over long periods of time  but theirs is a tiny club and membership opportunities are limited in the extreme  Accordingly  the overwhelming majority of investment results fall within two standard deviations of the median performance for a relevant benchmark  and that s not going to change  ever  We re all fishing in the same pond  The critical differences that separate portfolios  and results  come down to two key factors  asset allocation and rebalancing 
Buffett  of course  has opted for a fairly unique asset allocation  as reflected in the companies he s purchased through the years  The list is a reflection of his talents as an analyst  It s fair to say that he s favored a degree of concentration  in large part due to his well founded confidence in his capabilities to identify value  As for rebalancing  he largely shuns that aspect of portfolio management  which is a direct function of his confidence in security selection 
It s been a winning mix  in large part due to talent  Concentrated bets with minimal rebalancing has been the basic strategy that s kept economic gravity to a minimum at Berkshire through time  The results speak for themselves  But gravity mediocre performance wins in the end  The best case scenario is minimizing its bite for a lengthy run  which surely describes Berkshire s history  For mere mortals in the money game  however  gravity tends to weigh on results much sooner  The reason  of course  is a simple but extraordinarily powerful bit of wisdom attributed to Professor Bill Sharpe a la  

Properly measured  the average actively managed dollar must underperform the average passively managed dollar  net of costs 

There is a finite amount of positive alpha  market beating performance  and it s financed exclusively by negative alpha  Buffett s spectacular achievements over the past 50 years have come at the expense of countless losing investment strategies  But having beaten the grim reaper of financial results for so long  the game is getting harder  as it must 
The key point is that mediocrity beckons for every investor  eventually  For some of us  very few of us   the day of reckoning is far off  due to talent and perhaps even some luck  But for the vast majority of investors  professional and amateur  this is one of those rare instances in money management when the future s quite clear 
This outlook suggests that it may be best to embrace mediocrity from the start via index funds and focus on those aspects of portfolio design and management where the odds look a bit more encouraging for enhancing results a bit  Whereas Buffett favored concentration and minimizing rebalancing  the average investor should do the opposite  In short  hold a multi asset class portfolio  keep the mix from going to extremes  i e   periodic rebalancing   and use index funds to keep costs low 
It s the anti Buffett strategy  which is exactly the wrong strategy if you re Warren Buffett  Then again  if you wait long enough  perhaps this advice becomes relevant even for the Oracle of Omaha ",2015-03-07,James Picerno,https://www.investing.com/analysis/warren-buffett’s-stellar-record-in-defying-economic-gravity-244181,244181

Berkshire Hathaway B  NYSE BRKb  is its top holding and it had a failed rally on Friday showing weakness at as it nears key support at 144 86  This level has provide rally points over the last year for BRK B but each time the rallies has been weaker  Now BRK B is testing this level again and we know from technical analysis the more a support level is tested the weaker it becomes  The downtrend from December coupled with the support at 144 86 has also created a bearish descending triangle pattern  Keep and eye on this level  if it breaks it is a good short and will push XLF lower 

Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC  has been chopping around a tight range between 55 55 and 54 50  after breaking its longer term uptrend since January  On Friday it closed near the bottom of this range  If it was to break this range it it would be bearish  But WFC has one more support level at 54 03  that could stop the short term downtrend  This is the key level to watch  a break of this and WFC moves back to 52 50

156151,377667,BRKb,The Week Ahead  Will There Be A January Effect This Year ,opinion,"The pros are back from vacation and ready for a new year of punditry 
While there is a normal flow of news and a full trading week  I expect the financial media to focus on the New Year  That means an emphasis on slogans and seasonality 
Trader lore views January as including special predictive powers 
Will there be a January Effect  
Prior Theme Recap
In my pre holiday WTWA I predicted that the quest for content would be filled  by forecasts of any and all flavors   That was very accurate  partly because there was little competing news and light trading 
Feel free to join in my exercise in thinking about the upcoming theme  We would all like to know the direction of the market in advance  Good luck with that  Second best is planning what to look for and how to react  That is the purpose of considering possible themes for the week ahead 
This Week s Theme
While there is plenty of news on tap this week  those pundits who were on vacation still need to have their say  There is plenty of market lore about January  so it will be a highlight of discussions   at least until Friday s employment report  Many will be asking 
Is it time for a strong seasonal rally in stocks  
There is plenty of trader lore about January 
January is seasonally strong  especially after a good year   Merrill Lynch research going back to 1929 
As goes January  so goes the year  Also the first week forecasts the whole month  And even the first day forecasts the week     
It is a year ending in  5   Dana Lyons   below   He also  where there was a big drop on the last day of the year  noting that this is probably not meaningful  At least he points this out  as opposed to those who talk about the two prior times QE ended 

It is the third year of a Presidential term  And the seventh year of a Presidential administration     
The January Effect follows December s tax loss selling   See   
As always  I have some ideas about this question in today s conclusion  But first  let us do our regular update of the last week s news and data  Readers  especially those new to this series  will benefit from reading the  
Last Week s Data
Each week I break down events into good and bad  Often there is  ugly  and on rare occasion something really good  My working definition of  good  has two components 
The news is market friendly  Our personal policy preferences are not relevant for this test  And especially   no politics 
It is better than expectations 
The Good
There was not much news over the holidays  On balance it was mildly disappointing 
The Keystone Pipeline remains   While there is still the threat of a Presidential veto  I expect a successful bipartisan coalition and compromise  This will be an early test of whether compromises can be forged and legislation passed in this Congress  My environmentalist friends should note that I am not citing this as desirable public policy  I am merely sticking to my rules concerning what is  market friendly  
Hotel occupancy remains strong   See   
Rail traffic remains strong   why this is a solid indicator 

High frequency indicators remain positive   has the important weekly report 
The Bad
The bad news was pretty minor  although most items were a bit soft 
Financial crisis risk is not much lower than it was in 2007 09 according to Boston Fed President Rosengren   describes the rationale  citing money market funds  broker dealers  and short term funding 
Canada  I thought we were worried about Europe  China  and the emerging markets   about how low oil prices affect Canada s economy
Greece  After two tries there is still not a new government in place  There is concern about Greece  but also about the implications for the Eurozone and the potential impact on the world economy   offers a balanced view of the prospects 
The auto bailout tab is in at  if you count the interest payments or  16 billion if you do not  This is on an investment of about  80 billion   25 by Bush and 55 by Obama  Early estimates were for a loss of about  44 billion  We will never know what would have happened without the bailout  especially since the government would have been on the hook for some of the pensions 
Insider trading at BP  as well as various bank currency desks   
Construction spending shows weakness   See   
Jobless claims have drifted a bit higher  both on the weekly numbers and the four week average  It has been a small weekly amount  but it is worth noting  Doug Short s chart puts it all in context and the accompanying  of the underlying trends 

ISM manufacturing declined and missed expectations at 55 5  This level is still consistent with real GDP of 4 1  according to the ISM analysis  but that seems to have been a bit high in recent years   has the story and notes the West Coast dock slowdown as a factor 

The Ugly
Jailed journalists in China    

Increased trade and economic ties generally increase cooperation and make the world safer  It has now been 42 years since Nixon s famous  and even longer since   The world is very interested in China  its markets  and its economic data  Building confidence remains a challenge 
The Silver Bullet
I occasionally give the Silver Bullet award to someone who takes up an unpopular or thankless cause  doing the real work to demonstrate the facts  Think of The Lone Ranger  This week s award goes to RL at Slope of Hope for an  at how normal charting techniques have not worked well in the recent rally 

Fans of the Silver Bullet can check out our   just in case you missed one  Most investors have been bamboozled by one or more of these stories  so an annual review can be helpful

How to Use the Weekly Data Updates 
In the WTWA series I try to share what I am thinking as I prepare for the coming week  I write each post as if I were speaking directly to one of my clients  Each client is different  so I have five different programs ranging from very conservative bond ladders to very aggressive trading programs  It is not a  one size fits all  approach 
To get the maximum benefit from my updates you need to have a self assessment of your objectives  Are you most interested in preserving wealth  Or like most of us  do you still need to create wealth  How much risk is right for your temperament and circumstances 
My weekly insights often suggest a different course of action depending upon your objectives and time frames  They also accurately describe what I am doing in the programs I manage 
Insight for Traders 
Since our last WTWA post  Felix shifted from neutral to bullish  There is still a high level of uncertainty reflected by the extremely high percentage of sectors in the penalty box  There has also been some rapid changes in the top sectors  even in a relatively quiet market  Our current position is fully invested in three leading sectors  For more information  I have posted a further description     You can sign up for Felix s weekly ratings updates via email to etf at newarc dot com 
There is bottom fishing with fund flows in energy ETFs   picks up the story  Felix did also 
Insight for Investors 
I review the themes here each week and refresh when needed  For investors  as we would expect  the key ideas may stay on the list longer than the updates for traders  Major market declines occur after business cycle peaks  sparked by severely declining earnings  Our methods are focused on limiting this risk  We have updated our ideas on  
We aim for a light hearted approach in our  review of the past year  but there is still a lot of investment truth  If you missed it  please take a look 
Other Advice 
Here is our collection of great investor advice for this week 
Best Lessons 
Josh Brown s annual review of  What I learned  brings out  from his many sources  I always enjoy reading the list and I always learn something  You will  too  because it combines humor and education  There is no good way to summarize this  so please read and enjoy  Here is one favorite 

 Sam Ro  if you ask  most stock market bears will tell you they re not net short  

Watch also for these 14 famous but meaningless phrases that pundits use to appear smart   has the story  They are all so good that it is tough to pick a favorite 
Stock Ideas 

Eddy Elfenbein  CNN Money s best buy and hold blogger  is out with his eagerly awaited   Eddy locks in the choices for a full year  This post amplifies the preliminary version  cited in our last WTWA  and provides more discussion  There are always great ideas  and you have the choice of selling during the year   if you dare 

Thirteen ideas from   In contrast to the  bad news  above  he likes Canada 
Yield Plays 
 is writing to an audience of investment managers  but you can listen in  He carefully describes the possible role of convertible bonds very helpful 
Investors continue the quest for yield and Barron s has some ideas   reports on the alternatives in the table below  Don t stop there  The recommendations are more nuanced  There is also a nice accounting of what worked and didn t last year 

Sticking to a Winning Strategy 
 some winning strategies and the related drawdowns  noting the challenges of staying with the program   Finding a strategy that can beat the market over a reasonable period of time is relatively easy  It s sticking to it that is the challenge  
Warren Buffett s Berkshire Hathaway B  NYSE BRKb  stock had a great year   up 28   Betting on Buffett is an easy choice if you understand that you should focus on methods  Those chasing past performance would have instead emphasized the prior five years  where the stock trailed the S P 500 

 sounds the same theme  with plenty of charts and examples   Past performance is about to lead you astray   in a huge way  
Psychology and Time Frames 
Traders jump on a theme  but get bored quickly  Josh Brown is an expert on both traders and investors  often explaining how brokers sell their wares  This week he uses the Herzfeld Caribbean Basin Fund  NASDAQ  CUBA  as an example   

The closed end fund is down 35  over the last week and has given back most of the gains from the announcement  I ve seen this kind of thing play out approximately one million times  I d been on the wrong side of these plenty of times in the early part of my brokerage career as the sexiest stories in the market were always the easiest to sell to investors  Unfortunately  they re often the stories that are the least likely to have staying power once the hype dies down 


Did you get caught holding the bag on Cuba  Consider hiring a professional to manage your money or lessening the amount of event driven trades you take each year 


Similarly   on how market timing attempts are costly for most investors 

Investment Scams 
The hits just keep on coming  When you see a fund that is too good to be true  beware  Stephen Gandel at Fortune   Every investor is seeking something that looks like a CD but pays 8  per year  Understanding the risk reward balance is challenging for most 
Final Thought
I am not a big fan of seasonal effects unless there is a logical underlying reason  The Presidential cycle logic rests upon taking unpopular actions early in the term while emphasizing economic stimulus later  That does not have much relevance in the current environment 
The January tax loss effect is more persuasive  especially in years where there are some clear losers to sell  That was true in many sectors this year 
What are my market predictions for 2015  My own annual preview article will be out this week  I will not make a specific market forecast  but I will examine trends that I think offer the best risk reward balance  I remain constructive on stocks since we are still in the middle part of the business cycle  I will also try  as I do in my weekly posts  to distinguish between investors and traders ",2015-01-04,Jeff Miller,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-week-ahead:-will-there-be-a-january-effect-this-year-237307,237307

156166,377682,BRKb,We Are Cautiously Optimistic   July 4  2013,opinion,Since the start of the year  there have been many debates by investment experts on the future direction of the stock market  What is it this time so unpredictable  Reason is because nobody knows what is the impact on stock prices when Quantitative Easing  QE  is tapered or stopped  This is something new to the investment community  So what is our view  We are cautiously optimistic  We feel that major stock indices  S P500  Hang Seng  STI Index  may be correcting but there are still a lot of undervalued stocks in the market  So to protect ourselves as prudent investors  we had bought into stocks that are trading below tangible book value  There are many stock investing strategies adopted by different investors  Some investors like to buy low P E stocks  some investors like to invest based on charts  some investors like to follow the latest hot tips  From my 12 years of investing experience  there are only 2 investing strategies that I had adopted  First strategy is to buy stocks that generate earning growth  Problem with this strategy is that when the company stops generating growth  market will punish the stock and push the share price down mercilessly  Investors who do not have discipline cut loss strategy will suffer a huge loss  This type of strategy is best use when we are at the early stage of the bull market  We do not think we are at the early stage of the bull market anymore  Second strategy is to buy stocks that are trading below tangible book value  When stocks are trading below tangible book value  it gives investors a   Such situation happens when a company has been misunderstood or faces a temporary problem  Share price of the company can fall hard and even fall below tangible book value  There will be a time when market starts to understand the company or problem is solved  share price will then rise significantly  In an uncertainty market like this  most of our stock picks are based on the second methodology  We like to buy stocks that are trading below tangible book value  accompanied with strong insiders buying  It will be better if the companies had implemented share buybacks programs  this proves that even the management of the company think that their stocks are undervalued  and hopefully they pay some dividend  this will reward investors for some dividend yield while waiting the share price to go up   So if stock market continues to rise  we will participate on the bull run  And if stock market falls  our damage is minimised  One particular sector that are we are very bullish in is US Financials  We believe that this could be one of the best investment opportunity in our generation  Subprime crisis had caused much damage to the stock market in general and particularly the banks and insurance companies in United States of America  Major banks and insurance companies are trading at prices which are only 8  to 20  from the peak  They have stopped generating losses and start generating healthy earnings  Most of such US Financials have aggressive insiders buying by the CEOs  Chairman and Directors  This is a sign that the management of the company is optimistic on the future outlook of the company  We had bought 4 such stocks into our portfolio  One such stock is Genworth Financial The five stages of the business cycle are growth  expansion   peak  recession  contraction   trough and recovery  We like to buy stocks when business cycle is at contraction and then sell them when business cycle is at expansion or peak  Slowdown in China had caused commodity related stocks to fall  We will be interested to buy commodity stocks if they fall further  hopefully another 20  down  We will invest  keep them in our portfolio and wait patiently for business cycle to enter into expansion stage again  One such stock is a mining company whereby the Vice Chairman had invested US 34 million to buy the shares of the company  We are monitoring Hong Kong property sector as well  Land is scarce in Hong Kong  Falling property price is always a buying opportunity for property stocks  We had bought into a stock that has often been called a baby Berkshire Hathaway Inc  It does have many similarities to Berkshire  They are both diversified holding companies  Over the course of the 32 years from 1979 through 2011  the book value per share of the company  inclusive of a special dividend paid out some years ago  has expanded by 18 5  per year  and the share price by 19 8  per year  As a basis for comparison  the total return on the S P 500 during the period was 7 6  per year  Currently the stock trades below its tangible book value  So as an investor you are getting discount for the portfolio of stocks under its management  Investors for this stock come from world class hedge funds and mutual funds  include Ron Baron  Chucke Akre  Paul Tudor  Bruce Berkowitz and Jim Simons

156177,377693,BRKb,The Biggest Mistake Of Warren Buffett s Career ,opinion,Warren Buffett is a hero to many investors  myself included  His record speaks for itself  18 3  annualized returns in Berkshire Hathaway s  BRK A  book value over the past 30 years compared to just 10 8  for the S P 500  And his returns in the 1950s and 1960s  when he was running a much smaller hedge fund  were even better   Mr  Buffett is also quite generous with his investment wisdom  sharing it freely with anyone who cares to listen  But as with most things in life  failure is a better teacher than success  And Mr  Buffett has had his share of multi billion dollar failures   You want to know the biggest mistake of Buffett s career   By his own admission  it was buying Berkshire Hathaway  Everyone assumes that Buffett s decision to buy Berkshire Hathaway was a typical Buffett stroke of genius  Nothing could be further from the truth   We like to think of Warren Buffett as the wise  elder statesman of the investment profession  but Buffett too was young once and prone to the rash behavior of youth  And Berkshire Hathaway was not always a financial powerhouse  it was once a struggling textile mill   Buffett had noticed a trading pattern in Berkshire s stock  when the company would sell off an underperforming mill  it would use the proceeds to buy back stock  which would temporarily boost the stock price  Buffett s strategy was to buy Berkshire stock each time it sold a mill and then sell the company its stock back in the share repurchase for a small  tidy profit   But then ego got in the way  Buffett and Berkshire s CEO had a gentleman s agreement on a tender offer price  But when the office offer arrived in the mail  Buffett noticed that the CEO s offer price was 1 8 of a point lower than they had agreed previously Taking the offer as a personal insult  Buffett bought a controlling interest in the company so that he could have the pleasure of firing its CEO  And though it might have given him satisfaction at the time  Buffett later called the move a  200 billion dollar mistake    Why  Because Buffett wasted precious time and capital on a textile mill in terminal decline rather than allocate his funds in something more profitable in his case  insurance   By Buffett s estimates  had he never invested a penny in Berkshire Hathaway and had instead used his funds to buy  say  Geico  his returns over the course of his career would have been doubled  Berkshire will still go down in history as one of the greatest investment success stories in history  of course  But it was a terrible investment and a major distraction that cost Buffett dearly in terms of opportunity cost   What lessons can we learn from this  I ll leave you with two quotes from Buffett himself    If you get into a lousy business  get out of it     If you want to be known as a good manager  buy a good business    In trader lingo  cut your losers and let your winners ride  Holding on to a bad investment wastes good capital and mental energies that would be better put to use elsewhere   Thank you  Mr  Buffett  for sharing your failures with us  Your willingness to do so is one of the reasons we love you  Below you may find the video ,2013-05-02,Charles Sizemore,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-biggest-mistake-of-warren-buffett’s-career-165304,165304

year intraday high of 1576 on increased trading volume to set a new record of 1589  Catalysts appeared to be a promising start to earnings season and the early release of the March FOMC minutes  which

recovering ever since Not surprisingly  the higher beta Russell 2000 small caps and Nasdaq were Wednesday s big leaders with 1 8  gains  but it s notable that equity correlations remain quite high on strongly bullish days  as all boats are lifted in the rising tide  The S P 500 large caps rose 1 2  One of the exceptions to the bullish behavior was Titan Machinery  TITN   which fell 14  on an earnings miss  Sabrient subsidiary Gradient Analytics  which publishes in depth forensic accounting research and a quantitative Earnings Quality Rank  has been negative on the stock Among the 10 U S  business sectors  Telecom and Technology were the big winners on Wednesday  although Healthcare was also strong yet again and still stands above the rest of the field as the leading sector in year to date performance  The iShares Healthcare Sector Fund  IYH  is up nearly 19  YTD  while the iShares Basic Materials Sector Fund  IYM  is only at breakeven after some recovery this week However  it s notable that the top three performers so far this year among the 10 U S  sector iShares are all considered defensive sectors  Healthcare  Utilities  and Consumer Goods  And this general investor conservatism is also reflected in the general outperformance of value oriented mutual funds over growth funds over the past four quarters  Furthermore  we can t ignore the fact that the past three years saw early gains give way in April to significant market pullbacks But each of those pullbacks saw the market rise again later in the year  And an underlying conservatism among stock investors with a preference for value and dividends is not necessarily a bad thing  It might suggest that stocks are being led higher by longer term investors rather than by hot money  junk rallies   If earnings season continues to be strong  investors might be treated to sustained market strength this year rather than the usual yo yo Looking at the charts  the S P500 SPDR Trust  SPY  closed Wednesday at 158 67 and has broken out strongly above the sideways channel between about 153 5 and 157 that has been in place since the gap up on March 5  The 20 day simple moving average has been providing short term support  and the 40 day SMA has provided reliable secondary support  Oscillators RSI  MACD  and Slow Stochastic are all pointing up  The breakout is letting the Bollinger Bands spread apart after pinching together about as tight as they ever get  and now price might need to consolidate for a day or two to allow the upper band catch up The CBOE Market Volatility Index  VIX   a k a   fear gauge   closed Wednesday at 12 36  which is back to reflecting high levels of investor complacency  Last Friday  it spiked at the open to above 15  but that level held as strong resistance  and equities have steadily recovered ever since By the way  Sabrient s  Baker s Dozen  top 13 stocks for 2013 is up a robust 14 3  through Wednesday since its inception on January 11  which is 5 6  higher than last Wednesday s close   Over the same 3 month timeframe  the S P 500 is up 7 9   which is 2 4  higher than last Wednesday s close   The portfolio s impressive performance is led by identical 36  gains in the two Energy Stocks  Marathon Petroleum  MPC  and EPL Oil   Gas  EPL   Note that Sabrient is about to introduce a fresh list of 20 new  Earnings Busters  for Q2 Latest rankings  The table ranks each of the ten U S  industrial sector iShares ETFs by Sabrient s proprietary Outlook Score  which employs a forward looking  fundamentals based  quantitative algorithm to create a bottom up composite profile of the constituent stocks within the ETF  The multi factor model considers forward valuation  historical earnings trends  earnings growth prospects  the dynamics of Wall Street analysts  consensus estimates  accounting practices and earnings quality  and various return ratios  In addition  the table also shows Sabrient s proprietary Bull Score and Bear Score for each ETF High Bull score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended recently toward relative outperformance during particularly strong market periods  while a high Bear score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended to hold up relatively well during particularly weak market periods  Bull and Bear are backward looking indicators of recent sentiment trend As a group  these three scores can be quite helpful for positioning a portfolio for a given set of anticipated market conditions Observations  1  Technology  IYW  continues to hold the top spot with an Outlook score of 74  although it continues to drop from its recent highs above 90  IYW continues to display a low forward P E  strong projected long term growth  and the best trailing return ratios  Financial  IYF  moves into second place with a 71 this week as its score rose 6 points  while defensive sector Consumer Goods  IYK  saw its score fall a few points to 68 2  Telecom  IYZ  stays in the cellar with an Outlook score of 0  It is among the worst in every metric in the model  particularly forward P E  trailing return ratios  and insider sentiment  It is joined in the bottom two again this week by Basic Materials  IYM  3  Financial  IYF  and Utilities  IDU  have seen the most improvement in Wall Street sentiment this week  while Basic Materials  IYM  and Energy  IYE  endured eroding sentiment  i e   the greatest net earnings downgrades 4  Overall  this week s rankings maintain a neutral tone  although I think there s slightly less of a defensive tilt than last week  given the reemergence of IYF  Defensive sectors IYK  IDU  and IYH still rank in the top five  while economically sensitive sectors IYE  IYJ  IYM  and IYC are all in the bottom half  while the top bottom spread continues to narrow 5  Looking at the Bull scores  Energy  IYE  remains the leader on particularly strong market days  scoring 58  Surprisingly  Basic Materials  IYM  is the laggard on strong market days  scoring 48  But the top bottom spread is a relatively narrow 10 points  which continues to indicate high correlation on strongly bullish days 6  Looking at the Bear scores  Utilities  IDU  is serving as the favorite  safe haven  on weak market days  scoring 63  Basic Materials  IYM  is by far the worst during extreme market weakness as reflected in its low Bear score of 42  The top bottom spread has widened to 21 points  which indicates low correlations on weak market days    i e   it pays to be in the right sectors when the market is bearish 7  Overall  Consumer Goods  IYK  shows the best all weather combination of Outlook Bull Bear scores  Adding up the three scores gives a total of 178  Telecom  IYZ  is by far the worst at 108  Looking at just the Bull Bear combination  Utilities  IDU  shows an impressive total score of 117  as both its Bull and Bear score jumped this week  Materials  IYM  displays by far the lowest score at 90  This indicates that Utilities stocks have performed the best in extreme market conditions  whether bullish or bearish  while Materials stocks are avoided altogether These Outlook scores represent the view that Technology and Financial sectors may be relatively undervalued  while Telecom and Basic Materials sectors may be relatively overvalued based on our 1 3 month forward look Top ranked stocks within Technology and Financial include QUALCOMM  QCOM   SanDisk  SNDK   The Howard Hughes Corp  HHC   and Berkshire Hathaway  BRKB  Disclosure  Author has no positions in stocks or ETFs mentioned  About SectorCast  Rankings are based on Sabrient s SectorCast model  which builds a composite profile of each equity ETF based on bottom up aggregate scoring of the constituent stocks  The Outlook Score employs a fundamentals based multi factor approach considering forward valuation  earnings growth prospects  Wall Street analysts  consensus revisions  accounting practices  and various return ratios  It has tested to be highly predictive for identifying the best  most undervalued  and worst  most overvalued  sectors  with a 1 3 month forward look Bull Score and Bear Score are based on the price behavior of the underlying stocks on particularly strong and weak days during the prior 40 market days  They reflect investor sentiment toward the stocks  on a relative basis  as either aggressive plays or safe havens  So  a high Bull score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended recently toward relative outperformance during particularly strong market periods  while a high Bear score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended to hold up relatively well during particularly weak market periods Thus  ETFs with high Bull scores generally perform better when the market is hot  ETFs with high Bear scores generally perform better when the market is weak  and ETFs with high Outlook scores generally perform well over time in various market conditions Of course  each ETF has a unique set of constituent stocks  so the sectors represented will score differently depending upon which set of ETFs is used  For Sector Detector  I use ten iShares ETFs representing the major U S  business sectors About Trading Strategies  There are various ways to trade these rankings  First  you might run a sector rotation strategy in which you buy long the top 2 4 ETFs from SectorCast ETF  rebalancing either on a fixed schedule  e g   monthly or quarterly  or when the rankings change significantly  Another alternative is to enhance a position in the SPDR Trust exchange traded fund  SPY  depending upon your market bias  If you are bullish on the broad market  you can go long the SPY and enhance it with additional long positions in the top ranked sector ETFs  Conversely  if you are bearish and short  or buy puts on  the SPY  you could also consider shorting the two lowest ranked sector ETFs to enhance your short bias However  if you prefer not to bet on market direction  you could try a market neutral  long short trade that is  go long  or buy call options on  the top ranked ETFs and short  or buy put options on  the lowest ranked ETFs  And here s a more aggressive strategy to consider  You might trade some of the highest and lowest ranked stocks from within those top and bottom ranked ETFs ,2013-04-11,Scott

156225,377741,BRKb,A Note On The Purchase Of Heinz,opinion,I need to correct one thing that I wrote yesterday  3G and Berkshire Hathaway each own 50  of Heinz  once the transaction is done  I mistakenly thought that both sides were putting up equal amounts of capital  when they are only putting up equal amounts of common equity  So when you look at the financing of the  23 billion purchase price for Heinz it should look like this  The equity interest of BRK is equal to that of 3G  and if things go well with Heinz  whatever the form of the warrants are  Buffett can add to his equity interest by paying a fixed price  We don t know the terms of the warrants   how much stock it covers  what is the strike price  how long does it last  and any other provisions  What we do know is that though Berkshire claims to be the passive investor here  it possesses the right to become the dominant investor economically  even if it does not take control as a result  This is a major reason to reject the thesis that BRK is 3G s banker  Far better to say that 3G is Buffett s highly paid servant  They will do the dirty work  the grunt work  and Buffett will benefit more under most scenarios  Also  Wells Fargo   JP Morgan will be raising the debt portion of this offering  I see it looking something like this  an entity allied with Berkshire and 3G floats bonds and raises cash  The cash goes to shareholders  along with the cash from BRK and 3G  paying off HNZ shareholders at  72 50 share  The debt attaches to Heinz and not BRK or 3G  Another way would be a bridge loan prior to the merger that gets paid off by a debt offering and special dividend after the merger  This of course makes the bond market jumpy  The long debt of Heinz has sold off  whereas the shorter debt has not    The bond market fears a lot of long dated issuance  and a possible downgrade to junk   7 Billion of new debt is a lot  when you only have  5 Billion of debt  and another  8 Billion of preferred stock coming  That is a quadrupling of common stock leverage  What we don t know  The exact mechanics of how the debt portion of the deal gets done The terms of the warrants Now think for a moment about this from the perspective of 3G  Heinz has  1B of net income  Buffett gets  720 million of preferred stock dividends  New debt might absorb  200 million in interest after tax  That leaves around  80 million of profits  half of which go to Berkshire  for your  4 billion outlay  a 1  yr return  But consider if active management raises income to  2B  profits become  1 080 million half of which go to Berkshire  and returns to you are 13 5  yr  leaving aside dilution from BRK option exercise  What I am trying to show is that the tables are skewed here in favor of Buffett  again  He has set up a deal where his partner will be very motivated to cut costs  realize synergies  etc   because they don t make much if they don t  while he makes out fairly well under most scenarios  Heinz does very well   BRK exercises warrants gets majority of economics and controlHeinz muddles   BRK receives preferred dividend  does well Heinz does badly   BRK receives preferred dividend  does well  Might have to write down equity stake Heinz does very badly   BRK preferred dividend halted  buys remainder of Heinz by converting his preferred stock to equity  3G loses it all  Buffett brings in competent management for his now wholly owned subsidiary It s a lot easier for Buffett to win relative to 3G  3G needs strong demand to win  Buffett doesn t  Final note  I am not that impressed with   the present CEO   earning a  does not even double capital for those who were willing to hang on so long  Yes  sales have grown  but what matters to corporations if profit  not volume  On thing thing I learned in the insurance industry   it s easy to get sales  What is hard is getting profitable sales  Yet how many CEOs gain bonuses partially off of sales and other meaningless criteria   far better to use something like five year increase in fully converted tangible book value per share  It better measures how value has grown for shareholders  Full disclosure  long BRK B and WFC,2013-02-20,David Merkel,https://www.investing.com/analysis/a-note-on-the-purchase-of-heinz-156023,156023

156230,377746,BRKb,Comments On The Berkshire Hathaway Annual Letter,opinion,I ll let Buffett speak  and I will add a few comments   When the partnership I ran took control of Berkshire in 1965  I could never have dreamed that a year in which we had a gain of  24 1 billion would be subpar  in terms of the comparison we present on the facing page   But subpar it was  For the ninth time in 48 years  Berkshire s percentage increase in book value was less than the S P s percentage gain  a calculation that includes dividends as well as price appreciation   In eight of those nine years  it should be noted  the S P had a gain of 15  or more  We do better when the wind is in our face   To date  we ve never had a five year period of underperformance  having managed 43 times to surpass the S P over such a stretch   The record is on page 103   But the S P has now had gains in each of the last four years  outpacing us over that period  If the market continues to advance in 2013  our streak of five year wins will end  One thing of which you can be certain  Whatever Berkshire s results  my partner Charlie Munger  the company s Vice Chairman  and I will not change yardsticks  It s our job to increase intrinsic business value   for which we use book value as a significantly understated proxy   at a faster rate than the market gains of the S P  If we do so  Berkshire s share price  though unpredictable from year to year  will itself outpace the S P over time  If we fail  however  our management will bring no value to our investors  who themselves can earn S P returns by buying a low cost index fund    I appreciate Buffett and Munger not changing their metric  They could have said that Berkshire Hathaway s  BRK A  market return beat the S P in 2012  but they didn t  Buffett is a compounder  He figures that if he compounds net worth at an above average rate  he will beat the market returns of the S P 500 over the intermediate term  I agree  building intrinsic value will almost always lead to outperformance  unless the stock was significantly overvalued at the beginning   On Searching for Acquisitions  Our luck  however  changed early this year  In February  we agreed to buy 50  of a holding company that will own all of H  J  Heinz  The other half will be owned by a small group of investors led by Jorge Paulo Lemann  a renowned Brazilian businessman and philanthropist   We couldn t be in better company  Jorge Paulo is a long time friend of mine and an extraordinary manager  His group and Berkshire will each contribute about  4 billion for common equity in the holding company  Berkshire will also invest  8 billion in preferred shares that pay a 9  dividend  The preferred has two other features that materially increase its value  at some point it will be redeemed at a significant premium price and the preferred also comes with warrants permitting us to buy 5  of the holding company s common stock for a nominal sum   Once again  we don t know all of the details  but it really looks like Buffett got the better part of the deal  and by a decent margin  He continues   Our total investment of about  12 billion soaks up much of what Berkshire earned last year  But we still have plenty of cash and are generating more at a good clip  So it s back to work  Charlie and I have again donned our safari outfits and resumed our search for elephants    As many expected  Buffett has more than enough cash to deploy if he sees the right deal  With valuations being high  I don t see how they fire the elephant gun  unless a company with protected boundaries wants to sell   Though I failed to land a major acquisition in 2012  the managers of our subsidiaries did far better  We had a record year for  bolt on  purchases  spending about  2 3 billion for 26 companies that were melded into our existing businesses  These transactions were completed without Berkshire issuing any shares   Charlie and I love these acquisitions  Usually they are low risk  burden headquarters not at all  and expand the scope of our proven managers   The tuck in acquisitions of BRK are particularly valuable  Done out of the spotlight  they get done at reasonable terms  and grow BRK organically   The new investment managers  Combs and Weschler  did well in 2012  and Buffett is giving them more assets to manage   As noted in the first section of this report  we have now operated at an underwriting profit for ten consecutive years  our pre tax gain for the period having totaled  18 6 billion  Looking ahead  I believe we will continue to underwrite profitably in most years  If we do  our float will be better than free money    Now interest rates are low  and underwriting standards are far tougher across the industry than if we were in a high interest rate environment   Let me emphasize once again that cost free float is not an outcome to be expected for the P C industry as a whole  There is very little  Berkshire quality  float existing in the insurance world  In 37 of the 45 years ending in 2011  the industry s premiums have been inadequate to cover claims plus expenses  Consequently  the industry s overall return on tangible equity has for many decades fallen far short of the average return realized by American industry  a sorry performance almost certain to continue What Buffett is saying is that his float is unique because His company underwrites carefully There is a decent amount of long tailed business The short tailed business  GEICO  is growing  which makes short dated float feel long   in essence Buffett can borrow short and invest long  for now A further unpleasant reality adds to the industry s dim prospects  Insurance earnings are now benefitting  sic  from  legacy  bond portfolios that deliver much higher yields than will be available when funds are reinvested during the next few years   and perhaps for many years beyond that  Today s bond portfolios are  in effect  wasting assets  Earnings of insurers will be hurt in a significant way as bonds mature and are rolled over   He is overstating the case here  Most P C insurers run short asset portfolios and have already adjusted to the low interest rate environment   Now regarding the non insurance operating businesses of BRK  they almost all had good years in 2012  I m not going to say more  though I will say that Buffett spent too much ink on newspapers  it is a teensy part of BRK  Finally  Buffett talks about dividends  There are two major ideas here Dividends are tax disadvantaged versus buybacks If you can compound earnings at an above average rate  there is no reason to ever pay a dividend What this might mean is that when a future CEO of BRK concludes that  there are no more worlds left to conquer  a la Alexander the Great  it would be reasonable to pay a dividend  That said  he could also Centralize HR  legal and other functions Streamline subsidiaries  and make fewer managers manage more of BRK E g   turn BRK into a real company There would be many ways to reshape BRK post Buffett  There are benefits and costs to doing that  but I think the benefits would be significant  unless the new CEO could keep the  hands off  way that Buffett does private equity Full Disclosure  Long BRK B,2013-03-03,David Merkel,https://www.investing.com/analysis/comments-on-the-berkshire-hathaway-annual-letter-157404,157404

156244,377760,BRKb,Thoughts On How To Manage Your Watchlist,opinion,Before I start  a quick story  One day in March  I got an e mail from an older gentleman  and he said   Hi  my name is XXXXXX  Please call me   The name sounded familiar but I couldn t place it  So I called him  and he asked   I own a decent amount of Berkshire Hathaway  Can you explain to me why the value of the put options Buffett sold have risen from 3Q11 to 4Q11   After talking to him for a little bit  he said   So you really don t know   I replied   Yes  I don t really know  but give me a couple of hours  and I can give you a decent answer   So I told him I would give him an answer via e mail  and follow with hardcopy  As it was  we were both wrong  the value of the put options had fallen  But then it hit me why the name was familiar   he was one of the   You never know where you might go  or who you might meet just because you write some obscure blog  Oh  yeah  you might just get to go to the US Treasury  and meet you know who  And now a question from a reader I ve learned a lot from your blog  Thanks for the effort you put in to maintain it   Today s post was great  was just listening to my Intelligent Investor CD while driving last night and was thinking about how Graham talks about the need to be businesslike when investing   I had a question about your investing process  specifically how you track stocks that look interesting to you  For instance  I use value line and I flip through the pages on a daily basis  jotting down interesting tickers in a notebook  I then go to a few scans and watchlists  again jotting down tickers I d like to research further  After that  I take my list of tickers and do some brief research to determine if they should go on my watchlist  This is where I need to change a few things  I use Morningstar to track my watchlists  which is great because it keeps track of all of the financial data automatically  but the problem is that as my watchlist grows  I find certain cheap stocks on the list but I can t recall why I put them there  There is no spot for notes on Morningstar s watchlist  so I thought about using a google spreadsheet  but I really don t want two different things to track  Walter Schloss was famous for not owning a computer and simply flipping through value line  There must be a simpler way to track stocks that look interesting  Just wondering if you could share any thoughts on how you track potential stocks and how you refine your watchlist if it starts to get too large  Thanks David  I don t have a permanent watchlist  I generate ideas three ways 1  I read a lot of articles  When an idea sounds clever  I write it on a small piece of paper and set it in a pile to age 2  I study industries more than companies  and look for strong companies in weak industries  and levered companies in industries that are likely to remain strong for awhile  I use Value Line here  and screen for companies that might yield a 15  year return  while being above average in terms of balance sheet strength 3  I read through the 13Ds of a group of  75 investors that I respect  and look at the companies that are large holdings relative to market cap that are still being acquired Then I take all of my ideas once per quarter  shortly after the 13Ds are filed  and compare them against existing portfolio holdings against a variety of valuation metrics  sentiment variables  and other factors I then rank all of the companies as a group  looking at where the middle company in my existing portfolio is  Companies I don t own that are above it are candidates for purchase  Companies I own that are below the middle portfolio company are candidates for sale I then sit down and analyze  and pair off stocks to sell versus stocks to buy  unless there is some reason to increase or decrease the number of stocks in the portfolio  which is usually around 35  Presently it is 34  I buy sell 2 3 stocks per quarter  That keeps things fresh  but allows me to hold companies for longer periods of time   My turnover is 25  of the open end mutual fund industry  After I make my series of buys and sells  I throw all my work away  and start accumulating data for the next quarter My sense is that it pays more to think of your portfolio versus candidates than to track candidates The main idea here is that we should always be improving the character quality of the portfolio  Trade things that are worse for things that are better  Human beings can do that trade  What is hard is for people to assemble the best stocks  Getting a bunch of  pretty good  stocks can be done  and it does not mean they will outperform all the time  Getting a portfolio of all of the best stocks is impossible So think economically   try to improve your portfolio regularly  regular incremental improvements yield a large economic improvement over a market cycle  At least  that has been my experience ,2012-12-26,David

156247,377763,BRKb,Is Sears The Next Berkshire Hathaway  ,opinion,I originally penned this articled in   Given Sears  stock action in the year that has passed  it s worth another read  A well respected value investor buys an old American company in decline  promising to restore its fortunes  Alas  the recovery never comes  The economics of the industry have changed  and the company cannot compete with younger  nimbler rivals  The company ceases operations  but the value investor holds onto the shell to use as an investment vehicle  Could this be the future of Sears Holdings  SHLD  under Eddie Lampert  Maybe  maybe not  But it was certainly the case for Warren Buffett s Berkshire Hathaway  BRK A   Unless you re a history buff or a dedicated Buffett disciple  you might not have known that Berkshire Hathaway was not always an insurance and investment conglomerate  It was a textile mill  and not a particularly profitable one  It was  however  a cash cow  And after buying the company in 1964  Buffett used the cash that the declining textile business threw off to make many of the investments he is now famous for  starting with insurance company Geico  So  when hedge fund superstar Eddie Lampert first brought Kmart out of bankruptcy in 2003  the parallels were obvious  With its debts discharged  the retailer would throw off plenty of cash to fund Lampert s future investments  And even if the retail business continued to struggle  Lampert could and did sell off some of the company s prime real estate to retailers in a better position to use it  Lampert sold 18 stores to the Home Depot  HD  for a combined  271 million in the first year  That Lampert would use Kmart s pristine balance sheet to purchase Sears  Roebuck    Co  itself a struggling retailer seemed somewhat odd  but his management decisions after the merger seemed to confirm that his strategy was cash cow milking  Lampert continued to talk up the combined retailer s prospects  of course  But his emphasis was on relentless cost cutting  and he invested only the absolute bare minimum to keep the doors open  Sears Holdings didn t have to compete with the likes of Home Depot or Wal Mart  WMT   It just had to stay in business long enough for Lampert to wring out every dollar he could before selling off the company s assets  The strategy might have played out just fine were it not for the bursting of the housing bubble which killed demand for the company s Kenmore appliances and Craftsman tools and the onset of the worst recession in decades  With retail sales in the toilet  and looking to stay there for a while   there was little demand among competing retailers for the company s real estate assets  It s fair to blame Lampert for making what was  in effect  a major real estate investment near the peak of the biggest real estate bubble in American history  But investors frustrated by watching the share price fall by more than 80 percent from its 2007 highs have no one to blame but themselves  Anyone who bought Sears when it traded for nearly  200 per share clearly didn t do their homework  They instead were hoping to ride Lampert s coattails while somehow ignoring the value investor s core principle of maintaining safety by not overpaying for assets  Lampert is a great investor with a great long term track record  and there is nothing wrong with paying a modest  Lampert premium  for shares of Sears Holdings  If you like Lampert s investment style but lack the means to invest in his hedge fund  Sears may be the closest you can get  But at  200 per share or even  100 the Lampert premium had been blown completely out of proportion  The same is true of Buffett  of course  or of any great investor  As the Sage of Omaha would no doubt agree  there is a price at which Berkshire Hathaway is no longer attractive either  This brings us back to the title of this piece is Sears the Next Berkshire Hathaway  I would answer  yes   but not necessarily for the reasons you think  Everyone assumes that Buffett s decision to buy Berkshire Hathaway was a typical Buffett stroke of genius  Nothing could be further from the truth  In fact  Buffett revealed in an interview last year that Berkshire Hathaway was the worst trade of his career We like to think of Warren Buffett as the wise  elder statesman of the investment profession  but Buffett too was young once and prone to the rash behavior of youth  He had been trading Berkshire Hathaway s stock in his hedge fund  he noticed that when the company would sell off an underperforming mill  it would use the proceeds to buy back stock  Buffett intended to sell Berkshire Hathaway its own stock back for a small  tidy profit  But due to a tender offer that Buffett took as a personal insult  he essentially bought a controlling interest in the company so that he could have the pleasure of firing its CEO  And though it might have given him satisfaction at the time  Buffett called the move a  200 billion dollar mistake   Why  Because Buffett wasted precious time and capital on a textile mill in terminal decline rather than allocate his funds in something more profitable in his case  insurance  Berkshire Hathaway will still go down in history as one of the greatest investment success stories in history  But by Buffett s own admission  he would have had far greater returns over his career had he never touched it  So  in a word   yes   Sears probably is the next Berkshire Hathaway  And investors who buy Sears at a reasonable price will most likely enjoy enviable long term returns as Lampert s plans are eventually realized  But Mr  Lampert himself will almost certainly come to regret buying the company if he doesn t already  Below you may find the video ,2013-01-11,Charles

156249,377765,BRKb,The Real Truth About How To Become Super Rich,opinion,My main goal this evening is to discredit those who tell you that you can get rich quick by investing in the secondary markets  That won t work  It sort of worked for Buffett  but a lot of his success came from creating a holding company  and buying entire businesses  not just fractions of companies that he would not control Even the top entertainers and sports stars rarely become super rich unless they have an iron discipline  and hand over their excess assets to an honest and talented advisor  who shepherds them and grows them  and gives the client personal advice as needed  That s what I do  though I have no famous clients As with so many things  it comes down to self control  Can you defer self gratification  Will you seek talented advisors who are honest  They aren t easy to find Those that become super rich form their own firms  and use them to further their wealth  They hire talented people to grow their wealth  It can be a purely industrial firm  It can be part industrial and investing  like Loews  Berkshire Hathaway  Leucadia  Icahn  etc  It can be a private firm  whether private equity  a hedge fund  or an industrial firm The main idea here is that great wealth typically comes through running a large firm that is very profitable  which concentrates the efforts of others  Significant wealth never comes through your own labors or secondary market investing  It comes through creating a very profitable firm Now  I want to add one more tangential observation here  It s easier to make a lot of money by offering investment advice  than by investing your own money yourself  Why  In offering advice  your margins are virtually unlimited  Every new subscriber is gravy  Your own capital is limited  so your returns are limited But the record of newsletters is poor  that s why I have never considered a newsletter  I buy no newsletters because they have no value  I sell no newsletters because my best insights should go to my clients  I have never seen a newsletter in my life that genuinely offered value Far better that you build your own firm with your valuable differential insights  than that you try to make money in the public markets  Those who are very rich managed large firms that became dominant Now  few of us can do that  That s the way the world works  And most who try it will fail  Far better to aim lower and achieve a happy outcome  than strain after riches that never come ,2013-01-30,David Merkel,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-real-truth-about-how-to-become-super-rich-153041,153041

156282,377798,BRKb,Buffett s Gen Re Sees  Tendency To Higher Gold Prices ,opinion,Tuesday s AM fix was USD 1 706 75  EUR 1 305 35  and GBP 1 058 65 per ounce  Monday s AM fix was USD 1 718 00  EUR 1 317 59  and GBP 1 069 67 per ounce Gold climbed  2 00 or 0 12  in New York yesterday and closed at  1 715 20 oz  Silver dropped to  33 38 then rose to as high as  33 821 and then retreated  but it still finished with a gain of 0 66   Gold fell to its lowest point in a month on Tuesday  briefly touching  1 700 oz after a drop below  1 710 oz triggered some technical selling  Investors with a longer time horizon continue to accumulate on the dip and the uncertainty of shaky sovereign economies will fuel continuing diversification into gold Yesterday  Australia s central bank cut interest rates   point to match a record low  Central banks around the world continue to flood the market with cheap  printed fiat money which will continue to boost gold bullion  Platinum group metals have see a rise in the past few weeks in tandem with car sales data  as the metals are used in exhaust catalysts  Warren Buffett s General Re New England Asset Management has warned that until central bank monetary policies around the world change  there will be a tendency to higher gold prices   General Re New England Asset Management  a unit of Warren Buffett s Berkshire Hathaway Inc   said gold may advance as businesses temper spending and central bank stimulus measures fall short Gold s climb last year to more than  1 900 an ounce was fuelled by the expectation that government spending cuts in Europe would reduce demand for goods and services  GR NEAM Chief Investment Officer John Gilbert wrote in a newsletter posted on the unit s website today  as reported by Bloomberg   There is growing evidence that the rising price of gold is a statement about the discouraging prospects for returns on productive investments   Gilbert said   We hope that this analysis is wrong  We fear that it is not  Buffett  82  has said productive assets like farms and companies will outperform gold over the long term  Gold retains some of its appeal to investors even as central banks around the world implement policies to spur investment  Gilbert said  Businesses express caution by not making the investments necessary to improve productivity   Gilbert wrote  It s not  clear that activist central banks can repeal gravity by encouraging investors to take risk anyway  There will be a tendency to higher gold prices until that changes  GR NEAM had  64 4 billion in unaffiliated assets under management as of Sept  30  The investment adviser primarily serves insurers The European Central Bank has provided the region s banks with cheap three year loans and committed to buy the bonds of distressed nations as long as they fix their budgets and reform their economies  The Federal Reserve has kept borrowing costs near zero and expanded its balance sheet to help stimulate the U S  economy  the world s largest Buffett said in a February letter to Berkshire shareholders that investors should avoid gold  because its uses are limited and it doesn t have the potential of farmland or companies to produce new wealth  Achieving a long term gain on the metal requires an  expanding pool of buyers  who believe the group will increase further  he said  What motivates most gold purchasers is their belief that the ranks of the fearful will grow   he wrote   During the past decade that belief has proved correct  Beyond that  the rising price has on its own generated additional buying enthusiasm  attracting purchasers who see the rise as validating an investment thesis  As  bandwagon  investors join any party  they create their own truth    for a while  Buffett and his partner Charlie Munger s lack of appreciation of gold as financial insurance and bias against gold either shows a significant and potentially costly blind spot  Alternatively  there is an element of  talking their own book  as Berkshire is obviously very exposed to the U S  dollar  U S  equities and U S  banks and the pair may realise the threat that gold poses to their lack of diversification The performance of Berkshire Hathaway versus gold since 1996 and since the outset of the financial crisis five years ago  see charts  shows gold s importance as a hedging instrument and a safe haven in a portfolio Buffett deserves the title  Sage of Omaha  and is to be respected but his failure to appreciate gold s importance as a diversification in a portfolio and his repeated negativity towards gold  in contrast to his father Howard Buffett  will not be judged kindly in financial history It is never too late to do the right thing and to ensure his legacy Buffett should acknowledge gold has intrinsic value  has utility as money  as monetary asset  a finite currency and as financial insurance in a portfolio  By acknowledging the truth he will regain much respect  help protect many investors and he may even manage to protect and grow his own and his shareholders wealth ,2012-12-05,Mark

156285,377801,BRKb,Weighing The Week Ahead  Decision Time ,opinion,Decision time has arrived  After many months of debate  sparring  and posturing  the deadline has arrived for U S  policymakers to resolve the various matters that are popularly described as the  fiscal cliff   This is a handy simplification  In the finest American tradition it allows everyone to have an opinion whether or not they have any information  The average person knows only that something really bad is about to happen  and it will send taxes higher  Observers in other parts of the world see the U S  as unable to address major problems while still offering plenty of advice to every other country  Many of the media sources are unable to distinguish between political commentary and analysis of developments The oversimplification adopted by a leading financial TV network is that leaders should  rise above  politics and simply do what is right  An obvious problem with this approach is that no one elected the network to tell the rest of us what is right  Some Helpful Distinctions There are two major mistakes that account for most of the bogus analysis  Emphasis on politics  During elections issues are sharply framed  Appeals are directed at the most extreme and partisan elements  Television ads are negative  In the time between elections the U S  has historically enjoyed periods of bipartisan cooperation  especially when there was a widely recognized problem or a common enemy  Those who have followed the hard hitting elections of the last decade often lose perspective  They cannot imagine a person they voted against behaving in a cooperative fashion  Blaming participants rather than the process  It is entirely possible for everyone involved to be intelligent  well intentioned  and hard working    and yet we still have a terrible outcome  The U S  has a very conservative political process  it is easy to block change  Here s why a policy desired by the majority can often be easily blocked  Either House of Congress or the President can stop a proposal  All must agree to any changes The Senate requires a 60  super majority on most legislation  since a minority can delay indefinitely through the filibuster  Ending a filibuster requires a cloture motion  and 60 of the 100 votes   It used to take 67  The House Speaker can block proposals from reaching the floor for a vote  This is true even when a majority would support the proposal if a vote were to be taken  The Republicans follow something called the  Hastert Rule   named after former Speaker Dennis Hastert   This custom  not a legal procedure  says that the Speaker should only allow a vote on legislation supported by a majority of Republicans    a majority of the majority  Since the GOP has a slim majority in the House  it means that 27  could block the wishes of the entire House   There are some arcane methods for avoiding this  but not effective in the current case  Despite these obstacles  the process has worked well enough for over 200 years  Has something gone wrong  Are things somehow different  Yes  there have been changes  and not for the good  I ll offer my own take on what to expect on the fiscal cliff in the conclusion  Let us first do our regular review of last week s news and data  Background on  Weighing the Week Ahead  There are many good lists of upcoming events  One source I especially like is the weekly post from the WSJ s  There is a nice combination of data  speeches  and other events  In contrast  I highlight a smaller group of events  My theme is an expert guess about what we will be watching on TV and reading in the mainstream media  It is a focus on what I think is important for my trading and client portfolios  This is unlike my other articles  where I develop a focused  logical argument with supporting data on a single theme  Here I am simply sharing my conclusions  Sometimes these are topics that I have already written about  and others are on my agenda  I am putting the news in context  Readers often disagree with my conclusions  Do not be bashful  Join in and comment about what we should expect in the days ahead  This weekly piece emphasizes my opinions about what is really important and how to put the news in context  I have had great success with my approach  but feel free to disagree  That is what makes a market  Last Week s Data Each week I break down events into good and bad  Often there is  ugly  and on rare occasion something really good  My working definition of  good  has two components  The news is market friendly  Our personal policy preferences are not relevant for this test  And especially    no politics It is better than expectations The Good The economic news last week was mostly good  Initial jobless claims were back to the pre Sandy range at 361K  We continue to follow the  from The Bonddad Blog  who is trying to work through the distortions in this important data series Building permits increased  but the gain was mostly for multi family Personal income and spending were quite strong Rail traffic showed a surprising increase versus seasonal expectations  We need more data  but  that we pay close attention The Chicago Fed economic activity index is improving  See for a full analysis The Bad There was some bad news last week  but not very much Leading economic indicators from the Conference Board were a big disappointment  The six month gain has evaporated  via   Michigan sentiment was even lower than the depressed expectations  The fiscal cliff is hitting confidence  and possibly holiday spending  even before our leaders have decided  People have underestimated the continuing economic effects of these issues  pretending that the end of year deadline is adequate for a decision Inaction on the fiscal cliff was the big item The Ugly I propose that we take a break from  the ugly  this week  There is plenty to worry about  and I have a long list of candidates  We have had enough ugliness in the last few weeks  and we ll get back to worrying about everything in the next installment  Meanwhile  Scott Grannis   He has a paragraph on worries  but then goes to a collection of ten comforting charts  My favorite is the one on building permits  up 27  in the last year  Scott and I agree that this is a good leading indicator  Read the article for the other nine charts and the list of worries  The Silver Bullet I occasionally give the Silver Bullet award to someone who takes up an unpopular or thankless cause  doing the real work to demonstrate the facts  Think of The Lone Ranger  This week s award goes to Warren Buffett  The political content on CNBC has increased  but at least some of the material is labeled as an editorial  It should still be accurate  Gary Kaminsky attacked Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway  BRK A  for a stock buyback that he called  hypocritical   He characterized it as an attempt to help an early investor avoid a possible increase in capital gains taxes  It was a thinly veiled attack on Buffett s political viewpoint  Kaja Whitehouse s  provides the background as well as the Buffett response    a sharp lesson for Kaminsky both in tax law and also the stated Berkshire policies on buybacks  I understand that Mr  Buffett would rather beat me at bridge than win the Silver Bullet award  He is also defending his own position  unlike prior award recipients  We should still take note of his action  partly because it forced CNBC to acknowledge the error  They never do this when I send them corrections  Meanwhile  CNBC   Instead of helping the individual investor  they are trying to  outFox  the competition  The Indicator Snapshot  It is important to keep the current news in perspective  My weekly snapshot includes the most important summary indicators  The The key measures from our  Felix  ETF model An updated analysis of recession probability The SLFSI reports with a one week lag  This means that the reported values do not include last week s market action  The SLFSI has moved a lot lower  and is now out of the trigger range of my pre determined risk alarm  This is an excellent tool for managing risk objectively  and it has suggested the need for more caution  Before implementing this indicator our team did extensive research  discovering a  warning range  that deserves respect  We of 1 1 or higher as a place to consider reducing positions  The SLFSI is not a market timing tool  since it does not attempt to predict how people will interpret events  It uses data  mostly from credit markets  to reach an objective risk assessment  The biggest profits come from going all in when risk is high on this indicator  but so do the biggest losses  The C Score is a weekly interpretation of the best recession indicator I found    Despite the recent media blitz from the ECRI  there is no evidence of an imminent recession  Bob Dieli s most recent report to his clients includes the following   From what we know now  a cycle peak does not appear to be immediately in prospect  And if the number of cars in the parking lots of the malls I drive by every day are any indicator  it does not look like consumers are being reticent in their spending  At a recent client briefing  I referred to this expansion as  the recovery with no friends   It has been fashionable in both the political and the business communities to bad mouth the performance of the economy  I cannot recall another instance where we have had an expansion last the better part of four years without some sector taking the lead and one of the political parties acting as cheerleader   This is an important observation for those of us who want to invest effectively via a contrarian approach   Write to us at main at newarc dot com if you are interested in a free sample report from Bob   Doug Short has  of the ECRI recession prediction  now well over a year old  Doug updates all of the official indicators used by the NBER and also has a helpful list of articles about recession forecasting  He remains open minded about the upcoming evidence  In the  he writes as follows   In my opinion the economic data does not support a recession call  If we have reasonably good holiday sales  recession risk declines further  Of course  our politicians could torpedo the economy by mishandling the Fiscal Cliff budget issues   RecessionAlert uses a variety of different methods  including the ECRI  in developing a Super Index  They also offer a  Anyone following them over the last year would have had useful and profitable guidance on the economy  Georg Vrba explicitly and carefully   I encourage a thorough reading of Georg s work    a few minutes well spent  Readers might also want to review my new   which explains many of the concepts people get wrong   Our  Felix  model is the basis for our  official  vote in the weekly   We have a long public record for these positions  Three weeks ago we switched to a bullish position  and the outlook has become even more positive  These are one month forecasts for the poll  but Felix has a three week horizon  Felix s ratings stabilized at a low level and improved significantly over the last few weeks  The penalty box percentage measures our confidence in the forecast  A high rating means that most ETFs are in the penalty box  so we have less confidence in the overall ratings  That measure has recently moved lower  so we are becoming more aggressive   For more on the penalty box see   For more on the system ratings  you can write to etf at newarc dot com for our free report package or to be added to the  free  weekly ETF email list  You can also write personally to me with questions or comments  and I ll do my best to answer   The Week Ahead The holiday shortened week brings little data and scheduled news  The  A List  includes the following  Initial jobless claims  Th   Employment will continue as the focal point in evaluating the economy  and this is the most responsive indicator Consumer confidence  Th   The confidence news is becoming more important as a concurrent indicator of response to the fiscal cliff debate The  B  List  includes these entries  Chicago PMI  F   Important mostly as the best early read on the national ISM index New home sales  Th   Housing coming to the fore Pending home sales  F  The decision on the fiscal cliff issues will be most important  While nothing official will happen before Thursday  we might expect some hints on Wednesday  Trading Time Frame Felix has moved to a more bullish posture  now fully reflected in trading accounts  It has been a close call for several weeks  Felix has done very well this year  becoming more aggressive in a timely fashion  near the start of the summer rally  and getting out a couple of months ago  Since we only require three buyable sectors  the trading accounts look for the  bull market somewhere  even when the overall picture is neutral  The ratings have moved much higher in the last three weeks  Felix does not follow the fiscal cliff news  responding only to the message from the market  For a fine illustration of the trader versus investor question  see   from reading his book I know that he does not do  articles   on investment maxims  I love this one   And to cap off this talk  and it was a good talk  thanks for coming  I d like to share two quotes from two of the most successful market participants of the last century   The only sound reason for my buying a stock is that it is rising in price        The dumbest reason in the world to buy a stock is because it s going up      Warren Buffett If that doesn t sum up the value investor   momentum investor in a nutshell  I don t know what does   As someone who is both a trader and an investor  I understand completely  Investor Time Frame Each week I think about the market from the perspective of different participants  The right move often depends upon your time frame and risk tolerance  This week I want to highlight Barry Ritholtz s Washington Post article  also published on his blog   Barry has a great  thought provoking list  You may not agree with every entry  I did not   but that is part of the point  You should take up the challenge and do some self examination  I strongly recommend reading the entire article  but let me cite my favorite from the list   8 Gurus  shamans and prognosticators  Wall Street produces market wizards at a prodigious pace  It may be NYC s single biggest export  We love experts to tell us what is going to happen in the future  Never mind that their track record is awful  we prefer the mysticism of the television guru to actual thought  The data about these experts should give us pause  The more confident an expert sounds  the more likely he is to be believed by TV viewers  Unfortunately  the more self confident an expert appears  the worse his her track record is likely to be  And forecasters who get one single big outlier correct are more likely to underperform the rest of the time   Right now  most of the highly publicized experts are telling you what you already know  since that is how they can seem smart  Buying in times of fear is easy to say  but so difficult to implement  Almost everyone I talk with wants to out guess the market  The problem  Value is more readily determined than price  Individual investors too frequently try to imitate traders  guessing whether to be  all in  or  all out   This usually leads to mistakes in market timing  There are plenty of stocks at attractive values right now  Here is what to think about  Risk  If you are like the average investor you have it all wrong  You have been piling into bonds  gold  and dividend funds  All of these categories are now over valued  the result of this stampede  Some of the risk is showing up right now  and you will see more in the next few weeks A portfolio anchor  You need stability  If you are trying to do it with bond funds  you need to understand the risks  I prefer owning specific bonds Stretching yield  My approach is to find some reasonable dividend stocks and sell near term calls against the positions  If you did this skillfully  you could hit double digit annual returns with significantly less risk than simply owning dividend stocks  The range bound market of the last few weeks has been ideal for this approach A little octane  Many investors do not think carefully about asset allocation  There is always volatility  so the key is to  right size  your position  Instead of trying to time the market  try to be a player in the right sectors  the right stocks  and the right size  There are plenty of stocks selling cheaply in terms of their historic P E multiples We have collected some of our recent recommendations in a     a starting point for the long term investor   Comments and suggestions welcome  I am trying to be helpful and I love feedback   Final Thoughts on the Cliff Why is compromise such a challenge  It used to be that the party leaders had real power  There was party discipline  with members punished when they did not play ball  The rule was  to get along  go along  Rookies were not supposed to create problems  Speaker Boehner is trying to follow this tradition  but it does not seem to be working  Why not  In the  old days   and that would be only a few years ago  a member from a safe seat was free to exercise some discretion  Every ten years there is a census and states get to redraw the boundaries for Congressional districts  How this is done depends upon which party is in power in that state  In the past  this has lubricated the wheels of compromise    senior members of Congress who had some freedom to vote their consciences  The safe seats are now safe in the general election  but open to primary challenge  This means that Tea Party  or liberal  extremists can threaten a challenge  This has captured the attention of relatively new GOP members who are therefore not tempted to  rise above   Let s just say that if Maria or one of her colleagues  or you or me  were a member from one of these districts  she would not be acting like   Can you say  former Congressman   It is much easier to be a media pundit and critic than to assume actual responsibility  A legislator must balance personal conclusions with the feedback from constituents  This trend has been exacerbated by changes in rules on campaign funding  Serious challenges are easier to finance  Result  Members from safe seats are less willing to compromise than they were in the past  This does not imply an impossible dilemma  but it does represent a new era  I continue to see leaders as trying to compromise while dealing with the new electoral reality  The single most important thing to understand is that your electoral enemies icons are now playing a different role from that you saw during the campaign  If you did not notice any movement in the Obama position  you have a political fixation and will miss the deal when it comes If you did not notice any movement in the Boehner position   you have a political fixation and will miss the deal when it comes What we learned last week was that there will be 30 45 defections from any proposal that can be characterized as a tax increase  This was information that Speaker Boehner did not have before  It is now obvious that any deal will require support from both parties  This is completely consistent with history  but a new concept for the recent GOP majority  This week we will learn whether the current combination of leaders can achieve a compromise  I am sticking with my forecast from last week   My forecast calls for a resolution of the tax issues before any real economic impact occurs  Republican constituents are most dramatically affected by the AMT and the doc fix  Every poll shows that the GOP will be held accountable  Over 80  of Congressional insiders expect higher taxes on the rich in 2013  It is only a matter of when and how the tax policy will be changed  The publicized sticking point of rates for those with incomes over  250 000 is subject to compromise on the level of income  the exact rate  and adding some limits on deductions  Both sides can claim victory in a compromise   Final Thought I follow a number of inside sources on Washington and Congress  Some raise the concern that Boehner is worrying about his re election as Speaker and therefore completely beholden to the Tea party extremists  On the first day of the new Congress he needs an absolute majority of those voting  Normally this means that the majority party picks a candidate in their own caucus and then votes unanimously for that candidate  There are several stories suggesting that seventeen or more votes might defect from Boehner in a surprise coup  This could lead to repeated votes  until the GOP came up with a new candidate  There is already some opposition to Boehner because of his use of committee assignments to maintain loyalty  What if a few Democrats voted for Boehner  The Dems might figure that a Tea Party  approved candidate would be worse  This would be a totally novel move      Note to Readers I am working through the holidays  but emphasizing the 2013 outlook  I will do updates on my  as needed  but will probably not do a WTWA segment next week ,2012-12-23,Jeff

156306,377822,BRKb,The Muni Minefield,opinion,Municipal bonds have long been viewed as a staple asset class for conservative  income seeking investors   Munis   as they are known  are a large  liquid market of credit rated securities that provide tax exempt  from Federal taxes  income to millions of American investors  Towns  school districts  and other public sector authorities across the country have issued an estimated  3 7 trillion dollars worth of these bonds  But so far this year three municipalities in California  San Bernadino  Stockton  and Mammoth Lakes  have declared bankruptcy and are now asking their bond investors to take reductions in the principal and interest payments they are owed  Just last week  that club appears set to welcome another member as Atwater  a central California city with a population just under 30 000  declared a fiscal emergency and put itself on a path toward bankruptcy  After the Atwater announcement  NBC news reported that one public finance expert had described municipal bankruptcies in California as  spreading like a disease   According to recent reports from Moody s and Fitch s  these recent bankruptcies may only be the beginning  They warn that after decades of steady performance  municipal bonds  and by extension municipal bond funds  may see higher default rates and poorer performance in the years to come If the economy continues to languish in the years ahead municipal bond holders may find themselves in a tight spot  Their financial claims may increasingly compete with the pension claims of retired municipal workers  It s easy to envision a scenario whereby  rich  bond investors are asked to take a haircut so that retired policemen  firefighters  teachers  and other blue collar employees can be made whole on their pension expectations  The brewing class warfare currently playing out in the US presidential campaign may accelerate if the US economic pie continues to shrink Given the uncertainty over domestic bond issuers  investors seeking income may want to consider assets in countries and sectors that offer stronger fundamentals  The current crunch in municipal finances is particularly troubling given the surge in muni bond investing over the past several years  In the wake of the stock market crash of 2008  and the subsequent loss of faith in American economic resiliency  many investors appear to have sought the stability of munis  In addition  as short term interest rates are expected to remain near 0  for years to come  and tax rates are expected to rise for wealthy investors  demand for these tax free securities would be expected to remain high  As a result  any hiccups in the muni market in the years ahead could make a significant impact in the investment world  In truth  municipalities all around the country   not just those in California   are already experiencing stresses like never before  Professor Joshua Rauh of Northwestern University recently estimated that unfunded pension liabilities are as high as  4 4 trillion   that s nearly  30 000 for every household in America  bear in mind  these unfunded liabilities are beyond the commonly discussed federal obligations of Social Security and Medicare  Concerns about municipal bonds are not limited to academia  Nearly two years ago  Meredith Whitney   who previously gained fame by making a bearish call on Citigroup stock   began warning of a  tidal wave  of defaults amongst municipalities  She predicted that there would be between 50 and 100 major municipal bond defaults  at least 42 actually occurred in 2011 alone   In a sign of just how high the stakes are  Whitney was later called to testify before Congress in regards to her prediction Bond insurers   who pay investors in the event that a municipality goes bankrupt   have also come under pressure  Shares of insurer MBIA traded over  70 in 2006but now languish below  12  with a PE ratio of just 5   Shares of its primary competitor  Assured Guaranty  have fared little better  trading at just half its peak value from 2007  also with a PE of 5   Clearly  equity investors are unconvinced that these companies have bright prospects Last month legendary investor Warren Buffet terminated certain contracts that his firm  Berkshire Hathaway  made in the municipal debt market  As reported by the Wall Street Journal  under the contracts  Berkshire would have been required to make payments in the event of bond defaults  By cancelling these contracts  Berkshire is no longer on the hook Whether it s the university professor  the renegade analyst  or one of the most respected investors in the world  it s clear that there are significant concerns about the health of the nation s muni bond market Of course  there is another alternative to default  though one that would be equally injurious to investors  portfolios   It s not hard to imagine that if municipal finances got much worse  municipal bonds could be bought by the Federal Reserve under its new perpetual QE program  Professor Rauh has stated that the municipalities could go to the US Treasury for a bailout  From there  it s just a hop  skip  and a jump to the Federal Reserve announcing that it will add muni bonds to its list of assets that it intends to buy  in addition to Treasury and mortgage backed securities   Muni investors would then be made whole  but at the cost of more inflation  which would then surreptitiously reduce the real value of their portfolios In light of the brewing circumstances of municipal finances  investors would be well advised to review

156309,377825,BRKb,What Next For US Homebuilders ,opinion,Several weeks ago  I identified the homebuilding stocks as a possible leadership candidate out of several  see Suggestions for bulls and bears   For once  it seems that I was ahead of the curve instead of behind the curve in my market calls as Warren Buffett announced last week that Berkshire Hathaway  BRK A  was getting into the business of being realtors  This represents an enormous vote of confidence for the housing sector in America  as per this story from   Warren Buffett s Berkshire Hathaway Inc   BRK A  is extending its bet on the U S  housing market by forming a venture with Brookfield Asset Management Inc   BAM A  as low interest rates  inventory and prices spur a real estate rebound  Berkshire s HomeServices of America Inc  unit will be the majority owner of the venture to manage a U S  residential real  estate affiliate network  according to a statement on the new company s website  The firms plan to offer a new franchise brand  Berkshire Hathaway Home Services  starting next year  Brookfield s network has operated under the Prudential Real Estate and Real Living Real Estate brands  Positive demographics   More demandThe demographic tea leaves are also lining up bullishly for housing   highlighted a report from Moody s indicating that housing demand is about to turn up as the Echo Boomers reach the age where they want more housing as they begin families  It is a well known fact that homeownership in the US has been on a decline  a trend that started even before the financial crisis  Now Moody s predicts this trend will begin reversing next year Their explanation has to do with demographics  Baby boomers are moving into the highest homeownership group by age  while  echo boomers   children of baby boomers  are getting to the age at which they are significantly more likely to own a home than the younger age group  Rising construction employmentWhat s more  last Friday s  showed that the construction sector showed healthy employment gains  Despite being only 4 1  of the workforce  the sector showed 9 1  of the gains of 171K jobs  On a longer term perspective  however  construction employment is still relatively flat and has the potential to go quite a bit higher  especially when I looked at this graph from  Should construction continue to recover  then it would indeed be good news for the US economy and has the potential to feed through into a virtuous cycle of better employment and higher consumer spending What s next So what s next for the investors in homebuilding stocks   In the short term  there could be some turbulence  Despite what some of the polls say  the latest figures from  show Obama solidly in the lead for the big showdown on Tuesday  If Obama were to win re election  which is my base case scenario  then you can expect that capital gains tax rates will rise  In response  expect investors to harvest their capital gains this year instead of waiting to take them next year and get hit with a higher tax bill  What stocks have had the most gains this year  You guessed it  it s the homebuilders  Therefore  in the near term  don t be surprised to see some softness in these stocks as investors take their capital gains in 2012   Longer term  the technical picture looks promising  The relative performance chart below of the SPDR S P Homebuilders Index ETF  XHB  against The SPDR S P 500 ETF  SPY  shows the homebuilder ETF to be in a well defined relative uptrend  red channel  but testing a relative resistance level that dates back to 2007  A breakout out of such a long base suggests a technical target that is well above the relative highs set before the Lehman Crisis of 2007  Should tax related profit taking occur  don t be surprised if these stocks pull back and test the bottom of the relative uptrend  Bottom line  Short term cautious  but long term bullish on the sector  Expect some weakness until year end  but any weakness could be a great opportunity to buy Disclosure  Cam Hui is a portfolio manager at     Qwest    This article is prepared by Mr  Hui as an outside business activity  As such  Qwest does not

156332,377848,BRKb,Gold  Escape From Slavery,opinion,Vice President Joe Biden was accused of racism when suggesting a Romney administration would  unchain banks  that in turn might put the black audience he was talking to back into  shackles   The political uproar overshadows a reality that knows no racial boundaries  a person in debt is not a free person  a nation in debt is not a free nation  Does it mean those with large bank accounts are free  Not so fast   We don t want to downplay the horrific crime of slavery  but want to provide food for thought  debt is often taken on voluntarily  once taken on  however  one is forced to work to pay off one s debt  To be unshackled from banks and creditors  investors may want to consider living debt free and owning gold  Let us explain  Access to credit may fundamentally change one s lifestyle  On the plus side  it opens the path to home ownership and access to capital goods  be that a car  or these days even a mattress or exercise machine  But it also makes the creditor  rather than oneself the boss One symptom of the building credit bubble that caught my attention a decade ago was the rise of Spanish language billboards promoting mortgages  Proud immigrants in search of the American dream were lured into mortgages they could ill afford  Rather than focusing on feeding themselves and their family  the focus shifted to serving the bank  That shift only became apparent once the loan became too expensive to service  either because interest rates were resetting to higher levels or because someone lost their job and thus their income  but the debt remained   Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett famously discusses in his annual shareholder letters that the insurance business is a great business to be in  as policyholders pay him to hold money    Insurers receive premiums up front and pay claims later      This collect now  pay later model leaves us holding large sums   money we call  float    that will eventually go to others  Meanwhile  we get to invest this float for Berkshire s benefit       Indeed  Buffett has said that he would never allow his firm to be in a situation where he is at the mercy of banks  It doesn t mean he will never borrow money  But it means that when borrowing money  he always wants to be in a situation where he could pay it back if needed  Consumers have seen all too often that they only qualify for a loan when they don t really need it  Jamie Dimon  CEO of JPMorgan Chase has said responsible banks act like mothers  they will decline your loan request if it is too risky for you One cannot be a truly free person with debt  While bankruptcy may have been downgraded to a mere business transaction in the U S   some countries continue to put those that can t pay into prison  The neighborhood surrounding Dubai s airport has seen thousands of abandoned cars  often Ferraris or other expensive vehicles  as the formerly rich fled the country after their fortunes turned to avoid debtors  prison Anyone is likely to argue that a nice pile of cash in a bank account will make one feel financially secure   some place that pile at  100 000  Some at a million  as a million bucks isn t what it used to be  the wealthy often say they are not comfortable if they don t have  10 000 000 or more We have met people with very modest means that feel that they are wealthy  and others that have lots of money  but don t feel wealthy  Aside from the fact that some of them might simply have a distorted sense of reality  the wealthy often also carry a great deal of debt  Those able to manage their debt thrive in this low interest rate environment  But let even a wealthy person with debt hit a road bump  say lose a job  or face an obstacle in refinancing a loan  and such a person may quickly join the lower ranks of the 99   In our assessment  highly accommodative monetary policy is a greater driver of an increasing wealth gap than the policies of either Democrats of Republicans But even with  100 in a bank account  what does one really hold  One owns a promise by the bank to pay  100  The  100 bill is a Federal Reserve Note  it s a piece of paper issued by the Federal Reserve  That  100 bill could be returned to the Fed  in return the Fed would issue a credit balance to your account  you would have to go through a bank  as the Fed won t open accounts for individuals   The  resources  of the Fed are without limit  through its various quantitative easing programs  the Fed has increased the credit balances of the financial institutions where it has purchased securities  The Fed literally creates money out of thin air  with the stroke of a keyboard  Even prudent central banks like to see a little bit of inflation  it means that the dollar bills you hold erode in purchasing power  giving you an incentive to put the money to work to make up for the shortfall Importantly  the  100 bill in your bank account is really someone else s loan   the bank s loan  the Fed s loan  In fact  if you take out a loan from a bank  you will pay a merchant  who will in turn deposit the proceeds in his or her bank  As such  we talk about credit in a society  For simplicity s sake  let the banks hold 10  in reserves   100 in bank reserves with an offsetting  100 in demand deposit liabilities can thus be multiplied into  100 in bank reserves plus  900 in loan assets with an offsetting  1 000 demand deposit liabilities through the leverage of the fractional reserve banking system as banks lend and new deposits are made in a circular fashion  Between the Fed and the banks and the banks and their depositors  the system can have a multiplier effect of about 100  that is   100 created by the Fed can lead to  10 000 in credit  That s why we sometimes call the credit created by the Fed  the monetary base  super credit In the current environment  banks have not been aggressive in lending  and as such  we have not seen the  velocity  of money pick up  A key reason why many are concerned about the Fed s increase in monetary base is because it has the potential to fuel inflation  Indeed  a key reason I personally hold a lot of gold is not because of the environment we are in  but because I am concerned about how all the liquidity that has been created might be mopped up one day  Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke claims he can raise rates in 15 minutes  we think there may be too much leverage in the economy to have the flexibility when the time is needed  the political will to induce a severe recession to root out inflation may not be there It s all about debt  So if one doesn t want to have debt  what is one to do  The answer is real assets that are free of claims  Real estate held free and clear might be one answer  although keep in mind that governments tax real estate  thus making home owners tenants of the government  As the housing bust since 2008 has shown  the fact that many others owe a lot of money on their property changes the dynamics of this real asset The purest form of a debt free asset is gold  Gold is true money  the only form of money that isn t someone else s liability  While central banks might be able to lower the gold price by dumping their own reserves  central banks cannot print more gold   it s very difficult to ramp up gold production  If your bank goes broke  if Greece goes broke  gold will still be there  Some call gold a relic from the past  To us  it s the purest indicator of monetary policy  precisely because it has little industrial use  Mind you  we are not suggesting that everyone should sell all they own and buy gold instead  Everyone should consult with his or her financial adviser for specific investment advice  Specifically  one must be keenly aware of the volatility the price of gold can have relative to the U S  dollar  given that we have a lot of our expenses in U S  dollars  one has to be aware of the fluctuating value of the investment relative to the U S  dollar  But we want to get investors to be keenly aware that we live in a credit driven society  We also believe that the developed world has made too many promises  too much debt has been issued  Governments with too much debt may a  engage in austerity to pay off their debt  b  default outright  c  default though inflation  All scenarios suggest to us to hold assets that are debt free  We see gold playing a very important part in portfolios that take the risk into account that our policy makers continue to spend and  print  more money than is prudent  We don t need actual money to be printed   credit creation through quantitative easing   is far more powerful ,2012-08-23,Axel G.

156333,377849,BRKb,How Warren Buffett Is Different From Most Investors  Part 1 ,opinion,There was an academic article   Afterward  I thought I saw a few articles reflecting on it  but here is the only one I see now    Buffett is different  because he grew as an investor and as a businessman  and usually made the right moves over a 50  year career  When you don t have a lot of assets  and few people are doing value investing  you can do amazing things with special situations  and being an activist investor  In 1967  Buffett had control of a textile company named Berkshire Hathaway  BRK A   where he used the resources of the company to purchase some smallish P C insurance companies    This brings up the first way that Buffett is different than most investors  He understands and invests in a complex industry  P C insurance  He begins to realize that it can be used as a platform for greater investing  As he sees that potential  he buys half of GEICO in the 70s  before buying the whole company in 1994  This brings up the second way that Buffett is different than most investors  Buffett was willing to buy whole companies  not replace management for the most part  and operate them  Buffett limited himself to being the wholly owned company s board  asking questions on management competence  and redirecting free cash flow for the greater good of Berkshire Hathaway  That brings me to the third way in which Buffett is different than most investors  He analyzes cash flow streams from investments  and buys shares in companies  or the whole company when they offer a reliable high prospective free cash flow yield  And it brings me to the fourth way Warren Buffett is different than most investors  Buffett does not diversify  particularly in the early years  He plays for best advantage  Buffett views investing through the lens of compounding cash flows  and does not pay much attention to the market as a whole  In my opinion  it is a worthy use of time  but don t neglect your family  to read through the   If you do that  you will get a sense of a clever businessman who would invest for best advantage  His tactics shifted over time  but he was always looking to compound free cash flows at the best possible rate  I m going to hit the publish button now  but I will finish this in part 2 ,2012-08-26,David Merkel,https://www.investing.com/analysis/how-warren-buffett-is-different-from-most-investors-(part-1)-134191,134191
156334,377850,BRKb,Investing Longer,opinion,Accumulating large amounts of wealth via investing takes a combination of strong returns and investing over a long period of time  Practically all articles related to investing  including those on this site  are focused on getting those returns  this one post  however  is dedicated to prolonging the number of years in which you will be investing  The book value of Warren Buffett s Berkshire Hathaway has grown by an average of 19 8  per year for the last 45 years  turning every invested  1 into  3 393  Had that dollar been invested at that rate for only 35 years instead of 45 years  it would have grown to  only   557   a remarkable difference  So how does one increase the number of years in which one is able to invest  By living longer and healthier  It may seem as if you have no control over how long and healthy you live   but you do  A number of fatal diseases are becoming more prevalent in developed countries  even after accounting for the increased lifespans  Evidence increasingly points towards our diets as the causes of these diseases  But while you may think you know that the reason for this is that we re lazy and therefore simply eat too much  the evidence suggests you may be wrong  It appears increasingly likely that we don t get fat diabetes cancer Alzheimer s because we eat too much  but we eat too much and get fat diabetes cancer Alzheimer s because we eat things our bodies aren t used to  The implications of this are large  as they suggest that cutting our food consumption by reducing portion sizes will not work  This only induces us to expend fewer calories and or eat more calories later  For millions of years  our ancestors evolved while eating certain diets  Approximately ten thousand years ago  however  our ancestors started farming  Slowly  at first   this began to change the diets of our ancestors  Today  those dietary changes are accelerating  we eat dramatically different foods today than we did just a generation ago  Our bodies are likely not adapted to this new diet  If you re interested in learning more  here are a few books on this topic which I have read over the last few months  I ve ordered them from most technical  i e  for those who want to know the historical background  physiological theories and the results of studies  to the practical  i e  what to eat and not eat if you do subscribe to this line of thinking   1  Good Calories  Bad Calories by Gary Taubes 2  Why We Get Fat by Gary Taubes 3  Free The Animal by Richard Nikoley 4  The Primal Blueprint by Mark Sisson For a dissenting view  consider reading The China Study and one of its excellent excellent refutations Disclosure  I should note that I ve lost 25 lbs  and have more energy than ever since making just a few changes to my diet  It s not about portion sizes  as I have not gone hungry at all  I can eat as much as I want of a surprisingly large number of foods  i e  I m not just talking about fruits and vegetables  ,2012-08-31,Saj Karsan,https://www.investing.com/analysis/investing-longer-134767,134767
156335,377851,BRKb,3 Dividend Stocks Owned By The Smart Money,opinion,As I wrote back in August  it can be helpful at times to look over the shoulders of successful investors to see what their highest conviction investments are  And during times like these  when the economy is looking wobbly and the potential for a eurozone meltdown is hanging over our heads like the sword of Damocles  that extra insight is all the more valuable Today  I m going to take a look at one high conviction dividend stock each from three investors whose skills I respect and whose track records have withstood the passing of a crisis or two The usual caveats apply  I m basing this analysis on SEC filings that are reported on a time lag and may already be out of date by the time they become publicly available  For these reasons  I will stick with large positions that the investor has held for a long period of time or new positions that I consider unlikely to have been sold so quickly Let s start with the granddaddy of modern value investors  Berkshire Hathaway s  BRK A    Mr  Buffett made quite a splash last year when he bet big on technology powerhouse International Business Machines  NYSE  IBM   It was his first major purchase in the tech sphere  and it quickly became one of Berkshire s largest holdings  Buffett added to his position last quarter  and IBM now accounts for nearly 18  of Berkshire s portfolio  The appeal of IBM is straightforward  Buffett was attracted by the stability of the company s cash flows and its business model as a high end service provider whose customers are locked in to long term contracts  But its qualifications as a  dividend stock  might be a little more controversial  At current prices  IBM yields only 1 6   Still  this is roughly in line with the current yield on the 10 Year Treasury Note  and importantly IBM s dividend rises every year  IBM s dividend rose 13  this year and 15  the year before  Of course  this is nothing new  IBM is a proud member of the Dividend Achievers index  an exclusive fraternity of stocks that have boosted their dividends for a minimum of ten consecutive years  So while the current yield of 1 6  is a little uninspiring  it s safe to assume investors buying IBM today will be enjoying cash payouts far higher in a couple years  time than they would have had they opted to invest in bonds  Next on the list is the  Warren Buffett of Canada   Fairfax Financial Holdings  FRFHR  Chairman   Like Buffett  whom Watsa admires  Watsa built his financial empire around a solid insurance business  which provided him with a growing float to invest  And like Buffett  Watsa is known for being a patient investor who often holds his best positions for 5 10 years or even longer  Watsa s track record speaks for itself  According to research site   Watsa has grown Fairfax s book value by an astonishing 212  over the past ten years  This compares to total returns of just 34 9  for the S P 500  Impressively  he actually made money in 2008  Fairfax saw its book value rise 21  in the midst of the worst financial crisis in 100 years  Diversified health and pharmaceutical company Johnson   Johnson  NYSE  JNJ  is Watsa s largest holding by far  and accounts for more than 21  of his listed portfolio  Johnson   Johnson is an obvious choice for a conservative dividend stock  and it is a current holding on the Sizemore Investment Letter s Drip and Forget Portfolio  It also happens to be one of the highest yielding major American blue chips  with a 3 5  dividend at current prices  And like IBM  Johnson   Johnson has a long history of raising that dividend  J J is a member of the Dividend Achievers Index  Given the low repute of ratings agencies this matters less than it used to  but Johnson   Johnson is one of only four American companies to have its bonds rated AAA  Yes  Johnson   Johnson is actually considered to be less risky than the U S  government  and its stock pays more in yield  This is one you can buy and lock in a proverbial drawer  Our final guru today is hedge fund manager and fellow Dallas resident   principal of Hayman Advisors  Though he does trade equities  Bass is a macro investor better known for making large bets in the credit and currency markets  he made his investors a small fortune betting against subprime mortgage securities in the run up to the 2008 meltdown  Bass s equity portfolio is completely dominated by Six Flags Entertainment Corp  NYSE  SIX   the owner and operator of theme parks  Six Flags makes up nearly 40  of his equity holdings  With a current yield of 4 1   Six Flags certainly qualifies as a dividend stock  But readers should consider this stock a riskier bet than IBM or Johnson   Johnson  Theme parks are sensitive to the state of the economy  and the stock trades at a nosebleed valuation of 32 times expected 2013 earnings  There is a lot of optimism built into the price at current levels  All of this said  Bass has certainly done well by owning Six Flags it s up more than 100  over the past year and he clearly has a high level of conviction in the stock if he s make it nearly 40  of his equity portfolio  Disclosure  Sizemore Capital is long JNJ ,2012-10-02,Charles Sizemore,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-dividend-stocks-owned-by-the-smart-money-138338,138338
156339,377855,BRKb,Warren Buffett Just Poured Millions Into These 3 Off the Radar Stocks,opinion,If you re a fan of investment genius Warren Buffett or a shareholder of Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE  BRK B   then by now you ve certainly heard his investment management company started accumulating stakes in General Motors  NYSE  GM  and Viacom  Nasdaq  VIAB  last quarter    And it makes sense    One is an old school auto manufacturer getting back on its feet  while the other owns some of TV viewers  favorite cable channels  Both businesses are easy to understand and both are based on relatively reliable business models  These qualities are right up Buffett s alley  even though one or both of the two new illustrious members of his investment team    Todd Combs or Ted Weschler    likely made the picks    Yet  for investors looking to glean a stock pick  GM and Viacom may not be the best Berkshire coat tails to ride    they re just the highest profile names being added to the  75 billion equity portfolio  Your best Buffett based picks may actually be a trio of companies whose stakes he increased during the first quarter of the year    Here s a closer look at them      1  Bank of New York Mellon  NYSE  BK  Even after beefing up his position in the regional bank by a whopping 213  during the first quarter  Bank of New York Mellon is still only a  118 million position  or 0 2  of Berkshire Hathaway s portfolio  It s also a bit of an oddity for Buffett  who tends to bet big when he bothers betting at all  And make no mistake    if Buffett wanted more of the  24 5 billion bank  then he could certainly afford it    What gives  Had he not added so much to the Bank of New York Mellon position  it would have been dismissed as another one of about 30 trades that barely even register as one of his holdings  Despite so many other matters on his plate at the time    namely a now failed co bid to buy Avon  NYSE  AVP   prostate cancer and getting two new managers up to speed    Buffett made a point of adding to this stake more than any other  in percentage terms    Though it s still not clear why there s a sudden bigger interest in the regional bank  the fact that he s pouring so much more money into it now than he has before speaks volumes about his confidence in this stock    2  DaVita  NYSE  DVA  The  273 million Buffett used to add more shares of this kidney dialysis service provider to the Berkshire portfolio was actually his third biggest purchase last quarter  second only to the money he added to a couple of his favorite standbys    Wal Mart  NYSE  WMT  and Wells Fargo  NYSE  WFC   The 13  increase in DaVita still only brings the total stake up to   493 million  or 0 7  of the total portfolio  But considering DaVita is only a fraction of the size of Wal Mart or Wells Fargo  this is a pretty significant addition    More than that  the addition beefs up Berkshire s exposure to the health care sector with a company that s far from being mainstream  even by health care standards  It s important to note that health care has never quite been Buffett s proverbial cup of tea in the first place    Then again  Buffett may be onto something with DaVita  Although the reimbursement rules regarding medical procedures have been changing for a few years now  DaVita has been able to maintain a long string of annual earnings and profit growth  The forward price to earnings  P E  ratio of 12  for instance  is attractive as is  but considering the company posts an occasional earnings beat  it still may not do the stock justice    3  DirectTV  NYSE  DTV  Finally  though the  124 million purchase of 2 65 million DirectTV shares only meant a 13  increase in the total stake  Berkshire s DirecTV holding has grown to a sizable  1 08 billion    a position that started as a small one  but has grown reliably since the third quarter of last year  In fact  this is exactly what s so noteworthy out about the position  Of the 30 or so fairly meaningless trades Buffett made through Berkshire Hathaway  this is the only one that has slowly but steadily been becoming a significant one    Buffett could buy the  30 billion cable provider outright if he really wanted  And if he really wanted to  then he would have done so by now  The alternative may be better for shareholders in the long run though  in that the accumulation  drip  keeps a firm floor in place for the stock price from one quarter to the next    Buffett s attraction to DirecTV isn t hard to understand either  The company is a   with reliable top  and bottom line growth  The projected P E of nearly 9 likely appeals to Buffett s value senses too    Risks to Consider  Just because they were in Buffett s favor last quarter doesn t mean they ll stay in his favor  Berkshire cut its Intel  Nasdaq  INTC  and Verisk  Nasdaq  VRSK  positions by about a third last quarter  for example  to investors  surprise  The profit taking decision may have been prompted by solid run ups from both stocks  Buffett is clearly not in a mood to continue buying them now  even though he was still buying them just one quarter earlier    point being  things can change quickly  While General Motors and Viacom are high profile names that grabbed all the headlines  it s not like Buffett is able to single handedly bid them up  The smaller and off the radar stocks like the ones I named above

156346,377862,BRKb,Weighing The Week Ahead  Bring On The  Economic  Evidence ,opinion,In the short term world of trading  your job is to anticipate the short term behavior of others    In the world of investing  your job is to take advantage of the short term behavior of others    Markets render a short term verdict  but only professors believe them to be efficient  Warren Buffett famously notes  see  for more wisdom      I d be a bum on the street with a tin cup if the markets were always efficient   Fortune April 3  1995    Investors should remember that excitement and expenses are their enemies  And if they insist on trying to time their participation in equities  they should try to be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful    Berkshire Hathaway 2004 Chairman s Letter   This is great advice  but difficult for most to follow  How can we tell when the market is inefficient and fearful  We need evidence   Should we bail out of the market   Should we buy puts  even at high prices  to protect our risk   Let us turn to another expert   Perry Mason  actual historical ad    and many others    available   Let us take the advice of these two great iconic figures  seeking edge through evidence    Since the recent European elections  there has been a dramatic change in risk appetite  Ed Yardeni sees this as  for risk on risk off     The big switch was flipped to the off position following the May 6 French and Greek elections  which could upend all the bailout deal and fiscal pacts worked out by European leaders over the past two years  Such an outcome could push Europe deeper into a recession and weaken global economic activity  In other words  Risk On tends to be associated with widespread confidence in the outlook for global economic growth  while Risk Off indicates widespread fears that the global economy will sputter     Investors need evidence   Is the pessimistic outlook warranted   This week will provide more data    As usual  I will offer some ideas in the conclusion  but first let us do our regular review of last week s news and data    Background on  Weighing the Week Ahead    There are many good sources for a list of upcoming events  In contrast  I single out what will be most important in the coming week  My theme is an expert guess about what we will be watching on TV and reading in the mainstream media  It is a focus on what I think is important for my trading and client portfolios    This is unlike my other articles at  A Dash  where I develop a focused  logical argument with supporting data on a single theme  Here I am simply sharing my conclusions  Sometimes these are topics that I have already written about  and others are on my agenda  I am putting the news in context    Readers often disagree with my conclusions  Do not be bashful  Join in and comment about what we should expect in the days ahead  This weekly piece emphasizes my opinions about what is really important and how to put the news in context  I have had great success with my approach  but feel free to disagree  That is what makes a market    Last Week s Data   Each week I break down events into good and bad  Often there is  ugly  and on rare occasion something really good  My working definition of  good  has two components  The news is market friendly  Our personal policy preferences are not relevant for this test  And especially    no politics It is better than expectationsThe Good   The US economic data last week was mixed  but had some high spots  Housing and Car Sales Lead  The Bonddad Blog takes a page from UCLA Prof Ed Leamer to reach the following conclusion and chart Put simply  as an economic expansion ages  housing is the first sector to weaken  followed by cars  If they are strengthening rather than weakening  a recession is not near  And to be blunt  both sectors are indeed strengthening Let s look at this three ways  First here are the raw numbers of housing permits  left scale  and vehicle sales  right scale   measured quarterly to limit some of the noise  Both peaked well before any recession started  even in the case of the brief expansion in the middle of the 1980 81  double dip   Signs of GOP compromise    are signing the Grover Norquist  pledge    I cite this not from a partisan perspective  but as one who seeks solutions and compromise   Concessions by either party are good    More to come on the  fiscal cliff  issue  Michigan Consumer Sentiment hit a four year high   While this was helped by lower gas prices  it also reflected perceptions of better job prospects   Check out the     still not at peaks  but also not confirming the recession scare Zillow data suggests that home prices are moving higher    New home sales strengthen  Calculated Risk has been authoritative on this subject for years  so I am watching the analysis and forecast  a long and gradual recovery  with great interest  Here is Bill s   Clearly new home sales have bottomed  Although sales are still historically very weak  sales are up 25  from the low  and up about 15  from the May 2010 through September 2011 average     The Bad   There was plenty of bad news on the economic data front  Here are the most important items Downticks in  flash  PMI reports  These are getting a big play for those with a short time horizon  The question is whether the captured data is really accurate  The initial forecast for the US PMI was   predicting a dip  There were also negative reports on various European countries  This is an interesting new data source for the US  worth watching with interest Durable goods sales were weaker  Steven Hansen has   looking more deeply into the headline data Facebook should be   Or   Who could have known The informal European Summit disappointed  While the Eurobond concept was floated and stronger deposit insurance mentioned  there was no solid outcome  The market wants immediate answers  and the European leaders have a different time frame Spanish bank problems threaten escalation and contagion  Spain has  with bad housing loans at the fourth largest bank  While this is a pro active move  investors immediately raised questions about the status of other banks  How much more help will be needed   The Ugly   The  fiscal cliff  grabs the ugly award for this week  The authoritative  on what would happen in the absence of any policy changes  Assorted tax cuts and stimulus programs will expire  This is headline grabbing stuff  especially for those who have not been paying any attention    Hardly anyone expects even a fraction of this to take place  but it makes for good headlines  The marginal effect is clearly negative as the average investor acts in a way that he she believes to be smart and well informed    It is wall to wall crisis coverage  I plan to write more extensively on this topic    The Indicator Snapshot   It is important to keep the current news in perspective  My weekly snapshot includes the most important summary indicators The The key measures from our  Felix  ETF model An updated analysis of recession probability The SLFSI reports with a one week lag  This means that the reported values do not include last week s market action  The SLFSI has moved a lot lower  and is now out of the trigger range of my pre determined risk alarm  This is an excellent tool for managing risk objectively  and it has suggested the need for more caution  Before implementing this indicator our team did extensive research  discovering a  warning range  that deserves respect  We of 1 1 or higher as a place to consider reducing positions    The C Score is a weekly interpretation of the best recession indicator I found   I ll explain more about the C Score soon  We are working on a modification that will make this method even more sensitive  None of the methods are worrisome  Bob also has a group of coincident indicators  Like most of the top recession forecasters  he uses these to confirm the long term prediction  These indicators are also not close to a recession signal    This week s big news on the recession forecasting front this week came from  writing at The Bonddad Blog  He notes that the ECRI has retreated from a robust method with many leading indicators  seasonally adjusted  to a single reed  NDD   showing why the year over year real income indicator is misleading    Meanwhile  there are many others who have developed recession forecasting methods that have matched or beaten the ECRI  while providing transparency for consumers  These are the methods that I have been highlighting for many months  Our  Felix  model is the basis for our  official  vote in the weekly   We have a long public record for these positions  This week we continued as  bearish  although we do not  yet  have any short positions  Felix respects the market action  and the last three weeks have been convincing     For more on the penalty box see   For more on the system ratings  you can write to etf at newarc dot com for our free report package or to be added to the  free  weekly ETF email list  You can also write personally to me with questions or comments  and I ll do my best to answer     The Week Ahead   Sometimes the quirks of the calendar mean that we get a lot of important data in a short time frame  That is the story this week    Friday is the big day since it includes the employment situation report along with the ISM manufacturing data  a good input for estimating the jobs report    We will also get personal income and construction spending    Thursday is the big tee up for Friday  The Chicago PMI is the best guess about the ISM index  The ADP report is the best guess for the non farm payroll number  We also get the  backward looking  adjusted Q112 GDP data and initial jobless claims  not part of the Friday reporting periods  but more recent and relevant     Tuesday and Wednesday will provide housing price data from Case Shiller  a bit old  and Conference Board consumer confidence    While there are no big decisions scheduled from Europe  we know that there can be headlines    plus or minus    With all of this in mind  the US employment story is the feature for the week    Trading Time Frame   We have been partially invested in trading accounts  in a bearish position with 1 3 of our position profitably in bond ETFs  It reflected our  bearish  posture  and I would not be surprised to see  a  buy  recommendation for an inverse ETF next week  Felix does not try to call market tops and bottoms  but respects trends in the three week range    Investor Time Frame   For investment accounts I have been buying on dips in stocks that we like  I tried to explain the most important concept for individual investors in   I have had many emails from people who had a personal breakthrough in their investing when they understood this concept  If you missed it  I urge you to take a look  You can contrast this with the many  pundits who  The single most difficult thing for me to explain is that investors should often embrace opportunity just as traders are trying to do some fancy footwork  Investors should not be trying to guess the next market move  Instead  take what the market is giving you  You should not be a  buy and hold  investor  but instead engage in  active management  Think about risk control rather than market timing    If you are really worried  you can imitate our enhanced yield program  Buy good dividend stocks and sell short term calls  I am targeting 8 9  returns on this approach  and achieving it no matter what the market is doing  You can  too    Final Thoughts on the Economic Evidence   Factual evidence consists of actual economic data and    more importantly    reported corporate earnings  So far  the factual data has been strong    Speculation from many sources includes a European collapse and a US recession  leading to lower earnings    Does the current market reflect the speculation or the facts   Here are some interesting perspectives  Brian Gilmartin  a favorite of Real Money fans  has a new blog   features corporate specific earnings news as well as a macro take  Brian is off to a great start  and we will all enjoy reading his work  On the current earnings front he notes         N o matter how earnings act  the market p e continues to compress over the last 12 years  In fact  despite 20    30  growth off the 2009 bottom  the S P 500 hasn t traded much over 15 x  earnings since then  Even during the 2003   2007 rally  the S P 500 multiple stayed roughly even with earnings growth at about 15 x  earnings    agrees  suggesting that the market is pricing in plenty of bad news  As a reminder  the chart above shows the trailing PE ratio of the S P 500  At 13 4 today  it is approximately equal to what it was at the end of 2008  when the market fully expected a multi year global recession depression and years of deflation  Eddy Elfenbein writes that the   and the dip is  The pessimists are expecting a decline in economic growth  earnings  and profit margins This week should provide more solid evidence about whether the negative expectations have any justification No

156347,377863,BRKb,Buffett On Quarterly Fears,opinion,Warren Buffett has stressed many times that investor focus on quarterly earnings beats misses is bad for both investors and companies  Rather than focus on the long term  managers with such shareholders are implicitly encouraged to take all sorts of actions  e g  cutting R D expenditures  that increase short term earnings at the expense of the company s future  At   Buffett pointed to  that provides statistical evidence that suggests that the focus of management on short term earnings is rather pervasive  The paper is titled Quadrophobia due to management s apparent fear avoidance of the number  4  as the third decimal in its earnings per share  EPS  reports  If the third decimal number is a four  the EPS number gets rounded down  The paper s authors scoured the universe of US public financial statements  however  and found that the number four  when dividing income by weighted average shares outstanding  is absent as the third decimal number by a statistically significant amount  Why might this be the case  When management is close to rounding up its EPS number to the nearest penny  and having a four as the third decimal is as close as you can get   it will make the accounting adjustments it needs to in order to get there  Of course  not all companies engage in this sort of practice  just as not all consumers indulge in short term    But the authors found that the incidences of quadrophobia increase for companies that gain analyst coverage and where earnings come in close to analysts forecasts  Startlingly  the authors also found that persistent quadrophobes actually turn out to be more likely to be sued by the SEC   What can the investor do with this knowledge  For one thing  it should reinforce the notion that one should not buy sell a company if it beats misses short term earnings by a few pennies here and there  One might be tempted to check the third decimal of the companies in one s portfolio  but unfortunately even if the number four is absent from these calculations  the results for any one company would not be significant enough to draw any conclusions  As a whole    and so investors would be wise to  ,2012-06-16,Saj Karsan,https://www.investing.com/analysis/buffett-on-quarterly-fears-126665,126665
156348,377864,BRKb,On Life Insurance And Life Reinsurance,opinion,Is there a reason why life reinsurance companies are better positioned then life insurers  Don t they face the same problems that they won t be able to generate as they roll their portfolios into lower yielding bonds going forward  since rates have come down so much   Basically just wondering why you think RGA is cheap at 84  of AOCI adjusted book but not the rest of the life insurance industry at 35  75  of tangible book  Is it mostly due to your opinion of management  I started to leave a reply and the normally reliable software glitched  and I lost it  Dejected  I decided to make it a post  First  life reinsurance is much less competitive than life insurance  Globally and in the US  the top 5 life reinsurers have  80  of the market share  Life insurance is far more fragmented  and has a decent slug of mutual insurers who don t have an explicit profit motive   Note  many of the large mutuals are exceedingly well run  which makes the competition even stiffer  Second  life reinsurance is mostly mortality exposure based  versus life insurers which are mostly investment spread based  The law of large numbers favors the life reinsurers over the insurers  Low interest rates will not affect reinsurers as much as insurers  Hint to those who analyze life insurers and reinsurers  look in the statutory statements  which have a lot more data than the GAAP statements for odd reserves that indicate a significant chance of losses if interest rates continue to remain low  Third  life insurers have weaknesses in reserving practices for variable products with secondary guarantees  There is no good way to calculate what a proper reserve should be  The implied options are odd  and have no natural hedges  That s why I only own one life insurance company  one that has simple products  Aside from low interest rates  valuations are low at life insurers because of lack of certainty over reserves So  much as I like RGA management  they are not the main reason why I like the company  RGA executes well  and  Here s another question that I received via e mail  Prices of financial services stocks are too cheap for me to resist these days  I see companies like Citigroup as being just given away by Mr  Market     Within insurance  my equity exposure is limited to AIG  which I consider to be well managed  misunderstood  and priced attractively enough to continue holding  Over the past month other insurers have started to grab my attention  HIG  MFC  MET  PRU   HIG stands out as being the least sensitive to the possibility of a decade of financial repression  Do you have any favorites that you would care to share  This topic could make for a timely blog posting  I responded  Value trap  Focus on sustainable ROEs that will validate book value  The accounting of AIG is a quagmire  even after their disposals  There is a further difficulty with life insurers at present  The GAAP accounting standards do not fairly reserve for secondary guarantees on insurance and annuity policies  truth  as a life actuary and a financial analyst  the options offered are so complex and long dated  that I m not sure there is a way to value them  Over the last 10 20 years  we knew that this could be an issue  but we are now seeing the issue creep in as stock performance ebbs  But if you disagree  consider PNX  it has all of the issues  and then some  Be sure to get the Statutory books of the companies you buy here  because that drives dividend payments to the indebted holding company  And one more e mail  Hi David  I have enjoyed reading your blog for many years  even before GGG recommended it  I have two questions for you about insurance companies in general   I know you are very busy  I am just hoping you can point me to some websites where I can do my own homework   1  If I want to check the financials of a number of mutual insurance companies  is there a consolidated source  Do I need to pull the annual statements of each one and are the different state accounting rules comparable   2  As I understand it  and I am quite new to this so I may have this wrong    mutual insurance companies use  statutory accounting   which is different from US GAAP  Is there a website or library book that explains the differences between these two methods  Does statutory accounting differ from state to state  Again  I am sure you are very busy and I will have to do my own research   homework  You seem to be more knowledgeable than most about insurance accounting  and I am hoping you can point me to some documentation that will help me gain a better understanding  My response  1a  Consolidated source     but most companies will send it to you if you ask  Haven t been turned down yet  aside from Berkshire Hathaway  and I m working on that  1b  Generally  you have to pull each one  Some companies will do a combined set of schedules for their investments  When I got AIG 3 years ago  there were 60  books  1c  There are slight differences by state  but most of the time you can neglect that  2a  Mutual companies use statutory accounting  but so do stock companies for the state s analysis of insurance subsidiary solvency  And  though stock companies use GAAP for reporting to shareholders  many mutual companies will have an internal pseudo GAAP basis for analyzing long term profitability  and for management bonuses  yeh  Statutory accounting is in some ways more critical than GAAP even for stock companies  because that determines how much cash can be distributed to the holding company  which is crucial if the holding company needs to make interest payments  or wants to make dividend payments  This is one reason why actuaries often price products by calculating marginal distributable earnings  2b  I have   This is a big topic  and the NAIC sells all manner of resources at high prices with all of the gory details  This should give you a good start  I general  the volunteers from the actuarial societies put out some good summary stuff  but you have to hunt for it  Keep fighting the good fight  Bloggers are the conscience of Wall Street and DC  Life insurance is tough because there is uncertainty on claim payment on timing  and uncertainty of investment earnings  The latter is usually more serious  because the law of large numbers does not help  Add in the valuation issues  and now you know why a life actuary primarily invests in P C insurance companies  life reinsurers  and simple life companies Full disclosure  Long RGA ,2012-07-31,David

156369,377885,BRKb,Here s Why This Cheap Growth Stock Can Easily Double ,opinion,One of my all time favorite investing articles talks about how important growth is when buying a stock  The author goes back in time and demonstrates that  by buying into leading growth companies  investors could garner incredible annual returns  A key takeaway is that even when you buy in when these stocks trade at sky high price to earnings  P E  ratios  they still make a killing    if you ve picked the right stock  Billionaire investor Warren Buffett has famously pointed out that growth and value are joined at the hip when it comes to investing  And rightly so  growth can actually create its own value  And while investors shouldn t shy away from paying up for a company that should experience steady growth for many years  finding a growth stock that trades at a reasonable P E can further put the odds in an investor s favor  I ve found a stock that has strung together an impressive growth history  Handbag maker Vera Bradley  NYSE  VRA   The company was founded in 1982  which makes it a relative newcomer in fashion  Vera is even newer to investors  it became a publicly traded company in October 2010    Vera Bradley primarily sells its namesake purses through its own stores and a vast network of other retailers  The mix of indirect and direct sales is about equal  with half of sales stemming from Vera s own website and its 52 retail stores  while the other half comes from selling handbags and related accessories to 3 000 outside retailers that include malls  retail stores and e commerce websites    Growing popularity   To give you perspective on just how popular these handbags really are  I ll tell you a little personal anecdote that really shocked me  I just recently got back from Berkshire Hathaway s  NYSE  BRK B  annual shareholder meeting in Omaha  The annual event  dubbed  the Woodstock of Capitalism   attracted some 35 000 shareholders and fans  aside from hearing he Oracle of Omaha speak  shareholders can purchase some of the many items under the Berkshire umbrella    oftentimes at discounted prices   In contrast  Vera Bradley s annual outlet sale recently attracted about 62 000 loyal customers who visited its Fort Wayne  Indiana  headquarters to snatch up bags that were marked down up to 90     Popularity can be fleeting in the retail industry  but Vera only looks to be experiencing increasing popularity  Sales have grown 64  in the past five years to a recent  461 million  Current expectations call for 18  growth this year to  544 million and another 15  in 2013  Earnings per share  EPS  are expected to grow 19  from  1 43 per share last year to  1 70 this year  then another 19  to  2 02 in fiscal 2013    Vera Bradley has big expansion plans  It wants to open as many as 20 stores annually  grow sales at existing stores and continually roll out its merchandise to outside retailers  Because Vera is a growth stock  investors are too laser focused on its quarterly trends  These momentum based investors aren t very loyal and quickly jump ship if they think growth isn t accelerating  This happened last quarter when Vera reported sales growth of  only  26  for the full year  They may also have been spooked when reported profits grew only 14   which was due to a new corporate tax payment structure    Risks to Consider  Vera Bradley operates in the fickle fashion industry in which customers have been known to flock to a trendier alternative  But the company is still arguably in the very early stages of its growth curve  And judging by the recent pilgrimage to its outlet sale  its popularity is extremely robust    Vera Bradley s current forward P E multiple is about 12  I find this extremely reasonable  given its potential for a lot more growth  As my experience has taught me  companies that grow briskly are worth paying up for  In the case of Starbucks  Nasdaq  SBUX   for instance  investors could have paid a P E as high as 300 and still made money during its growth heyday in the 1990s and through today  They could have paid a P E up to 500 for women s retailer Chico s  NYSE  CHS  during this same period and still made money    BY Ryan Fuhrmann,2012-05-11,StreetAuthority,https://www.investing.com/analysis/here's-why-this-cheap-growth-stock-can-easily-double-122873,122873

156402,377918,BRKb,Forget Apple  Focus On What s Next Instead,opinion,I m sure you ve heard the sad news by now  The genius factory at Apple  Nasdaq    is finally out of ideas    New CEO Tim Cook  who took the reins of the  576 billion company from legendary founder Steve Jobs after Jobs  October 2011 death  made a rambling announcement about the new  2 65 dividend on March 19  Cook  reversing Jobs  long standing reluctance to return cash to shareholders  said he wanted to broaden the appeal of Apple shares to a wider investor audience    This is  of course  pure and utter nonsense Dividend investors are hardly going to be clamoring for the decidedly wimpy yield Apple s shares will be paying  about 1 8  assuming the price holds near  600 a share  If the stock continues to rise  then this yield falls even more Consider this  397 out of the 500 companies in the S P 500 pay a dividend  Apple s will rank a lackluster 257th on that list Now given  this dividend can  and probably will  rise going forward  but it s going to be a while before this becomes a stock for dividend lovers If Cook really wanted to increase Apple s appeal  then he d split the stock 20 for 1 and bring the price down to  30 a share  That changes absolutely nothing about the company s fundamentals  of course  but it makes the shares  seem  more affordable  Sticker shock sets in at  100 a share  At  600 a share  most investors simply don t have any frame of reference That the share price is so high is a big reason why Wall Street can t understand how to value the company  More notably  however  the dividend move was seen as a concession to growing pressure that Apple  do something  about its massive cash hoard  which totals nearly  100 billion This is materially significant  Apple is not a company that has ever bowed to pressure  More than that  the notoriously secretive company has never even remotely cared what Wall Street  the blogosphere or anyone else does or says  From that position  Apple led the news and set the trends  never following either  Apple was allowed to be different because its CEO was regarded almost universally as a visionary genius  He got to play by special rules we allow to the amazingly talented But Cook is not that guy  He is merely very good  The dividend announcement signals that the Jobs era is indeed over  and the company now is applying for membership in the League of Above Average Companies It is not a serious misstep by Cook  That s too harsh  It is simply the new reality So the worthwhile question at this point is why Cook did what he did  Let s think about that    Clearly Wall Street  Proud motto   Never satisfied   always wants to see a number of things  When the talk turns to balance sheets  the name of the game is always return on equity  ROE    This is the measure that that fellow in Omaha uses to gauge his progress    ROE  is determined by dividing the bottom line on the income statement    that is  net earnings    with the  net asset  or  book  value on the balance sheet  For Apple s most recent annual period  that ROE figure looks like this  Net earnings  Year ended Sept  24  2011    25 9 billion Shareholder equity   76 6 billion   25 9   76 6   33 8  That looks like a pretty good return  right  After all  the total return of the S P 500 has beat that only twice since 1965 But look more closely  and this emerges as a remarkably stellar return  I screened for S P 500 companies with no long term debt  there are only 29  and then ranked them by their most recent quarterly return on equity  Apple came in first  at 45 6   The next closest was Paychex  NYSE     with a 35 8  ROE  Apple beat that by 10 percentage points  So Apple simply cannot  under any stretch of mortal imagination  be even remotely concerned with its ROE  Well  how about growth  Apple has certainly delivered here  Consider the past four years  worth of revenue data  shown in the table to the right From 2008 to 2009  Apple grew revenue 32   then 52  the next year and 66  the year after  That s an average revenue growth rate of 50   What is the logical extension of that Frankly  I don t know  But it follows that if Apple can sustain that sort of growth for 12 years  its revenue would exceed the entire U S  gross domestic product  Clearly  that s not possible  Apple is initiating a dividend because it knows it can no longer generate that sort of growth  or  if you prefer  it knows that it cannot reasonably sustain it long term The company is simply out of ideas to deliver material growth  and it evidently doesn t see other companies out there it could buy to deliver additional return Even with all the money in the world  Apple can t figure out  What s Next  That s why it was sad when Tim Cook said the company had more cash than it needed to run the business  All businesses need cash to finance growth  and Apple  in the absence of Steve Jobs  doesn t have any ideas for how to do that  It doesn t have another iPod  iPhone or iPad up its sleeve  It has incremental advances for its existing suite of gizmos  Alas  Action to Take     Some might be chagrined or outright saddened by this  I confess that I am a little  My wife and I have seven Apple devices in our house  But    and I really want you to hear this    the reality is that there is another Apple out there There is another Facebook in another dorm room    another Google  Nasdaq    Even another Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE   In my newsletter  Game Changing Stocks  I tell readers that we too often fixate on the hot companies grabbing headlines today  and not on the companies that will make news a few years from now That s how you build real wealth So while we mark the end of an era at Apple  we also are mindful that the future is still very bright  Our best days

156403,377919,BRKb,Predicting The Oracle Of Omaha,opinion,It is a great pleasure to quantitatively assess the future of Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE  BRK B   The Oracle of Omaha is considered as one of the greatest investors  Here we would like to introduce a deterministic model for a BRK B share price  Berkshire Hathaway  Inc  is a publicly owned investment manager  The BRK B structure is highly diversified with interests from GEICO  car insurance  to Dairy Queen The model is deterministic since it has been obtained by decomposition of a share price into a weighted sum of two consumer price indices  One may follow up our simple assumption that the growth in the CPIs related to BRK B  e g  transportation service  TS  and dairy products  DAIRY  might be seen in the change of the pricing power for the studied company  These two CPIs are revealed as the drivers of the BRK B price  However  they were actually selected using the LSQ method from a set of 92 different  not seasonally adjusted  CPIs  The best model predicting the monthly closing prices adjusted for dividends and splits has the smallest RMS error from July 2003 to March 2012 We have borrowed the time series of monthly closing prices of BRK B from Yahoo com  the closing price for March 2012 is included  and the CPI estimates through February 2012 are published by the BLS  The best fit model for BRKB t  is as follows BRKB t     0 802DAIRY t 11    2 24TS t 7    21 13 t 2000    584 66  March2012where BRKB t  is the BRK B share price in U S  dollars  t is calendar time  Figure 1 displays the evolution of the defining CPIs since 2002  Instructively  both indices are relevant to the BRK B structure and have negative slopes  The DAIRY index likely has a larger impact on the growth of the price becasue of higher amplitude oscillations  The TS index is rather a linear line since 2002 with only a small positive fluctuation  negative impact on the price  in the end of 2008 Figure 2 depicts the high and low monthly prices for an BRK B share together with the predicted and measured monthly closing prices  The predicted prices are well within the limits of the share price uncertainty  The model residual error is shown in Figure 3 with the standard deviation between July 2003 and March 2012 of  4 73 The accelerated growth in the DAIRY index since April 2011 induced a mid term decline in the share price  This rise in dairy price did not come to end yet and we cannot exclude that the actual BRK B price will return to the predicted level of  73 per share by the third quarter of 2012  The TS price index does not show any sign of deceleration and food price together with dairy products will likely be rising till 2014  If the model is right  we may observe in 2013 some further decline in BRK B price Figure 1  The evolution of defining indices Figure 2  Observed and predicted monthly closing prices for a BRK B share  Figure 3  The model residual error  sterr  4 73 ,2012-04-12,Ivan Kitov,https://www.investing.com/analysis/predicting-the-oracle-of-omaha-119916,119916
156404,377920,BRKb,My Odds on Favorite To Run Berkshire Hathaway After Warren Buffett Retires,opinion,Warren Buffett is back in the news  and not on the opinion pages about the so called  Buffett Rule  that would subject high income earners to additional taxation  Buffett is on Page One because he has prostate cancer  It s Stage One  easily treatable and not life threatening  The revered Oracle of Omaha says he not only feels great but will keep working his normal schedule  though his travel will be restricted later this summer as he undergoes radiation So  predictably  it s game on for Buffett watchers  who are all over the airwaves speculating as to the palace intrigue and about how Ajit Jain clearly will be the next CEO  But Jain is too valuable as Lord Chancellor of Berkshire Hathaway s  NYSE  BRK A   BRK B  reinsurance business  He s no crown prince  A coronation would be a lovely accolade  surely  but Jain is far too effective  and far too happy  to be moved from his current role  Keeping talent in place is a longstanding Berkshire tradition     What s more  Berkshire s CEO candidate doesn t know that he or she has been chosen by the board as the leading contender  and there is nothing that happens at Berkshire that Jain isn t told about  Buffett talks to him every day  That also excludes Buffett s new stock pickers  Ted Weschler and Todd Combs  who took over running a portion of Berkshire s portfolio after longtime investment manager Lou Simpson retired from Geico in late 2010  Every candidate being bandied about on financial TV is an operations guy  That s wrong  The chairman of Berkshire needs to be all about deal making  After all  each Berkshire unit  from See s Candy to MidAmerican Energy  runs itself Buffett has long stated that excellent management is a prime requirement for Berkshire acquisitions  as it is the only thing that Berkshire cannot supply  Once companies are acquired  they are independent business units  Buffett has joked for years that he delegates to the point of abdication  He s not standing by the supply cabinet monitoring who takes Post It notes   I hear he has a well paid secretary for that sort of thing  And what kind of deals does Buffett pine for  He likes buying large  family owned enterprises with long histories of predictable profitability achieved with very little additional capital infusion  Typical of the breed  Buffett bought Marmon Industries  a collection of 125 manufacturing and service companies  for  4 5 billion from Chicago s Pritzker family  in 2007  Those kinds of deals need a gentle touch  a special perspective that s cultivated  honed    not in the trenches  not in the conference room    but through personal interaction  at Sun Valley and Aspen  The critical sit in those deals takes place in homes  not board rooms  To put it in pop culture terms  you don t need Bob Sugar  You need Jerry Maguire Geico boss Tony Nicely doesn t have what it takes  either  He knows insurance  Burlington Northern CEO Matthew Rose knows trains and Lubizol head James Hambrick knows about industrial manufacturing  but neither have the temperament  Greg Abel comes close  but he  like Jain  is too valuable in his current role as the head of MidAmerican  And he makes more money there  too  which is not an incidental consideration The right man for the job is Bryon Trott You might not have heard of him  but he s my odds on favorite to run Berkshire after Buffett retires  which he has scheduled for  five years after  his  death  I give Trott a three in four chance  Trott  53  is a Goldman Sachs  NYSE  GS  alumnus    former vice chairman  to be exact  Buffett s  5 billion investment in Goldman was at Trott s suggestion  He s worth a fortune  of course  and now runs a boutique investment shop in Chicago  catering to    wait for it    extremely wealthy families    That s three votes in his favor  Buffett worships Goldman Sachs  they ve done a deal together and Buffett loves family owned businesses  He greatly respects the people who  like him  can put those deals together  That is the legacy he wants to leave at Berkshire  The rest of the company runs itself    Another thing to like about Trott    besides the fact that he is a well connected  well respected outsider  is that he s a major holder of Berkshire shares  392 Class A shares as of his latest filing with the SEC  The shares were worth  45 million  about a third of his BDT Capital Partners   115 1 million publicly disclosed portfolio   His other major Trott holding to take note of  Molex  a  4 8 billion electric components company  with  3 5 billion in annual sales and a balance sheet strong enough to make Buffett grin  A Molex not a barn burner  though it is a key supplier to Apple Inc   Nasdaq  AAPL    It s hardly sexy  It just does its thing  does it well  and makes money  Classic Buffettology  The whole enterprise screams  Buy me  to Berkshire  But that s not what to watch      The conventional wisdom is that Buffett will be OK  I mean  anyone who can beat the S P for four decades ought to be able to handle cancer  But Buffett is not really the one to watch  either  The guy to keep an eye on is Byron Trott    Berkshire Hathaway is a screaming  buy  now  at just 1 1 times book value  but it likely will be an even better buy after Buffett leaves because of the likely selloff that will take place when that happens  That could be in 10 years  though    when Trott is still just 63    and I hope it is  by Andy

156405,377921,BRKb,Misunderstanding The Tax Debate  II ,opinion,I m going to do something different to start this post    Thanks for disagreeing  because it makes this post better    Response 1    It s all well meaning but it s likely to fail in practice  with unintended consequences and nasty corner cases where you have to reintroduce complexity    For example imagine a taxpayer with one  liquid but volatile asset  which is essentially long term flat  It goes up  X in one year   X the next  etc  So the taxpayer has essentially zero income  amortised  but must pay on the  X on the positive years  The no deferral rule prevents creating an offsetting tax credit on  X years  so he s either paying tax on non existing income  no good   100  tax rate   or requires a refund on the down years  which creates a new class of enforcement problems that didn t exist before  people creating fake losses to get actual cash  when they could only get tax credits before     Another example is a taxpayer with a single illiquid asset  say a small business owner who owns nothing else  and the business is with tight cash flow  or a disabled elderly person who owns their house outright but nothing else and who lives on welfare  If the business house valuation goes up  these guys have a tax bill  So now they must raise money out of an illiquid asset just to pay tax  and as it s illiquid and they don t have cash flow they might have to either pay distressed credit rates on their tax borrowing  or just sell the business house which is a bit of a harsh punishment for a tax cashflow issue    Income is intrinsically a tricky problem  You can clean up the crud from time to time  indeed you must as some nonsensical rules will inevitably accumulate  but a simple tax idyll is unfortunately not realistic I believe    Response 2    I respectfully don t think so  The example of the taxpayer with the volatile asset could also be compared with a person who pays income taxes on a salary  If they lose their job next year  volatility  they would have paid too much this year by your model  The issue is that it seems less fair to tax work  salaries  at a higher rate than wealth  dividend income   Perhaps it could be separated from capital gains   which isn t real income until it is sold at a profit  It could also be argued that salaried people contribute more to the economy than dividend income does  I m not a job creator if I go sell a  100K of stock on the NY Stock Exchange   what have I added to the economy    Response 3    This does not strike me as a good idea  It isn t practical to tax appreciation of illiquid untraded assets  and the overhead and intrusion involved in doing something like this fairly would be tremendous    I don t see why we should be so reliant on taxing income anyway  Pigovian taxes would be better for the economy  and consumption taxes would be easier to levy  Even a Henry George style single tax would seem preferable to trying to impute income to people as a result of asset fluctuations    I like my readers   Why do I like my readers  One  they are bright people  even if I might disagree with them  Second  they are relatively polite   I was walking through Times Square with another prominent blogger  and he said to me   When I see the comments at your blog  David  you have nice commenters  whereas those at my blog are not    I said to him that there were three factors in play  He has more readers than I do His format did not allow for filtering   I filter  but rarely   Also  it s harder to comment on my site  and that s a feature  not a bug  because I want people who are determined to comment  not something that is off the top of the head I pointed out to him that his rhetoric had bomb thrower tendencies  and what kind of crowd would that attract So  I like my readers  and commenters  In general  if you comment here  and I don t delete it  I respect you   Deletion rate is less than 0 1    But now to my main point   Much as I like Buffett  I disagree with him on tax policy  because he is a hypocrite Let him argue that stock holdings should be taxed annually on the unrealized increase  and I would agree with him   He doesn t pay as much taxes as he should because  Berkshire Hathaway doesn t pay a dividend He never sells shares of his company He engages inside his company to avoid taxes in every legal way  He is not interested in paying taxes in the slightest My tax proposals would make Buffett and those like him pay  and others who game the system as well  The critiques above miss the point in a major sense  Much avoidance of taxation comes from having companies that are heavily indebted  I don t believe that having heavily indebted companies is a good thing  If they faced taxation on the presumed increase in their value annually they would be forced to have more liquidity  and that is a good thing    My proposal would lead to companies not being so heavily indebted  That s a feature  not a bug  We need to discourage debt in the financial sector  because it tends to create booms and busts  If you want to do a big capital investment  save for it  or borrow on a very short term basis    My proposal on taxation should be phased in gradually  Mr Buffett should not be presented with a bill for  12 billion  but rather a request for  1 2 billion for 10 years  reflecting the value he has obtained untaxed  With respect to taxation  he is the ultimate hypocrite  If he did not speak on such matters  I would respect him  because he is generally such a wise man  but he has prostituted his position to the current political scene  Thus I don t respect him here     As an aside  we could drop the estate tax after instituting this  because appreciation would be taxed annually  As such  the cost basis at death would be very near market  One thing that was little noted in the one year elimination of estate taxes in 2010 was that if you inherited something in that year  your tax basis did not step up to market  but remained at the cost basis of the decedent   The taxes may be delayed  but they weren t eliminated  That s still quite an advantage     I believe that a less levered system is better for the economy as a whole   It is far better to disallow interest as a deduction for corporations  and allow corporations to dividend to shareholders without taxation  Or  eliminate corporate taxation  and tax dividend receivers directly  combined with a tax that taxed profitable companies that did not pay dividends    The economy is better off when it is less levered  Debt obligations make the economy less flexible  demanding fixed payments  regardless of how likely they are  For modeling  it is best to think of the unlevered economy  What is the native demand  leaving aside the  speculative demand   Borrowing to create speculative demand should not be encouraged by the tax code   After a phase in  interest should not be tax deductible  but would add to the cost basis of assets    My views are relatively simple  Taxes should be moderate  and levied on the approximate increase in value annually Corporations and individuals should avoid borrowing to finance investment consumption  at least  it should not be tax favored to borrow in the short run Everyone should be taxed  there is no way to avoid it   This ensures fairness All classes of income should be taxed at the same flat rate There are no non income deductions credits  and no use of the tax code for social engineering This should be phased in over ten years to avoid a shock For illiquid situations  businessmen would have to plan in advance for taxation  which would impose a cost on illiquidity in the economy We would not favor savings over consumption   goodbye to the complexities of IRAs  life insurance  pensions  and all other deferral vehicles The overarching idea is to create a flat taxation system  where the increase in value is taxed annually  and where there is little incentive to engage in any sort of action to convert one sort of income into another  This would level out many of the advantages that the wealthy have  while leaving in place a relatively transparent taxation system with few preferences which would be stable  and create predictability in taxation    Those are my views  I am trying to create something more stable  fair  and transparent  can t hide income  Those are desirable goals   Why shouldn t everyone love this  aside from the rich that use the overly generous tax code   Feel free to comment below    PS   this would have implications for US entities owning foreign assets  but I haven t figured out how to make this work globally without making people firms flee the US   Ideas are welcome  Thanks to all readers commenters  I appreciate all of you ,2012-04-19,David Merkel,https://www.investing.com/analysis/misunderstanding-the-tax-debate-(ii)-120691,120691
156406,377922,BRKb,How To Invest Like The Warren Buffett Of Canada,opinion,Ask investment buffs why they spend so much more time researching and picking securities than most people  and they ll probably tell you they want the best performance possible from their portfolios  They certainly don t want to track the S P 500  and they may not even be satisfied to beat it by a percentage point or two over time  They want to CRUSH it It s a tall order  to be sure  Maybe two or three out of every 10 investors are fortunate enough to beat the market in any given year  let alone consistently over long periods of time This is why so many investors closely watch and try to emulate stock picking greats like Warren Buffett  Carl Icahn and others  Like most of us  these giants of investing may or may not beat the market in any given year  or even for several years  But over longer stretches    watch out This certainly describes Prem Watsa  Chairman and CEO of Toronto based Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd   Toronto  FFH     Watsa  age 61 and originally from India  began to earn a reputation as the  Warren Buffett of Canada  back in the late 1980s and early 1990s  not long after he took the reins at Fairfax  Indeed  he sold ahead of the crash of 1987 and foresaw the collapse of Japan s stock market in 1990  He also predicted the mortgage crisis of 2008 and prepared for it by selling or hedging equities and buying credit default swaps  which enable the holder to be compensated for loan defaults  Then  in late 2008 when virtually no one wanted anything to do with the stock market  he began investing heavily in equities again    As a result  his  19 8 billion portfolio has posted returns that have soundly beaten the S P 500 in the long term  as the table below illustrates   Clearly  Watsa is cut from the same mold as Buffett and other value oriented investors who love to  be fearful when others are greedy  and be greedy when others are fearful   His company  Fairfax  is also quite similar to Buffett s  Although it s in the insurance business    reinsurance and property casualty  to be precise    investment returns are the key driver of the stock price  The insurance business exists to generate cash for Watsa to invest  sort of the way Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE  BRK B  provides a platform for Buffett s investing activities    One of Watsa s biggest moves recently  On Jan  27  he announced that he d doubled his stake in struggling Blackberry maker Research in Motion Ltd   Nasdaq  RIMM  to 26 848 500 shares  currently worth about  349 million   Through Fairfax  he now owns just over 5  of the company  Watsa is also on the company s board of directors  Research in Motion is down about 7  since Watsa doubled his position in the stock  but it s still far too soon to say whether or not the move will pan out    His top five holdings as of the end of 2011 are listed in the table below  The recent additions of Research in Motion have since put that stock pretty much on  with Johnson   Johnson  NYSE    in terms of portfolio weighting  Although Fairfax is most famous for the investing acumen of its CEO  the insurance business is what keeps the doors open  And the thing is    that business isn t as strong as it could be Of Fairfax s  7 5 billion in total revenue last year   5 4 billion  or 72   came from insurance premiums  investing activity accounted for the rest   Sounds good  right  Well  not so much when you consider the company s combined ratio    a measure of profitability used by the insurance industry    has averaged just over 100  for the past 10 years  This means Fairfax s insurance business is actually a bit in the red  since the combined ratio has to be under 100  for an insurer to be considered profitable  In 2011  for example  when Fairfax s combined ratio was 105   losses from insurance operations totaled  230 million To be fair  the entire property and casualty insurance industry has had it rough for about a decade now  suffering through a soft market characterized by overcapacity and declining premiums  Hurricane Katrina and a number of other multi billion dollar disasters  not to mention the financial crisis  have also cut deeply into profits  Still  the performance of Fairfax s insurance business would still have to be described as below average  since many competitors  combined ratios have been more in the 95 98  range Risks to Consider  Though it generates the necessary cash for Watsa to invest  Fairfax s insurance business could be better and is likely a drag on stock returns  This situation could worsen if the company is hit with more insurance claims than expected Even with its below average insurance business  Fairfax Financial Holdings is a worthy stock to hold for those looking to invest with the  Warren Buffett of Canada   The stock s long term performance speaks for itself  and it reflects Watsa s ability to generate great returns by investing the premiums Fairfax receives from its insurance customers even though the insurance business is currently losing money by paying out more in claims  salaries and operational expenses than it collects in premiums  Plus  Fairfax has been seeking to improve its insurance business by acquiring more profitable operators  such as Zenith National Insurance Corp   a workers  compensation provider with a combined ratio averaging 95  during the past 30 years   Zenith was acquired in May 2010 for  1 3 billion  by Tim

156407,377923,BRKb,What Buffett Says About Diversification Will Shock You,opinion,Working for StreetAuthority  I do a lot of different things In the course of a day  I may be writing an article    editing a newsletter    discussing potential picks with our staff    researching the next investing hotspot    even going over article ideas with Bob Bogda  our managing editor And with so much going on  I actually find myself a little frazzled as the day goes on To combat this  I ve started getting to work about an hour earlier than the rest of the staff  I don t do this to show off  but found I can do more in that one hour  when I can simply focus on one task without distraction  than I could in two hours when the rest of the staff has the office buzzing Turning off the background noise allowed me to simplify things    and get better results What does this have to do with investing  A ton Why diversification is like drinking from a fire hose Sometimes the investing waters are as clear as mud to retail investors  After all  there are literally thousands of potential plays out there You could try to play the exploding technology sector  You could day trade the banks  You could stick with index funds and ride out any storm  You could even try to find companies that are simply undervalued and will rebound once the market notices    But the problem is that there are too many options    it s like trying to drink from a fire hose  Too many choices make it hard to nail down the one investment that will make your portfolio a winner    Instead  like I do every morning by getting an early start  I think successful investors need to turn off the distractions and focus their attention to a small group of the best ideas    drink from a glass  instead of a fire hose    By shrinking your portfolio  you ll find    It s easier to stay on top of your investments    If you have a portfolio of 50 stocks  how well can you pay attention to each one    Even if you read up on each one just an hour each week  you d have a full time job  plus 10 hours of overtime  just to give each its due    And with this market  it s more important than ever to watch your holdings  Instead  a portfolio of just 10 12 of your best picks would need significantly less time to track each week and you ll likely sleep better at night knowing you ve done your homework    Better portfolio performance    Which do you think would average higher on a test  an entire class full of students  or a handful of the smartest students as picked by the teacher    The answer is obvious    and it s the same with your portfolio    Look through your holdings  If you have upwards of 30  40  even 50 holdings or more  I bet you ll find some that you think are simply  OK   Hell  it wouldn t surprise me if you have some you don t even like but simply haven t sold yet    Instead  what if you culled down your portfolio to just your favorite picks  Wouldn t your portfolio be in much better shape going forward  You d have the cream of the crop  instead of the entire field  Remember  it s hard to outperform the market if your portfolio is the market    That you re not alone in trimming down your portfolio    Warren Buffett s Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE  BRK B  holds just 37 positions  That s a lot for an individual investor  but for a company with billions at its disposal  it s surprisingly few  On top of that  in the past 25 years Berkshire s top five holdings have made up an average of 73  of its portfolio    Buffett is simply a proponent for positioning a portfolio to take advantage of the best picks  He s even gone as far as saying     If it s your game  diversification doesn t make sense  It s crazy to put money into your 20th choice rather than your 1st choice  It s the  LeBron James  analogy  If you have LeBron James on your team  don t take him out of the game just to make room for someone else     If one of the world s greatest investor is following this approach  shouldn t other investors  That s what I m doing with  100 000  Buffett s school of thought is one of the main tenets of my  newsletter  and its  100 000 real money portfolio  Think about it    our economy and the markets still continue to run hot and cold  Investors are still skittish about unemployment  interest rates  housing    the list goes on    But no matter what s happening  there are always some stocks doing well  And if you focus on a select group of your best picks  then you can profit  One of my best performers in my newsletter  Olin Corp   NYSE  OLN  gained 58  in about a year before I closed the position  Sally Beauty Supply  NYSE  SBH  had the same return  Hasbro  NYSE  HAS  gained 45 9   And these returns were during what can at best be described as a  rocky  environment     I understand that years of conditioning has led millions of investors to think diversification is crucial to success  And it is  if you want to simply match the market  But that s not what I    nor Buffett    want to do  I doubt you do either  by Amy Calistri,2012-04-29,StreetAuthority,https://www.investing.com/analysis/what-buffett-says-about-diversification-will-shock-you-121591,121591
156408,377924,BRKb,U S  Market Cools  Thoughts on Berkshire Hathaway And Investing,opinion,In April of 2012  U S  financial markets cooled off as the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by  01   the S P 500 retreated  51   and the Nasdaq went down 1 5    It is only natural that the equity markets have cooled off from the hot start during the first quarter   Naturally  many investors are concerned about what the next problem will be   Is it the continuing sovereign debt crisis in Europe  a slowing down of the Chinese real estate and economy  or high oil prices   Maybe a large increase in the rate of inflation  or a general demise in the growth rate of the U S  economy is the next shoe to drop   Why stop at potential economic concerns which will bring the stock market down   Instead  we could look at every possible world problem in an effort to find reasons why stock markets should not rise Let s see  we could mention the high concentration of wealth in a few holders  hands  the lack of affordable health care for many people and rising health insurance rates every year  or I am sure you can think of something else which comes to mind   Stock markets have underperformed bond markets over the last fifteen years  but with the surge of profitability in the corporate world stocks should continue to do well   It is hard to focus on what matters when the world is full of troubling issues   However  as an investor  there will always be situations which could negatively impact business   In many instances  there is a short term effect because of a one time event  like last year we had the earthquake in Japan or Arab spring   If one extends the time frame past 6 months or a year  profitability becomes the main determinant as to how stocks will perform   There is still quite a bit of fear in U S  financial markets  and one only needs to look at the very low bond yields on U S  Treasuries to see it  I expect the spring and summer will sport lower trading volumes and slower business conditions  which is typically the case in the financial year   The slowdown does not mean stocks won t go up  or down   just that activity will probably start to become a little lighter now  especially when earnings season winds up   One should always expect the unexpected  but we might see a very uneventful upcoming few months in financial markets                                                                                   The World Shall Be Your Oyster    If you are looking all over the world for investment opportunities  2012 has been a year when there have been many areas which have performed well  so far anyway   The BRIC countries have been very solid  posting year to date results of  Brazil   8 7    Russia   15 4    India   10 9    and China   11 9    Other countries in Asia have even better results  as seen by Hong Kong   12 5    the Phillippines   18 2    Thailand   18 2    and Japan   12 6     Some countries in Eastern Europe also have posted strong returns for investors   For example  Austria is ahead by 11 9   Germany is up by 15 3   Denmark has gained 16 7   and Turkey and the UK  FTSE 25  have returned 18 2  and 13 6   respectively The areas of the world which are lagging behind include Spain   16 6    Italy   2 1    Portugal   5 9    and Canada  2 4     It will be interesting to see if the outperformance in Asia and the BRIC countries continues or if the mature European countries can start to improve their results                                                                                       When we welcome in the month of May  two annual events which occur each year come to mind  The Kentucky Derby and Berkshire Hathaway s Annual Meeting   If ever there was a great contrast to be made  those two festivals embody the vast world of difference in the participants   In the Kentucky Derby  people wager on horses in an effort to make a return on their capital   With the Berkshire Annual Meeting  shareholders have placed their money in a company which owns something like 70 businesses with over  50 billion dollars of sales   Those businesses have been put together by the greatest investor who ever lived  Warren Buffett   Over the last few years  Berkshire Hathaway  BRK A  shareholders have suffered through a once in a lifetime situation  the stock has not gone up   All is not lost however  it can yet go up   If one loses in the Kentucky Derby wager  your money is gone  sionara  finito  ari viderci   A major difference  don t you think                                                                                              Many people equate investing in the stock market to gambling   With the implementation of decimal trading  the invention of double and triple leveraged exchange traded funds  algorithm based trading  and high frequency traders  there are many elements in the current market environment which do resemble a casino   However  one must understand what a buyer gets when they own the equity of a company   When you own the stock of a company  you own a claim on the company s assets after all liabilities are paid  and whatever income those assets generate   So  let s say you own the stock of a company which has a net cash position of 100 million dollars  cash long term debt    If there are 10 million shares outstanding  this equates to  10 per share of cash on the balance sheet   If the company has net income in a year of  10 million dollars  the company is generating  1 dollar per share in earnings per share    Diluted earnings per share just includes what all the shares would include if one converted stock options  preferred stock  or convertible stock into common stock   So  if the stock were selling for  5 dollars per share in the stock market  you would be paying  50 cents on the dollar for the cash on the balance sheet  and getting a company with a P E ratio of 5   The P E ratio is simply the price divided by the earnings per share    There are different kinds of P E ratios  trailing and forward   Trailing uses the past year of earnings where forward uses the projected earnings in the upcoming year   So  a good question would be  in the above example  do we buy  sell  or hold     Seems pretty simple  but a wise investor would say   Tell me about the business   What industry is it in   What is the competitive position of the company   What were the last 5 years of earnings like   How quickly are revenues growing   Are operating profits growing at the same rate of revenues   What is the cash flow historically been   Is the business capital intensive    How does the company plan on utilizing its cash   Is it interested in growth  or paying dividends   Is the company planning for international expansion   What countries are they currently in   What does the pipeline for growth look like     There are plenty of other questions which should be asked as well   The key is gathering tons of information on the company and distilling it all into a decision about whether you think you are getting a lot for your money    Well  that is how I look at it   I know this  by buying a stock  you certainly are not betting on the pass line  or hitting on a 16 when the dealer has 21     One of the hardest parts of investing is coming to grips with the reality that every stock you look at has issues   I looked at quite a few this weekend  and all had some situation which would give a buyer pause   Education stocks are in the doghouse because of problems with student loan funding and the federal government   Natural gas stocks are beaten down because of record low natural gas prices   Pharmaceutical stocks are cheap because of drug patents are causing the most profitable drugs to become generics   Bank stocks are impeded by the housing overhang and flat yield curve   Big tech is too big and too dependant on the PC industry   Apple  AAPL  is missing Steve Jobs   You get my point  but in my mind  the key is to try and be open minded about the strengths of a company  as well as the issues it faces   After you look at a lot of companies  you begin to understand that you want to understand what exactly are you getting when you buy the stock of company XYZ   By the way  the answer is yes  it is a screaming buy   Disclaimer  It is the responsibility of each investor to research possible investments mentioned so they can decide on the appropriateness and suitability of the investments consistent with their risk tolerance  risk constraints  and return objectives ,2012-05-02,Yale

156432,377948,BRKb,Coal May Soon Overtake Oil as Fuel of Choice  Here s How to Profit,opinion,Wouldn t it be nice if we didn t need to rely upon those dreadful fossil fuels like coal  oil  and natural gas  If only we could be warmed in winter by the gentle rays of the sun and cooled in summer by harnessing that sun to power our air conditioners  If only we could employ the gentle breezes that waft across the land in endless abundance Alas  such is not to be the case  According to the International Energy Agency  IEA   in the decade just passed  coal accounted for nearly half of the increase in energy use worldwide  In fact  while we may be basking in the glow of an unseasonably warm winter in parts of North America  in the rest of the world another historical anomaly is taking place  coal usage is growing so quickly that it may soon overtake oil as the fuel of choice If only we could be citizens of the nation which has the largest coal reserves in the world  we might be able to improve our balance of trade  significantly increase exports  and create hundreds of thousands of jobs supplying this commodity to Asia and the rest of the world Oh  That s right  We are China  India and the rest of Asia have been the engine that both demands and uses the most coal  In fact  two thirds of the growth in global energy demand of all types has come from Asia for more than two decades China actually leads the world in coal production Since the Chinese are also the world s largest consumers of coal  however  they are also the world s largest importer of this energy source  How convenient  the reserves held by the United States dwarf all other nations  It has been truly said that the United States is the Saudi Arabia of coal  Even though China and India  as well as an elaboration of nations  are committed to expand alternative energy sources  to use nuclear power as much as possible  and to continue to build massive dams  China is by far the largest producer of hydroelectric power in the world  they still derive 80  of their electricity from coal fired power plants  Of course  it isn t nearly as bad in India  there only 70  of the electricity is derived from coal fired power plants  Both nations face a similar dilemma  for transportation  for heating and cooling  for manufacturing  and indeed for pulling themselves up by their bootstraps to become fully developed nations  they must and will increase their energy usage  It isn t as if they have given any other indication  China is the number one producer of coal  India is number three  with the world s fifth largest coal reserves  by the way   In the wake of the Fukushima nuclear power plant disaster in Japan in 2011  even nations that have recently reduced their dependence upon coal by using nuclear power are newly in the market for coal resources  Difficult as it is to imagine  if Germany actually follows through with its plan to dump its clean burning and recent generation nuclear plants  it will have no alternative on a large enough scale other than Russian natural gas or German and other nations  coal  Japan itself  a nation which has always had to import nearly 100  of its energy  is likely to increase its coal consumption from just under 30  of its total to closer to 50  In all cases  new technologies in horizontal drilling and fracturing deposits in order to be able to release more natural gas will provide some replacement for off lined nuclear plants  To avoid even greater dependence upon Russia  Germany  Poland  France and other European nations are looking to unlock the shale gas early indications show are present on the continent   I m writing a follow on to this article about the best ways to play incredibly cheap natural gas  as well  As one tidbit  we need to realize that it adds energy  water and expense to liquefy gas to ship it over the ocean  If it isn t on the same continent  it is likely that a nation will pay dearly for it  currently about  15 per mcf   way more than coal  The good news  for China anyway  is that the world s two biggest exporters  not the biggest reserves  but the biggest exporters  are in their backyard  Australia and Indonesia  And even better  right in their front yard  Mongolia is developing what is now the world s biggest untapped coal deposit The bad news is that their own reserves  or at least the quality thereof  may be depleting more rapidly than they d like   or like anyone to know  But the indications are there as lower and lower quality coal is mined Also  like natural gas  coal requires huge volumes of water to produce  On a per capita basis  China is already stretched in this area  Without the massive runoff from the Tibetan plateau  Chinese citizens would already be seeing their water rationed Those nations with abundant water and abundant coal are likely to benefit most as the world s population growth stretches fresh water resources to the limit So what multinational firms might benefit from the world s growing  not declining  need for coal  For openers  look no further than the USA s home shores  Peabody Energy  BTU  is the world s biggest private sector coal company and a global leader in clean coal solutions  Peabody reaches across six continents to create strategic advantage  The company has some 9 billion tons of proven and probable coal reserves and owns  through its subsidiaries  majority interests in 30 coal operations located throughout all major U S  coal producing regions and in Australia It also has a growing presence in Mongolia  For the best information on coal and other opportunities in Mongolia  I highly recommend the articles of my fellow contributor Jon Springer  Peabody is also the major factor in the Powder River Basin  even bigger than Cloud Peak Energy  CLD   which I have written about in previous articles  With solid coal seams up to 100 feet thick     a low sulfur contentand convenient train loading capabilities  Peabody Energy s operations in Wyoming s Powder River Basin provide more than 140 million tons of coal each year for customers in the United States and around the world The North Antelope Rochelle Mine alone has shipped more than a billion tons since mining began in the early 1980s   and it enjoys the distinction of supplying the lowest sulfur coal  the  cleanest  at the point of extraction  on the entire continent  That mine alone accounts for more than the total output ofmost companies and many coal producing nations Thank you  Mother Nature  The combination of the world s biggest coal producer  BTU  with the railroad that ships more of the stuff out of the Powder River Basin than any other railroad company  Berkshire Hathaway s BNSF  BRK A   would make for an interesting corporate combination  I have no information that such an event would ever occur  mind you   I m just sayin  While BTU supplies both metallurgical   coking   coal for making steel as well as thermal coal to provide power  its primary product is thermal coal Canada s Teck Resources  TCK   on the other hand  is the second biggest metallurgical coal company in the world  and is huge in copper and zinc mining  as well   And also happens to have significant oil sands acreage   Teck s metallurgical coal business is well positioned to serve the China market with the high quality product needed for today s large blast furnaces  With China s steel production growth having slowed  pricing has weakened  but that won t last  China now consumes 40  of global copper supply  The Teck copper business produced  1 67 billion in EBITDA in 2011  Copper is considered a leading economic indicator and a symbol of industrialization  Teck plans to double the size of its copper business over the next five years through the expansion of existing and building of new mines And just this week  TCK and the National Agricultural Technology Extension Service Center of the Ministry of Agriculture of China  NATESC  announced an agreement to demonstrate and promote zinc fertilizer use in China  Zinc deficiency is a worldwide problem that has serious impacts on agricultural production and human health  Over 450 000 children around the world die every year as a result of zinc deficiency  In China  60  of arable land is classified as zinc deficient  with critical conditions in many dry areas  Zinc deficient soil can result in stunted crop growth and the inefficient uptake of essential nutrients Worried about the environmental impact of coal  So should we all  But even that area is being attacked with gusto The US government disperses billions of taxpayer dollars dispensed by bureaucrats with little in depth knowledge of the solar  wind  biomass and  thus far the biggest boondoggle of all  corn based temperate climate ethanol  industries they so lavishly reward with our money  On the other hand  the research and development being conducted by coal companies to clean coal at the source  liquefy it  gasify it  or clean it of emissions at the smokestack goes largely unheralded and in fact denigrated by the bureaucrats whose jobs depend on disbursing  dispersing   taxpayer dollars Worldwide  there are now plans to build over 1000 new coal fired plants  Rather than complain about dirty coal  perhaps we should take some of those Solyndra campaign contribution for handout dollars and put them to good use   Or leave those dollars in taxpayers  pockets rather than moaning that consumers aren t spending   One way to avoid importing oil and clean up the environment is to use Coal to Liquids  CTL  technology  where pollutants are removed at the source  The worldwide leader in this technology is Sasol  SSL   the world s largest producer of synthetic fuels  both CTL and GTL  Gas to Liquids   Like all coal companies  South African multinational SSL is depressed right now  selling on the NYSE at just 9 times earnings with a 5  yield   Since 3 of the world s top 4 energy consumers also hold the most reserves  The U S   China  and India  I see SSL s technology as having quite a sustainable market There are two other approaches you might want to consider  as well  The first are the coal royalty firms that buy or lease coal bearing lands then lease or sub lease them to the big operators  My favorites here are Natural Resource Partners  NRP  and Penn Virginia Resources  PVR   Both are rock steady earners and both yield more than 8  year in and year out Finally  for those who prefer the diversification of ETFs  you might take a look at Market Vectors Coal  KOL  or PowerShares Global Coal  PKOL  Markets go up and markets go down  But basic materials are needed every day Their pricing fluctuates with supply and demand but the need doesn t go away  Does Japan need to rebuild after Fukushima  That will take thermal coal  steel and copper Does India need to create an infrastructure to store food and move it to market  That will take fuel  cement  coal  steel  copper and more  Now take that need and expand it to every emerging nation  Disclosure  We  and or those clients for whom it is appropriate  are long TCK  BTU  NRP and PVR  And we are buying more if as they decline in

156433,377949,BRKb,How Warren Buffett Turned A  13 Million Investment Into  2 1 Billion,opinion,Warren Buffett is the world s most successful investor  He s worth  44 billion and is the third richest person on earth  The investments made by his firm  Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE  BRK B   gained 513 055  from 1964 to the end of 2011  The S P 500  including dividends  gained 6 397  over the same time period    Now  you may have seen these stats before  But let me ask you a question    If you could jump in a time machine and meet Buffett in 1964  back when he was still rustling up money from a handful of private investors  would you take your checkbook with you  Before you answer  ask yourself if you would have had the guts to make this type of investment  In 1963  a small time businessman named Tino De Angelis owned a company  Allied Crude Vegetable Oil  De Angelis would borrow money from a bank via a line of credit  buy shiploads of vegetable oil  store the oil in tanks on shore  sell the oil and then pay back the line of credit  The oil in the tanks was inspected regularly and was pledged as collateral for the line of credit  Eventually  De Angelis figured out a way to outsmart the bankers who came by to check on the collateral  Instead of filling his ships with vegetable oil  he filled them with water and then pumped in a thin layer of oil on top  When the bankers sampled the load  they never reached below the oil floating on the top of the water  They thought the whole tank was filled with oil  as promised  De Angelis used this  phantom oil  as collateral for more and more loans  borrowing more than  150 million  over  1 billion in today s dollars  against tanks of water  By the time the bankers finally caught on  the  150 million was gone  The loss hit the banks hard  One bank in particular  American Express  NYSE  AXP   lost half its value due to the     But a cagey investor from Omaha took notice of a great company selling at the fire sale price of  35 per share    and he loaded up on  13 million worth of AXP  Consider  If you had followed Buffett s lead in 1964 when he made his first investment in American Express  you would have made a tidy 162 543  return today based on share price alone  That s the power of holding  forever  Without even accounting for 48 years of dividends  just one  35 share of American Express purchased alongside Buffett in 1964 would now be worth around  5 724  thanks to six different stock splits  Today  the book value of Buffett s original  13 million investment is about  2 1 billion  His total investment in the company is worth over  7 2 billion  he s made subsequent stock purchases   Unlike those potential investors who had to make real time decisions about investing with a young kid from Omaha  we have the benefit of hindsight    and we can see the impressive 48 year track record Buffett s built  So  what if we knew what Buffet was  loading up  on today  Well  luckily we do  Each quarter  Berkshire Hathaway has to disclose its holdings in a form called a   The 13F is filed with the  and posted publically on the SEC website  Berkshire released its latest 13F filing on February 14  2012  The highly anticipated release offers the timeliest way to see which stocks Warren Buffett bought  sold or held during the previous reporting period  I took a look at the most recent filing and put together this list of 10 stocks Berkshire was buying in the fourth quarter 2011 Once we know what companies he was buying  we can figure out the average price he paid  For example  Buffett bought 2 865 008 shares of Visa during the fourth quarter 2011  Its average price during that time was about  93 81  Today  Visa  NYSE  V  trades north of  117 per share  giving Buffett a 25 0  gain in just 10 short weeks  Buffett obviously got a great deal on Visa stock  But there are plenty of other stocks in his 13F that haven t quite taken off yet  In those rare cases  we still have the chance to pay the same price as the world s greatest investor  Buffett s American Express homerun shows the power of investing alongside the world s greatest investors  And when you follow his lead and buy what we call  forever  stocks  the gains can be enormous  As a matter of fact  I recently did an analysis of another stock Buffett recently bought that could turn into another  forever  homerun  And best of all  it s still trading near levels where he bought it in the third and frourth quarters last year ,2012-03-22,StreetAuthority,https://www.investing.com/analysis/how-warren-buffett-turned-a-$13-million-investment-into-$2.1-billion-117856,117856
156434,377950,BRKb,Warren Buffett And Investing In Gold,opinion,In Warren Buffett s letter to Berkshire Hathaway  BRK A  shareholders released in late February  2012  Mr  Buffett expressed his skepticism with respect to the investment merits of gold  He stated that gold is a favorite of investors who fear almost all other assets  especially paper money  What motivates most gold purchasers is their belief that the ranks of the fearful will grow  As  bandwagon  investors join any party  they create their own truth    for a while    What the wise man does in the beginning  the fool does in the end  At current prices  today s annual production of gold would be valued at  160 billion  Buyers   whether jewelry and industrial users  frightened individuals  or speculators   must continually absorb this additional supply to merely maintain an equilibrium at present prices   The total current value of the world s gold stock of  9 6 trillion  will compound over the  next  century at a rate inferior to that achieved by  productive assets such as farmland and large U S  corporations such as Exxon Mobil  XOM    I was quoted in an article on this topic  March 20  2012  as follows  The  Greater Fool Theory  is an investing idea that means people will buy something not because it s worth a given price but because they feel that they will be able to sell it later at a higher price People who buy gold and silver expecting to sell it at a higher price  Kass said  are perfect examples of the theory Investing in gold and silver is purely speculative  he said From my perspective  I think it s risky   Kass said  There s no guarantee that it s going to go up  and if it does you don t know what your rate of return will be  ,2012-03-25,David Kass,https://www.investing.com/analysis/warren-buffett-and-investing-in-gold-118055,118055
156435,377951,BRKb,Warren Buffett Just Spent  200 Million On This Stock,opinion,Warren Buffett is no fan of short term trends  Rather than focusing on the flavor of the minute  Buffett instead fixates on trends that will last decades    And then he makes a fortune off of them    Take his investment in Coca Cola  NYSE  KO   for example  Buffett began buying the soda maker in 1988  eventually acquiring about 7  of the company  thinking it had room to grow in the developing world    He was right  What was a roughly  1 billion investment for about 200 million shares is now worth nearly  14 billion    But it doesn t stop there  The same can be said for his stakes in Wells Fargo  NYSE  WFC   American Express  NYSE  AXP   IBM  NYSE  IBM   the list goes on      Buffett s stock purchases are some of the best examples of what we call     It s a term coined by Paul Tracy  StreetAuthority s co founder and chief investment strategist of our Top 10 Stocks newsletter  Forever Stocks are stable  growing companies you buy and hold almost quite literally  forever   And like Buffett s Coca Cola stake  you can make incredible gains over time  while resting easy knowing that you own shares of a solid company    Back in February  I briefly mentioned that the billionaire investor s firm  Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE  BRK A   NYSE  BRK B   had acquired more than  200 million worth of stock in another company  one of the leading kidney dialysis center operators in the United States    So did Buffett just buy another Forever Stock    I think so  Here s why    The stock Buffett bought is DaVita  NYSE  DVA   And as I said  the company provides dialysis treatment to patients with kidney failure  also known as end stage renal disease    The loss of kidney function is usually irreversible and requires dialysis to remove toxins  fluids and salts from the blood    functions that the kidney would usually perform  Kidney failure is caused by ailments such as diabetes  high blood pressure and other less common kidney diseases  Diabetes continues to grow into an epidemic in the United States  due an aging population and unhealthy eating habits   Older Americans are much more susceptible to higher blood pressure and other kidney ailments as they continue to age  and I don t have to tell you the staggering statistics behind the obesity problem plaguing this country     This is obviously not something that s appealing for the health of individuals  but it is driving DaVita s growing business  During the past three years  DaVita has grown annual sales by more than 7   up to a recent  7 billion  and profits have grown a very respectable 12  each year  up to  2 3 billion  Going forward  this trend is highly likely to continue    the first wave of Baby Boomers just reached 65 years old last year    DaVita ran 1 820 dialysis centers in the United States at the end of 2011  This was up 33  from just over 1 300 centers in 2007  Underlying demand is growing and steady  as there are few options other than dialysis for many of these ailments  Kidney transplants are an option  but it can take many months and even years for a donor match to become available  to say nothing of the cost    As you might imagine  the business is stable and very profitable  Last year  DaVita generated just close to  800 million in free cash flow  or about  8 08 per diluted share  As a reminder  free cash flow is capital left over after a company has paid for its regular business operations and invested in growth  That  8 per share cash flow figure I just mentioned is pretty impressive  as it s nearly 10  of DaVita s share price  the stock currently trades for about  86 a share   This left room for the company to buy back more than  300 million of its own stock and acquire additional dialysis centers    Combined with the fact it is growing  it is easy to see why Buffett would want to own this stock    Since the time Berkshire made the purchase  the stock has rallied only about 2   It has  however  rallied close to 16  so far this year  while the market has also had a strong 12  rally    That s nice  but I don t think this matters much  As I said  I think Buffett just bought a Forever Stock    one that will likely deliver staggering results over the long term  It s a lot easier to sleep at night  not worrying about the short term fluctuations  knowing you own a well run company riding a mega trend like this one    I would say that DaVita will outperform archrivals as well  but there simply aren t many direct rivals in the United States  Fresenius Medical Care  NYSE  FMS  is in the same line of business and  along with DaVita  controls roughly 32  of the domestic market  But Fresenius is based in Germany and operates in more than 40 countries  It is also valued much more richly than DaVita  with a forward price to earnings  P E  ratio of 18  DaVita  meanwhile  trades at a more compelling P E of 14 and has been growing much faster    Risks to Consider  Medicaid accounts for close to half of DaVita s sales  Government programs are notoriously unpredictable and stingy  but so far  DaVita has had little problem negotiating profitable  though low margin  reimbursement levels from Medicaid  And again  patients have few other treatment options     Buffett has a reputation for being one of the most loyal stockholders in history  And given its stable and growing revenue streams  it seems hard to go wrong for investors willing to hold DaVita for the long haul  By my reckoning  it s a true Forever Stock

156436,377952,BRKb,On Generating Alpha From Value Investing,opinion,Value investing has been a successful strategy for many investors since the earliest days of equity markets The principle is quite simple  Investors select stocks they feel are trading for artificially less than their intrinsic values and hence are  significantly  undervalued by the marketplace    Sir John Templeton was a pioneer in this field  He began his career on Wall Street in 1937 and went on to create some of the world s largest and most successful international investment funds  In 1999  Money magazine rated him as   arguably the greatest global stock picker of the century  He sold the Templeton Funds in 1992 to the Franklin Group for  440 million  and today his great niece Lauren Templeton continues the legacy through her firm   Lauren Templeton Investments   Ms  Templeton is the president and founder of the Southeastern Hedge Fund Association  INC and is a Trustee of the Baylor School and the Finance Advisory Board of the University of Tennessee Chattanooga alongside which  she is a member of the Templeton Foundation She also co authored  Investing the Templeton Way  The Market Beating Strategies of Value Investing Legendary Bargain Hunter     In this interview  Ms  Templeton takes us through her story of generating alpha from value strategies    Q  What are the key reasons for some stocks becoming  bargains      Lauren Templeton  We tend to see two scenarios that come up time and time again    The first and most common scenario is that security prices become inefficient or show large departures from intrinsic value when there are few investors paying attention to the company  So in this case  we are talking about a neglected stock  One good example is the recent take over of NEO Material Technologies  NEM TO  which is our company s largest holding They are a rare earth refiner who are listed and headquartered in Toronto  but they have substantial operations in Mainland China near their primary source of rare earth China controls 90  of the world s supply of rare earths and do not  in general  allow foreigners to participate in ownership of that supply  NEO Materials however  has managed to set up operations in China near the main source This company we purchased back in 2006 2007 had little  if any  research at that time  but was remarkably well positioned in the value chain for rare earths insofar as it had competitive advantages in the processing of rare earth materials  It had very high operating margins and high returns on capital to illustrate those advantages Back then  before rare earths became popular as an investing topic  the company was trading at just 6x earnings  The reason we believe for this is that nobody was paying attention to it Since 2006 2007  rare earth prices have really increased  NEO Materials can pass along these price increases and so the stock s valuation increased  as did research coverage That s a great example of a neglected opportunity    The second is a crisis situation This can occur in a country  a region  an industry or a specific company  and we take advantage of all of these  Uncle John always had a desk plate in his office that said  trouble is opportunity  and that s very much how we see the markets  A great example of this would be the Swine Flu crisis of 2009  That crisis really hit home for me because my daughter was born in March of that year  My husband and I had just come out with a book   Investing the Templeton Way  and we had been the opportunity and do the annual book signing in conjunction with Berkshire Hathaway This was such a good opportunity  but we had a 6 week old daughter that we were going to have to travel with I was a first time mum  and scared to death as Swine Flu was all over the news People at Berkshire Hathaway were walking around with face masks and Vice President Joe Biden said he wouldn t fly on an airplane  On the other side of the coin  I remember coming into the office and saying   how are we going to play this    We started research doing screens and ended up identifying Mexican Airport operators who were already trading at cyclical lows  They had already declined over 20  in a single day because of this crisis They had EBIT margins ranging from 30 40  and were great businesses with little to no debt We bought three of these firms  taking a basket approach  All were very profitable  and we later collapsed them into one position that remains in our portfolio today  Whether it s Swine Flu  the Japanese Tsunami or any other crisis  we re out there looking for an opportunity    Q  How do you determine the  point of maximum pessimism      Lauren Templeton  The point of maximum pessimism is the ultimate time to buy a stock because at this point  all the sellers are gone  and only buyers remain  How do you determine this point  Even Uncle John said it s impossible   You never know until it has passed    For us  it is best signaled by valuations that are creating new lows versus historical valuation levels or relative to other stocks That s when we get the most excited  In late 2007 09 PE ratios across the market were as low as they had been in 25 years That was exciting to us because at some level we felt like we had our choice of stocks to purchase which  as any investor knows  is a rare luxury    If you had to perform this exercise on a company like AGCO which was one of our holdings during the financial crisis  or Agrium  AGU  which is one of our current holdings  you would have found that the market was discounting low single digit growth into perpetuity  You would have had to ask yourself whether that was reasonable   For us  it wasn t reasonable in these stocks We believed that for these organisations there were opportunities in agriculture from emerging market consumers  and so we decided that single digit growth rates were unrealistic for this industry    Q  How does your valuation methodology work     Lauren Templeton  Our methodology is pretty simple  We start out by looking at standard quantitative screens that we have used for many years There s nothing sophisticated about them  they are standard valuation screens that most investors would use  Once we run these screens  we focus on the bottom decile of the list  If we find interesting companies we feel do not belong there  we will run them through a discounted cash flow model to get their intrinsic value over a 10year view  We will not employ capital unless we can find an opportunity that has a minimum of 50  upside to our intrinsic value over the term of our investment While we project over a 10 year period  our target holding is 3 5 years    In terms of selecting companies  we look for companies that are growing faster than their peers  have higher operating margins than their peers  and have higher return on capital than their peers  In currency  we pay attention to purchasing power parity and favor currencies that appear under valued  Right now this would be currencies like the South African Rand  the Chinese Renminbi and more There are also examples of currencies which are very well managed by their governments and are unlikely to lose value over time such as the Canadian Dollar   Our sell discipline is that when a company or stock approaches our approximation of intrinsic value  we liquidate the put position  quickly if it s a cyclical company This yields cash into the portfolio  Typically you will have a few stocks  all at once  approaching your estimations of intrinsic value  If the market is fair to over valued  it will be more difficult to find these opportunities and this process will really slow down    Managing a hedge fund as a value investor is a dream come true Uncle John managed a mutual fund  in this industry people give you money at the wrong time  they take it away at the wrong time  and although they do that in a hedge fund as well  monthly versus daily liquidity curbs it a little bit Hedge funds also have two additional levers I can pull which mutual funds cannot access Firstly  I can start covering shorts meaning my net long exposure goes up The second is employing leverage    Q  To what extent do you think human behaviour can lead to mispricing in the market     Lauren Templeton  To a huge extent  Behavioral finance and value investing are perfectly compatible Human beings have a real tendency to overreact on the upside and the downside We are not rational investors I do not believe that people make rational financial decisions    If you study financial decision making you will find that human beings are irrational in a very predictable manner  Most theories in finance such as modern portfolio theory and so forth are based on the existence of  homo economicus  which models man as a perfectly rational wealth optimizer In the real world  evidence suggests this simply is not the case  We make the same mistakes over and over again  and behavioral finance experts refer to these mistakes as biases and heuristics  I as a value investor focus on the social side of this  herding  contagion and so forth  These opportunities allow me to compound money at a higher rate than my peers simply because I m taking advantage of these mis pricing events    Uncle John s career really blossomed late in life  He sold his business in New York  and the one thing they didn t buy was the Templeton Growth Fund  He and his wife moved to Nassau in the Bahamas and he was stuck with the Templeton Growth Fund  He managed it from there and it really made his career He told me that his returns got so much better in the Bahamas  why  Because he got the Wall Street Journal a few days late It s so difficult to mentally distance yourself from the herd and so perhaps physically distancing yourself from the herd is a good idea    I genuinely believe that you can train yourself to see trouble as opportunity and realize that the best time to make money is when other people are most fearful    What does this mean for investors and risk managers  The world of investment continues to seek ever more sophisticated methodologies to seek opportunities in the marketplace Lauren shows us that value investing can yield significant opportunities for return in the market by using very well established principles and solid fundamentals Her view is a necessary breath of fresh air in an environment where otherwise complexity has been king

156437,377953,BRKb,Is This Warren Buffett s New Favorite Stock ,opinion,It s become one of my favorite stocks  I like to call it my  Cadillac  investment for 2012  I ve even selected it as one of my  Top 5 Stocks for 2012     The company is buying back billions of its stock  It s expanding furiously into growing markets  And it just announced its tenth consecutive year of record sales   Just days ago Warren Buffett s Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE  BRK B  announced it added 16 1 million shares of this stock to its holdings  taking its total to 20 3 million shares  a position worth more than  975 million    But Buffett isn t the only one who is backing up the truck to load up on shares    George Soros just added over 474 000 shares to his portfolio  too    But this isn t an investment reserved only for financial gurus  Regular investors like you and me can pull back the curtain and buy this  forever  idea  too  My advice  Buy it  forget about it and hold it forever    I m talking about DirecTV  Nasdaq  DTV   You likely know DirecTV already  Based in El Segundo  California  DirecTV is the world s largest provider of pay television services  Its satellite dishes sit on the roofs of 32 million subscribers worldwide But besides being  1 in its industry  what is it about DirecTV that has so obviously grabbed Buffett and Soros  attention Well for one  DirecTV is the  Cadillac  of cable and satellite providers  Let me explain      In the U S   DirecTV targets the premium end of the market by offering exclusive programming  specifically sports programming  These premium offerings attract high end  loyal customers willing to pay a little extra for subscriptions like NFL Sunday Ticket  NCAA Mega March Madness and NASCAR HotPass    I count myself as one of those customers  Even though there are cheaper cable options in my area  I pay a premium for DirecTV  After all  I m a Chicago Bears fan living in the middle of Texas  and come September  I want to be able to see every Bears game  The only way to do that  Pay a little more to subscribe to DirecTV s NFL Sunday Ticket     DirecTV dominates the high end of the pay television market just like Cadillac dominates the high end of the U S  auto market  They are both  best in class  brands focused on quality  innovation and a little bit of luxury  They are the brands people turn to when they want more than just the basics    they want to reward themselves    And that s the kind of  best of class  market dominance I want to invest in for the long run because it translates into  pricing power      Competition gets way more aggressive if a company doesn t have these premium offerings  Providers like Time Warner Cable  NYSE  TWC   Comcast  Nasdaq  CMCSA  and DISH Network  Nasdaq  DISH  largely compete on price  If a cable provider tries to raise rates  subscribers threaten to switch  Same goes for when a competitor cuts rates    customers will insist their current provider match the deal or they ll cancel    DirecTV s exclusive sports programming  reputation for quality and loyal high end customers serves to insulate the company from the competitive churn at the lower end of the sector    But if I had to guess  I d say that Buffett and Soros are eyeing something much bigger than the U S  cable market      My hunch is that Buffett and Soros are buying the massive growth opportunities south of the border  in Latin and South America    It s simple  In countries like Mexico and Brazil  if someone wants TV  the signal almost always has to be beamed in via satellite  There s little by way of cable and fiber infrastructure that transmits cable signals in America    So while premium programming drives DirecTV s pricing power in the U S   its pricing power in Latin and South America is driven by the lack of other options    DirecTV is taking advantage of the opportunity by aggressively expanding via its DirecTV Latin America division and ownership in Sky Mexico    In fact  DirecTV just announced the all time largest annual net gain in new subscribers in Latin America    3 7 million new customers signed up in 2011  DirecTV Latin America 2011 revenues grew 42  when the record subscriber growth was paired with a 8 1  increase in average revenue per subscriber    With stats like that  it doesn t take the expert investing skills of Buffett and Soros to see why DirecTV stock could go higher in the months and years ahead   For more details on DirecTV  I ve profiled it the recent presentation I put together on my  Top 5 Stocks for 2012   You can read the entire profile here     But DirecTV s pricing power and expansion into growing markets is still only part of the reason investors such as Buffett and Soros are drawn to this stock    The last piece of the puzzle  The company just announced that it s bumping up its existing share buyback program by another  6 billion in 2012  which should create significant shareholder value    Management continues to target a  5 earnings per share goal in 2013  and if the company achieves the  5 target  that puts DirecTV s current forward P E ratio at roughly 9 0x  an incredible value  No wonder Buffett    the world s greatest value investor    is buying this stock like crazy    Add in the  6 billion stock buyback plan authorized for 2012  and you ve got all the ingredients for a true  Cadillac  investment  After all  strong  growing companies that take care of their shareholders tend to do better over the long run  And you don t have to be a Buffett or Soros to understand that    Risks to Consider  Of course  with investing there s never a surefire thing  Even the seemingly strongest companies aren t guaranteed to deliver see a positive return    But that said  if you invest in companies with a pricing advantage  aggressive plans for expansion and shareholder friendly policies  then I think you have a great chance of making money in the long run  by Sara

156438,377954,BRKb,Was Warren Buffett Wrong About This Stock ,opinion,Did Warren Buffett s Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE    recently commit an error in judgment  It s tough to be critical of one of the world s greatest value investors  but even the best of the best can occasionally get caught up in the hype and forget the disciplined rules that earned them their fortunes in the first place    In question are the so called dollar stores  specifically Berkshire s potentially overpriced investment in Dollar General  NYSE       To be fair  making a  48 million investment in a  15 6 billion company while the stock traded at a high 18 times earnings didn t seem like a call Buffett would have made  Instead  Berkshire s new manager  Todd Combs  probably made the pick   Still  Berkshire Hathaway is Buffett s baby  and knowing how he likes to do things  the pick may not exactly be one that investors want to mirror    Here s why   From good to great Dollar stores and deep value retailers such as Dollar General  Family Dollar  NYSE    and Dollar Tree  Nasdaq    are new  but they really didn t reach their full stride until 2008  Prior to then  consumers for the most part felt rich and acted rich  and didn t want or need to shop for bargains    But once economic Armageddon struck  many consumers quickly made the switch and started shopping at these deep bargain stores in order to save their hard earned money    And the numbers verify it    Between 2005 and 2007  Dollar Tree s bottom line grew by an average of 15  per year  Since then  its net income has expanded by a little more than 31  per year on average    Dollar General s earnings growth since 2007 has been even more phenomenal  The company moved from what was essentially a break even year in 2007 to per share earnings of  2 37 last year  which isn t bad for a stock priced at roughly  46  Before 2008  Family Dollar s average annual earnings growth rate used to be 6   Since then  it s averaged 23    By all accounts this is exactly the kind of growth investors love to see from the companies in which they ve invested  And with this new bargain focused paradigm apparently here to stay    even during a stronger economy    the social undertow clearly supports this industry s earnings    So why do I say Buffett and Combs likely made a big mistake in buying shares of Dollar General    Because the stock wasn t even close to being cheap when they bought it    While the earnings growth from this group of retailers has been red hot for the past four years  the underlying stocks have appreciated even faster    perhaps too fast    Take Dollar Tree for instance  Annual earnings now are 138  stronger then they were in 2008  but the stock has gained nearly 300  between then and now  As a result  the price to earnings  P E  ratio has soared from a palatable 16 4 at the end of 2008 to a current trailing P E ratio of 23 5 And Dollar Tree isn t alone Family Dollar is the same story  While per share earnings have grown from  1 66 in 2008 to  3 40 for the past four quarters as consumers have become loyal to the stores  the stock s price grew nearly 200  during the past four years And while the trailing P E ratio of about 18 6 makes it the cheapest among the three stocks in question  that s still an unusually high P E ratio for a retailer  Dollar General wasn t a publicly traded company in 2008  but just for reference  earnings of  0 47 per share in 2008 swelled by an incredible 400  to reach  2 37 last year  Since Dollar General went public in late 2009  the stock has roughly doubled  while income has only been 81  higher  The trailing P E ratio has moved up to a pricey 19 5 Risks to Consider  The rallies from these stocks are becoming flimsy  as market saturation will likely make it more difficult to maintain earnings growth rates  But to give credit where it s due  these deep discount business models can somewhat justify growth like valuations because of their double digit earnings growth rates   Action to take     There is more room for each of the companies mentioned in this article to crank out top  and bottom line growth  But for the stocks  there s more vulnerability than opportunity at this point  Their valuations have simply just gotten out of control as the market has fixated on growth and promise  All three names could make for solid investments if timed right  but the right time and price for an entry is probably going to require about a 25  correction from peak levels by James Brumley,2012-04-04,StreetAuthority,https://www.investing.com/analysis/was-warren-buffett-wrong-about-this-stock-119154,119154
156465,377981,BRKb,Berkshire Hathaway s Investment in Goldman Sachs Has Resulted in a 50  Return,opinion,On September 24  2008  Berkshire Hathaway  BRK A    BRK B  and Goldman Sachs  GS  entered into an agreement in which Berkshire Hathaway purchased  5 billion of Goldman s preferred shares paying a 10  dividend  Berkshire also received warrants granting it the right to buy  5 billion of Goldman Sachs common stock at  115 per share  or 43 5 million shares  through October 1  2013  Goldman Sachs called the preferred stock for redemption on April 18  2011 at a premium of 10  over par value  plus accrued and unpaid dividends  As a result  Berkshire Hathaway earned approximately  1 75 billion   1 25 billion in dividends plus a redemption premium of  500 million  in 2  years on its investment of  5 billion  This represents a return of 35  over this time period from the preferred stock alone  At Goldman Sachs s closing price of  109 73 per share on January 30  2012  what are its warrants worth  Although these warrants are currently  out of the money  since the underlying common shares are selling below the strike price of  115  they have considerable value which can be estimated using a Black Scholes calculator  When applying a strike price of  115  stock price of  109 73  time remaining of 605 days  historical volatility of 38 8   source  TD Ameritrade   and a risk free interest rate of 0 2   2 Year U S  Treasury   each warrant is valued at  19 76  Therefore  Berkshire s 43 5 million warrants have a total current value of  860 million  When adding the current value of  860 million from its Goldman Sachs warrants to its return of  1 75 billion from Goldman s preferred stock  Berkshire s total return can be valued at approximately  2 6 billion  or more than 50  of its  5 billion investment  This provides further evidence of how Warren Buffett has recently created shareholder value for Berkshire Hathaway  Furthermore  his willingness to invest  5 billion in Goldman Sachs at the peak of the financial crisis in September 2008  and his previously stated intention of not exercising Berkshire s warrants in Goldman Sachs until their expiration on October 1  2013  are providing an indication of Mr  Buffett s confidence in the outlook for Goldman s common stock  Since shares of both Berkshire Hathaway and Goldman Sachs are currently selling at reasonable valuations  investors might wish to consider investing in them ,2012-02-02,David Kass,https://www.investing.com/analysis/berkshire-hathaway’s-investment-in-goldman-sachs-has-resulted-in-a-50-return-112849,112849

156467,377983,BRKb,The Price of Austerity ,opinion,On the face of it  the vote to pass the latest austerity measure in Greece passed comfortably  199 votes in favour with 74 against  But the political and social price has been high  Several cabinet ministers have resigned and violent protests have spread across the country  But as always  it s a question of implementation of the measures which run to over 50 pages in the memorandum of understanding   We re not home and dry yet however  with EU Finance Ministers set to meet on Wednesday to give final approval  together with the finalisation of the private sector involvement deal   It has to happen this week for it to be in place ahead of the March 20th Greek bond redemption  Once these elements are in place  markets will also be looking for signs for any signs from the ECB that it is prepared to play its part by forgoing the  eventual  profits on its holdings of Greek debt   Understandably  the single currency is not in the mood to celebrate this result  standing only marginally firmer vs  the USD during the Asia session  Commentary Swiss policy alternatives looking more attractive  The latest inflation data make uncomfortable reading for the Swiss National Bank  SNB  and makes it more likely that the central bank will take another stab at trying to weaken the Swiss franc at some point in the not too distant future  The fall in the annual rate from  0 7  to  0 8  was broadly in line with expectations  In absolute terms  prices are now at levels last prevailing in September 2010   With interest rates effectively at zero the options for the SNB look pretty limited at first sight  Before the current cap was put into place  it s understood that the authorities looked at a range of measure for containing franc strength  including capital controls and negative interest rates  As times goes on  it s looking more likely that these will have to be put back onto the agenda  The issue at this point in time is that the SNB has done a good job in credibly holding its ground with regards to the current floor to EUR CHF of 1 20  To move that higher would risk goading the markets into a tougher battle that the SNB may have a smaller chance of winning  Although we only have data up to November  there are few signs that the cap on the CHF has substantially deterred overseas investors  Sight deposits of overseas institutions are less than 2  lower when comparing September to November vs  the prior six month period  Therefore  although there are a lot of factors determining investment flow as well as rates  on the face of it there are few signs that investors have been deterred by the potential for further intervention  Imposing negative rates for overseas deposits and or capital controls could prove to be the more favourable route from here  with less scope for reputational disaster  Dressing down for the gold bulls   In a devastating article penned for Fortune magazine  the Sage of Omaha delivers a withering critique of the gold bubble  one which ought to shake gold bulls to their very cores  According to the Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway  gold belongs to a category of investment that produces nothing  and one in which the investor buys the metal in the hope that someone else will pay more for it in the future  In order for the price of this type of asset to rise  an expanding pool of buyers is required  Therefore  when you buy gold you are essentially hoping that more and more people will buy gold in the future than have bought it before   In recent years  gold has performed very well because people have been frightened that paper currencies were rapidly being debased  an entirely legitimate fear  However  gold has two major shortcomings    it is of no practical use  except for limited industrial and decorative purposes   and it is not procreative  Therefore  by owning gold you are assuming that the ranks of the fearful will expand  never a good rationale for making any investment   Buffett points out that the current stock of gold is around 170K metric tons and  at today s price is worth a staggering USD 9 6trln  When investors fear currency collapse they rush for gold  If this fear diminishes then the demand for gold collapses  Should Europe get its collective act together and ultimately resolve Europe s debt crisis  and if central banks desist from currency debasement  then the premise for holding gold will evaporate  Pain relief for Portugal  Amidst the perma pain of fiscal austerity  finally some reward for Portugal  In a meeting Thursday between the German and Portuguese Finance Ministers  the former suggested that there may be room to ease the terms of Portugal s EUR 78bln bailout package  but only after the Greek situation has been clarified  Schaeuble remarked that Portugal had made good progress in implementing the various conditions contained in the bailout  The Portuguese 10yr yield is down another 20bp today at 12 87    down more than 550bp in a little over 10 days  Suddenly  Portugal is out of the intensive care unit  although it remains in a critical condition  because it simply cannot afford these borrowing costs

156468,377984,BRKb,Shareholder Interests Aren t All The Same,opinion,Management will act in its own best interests  and for this reason investors should ensure that management s interests are aligned with theirs  Sometimes  however  management may be swayed to act in the interests of major shareholders  whether under the threat of a hostile takeover or as part of a courtship process for a friendly merger  Investors armed with this knowledge are in a position to better understand what is about to take place  and may thus make investment decisions that are in tune with their investment strategies For example  value investors can take a hint as to the company s future capital allocation plans if a company under review already has a large shareholder with a history of a preference for companies which return capital to shareholders vs  those which try to empire build  But to the aspiring value investor  finding this information isn t always easy Shareholders who peruse SEC company filings will have come across  from time to time  This is a mandatory filing that must be submitted by anyone who owns more than 5  of a company  On this form  major shareholders are required to disclose who they are  their relationship to the company  and even the motivations behind the transaction  though that can be conveniently changed at a later time  But even if the schedule itself does not make the motive of the purchase abundantly clear  researching the large investor s background may help clear up uncertainties with respect to the company s near term future  For example  if Berkshire Hathaway  BRK A  has taken a large stake in a company  it may be seen as an endorsement of management  On the other hand  if Carl Icahn is the buyer  director and management changes may be on the way That management should act in the best interests of shareholders is often discussed  including on this site  Implicit in this idea  however  is the notion that all shareholder interests are the same  Unfortunately  this is not always the case  However  disclosures are available which can aid the shareholder in determining whether the interests of major shareholders are aligned with theirs ,2012-02-16,Saj Karsan,https://www.investing.com/analysis/shareholder-interests-aren't-all-the-same-114141,114141
156469,377985,BRKb,Housing  Fantasy vs  Reality,opinion,The fantasy they want you to believe    Reuters  New single family home sales fell in January  but an upward revision to December s data and a drop in the supply of properties on the market added to growing signs of a budding recovery in the housing sector  The reality I want you to see    Streettalk The Total Housing Activity Index shown here is a composite of the sales of new and existing homes  new construction permits for single family homes and new single family home starts   As you can see we are still near the same lows that we were in 2009 at the end of the recession   Furthermore  and what is really worse  is that the  recovery  was built on the bank of a whole slew of tax payer funded bailouts  tax credits and incentives from HAMP to HARP to the Home Buyer Tax Credit   Not quite the recovery the government was hoping for    NewsBusters In his Friday report on new home sales   Associated Press journalist Derek  Kravitz noted a seasonally adjusted January drop  but trumpeted a minuscule upward adjustment to fourth quarter sales which was barely more than a rounding error New home sales dip after 4 straight monthly gains Sales of new homes dipped in January but the final quarter of 2011 was stronger than first estimated  The Commerce Department said Friday that new home sales fell 0 9 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 321 000 homes  That followed four straight months of gains in which home sales rose 10 percent  The gains came after the government upwardly revised October  November and December s figures  December s annual sales pace of 324 000 was the highest in a year  Even with more sales  just 304 000 new homes were sold in 2011   the fewest on records dating back to 1963  And new homes are selling well below the 700 000 per year rate that economists equate with healthy markets  Still  the pickup in sales at the end of last year coincides with other improvements in the housing market and should bolster the view that the depressed sector is starting to revive  Below  is the raw data which forms the basis for Kravitz s first paragraph placement of the fourth quarter revision and its characterization as  stronger than first estimated  You ve got to be kidding me  Derek  A whopping 2 000 more homes were sold in December  because of rounding  it could be anywhere from about 1 000 to about 3 000 more   This is supposed to indicate that the industry is  starting to revive   If Kravitz thinks that 23 000 is  stronger   he must want us to believe that original 21 000 was  strong    Economix   A new paper presented Friday at a monetary policy conference in New York  says   more than half the underperformance in this recovery is associated with housing related sectors  Yes  that s right  Housing is more than half of our problem The details by now are probably familiar  The crash in housing prices erased a vast amount of wealth and  perhaps even more importantly  it severely restricted borrowing power  Many people are unable to refinance and unable to tap the value of their homes to finance consumption or investments In other words  the housing crash not only caused the crisis  it is impeding the recovery   it is interfering with the Federal Reserve s easy money aid campaign  which aims to promote growth by encouraging new borrowing   Housing problems have both offset the stimulative impact of easy monetary policy and have impaired the link between policy and the economy   says the paper by Michael E  Feroli  a J P  Morgan economist  and three collaborators The paper offers a striking way of thinking about the depth of this housing problem  It calculates that at the end of 2010  the total value of American homes exceeded demand by about 9 percent  or about  1 5 trillion   Deal Journal  Warren Buffett says the economy is improving from the devastation of the financial collapse  but that the housing world remains  in the emergency room  Buffett s annual letter to shareholders Saturday spends a good deal of time self deprecating his previous calls  as he is wont to do  He now says his statement last year that a  housing recovery will probably begin within a year or so   was in fact  dead wrong  The businesses his Berkshire Hathaway empire owns that are tied to housing including a brick maker  a pre fabricated home builder and a building products company reported similar pre tax profits to last year  but less than a third of what they reported in 2006  This hugely important sector of the economy  which includes not only construction but everything that feeds off of it  remains in a depression of its own   Buffett writes   I believe this is the major reason a recovery in employment has so severely lagged the steady and substantial comeback we have seen in almost all other sectors of our economy  ,2012-02-26,Michael Panzner,https://www.investing.com/analysis/housing:-fantasy-vs.-reality-115043,115043
156470,377986,BRKb,Five Reasons to Ignore Warren Buffett on Gold  and Silver ,opinion,It was reported today that Warren Buffet once again poo pooed gold in his statement to shareholders   In case you are tempted to listen to him  here are five reasons why you need to ignore old Uncle Warren  First  you are never too old or too rich to stop  talking your book   which is industry jargon for talking up investments you own  while trying to belittle investments you don t  Basic sales pumping that lots of people do Second  you are also never too old to say one thing and do another  This is the opposite of the first observation but also a trick deployed by hedge fund managers  For example  George Soros has been known to say negative things about gold while he was privately adding to his gold stock positions  Sometimes  you just don t want to tip your hand Third  remember that Buffett did own nearly 130 million ounces of silver about 15 years ago  So once upon a time  Buffett understood the value of at least one of the metals  He sold early   however  arguably because he was accused of trying to corner or otherwise  screw up  the silver market  I wonder if this somehow colors his view towards the metals overall  Who knows Fourth  Warren Buffett actually owns some businesses outright  as opposed to simply having all of his wealth on paper  even as he sells paper equities to others   This matters because most middle class people cannot actually buy huge tracts of farm land  oil wells  or productive businesses or other real assets  But they can own gold and silver  which are the poor man s real assets in many ways  unencumbered by bank debts or some sort of broker intermediary Fifth  I thought that Warren s friends at the Federal Reserve want you to buy real assets like gold and silver  I thought that s what the zero percent interest rates and the war on savers is all about  I thought this was taking a page from the 1930s playbook in terms of purposeful currency debasement to generate inflation  But I guess people like Warren Buffett want to play this game of perception management  where the bankers and other people who run the world need to pretend that they aren t in fact just diluting the value of fiat currencies  Some people seem to think that every good thing in their world depends upon having other people believe fantasies about  growth   instead of admitting the role good old fashioned money printing plays in pumping up asset values Plus  remember  many would say that without government bailouts  a lot of Berkshire Hathaway s investments wouldn t be worth much  And so  billionaire or not  Mr  Buffett may be about as reliable as any other government official when it comes to admitting the truth about monetary policy and the precious metals ,2012-02-28,Ryan Jordan,https://www.investing.com/analysis/five-reasons-to-ignore-warren-buffett-on-gold-(and-silver)-115225,115225
156471,377987,BRKb,Notes on the 2011 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Report  Part 2,opinion,Picking up where the last post left off 13  So Buffett told us he has a successor lined up  but won t tell us who  but will tell us that the successor doesn t know that he is the successor   Really does not seem like much of an improvement over the past  except that the CIO function is getting better defined with Todd and Ted 14  Todd   Ted share their performance 80 20   80  of their own and 20  of their colleagues performance   Seems like a fair idea  balancing the team vs the individual 15  The regulated subsidiaries  and manufacturing  services and retailing did well  That operating income growth is what drove the year   The turnaround at NetJets was also a help  and that was fast 16  We are still waiting to see what problems BRK s decentralized system can develop   To this point  the flexibility for managers within a structure that oversees reinvestment of cash flow is admirable 17  The economic spread of BRK businesses is significant  and I would argue  unrivaled in terms of conglomerates   It almost makes me think that Buffett is aiming for owning an extra productive slice of US World GDP   It makes acquisition criteria  1 less relevant  because if you are small and private  and want to be acquired by BRK  it means that you analyze BRK  identify the portion of it that you are most similar to  and talk to the CEO of that segment  not Buffett 18  That brings up my view of Buffett at present   He has changed as the amount of assets under management has grown   The last phase for Buffett is not large cap value manager  but private equity manager   conglomerateur   He uses the float that his insurers produce to invest in a wide number of enterprises that will produce excess returns   He does not run a closed end fund  but runs a conglomerate 19  Interesting to see Nebraska Furniture Mart open its third store   Logical to do  if the experience is replicable 20   We do not talk one on one to large institutional investors or analysts   Bravo   Would that this would be true of more companies   When I represented a large holder of Safety Insurance  the management asked me what we wanted in terms o market disclosure   I said that it did not matter to us  and that we would be happy if they never talked to the media analysts  and only emitted 10 Qs and 10 Ks  even without notifying us as to timing 21  Buffett notes that a decent number of borrowers that lost their homes did well in the crisis  because of all the money they extracted from loans   That might be similar to a private equity manager profiting through deals to borrow where he pays himself a dividend 22  Owning 11  of Munich Re gives Buffett additional influence over the reinsurance market 23  Because of the need for collateral  BRK will not be making any more significant derivative bets 24  Buffet repeats his  regarding bonds and gold   I repeat my screed   It s all logical  Warren  but you have to think more broadly and read about the  25  It makes sense that flying to Kansas City is a better strategy than going to Omaha   But as this becomes widely used  make sure you reserve a car early 26  If you want to ask Buffett a question at the annual meeting  you can do it by e mailing the following 27  There will be insurance analysts at the annual meeting  and they are Cliff Gallant of KBW  Jay Gelb of Barclays Capital and Gary Ransom of Dowling and Partners   I have a lot of respect for Gary Ransom   listen to the questions that he asks 28  Minus   Plus  Negative change in AOCI   comprehensive income of noncontrolled interests down   Strong CFO  net of capex  supports goodwill 29  At for BRK s big options  BAC in the money  GS at  GE DOW out of the money 30  Do parts of all asbestos liabilities eventually go to Berkshire Hathaway for reinsurance   Who don t they reinsure    The liabilities for environmental  asbestos and latent injury claims and claims expenses net of reinsurance recoverable were approximately  13 9 billion at December 31  2011  I know that Buffett thinks he can earn money off of the float on these claims in excess of the implied interest rate   But when he begins to become the preferred habitat for reinsurance  he makes BRK more volatile with respect to legal judgments 31   Without prior regulatory approval  our principal insurance subsidiaries may declare up to approximately  9 5 billion as ordinary dividends before the end of 2012   And that is because only 10  of the regulatory surplus of  95 billion can be released 32  BRK  unlike many firms  has more reasonable assumptions on DB pensions  expected return  6 9   discount rate 4 6  33  To date  share repurchases have been insignificant   Looks like  67 million from the Statement of Shareholders Equity 34   On January 31  2012  we issued an additional  1 7 billion of parent company senior unsecured notes  the proceeds of which were used to fund the repayment of  1 7 billion of notes maturing in February 2012  Why not pay down short term debt   BRK has the cash  and you state that you have an aversion to debt  particularly at the holding company level  but you are not acting like you have an aversion to debt over the last 10 years To Buffett  is there a level of debt at which you would be uncomfortable at the parent company  or subsidiaries   Also  would you ever make an effort to get the AAA rating back 35  BRK has a very diversified reserving book if you look at page 84 of the annual report   impressive 36  I appreciate acquisition principle 6  which deal with aspects of value that accounting does not capture   Buffett takes the right position to value those fully  because you will eventually get that value  and others will not pay up for it 37  Buffett makes a lot out of the virtues of deferred taxes and float  He argues  they are liabilities without covenants or due dates attached to them    This is true  though deferred tax liabilities assume that you will make money  and will continue to grow   Float is similar  it assumes you will underwrite well  and it would be nice if you grew 38  Buffett says toward the end of the annual report There is a third  more subjective  element to an intrinsic value calculation that can be either positive or negative  the efficacy with which retained earnings will be deployed in the future  We  as well as many other businesses  are likely to retain earnings over the next decade that will equal  or even exceed  the capital we presently employ  Some companies will turn these retained dollars into fifty cent pieces  others into two dollar bills I ve written about this before   Some managements teams with skill should retain all earnings  and not pay a dividend   Management teams without skill should act like REITs and pay out 90  of taxable income  or free cash flow  39  Buffett says he was wrong on housing   I think he is still wrong on housing  it will take a lot longer for this situation to normalize   The key variable is the proportion of houses with debts exceeding a 90  LTV   Those houses are illiquid  can t be sold except in a short sale 40  One final wild idea  would BRK consider buying out the corpus of AIG   I have better small insurance acquisition targets than that  but buying out AIG would be delicious given the comments Greenberg made to Buffett back when BRK was smaller   He was very dismissive of BRK   Also  Buffett could fold ILFC into NetJets  or vice versa   sell off the life companies  and impose greater discipline on the P C underwriting   Personally  if BRK made a bid for AIG at  32  I think Buffett could make a lot out of it  and he would not have to worry about a lot of fuss  because the major holder is the US Government

performance for U S  financial markets as the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2 61   the S   P 500 4 1   and the Nasdaq tacked on 5 43    The improvement in market indexes is at least partially attributable to the continued reduction in unemployment claims below 400K   Market participants see the economy continuing a recovery  and like a leaky faucet which continually drips  gradually buy in an effort to outperform targeted benchmarks        However  there are other indicators which tell a different picture as well   The 10 year Treasury bond yield still hovers at around 2   and with the 30 year yield at near 3   you also have gold priced at close to  1700 per ounce   These statistics merely show there is still tremendous hesitation in the investment world to embrace any kind of

prices  like oil at over  105 a barrel and the record low natural gas price of  2 50  many investment professionals have tremendous skepticism about any economic strength and believe the U S  economy is headed for a double dip recession   However  corporate profits continue to remain strong  even with stubbornly high oil costs and a tentative U S  consumer   As profits are what drives stock market

the first two months of global stock market returns  sticking with the simple theme of investing in BRIC countries would yield an investor excellent returns   Every participant knows the often mentioned growth theme of investing in Brazil  Russia  India  and China as that is where most economists see the highest growth rates in the next 5 10 years   Yes  it is a very simple idea  but so far in 2012  the best returns have resided in the indexes of those countries   By country  Brazil is ahead by 15  year to date  Russia 25   India 12 9   and China 13 6    If you equal weighted each index

the year play out        Last year  global indexes started out in the same encouraging manner as 2012 has  only to wind up yielding heavy disappointment  especially in the BRIC and emerging market countries   Many of these indexes were down by more than 15   some in the 20 30  range   A few questions investors should strongly consider might be   Will the European sovereign debt crisis get resolved in a manageable way or will it become a disaster   How will the crisis affect the whole European economic performance  especially in Germany  France  Spain  and Italy   Will Germany become the de facto Emperor of Europe  as some already think it has   How will the crisis impact Asian economies like China  Japan  and South Korea   What effect will the crisis have on companies in the

Shareholder Letter Shows Investor s How to Proceed   Y H   C Investments may have positions in companies mentioned in this newsletter   It is the responsibility of each investor to research possible investments and make sure they fit ones risk tolerance  time horizon  liquidity needs  return objectives  tax situation  or any other issue pertinent to one s entire financial situation              Every year  on or close to the first Saturday of March  I look forward to reading Warren Buffett s annual letter to shareholders because there is always investment wisdom to be learned from the great one   In an age where the term   Pearls and Swine   is most applicable  New Jersey Governor Chris Christy and CNBC s Jim Cramer   Buffett has never come under more criticism  both for his political views and the lack of performance by Berkshire Hathaway s stock   However  if one actually reads his letter  you can take insight on how to prepare your thinking and portfolio for the future   For example  here is what Mr  Buffett has been doing over the last few years              Our major businesses did well last year  In fact  each of our five largest non insurance companies BNSF  Iscar  Lubrizol  Marmon Group and MidAmerican Energy   delivered record operating earnings  In aggregate these businesses earned more than  9 billion pre tax in 2011  Contrast that to seven years ago  when we owned only one of the five  MidAmerican  whose pre tax earnings were  393 million  Unless the economy weakens in 2012  each of our fabulous five should again set a record  with aggregate earnings comfortably topping  10 billion    Many investors believe that   Cash is King    In Buffett s approach  uh nope  not even close   He has used his enormous cash flow to buy even bigger businesses with larger operating profits  ensuring even more cash flow in the future   In addition  those businesses are growing  and as the economy gets strong  cash from operations will just continue to increase   Sitting on cash when there are opportunities available makes little sense  especially in a world of extremely low interest rates and possibly negative real returns   Now  most investors don t have tons of cash flooding in every day like Buffett  but still  constantly looking to acquire businesses at good prices usually pays off    Even more striking is Buffett admitting his investment mistakes  which many people do not think he does  A few years back  I spent about  2 billion buying several bond issues of Energy Future Holdings  an electric utility operation serving portions of Texas  That was a mistake   a big mistake  In large measure  the company s prospects were tied to the price of natural gas  which tanked shortly after our purchase and remains depressed  Though we have annually received interest payments of about  102 million since our purchase  the company s ability to pay will soon be exhausted unless gas prices rise substantially  We wrote down our investment by  1 billion in 2010 and by an additional  390 million last year    At year end  we carried the bonds at their market value of  878 million  If gas prices remain at present levels  we will likely face a further loss  perhaps in an amount that will virtually wipe out our current carrying value  Conversely  a substantial increase in gas prices might allow us to recoup some  or even all  of our write down  However things turn out  I totally miscalculated the gain loss probabilities when I purchased the bonds  In tennis parlance  this was a major unforced error by your chairman                In the investment world  nobody is perfect  including Buffett  probably the best who ever lived   When you swing the bat  you are going to miss on occasion   Finally  Buffett comments on his most recent large investment in technology  which has not been an area he ever invested in   Let s use IBM as an example  As all business observers know  CEOs Lou Gerstner and Sam Palmisano did a superb job in moving IBM from near bankruptcy twenty years ago to its prominence today  Their operational accomplishments were truly extraordinary  But their financial management was equally brilliant  particularly in recent years as the company s financial flexibility improved  Indeed  I can think of no major company that has had better financial management  a skill that has materially increased the gains enjoyed by IBM shareholders  The company has used debt wisely  made value adding acquisitions almost exclusively for cash and aggressively repurchased its own stock  Today  IBM has 1 16 billion shares outstanding  of which we own about 63 9 million or 5 5   Naturally  what happens to the company s earnings over the next five years is of enormous importance to us  Beyond that  the company will likely spend  50 billion or so in those years to repurchase shares  Our quiz for the day  What should a long term shareholder  such as Berkshire  cheer for during that period  I won t keep you in suspense  We should wish for IBM s stock price to languish throughout the five years  Let s do the math  If IBM s stock price averages  say   200 during the period  the company will acquire 250 million shares for its  50 billion  There would consequently be 910 million shares outstanding  and we would own about 7  of the company  If the stock conversely sells for an average of  300 during the five year period  IBM will acquire only 167 million shares  That would leave about 990 million shares outstanding after five years  of which we would own 6 5   If IBM were to earn  say   20 billion in the fifth year  our share of those earnings would be a full  100 million greater under the  disappointing  scenario of a lower stock price than they would have been at the higher price  At some later point our shares would be worth perhaps  11 2 billion more than if the  high price  repurchase scenario had taken place  The logic is simple  If you are going to be a net buyer of stocks in the future  either directly with your own money or indirectly  through your ownership of a company that is repurchasing shares   you are hurt when stocks rise  You benefit when stocks swoon  Emotions  however  too often complicate the matter  Most people  including those who will be net buyers in the future  take comfort in seeing stock prices advance  These shareholders resemble a commuter who rejoices after the price of gas increases  simply because his tank contains a day s supply   All of the above quotes come from the 2011 Annual Report of Berkshire Hathaway  written by Warren Buffett    Very few have the discipline  valuation capability  and resources of Buffett and virtually no one will be able to duplicate his investment performance   However  approaching the investment world with the attitude that there are opportunities available  especially when the environment is very negative  can be incredibly lucrative   Of course  guys like Chris Christy and Jim Cramer already have this figured out  but some of us will thank Buffett for helping us mere mortals learn   Thank you for reading  and any comments  questions or thoughts  please email information y hc com,2012-02-29,Yale

156473,377989,BRKb,Notes on the 2011 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Report  Part 3  On Acquisitions ,opinion,Though part of a series  this post is different  I went back through the last 35 years of shareholder letters to analyze Buffett s approach to acquisitions  As Charlie Munger has said  Buffett is scary smart  I say this because he adjusted through many different eras  while running a business that was part conglomerate  part closed end fund In some ways the early years were different   more arbitrage  public investments take up more time in the shareholder letter  But what I find fascinating is that from the earliest days  it didn t matter to Buffett whether he owned whole businesses  or parts of them Part of this feeds off of   where he contrasts tuck ins and bolt ons  correctly concluding that the difference is only one of size  even though that is an informal distinction One thing to understand about BRK is that full and partial ownership of private public businesses was always a part of the plan  Growing out of a textile manufacturing business as a holding company  that should be obvious  as it should be when considering See s Candies  BRK s first acquisition Public and private  full and partial did not matter to Buffett  He was simply interested in what could grow the intrinsic value of the the overall enterprise best  within the concept of a margin of safety 1987 1989 was kind of an inbetween era for BRK  where Buffett would talk about his Sainted Seven private firms inside BRK  until he bought Borsheim s in 1989  which gave him no good way to describe his private holdings with a simple moniker As it is  when he began doing more acquisitions  the 1991 1993 era included the  Shoe Group   which was not among his finer moments  But starting in 1995  with the purchase of the remainder of GEICO  is the start of the modern BRK  Acquisitions become a regular part of the plan  What makes that plain  was that post 1990 in years where BRK had no acquisitions  Buffett would discuss his theory on acquisitions for shareholders   He did this because when there are few promising targets to invest in  it is usually a sign that valuations are stretched And in general  Buffett chose wisely with the private businesses  Yes  there have been some that ended up being losers  or  not big winners  like the  Shoe Group   and Scott   Fetzer s untimely purchase of World Book  which was about to be obsoleted by Encarta  and then Wikipedia Buffett understood the need for sustainable competitive advantage  He also knew how much he could afford to risk in acquiring private firms  His  bite size  increased gradually until he could take down monsters like Burlington Northern  He bought businesses that would be hard to obsolete One thing I found interesting about reading through the older letters of Buffett was that his ideas on acquisitions were developed early  long before BRK ceased to be predominantly a public company value investor  which is the way that many still regard BRK And as a result  it should be no surprise that as BRK grew  given Buffett s desire for owning as much of great businesses as he could  that BRK became a conglomerate  albeit one dominated by its leading insurance businesses Though we can look at the different strategies employed by Buffett over the years  and see how some played a larger role early on like arbitrage and distressed investing  Buffett had a singular focus for the investments that offer decent returns in the size range that will make a difference for BRK investors Once BRK got big  that meant becoming a conglomerate  albeit a special one  was the logical outcome   And I could be wrong  but that is the final corporate form for BRK  There may come a day in a post Buffett era when it may do many things  such as spin off companies  or centralize functions  At present that won t happen because BRK is the acquirer of choice for those that want to cash out  but don t want the unique character of their organizations to change  which Buffett points at in the present Shareholders  Letter as a unique competitive advantage   BRK does not compete on price in acquisitions  it does compete by saying that unless something goes badly wrong  BRK will be more than happy to let the management do its thing   It s as if Buffett says   Just make money  and send us back the excess  If you have need of cash for promising opportunities  let us know  And then  it lets a thousand flowers bloom  and a thousand schools of thought contend  so long as you make money and grow the value of the business  BRK is a unique business  and reflects the character of its founders  including Munger here   No other large firm that I know of offers as much latitude to its operating units One final note  Buffett has also had a very good nose for sniffing out good insurance enterprises  That s the backbone of BRK  It s interesting to see over the years how he assembled the various pieces  It would be interesting to see pre 1977 data on the insurance side  to look at how Buffett initially entered the insurance business  and transisted out of running a textile firm Tomorrow should have

156503,378019,BRKb,Valuing Berkshire Hathaway,opinion,If you re into this kind of thing  which is to say that examining financial statements is a source of stimulating mental gymnastics  figuring out the value of Berkshire Hathaway  BRK  could keep you entertained  BRK released their third quarter s earnings over the weekend  It s an insurance company transforming itself into an operating business as Whitney Tilson has pointed out before  It s true that the acquisition of Burlington Northern has pushed their non insurance operating earnings to a new level  Breaking the company into its two pieces  insurance and non insurance  and adding its securities portfolio is an interesting exercise Non insurance businesses generated pre tax operating income of  5 4BN during the first nine months of the year  There are many moving parts  but assume positive surprises will net out with negatives and you get  7 3BN of full year pre tax earnings  Most insurance companies operate an underwriting loss  i e  they only reach profitability because of investment earnings on the float  but BRK seeks to make a profit on underwriting  Averaging the past two years and annualizing the result generates  765MM in pre tax operating income  In fact over the past eight years underwriting has produced  17BN  or over  2BN per year   These two add up to  8BN of pre tax income  after 35  tax  5 2BN Using the S P500 s trailing P E multiple of 13 values this at  68BN  This is the value of Berkshire s insurance underwriting and disparate operating businesses but excluding investment income But in addition  BRK has an investment portfolio consisting of marketable securities  non public investments and cash worth  147 BN  Adding this cash and investment portfolio to the businesses above produces  215BN  compared with BRK s current market capitalization of  190BN  or in other words the company s valued at a 12  discount Aspen Reinsurance noted that around  95BN of global reinsurance capacity has gone following many events from the earthquakes in Japan and New Zealand to weather related losses in the U S  and Australia  Given a harder market  i e  one of rising premiums given the reduced industry capacity  it s not unreasonable to expect BRK s underwriting results to improve next year  If they get back to the eight year average  the company s worth almost  230BN or is at a 17  discount This is a summary of how we look at BRK  It seems to trade at a conglomerate discount  But their underlying businesses are going well  they re buying back stock and they had their most active quarter of investing in fifteen years  putting almost  21BN to work  We think it remains an attractively priced investment ,2011-11-08,Simon Lack,https://www.investing.com/analysis/valuing-berkshire-hathaway-104850,104850

156505,378021,BRKb,The Euro Has No Good Options,opinion,The challenges facing the Euro zone including most recently Italy seem so enormous and intractable that it s easy to contemplate previously unimaginable outcomes  Der Spiegel reports that the German government is preparing for a possible Greek exit from the Euro  The currency was designed without an exit   it s unclear how Greece could extricate itself  A weekend nationalization of banks with all deposits converted to drachma  The new currency would immediately collapse from its initial level as unwilling holders of drachma sold  and in any case the days and weeks leading up to such an event would no doubt see a sharp run on deposits from Greek banks  As it is there s a tax on money leaving the country  And we read every day that supporting Italy will require the IMF and a reinforced EFSF  What will happen if Italy can t refinance its debt   250BN of which rolls over in 2012 But you don t need to bet on disasters to see downside for the Euro  Just muddling through and avoiding any of the crisis scenarios is going to involve slower growth  The Austerity Solution so favored by the EU and IMF is assuredly lowering GDP growth in the region as well as consumer confidence  The growth differential between the U S  and the Euro zone continues to widen  JPMorgan now forecasts  1 7  2012 GDP growth in the U S  versus  0 6  in the Euro zone  Solutions and non solutions seem to lead to the same place  The next 10  move in the exchange rate looks far more likely to be lower The Financial Times notes that Liquid Natural Gas  LNG  tanker ships are experiencing increased demand  one of the very few areas of shipping for which that is true  The rest of the shipping industry has shot itself in both feet as every operator positioned for a 10  increase in market share  which has crushed shipping rates through overcapacity and made the sector even less friendly than U S  residential construction  if that s possible   But the virtual shutdown of the Japanese nuclear energy industry following the earthquake has increased Japanese demand for LNG imports and is raising prices  Regrettably  producers of domestic natural gas in the U S  are not direct beneficiaries because the U S  currently has no facilities at which natural gas can be compressed for export  but greater global demand is a positive over the long term  i e  3 5 years  Still on the subject of shipping  we continue to be invested in Aegean Marine Petroleum  ANW   They provide bunker fuel to the shipping industry and so operate a very different business model than their customers  Their stock price has been beaten down with their peers  although they continue to generate operating profits and just reported a third quarter of solid margins  If you can believe their book value  assets are ships and fuel inventory  the stock trades at a 40  discount  On their earnings call last week management asserted that market value for their ships was no lower than carrying value   much of the fleet is recently purchased so that ought to be true  although they did take a loss versus book value on the sale of one vessel in the third quarter  Even after rallying on last week s earnings it still trades at less than 7 X  12 estimated earings  We continue to hold a modest position in ANW Berkshire Hathaway  BRK  remains one of our biggest holdings  for reasons articulated the other day  Warren Buffett s appearance on CNBC this morning was never boring  and he revealed an investment in IBM which is not a stock we would have bought ourselves  Many large cap U S  stocks appear attractively priced  and the dividend yield on the S P500  SPY  remains more attractive than long term government or high grade bonds  The equity risk premium is not as wide as it was but remains nonetheless attractive in favoring equities over fixed income ,2011-11-15,Simon Lack,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-euro-has-no-good-options-105574,105574
156506,378022,BRKb,Another Sweet Deal for Buffett   Who Pays  You Do ,opinion,Yesterday  First Solar  FSLR  announced that it had sold its interests in a big solar project called Topaz  The buyer was MidAmerican Energy Holdings  a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway  So Warren B  is behind the transaction  I think he got another sweetheart deal  This time  it s the taxpayers who will be making Buffett richer The transaction is between two companies  As a result there has been little disclosure of the actual terms and conditions  The following is my thinking on what is behind the transaction  If I have it wrong  the nice folks from Omaha can send me a note and I ll publish their response There are a number of angles to consider in this story  I ll outline a few and try to tie them together The Topaz solar project is in San Lois Obispo  California  Construction began a month ago  and will not be completed until 2015  The facility is designed to produce 550MW of energy  The cost per MW of these types of facilities is between  3mm and  4mm per MW  Using the mid point of  3 5mm you get an estimated cost of construction of  1 925 billion  Add in another  75mm of soft costs and the total should come to  2 billion Bloomberg confirms my estimate on the completion costs of Topaz with this headline Buffett has purchased the rights to build a solar farm  The money he is putting up will be the construction costs over the next four years  First Solar will get some consideration as it has absorbed all the front end costs  but it would be a mistake to assume that FSLR is getting anything close to  2B from Buffet   Neither of the press releases from the companies mentions cash consideration  Buffett s only condition to the deal is that the Power Purchase Agreement   PPA   that Topaz has previously entered into is affirmed to Berkshire s lawyer s satisfaction  This is a critical part of the deal California s monster electric utility  Pacific Gas   Electric  PGE   has entered into a 25 year PPA with Topaz  With PGE taking all of the power from Topaz  the risks in the deal fall sharply  The output of Topaz has already been successfully monetized  All that needs be done is complete the construction and then let the sun shine  It s important to understand that Uncle Warren has a seat at this table because the Department of Energy failed to approve a big loan to Topaz prior to 9 30 2011  the deadline to get federal subsidies   The DOE did substantial work before nixing the deal  This PDF link to the DOE shows just how much had been accomplished prior to 9 30   How much did this report cost the DOE us  Many millions   All of the necessary approvals and engineering work had been completed  Construction of these solar farms is not all that complicated once the approvals and site work has been signed off on  Buffet got a deal that was teed up and ready to go  Construction commenced a month ago  Warren bought into a deal in the 11th hour  He got a shovel ready investment  He has very little risk at this point When Topaz is completed  energy will be produced  Pursuant to the PPA Topaz Buffet will receive checks monthly from PGE for the next 25 years  That stream of revenue is assured  PGE is a single A  Its long term debt yields are in the mid 4  range  I m certain that Buffet got a better yield than that  But the yield is not what brought Buffet into the deal  It was taxes and his desire to avoid them that got this deal inked  Again  that Bloomberg Headline It s clear that as part of the deal  Buffett got the tax breaks associated with Topaz  The federal tax subsidies for solar construction belong to Buffett  The numbers are huge Once completed  the owners of a solar farm get one of two massive incentive payments 1  The owner gets a cash grant equal to 30  of the construction cost  or 2  The owner gets a break on their federal taxes equal to  get this  100  of the cost of the project  This  Bonus tax deduction  can be used to reduce federal taxes in the year that that the project is first completed Berkshire Hathaway paid 29  taxes in 2010  This would imply that it would opt for the cash payment of 30    600MM    But BRK is actually faced with a statutory tax rate of 35   Therefore the value of the tax reduction could be as high as  700mm   Warren can engineer any income necessary to max out the tax deduction  The PPA with PGE will return all of Buffett s  2B of investment plus a return of at least 5   But when you add into the calculation that in four years Buffett gets a mega tax break the implied returns soar  I did an IRR assuming a 2015 construction completion   2b cost and a 25 year payback  It comes to a return of 15  17  pa  This is a terrific return from what is functionally an A risk This monster result is exclusively the result of the tax breaks Buffet will enjoy  In other words   you  are making Warren richer Notes As I indicated  the PPA with PGE is central to Buffett s investment  It s important to understand why PGE has stepped up to facilitate Topaz  California  and 30 other states  have passed laws that mandate that electric utilities MUST produce or acquire a percentage of their electricity from alternative sources  In California  Executive order S 14 08 mandates that 30  of all power sold in California must come from alternative sources by the years 2020  This means that PGE is in a bind  It HAS to have alternative energy or it can t grow  So PGE came into the Topaz deal desperate for a supply of power that did not come from fossil fuels  Topaz solved  in part  PGE s problems There is one technical aspect to the Buffet Topaz deal that I don t quite understand  The rules on the tax breaks rebate are very clear  Not less than 5  of construction must have been completed by 9 30 2011 in order to qualify for the subsidies  As I have indicated construction of Topaz did not commence until November  It would appear that the requirements for the subsidies has not been met  The possibility exists that the DOE agreed to allow for the subsidy and waived the 9 30 deadline  Another possibility is that the DOE gave credit toward the 5  completion by allowing for the pre construction soft costs of the project  If it is the latter  I m confused  Other projects that I m aware of did not get credit for pre construction soft costs  One additional possibility is a waiver of the completion requirements was granted  AKA  Side Deal  When the DOE money did not come through  it must have been a big blow to the White House  Topaz was a big prize for them  I wonder if Obama called his pal Buffett and asked for a  fix   Warren B  delivered  But  as usual  he charged a pound of flesh  Obama got what he wanted  He avoided another solar disaster when WB stepped in Summary  Buffett gets another sweetheart deal that makes him richer  PGE gets a long term supply of alternative energy that allows them to grow for a few more decades  First Solar gets out of a huge headache  It gets get to sell solar panels to Topaz  The citizens of California that will use this power will get nothing  They will continue to pay the highest rates for electricity in the country  The US tax payers foot the bill for another  600    700mm  That s the  Vig  for Warren  Those taxpayers also get nothing in return ,2011-12-12,Bruce

156507,378023,BRKb,America s Best Companies are Cheap   So Merry Christmas and a Prosperous New Year ,opinion,Let there be no confusion about the purpose and intent of this article   It is intended to present a positive and enthusiastic defense and a reasoned support of our great country and its economic strength and promise   There are far too many that want to criticize and denigrate our economy and the very system within which it operates   Not only do I believe we live in the greatest country on earth  I also believe that our economy is the strongest and most prolific that has ever existed   And as such  it is the most benevolent and generous provider for the population it serves than any other on earth Yes  we face economic problems from time to time  and we always have and always will   But the indomitable American spirit has met every challenge we ve ever faced  and I believe will continue to do so for a long time to come   The late great American economist Milton Friedman said it better than I  So that the record of history is absolutely crystal clear  That there is no alternative way  so far discovered  of improving the lot of the ordinary people that can hold a candle to the productive activities that are unleashed by a free enterprise system   Anyone who has followed my work knows that I have often written articles with optimistic undertones   The Positive ViewpointAlthough it s hard to find supportive and positive opinions regarding our economy and the future of the American stock market  they fortunately do exist  This past week a friend sent me an uplifting piece that was authored by a financial advisor that he respects and uses   The advisor s name is John Bodnar of Bodnar Financial Services Inc   headquartered in Florham Park  New Jersey   Here is a link to their website  for anyone who would like to learn more about John and his team  Bodnar Financial Services Inc I was so impressed with what John wrote that I asked if he would give me his permission to re publish his work in its entirety  and he enthusiastically agreed  What follows is John s piece which I offer with his permission as an uplifting Holiday Season and Prosperous New Year card to all those who may be suffering from the doom and gloom that is so pervasively and relentlessly heaped upon us   I hope and wish it provides a lift of your spirit and confidence  Can we learn from the past  The U S  economy remains almost comatose  the economy is staggering under many structural burdens  as opposed to familiar cyclical problems  The structural faults represent once in a lifetime dislocations that will take years to work out  Among them  job drought  debt hangover  the banking collapse  the real estate depression  the healthcare cost explosion  and the runaway federal deficit  The paragraph above is a series of quotes from a TIME cover story  The Economy  Is there light at the end of the tunnel   The headline and quotes sum up nicely how the masters of  the media view current events   But look closely at the cover   Can you read the ribbon in the upper left corner   It says BUSH vs  CLINTON   The date of this TIME issue was September 28  1992  The Dow Jones Industrial Average would close that day at 3276   And if you could go back in time  having ignored TIME  and invested  1000 in an account for your new born child or grandchild s future college costs  19 years hence that  1000 would be worth  3489 70  a cumulative return of 248 97    I guess there was some light at the end of that tunnel Are you as fed up with the portrayal of gloom and doom as I am   In September  I celebrated my 30th anniversary in the financial advisory business  Jeanne and Lorraine gave me a gift certificate for 10 free visits to a local psychiatrist  That s a joke   But tell the truth  for a brief moment  you thought it just might be true     Why do we sit in front of the TV at night listening to the crazies   TV was invented to provide an escape from the pain and aggravation of everyday life   Instead  it seems the more you watch  the more uptight and angry you become Fear not comrades  herewith are a handful of factoids guaranteed to put a red  white  and blue grin on your face   Let s begin with one of the golden oldies Manufacturing  I m sure you all have read newspaper articles or listen to a fair and balanced discussion on cable TV of how America is going to hell   The cry of  we don t make anything anymore    Answer me this  what country dominates in world manufacturing   And the crowd responds in unison CHINA   Wrong  The U S  continues to be  1 in manufacturing   We are still the country of innovation and high quality engineering   Don t believe it   Why would BMW establish a new plant to build the popular M6 series in Spartanburg  SC  Not only is the M6 Series made in America and exported back to Europe  but BMW recently announced that the 3 Series would also be manufactured in the USA as well  BMW is now the number one auto exporter in America  Boeing could have opened a manufacturing operation anywhere in the world  but they chose to stay in America where labor is skilled and material quality can be assured   Let China manufacture all the T shirts the world needs  but when precision and engineering are needed  nothing yet can match the USA Talking heads on radio and TV claim that the American consumer is tapped out   Now that s a real joke   Americans are going to stop spending money   Personal consumption expenditures are up in excess of 2  in 2011 over 2010  Spending was back as strongly in 2010 as before the crisis of 2008   Personal income for those employed has risen almost 10 5  since 2008   Granted  unemployment remains above 9   but can we focus on the 91  who are employed and spending money I hear rumbling from the back of the room  but what about the housing crisis   Ah yes  yet another crisis  never let one go to waste is the tagline of many a political consultant  Agreed  there will likely be a housing hangover for several years   But  there is some good news   Nearly 40  of home purchases in the last year were ALL CASH DEALS  Florida  a state with exceptionally high foreclosure rates  posted a total of 485 286 foreclosed units in 2010  The number of foreclosures through July 2011 has declined to 71 899 Housing is important  but it only represents 2 3  of Gross Domestic Product  GDP   core  3 3 billion   Yet we continue to dwell on this one piece of the overall economy   Did you know that capital spending by businesses represent 8 3  of GDP and is coming in at  1 1 trillion in 2011   Capital spending encompasses technology  display cases  store fixtures  etc  Capital spending is at an ALL TIME high in 2011  far exceeding the amount spent in 2000 for the non event known as Y2K another example of an insignificant event that managed to dominate air time Now for the crisis du jour  will the Greece debt crisis  bring the world economy to a halt   This one really needs to be put into perspective   Boys and girls  when it comes to economics  Greece hasn t really mattered since 60 B C  Greece has been in default 51  of its entire history as an independent nation   Why on earth do we act so surprised that they can t pay their obligations now  There will be a bail out  and Greece will default again  This is nothing against the wonderful people of Greece   Love the weather  love the food  where would Western civilization be without the Greeks   But I assure you  there is not a German alive who s willing to work to age 70 so the average Greek worker can retire at age 50  To put this one to rest  Greece s GDP is slightly larger than West Virginia s GDP   Come on folks  can we keep our wits about us and not fall prey to every rumor over a country the size of West Virginia And now for the grand finale  what about China   They are going to eat our lunch on the worldwide economic stage  Yes  China owns a huge pile of IOUs with a picture of Columbia holding her torch   But let s drill down a little deeper   First  over the past 20 years China has done a great job of building a  new  China along their southern coastline   Keep in mind that America  the home of innovation for the past 200 years has had to transition from telegraph to telephone to fiber optics to 3G  China didn t need to pay for those transitions  they went from NO PHONES WHATSOEVER to 3G  They are very good at implementing technology developed by other nations  They are not innovators   Infrastructure building over the past decade has been astounding  but if you venture to the interior of China  you will find many people without power  clean water  and living in dilapidated housing with minimal food to eat Here is a hard truth about China that you never hear discussed in the media   The labor force of China is peaking   RIGHT NOW   Between 2000 and 2050  China s labor force will decline by 9 8    Over this time period  the labor force in America will grow by 4 2    Place your chips on the table folks  China or the USA for the long haul Since China is one of my dear old Dad s favorite rants of late  let me just beat this horse to the ground   China represents 23  of the world s population yet has only 7  of the world s fresh water supply   In fact  much of southern China  where the development is concentrated  and India share the same water source   China is damning the water upstream from India which could eventually erupt into an ugly situation   The Great Lakes region of the US contains 21  of the world s fresh water supply   Manufacturing requires natural resources   Comparing these facts alone  I would argue that the USA will remain a dominant economic power  Not to fret Grandpa  your grandchildren and great grandchildren will have jobs and not be forced to learn Mandarin  Corporate America  has it recovered from the 2008 financial crisis   If you believe the headlines you would think that the USA is on the precipice of another great recession  or worse  a depression  Hold on tight for this one  corporate profits hit an all time high repeat ALL TIME HIGH in 2010 and are on track to exceed that number in 2011  Second quarter earnings for U S  corporations also set a record   That s right  the quarter that ended on June 30  2011 was the greatest quarter for earnings in the history of American capitalism   Where were the balloons and the parade you ask   I can t figure it out   Instead  the media tells us how the system is broken and we need fundamental change There have been ten ALL CASH corporate mergers from May 2011 through September 22  2011   These are little mergers   BHP Billiton purchased Petrohawk Energy for  12 1 billion   Get the picture  One day you will look back to the autumn of 2011 and ask yourself  how did I miss it   The signs were everywhere  1   Investors withdrew in excess of  75 billion from equity mutual funds in the four months through August   That is more than they did in the five months after the Lehman collapse in September 2008   You will probably not need to be reminded that those latter five months represented the greatest buying opportunity in a generation  and that at their nadir offered prices which will most probably never be seen again  2   Corporate insiders loading up on company stock  August 2011 insider purchases were over  681 million   So  when a director of ExxonMobil ponies up  700 000  a director at Berkshire Hathaway invests  843 300  and even the CEO of Merck spends a million and a half dollars just as the masses fall all over themselves getting out somebody is usually trying to tell us something Ready to wrap this up   Let s return to the 1992 TIME cover story   Sounds eerily like the headlines we read today   And yet  the decade of the 1990s turned out to be a boom for investors  Odd considering all the negative headwinds reported in the TIME article   I suggest we resurrect the American spirit and align ourselves with the economic realities instead of the political headlines   American businesses are doing well   They are well capitalized  sitting on loads of cash  increasing their dividends  and buying back their own stock   It is a great time to be an investor in some of the greatest companies in the world Significant market bottoms  when they finally occur  have less to do with fundamental economic and financial shifts than with crescendos of public panic  On this you can rely  the stock market remains an exceptionally efficient mechanism for the transfer of wealth from the inpatient to the patient  Pessimism Has Put Many of America s Greatest Companies On SaleAfter reading John s uplifting piece I was very taken by the last two paragraphs where he talked about two important facts   First he talked about what a great time it was to be an American investor because some of the greatest companies in the world are on sale  Then he rightfully pointed out how the stock market was an exceptionally efficient mechanism to transfer wealth from the impatient to the patient  Therefore  I began looking at valuations of some of our finest companies and was frankly startled by what I found For the past 200 years or so  the average company has historically traded at a PE ratio of approximately 15  and for the past 50 years the PE ratio of the average company has been closer to 20   The following portfolio review produced by F A S T  Graphs  lists 100 mostly above average American companies that can be bought today at PE ratios below 13   In other words  today we can buy above average companies for less than we could typically buy average companies The list is produced in alphabetical order  The first column on the list shows the current PE ratio  followed by the 15 year normal PE ratio  followed by the 15 year historical EPS growth  followed by the estimated EPS growth and finally by the dividend yield ConclusionsInvestors have been fleeing US equities at unprecedented levels   Yet  I believe there is compelling evidence that suggests that this may be the best opportunity to invest in high quality U S  common stocks that we have seen in many years  The list of 100 stocks presented in this article represents only a sampling of the many companies that are selling at valuations which are lower than their fundamentals justify   The only logical reason that I can come up with for this  is extreme pessimism As I look to 2012 and beyond  I am astounded by the opportunity to own extremely high quality profitable businesses that can be purchased at such historically low valuations  Buying low is the first  and perhaps most important and sacred principle of all investing  Although I can t say with certainty that every stock on the above list is a great long term investment  I can confidently state that you would be hard pressed to find any on the list that will not be selling at higher prices 3 to 5 years from now   More than likely there will be a few  but I doubt that there will be many   I offer my wishes for a prosperous New Year and bright long term future Disclosure   Long ABT  AFL  AVP  BBY  CVX  ENDP  EZPW  FISV  GME  HPQ  INTC  IR  ITW  JNJ  KSS  LLL  MDT  SYK

156508,378024,BRKb,On Insurance Stock Indexes,opinion,I m still toying with the idea of starting an insurance only hedge fund   I own a lot of insurers  and I think that I get the better of that market Where I have a harder time is with what to short  Shorting is tactical not structural  and I am less good at the tactical vs structural   Having a tradable benchmark to short against would be useful  but what exists there There is one ETF focused on insurance that has any significant volume   KIE   In the past  it was capitalization weighted  but now it is equal weighted   That stems from a change in the index that the ETF follows   Personally  I don t get the change  but here are my statistics on the change The  Old KBW  column comes from segmentation done by KBW   The other columns are done by me   There are some matters for judgment Do you include Berkshire Hathaway   I think you should   Do you include foreign life insurers traded on US exchanges   I think you should I am also more willing to place a company in the  Conglomerate  category because of companies that are in multiple lines of insurance  without a dominant area of insurance that they are in  or  they have significant non insurance ventures Anyway  the new KIE overstates the insurers in Bermuda and the Brokers   It understates life insurers and conglomerates Aside from that  the new S P index  being equal weighted  is more mid cap than a whole market index would be   Also  if I put more effort into this  I would segment companies into their proportions  and there we be no conglomerates These may be trivial concerns to some  but if you are thinking of running a portfolio that might be shorting KIE against other insurance longs  it makes a considerable difference ,2012-01-03,David Merkel,https://www.investing.com/analysis/on-insurance-stock-indexes-110188,110188
156509,378025,BRKb,Stocks Versus Bonds,opinion,That the world s a risky place has not escaped the recent attention of investors  The potential demise of the European single currency and perhaps with it European banks and the European project itself looms large over every investment decision  and has for many months  Economic slowdown in China  the uncertain consequences of the Arab Spring and more recently Iran s nuclear ambitions all add to the global uncertainty  Within the U S  a highly partisan Congress has led to legislative gridlock and no certainty about long term fiscal policy  It makes you wonder how investors get out of bed in the morning  And when they do  they are confronted with a choice of risky assets  such as equities  which may lose value immediately  or less risky assets  such as bonds  which will lose real value with certainty  That investors are choosing the certainty of lost purchasing power over the available alternatives reflects the seemingly poor choices on offer  Thus is the equity risk premium  the difference between the earnings yield  inverse of the P E ratio  on the S P500 and the ten year U S  treasury yield  at its widest since 1974  a year that closed with the Dow Jones Industrial Average having dropped 45  from its peak only eighteen months earlier  and inflation at 12 3  Start with bonds  Today s ten year treasury yield of around 2  assures even the tax exempt hold to maturity investor of a loss in purchasing power if inflation over ten years exceeds 2   The taxable investor of course will fare even worse  Even a portfolio of blue chip corporate bonds yielding around 4  will struggle to overcome the twin headwinds of taxes and inflation  But bonds have a big thing going for them  which is momentum  For those who draw comfort from investing with a tailwind  bonds are a warm and cozy place  The Dow Jones Corporate Bond Index has returned 10  per annum for the past three years including 8 5  in the most recent one   Who s to say that this won t continue  And of course it may  although such forecasts will struggle mightily to overcome the Math  for bonds to return more than their current yield  their yields need to fall causing prices to rise  Corporate bond yields could drop from 4  to 3   although such would presumably require a similar drop in treasury yields  to 1   The world in which 1  ten year treasuries draws buyers is unlikely to be a friendly one for corporate credit  and at such a time credit spreads might be substantially wider  depressing the prices of corporate bonds  So  much as bonds investors might draw comfort from looking backwards  their best plausible outcome is that they ll earn the current yield and suffer a steady depreciation in the real value of their assets In fact  relative pricing between stocks and bonds is such that  20 invested in the S P500 yielding 2  will  assuming 4  dividend growth  and the 50 year average is 5   generate the same increase in after tax wealth as  100 in ten year treasuries  This assumes the  80 not invested in stocks earns 0  by sitting in cash  although holding cash provides the option to do something with it that might well earn a return later on  The Math works for corporate bonds as well  just change the  20 in stocks to  40  So bonds have been good  but past performance is highly unlikely to be repeated  In fact  we believe there s a strong case to be made for all investors to reduce their asset allocation to fixed income  Government policy is to maintain ruinously low interest rates while debtors rebuild their balance sheets  The Federal government is effecting a transfer of real wealth from investors to borrowers  This policy is likely to continue for quite a long time  not least because it s popular  with those voters who contemplate such things   There are many more debtors than creditors  and regardless of how independent you think the Federal Reserve is  monetary policy is unambiguously populist  designed for the masses  The appropriate response is to allow the government s voracious appetite free rein  If Chairman Bernanke likes bonds that much he can have the lot As a result  identifying alternatives sources of investment income is a task that consumes much energy on a daily basis at SL Advisors The stock market offers a risk to suit every taste  For those who like to wake without first worrying whether their holdings are solvent  many reasonably priced large cap companies with low levels of debt and a history of steady earnings growth are available  Kraft  KFT   Microsoft  MSFT  and Berkshire Hathaway  BRK A  are all examples in our Deep Value Equity Strategy  along with less well known names such as Corrections Corp  CXW  and Republic Services Group  RSG   Domestic energy exposure adds volatility and return potential through Devon Energy  DVN  and Comstock Resources  CRK   The former bond investor can allocate his new funds to a combination of stocks and cash  depending on risk appetite   or to other income generating strategies There are even examples of stocks whose dividend yield exceeds that on their own bonds   not because their fortunes have suffered and a high dividend yield reflects expectations of a cut  but because price insensitive bond investors have driven bond yields low in their flight from equities  Johnson and Johnson  JNJ  is one such example  Our Dividend Capture Strategy consists of a diversified portfolio of such names combined with a hedge to eliminate most of the daily market moves  The result is a portfolio exposed to dividend paying stocks and dividend growth that is hedged against excessive moves in stocks Master Limited Partnerships  MLPs  are another attractive asset class for taxable investors tolerant of K 1s  I won t repeat here the well worn arguments that are familiar to regular readers  except to note that the sector s unique structure renders it worth having in many income seeking portfolios  MLPs offer tax deferred distribution yields of 5 6  combined with growth expectations of 4 6   suggesting a total return potential of 9 12  with no change in earnings multiples  ,2012-01-04,Simon
