199182,420698,NVDA,NVIDIA Officially Launches Game Streaming Service GeForce Now,news,"Computer hardware company NVIDIA  NASDAQ NVDA  has officially launched its long awaited GeForce Now  bringing the power of high end graphics processors to devices that may lack graphics cards altogether  The end result is an impressive video gaming experience on devices like the iPhone  Android smartphones  and laptops built largely without gamers in mind 
Built to be better
GeForce Now spent roughly two years in beta testing  even as rivals Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL   NASDAQ GOOG  and Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT  launched competing services called Stadia and a beta test of xCloud  respectively  to perfect GeForce Now s underlying technologies  Gamers may ultimately decide it was worth the wait  however  for two reasons 

Chief among them is the concurrent development of the interface with hardware strategically located at data centers  NVIDIA already makes graphics cards found within personal computers  as well as hardware for data centers  Extracting remote performance played into the company s core competency 
The second reason NVIDIA may be able to edge out similar services like xCloud and Stadia is the selection of titles game players will be able to access  Not only can games be purchased through the new app  but gamers will be able to access cloud based games they already own through platforms like Steam or Battle net 
Competitively priced
GeForce Now is presently offered at two price points  the lower of which is free  but with restrictions  The higher priced one costs  4 99 per month  offering unfettered access to Nvidia s data centers that handle the computing load  Even so  NVIDIA says that monthly fee will rise at some point  For comparison  Google s Stadia costs gamers  9 99 per month  although a free version is in the works 
While the definition of  cloud gaming  remains relatively loose as the area expands  Mordor Intelligence says the market was worth  1 15 billion last year ",2020-02-04,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pr2w3,2076127
199183,420699,NVDA,Should You Buy NVIDIA Stock At Its Current Valuation ,news,"NVIDIA  NASDAQ NVDA  stock has regained its mojo of late  gaining nearly 50  in the past six months thanks to a turnaround in its gaming and data center businesses  The graphics specialist gets nearly 80  of its revenue from the two segments  so improving business prospects in these businesses have encouraged investors to buy more shares 
But the problem is that NVIDIA s recent rally has made the stock expensive  The stock is now trading at a rich price to earnings  P E  multiple of 63  This is much higher than the stock s five year average P E ratio of 38 

NVDA Revenue  TTM  data by YCharts
At the same time  the company s recent quarterly results have not been up to the mark  Its top and bottom lines shrank last quarter and the outlook was lighter than anticipated  making NVIDIA stock overvalued at current levels  So  does this mean that investors shouldn t buy NVIDIA stock anymore  Let s find out 
Taking a deeper look at NVIDIA s performance
Though NVIDIA s top and bottom lines have been heading south over the past few quarters  things are about to change for the better  The company s outlook for the current quarter might have been lighter than expectations  but it would mark a return to growth 
NVIDIA expects  2 95 billion in revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020  which would be a 34  improvement over the prior year period s top line of  2 2 billion  The chipmaker credits this impressive top line growth to strong demand in its gaming and data center businesses  Both these segments delivered impressive sequential growth last quarter  and they look good for more thanks to NVIDIA s product development moves and the end market opportunities 
The gaming business  for instance  is witnessing a nice turnaround  NVIDIA gained five percentage points of market share on a sequential basis in the third quarter of 2019 in the discrete GPU  graphics processing unit  market  according to Jon Peddie Research 

The impressive thing to note here is that NVIDIA s market share increased despite the launch of new graphics cards by archrival Advanced Micro Devices  NVIDIA held nearly 73  of the discrete graphics card market at the end of the third quarter  and it could continue to dominate this space thanks to its next gen cards 
Taipei Times reported last month that NVIDIA s next generation GPUs based on the 7 nanometer  nm  manufacturing process could deliver a 50  jump in graphics performance while reducing power consumption by half  Such a product line could put NVIDIA in a great position to take advantage of the fast growing gaming laptop market 
Gaming laptops are generally more power hungry when compared to regular computers  as they require more computing power to run games  which takes a toll on battery life  If NVIDIA comes out with graphics cards that are capable of reducing power consumption and boosting computing power simultaneously  it could become the go to supplier for gaming laptop OEMs  original equipment manufacturers  
Third party research predicts that the gaming laptop market could clock an annual growth rate of 22  through 2023  The good part is that NVIDIA is already making waves in this market  Gaming laptops were a crucial growth driver for NVIDIA in the third quarter  with the company s partners launching over 130 such models 
So it won t be surprising to see gaming laptops push NVIDIA s gaming business higher this year 
NVIDIA s data center growth could take off
NVIDIA s data center business hit a purple patch last quarter thanks to the increasing demand for artificial intelligence  AI  applications in the cloud  Its data center revenue increased by almost 11  sequentially  and more improvements could be in the cards for a couple of reasons 
First  the hyperscale data center market is expected to clock an attractive compound annual growth rate of 24  through 2024 as per third party estimates  NVIDIA is already benefiting from this fast growth  as shipments of its Tesla GPUs  which are used in data centers  hit a record in the third quarter 
The second reason why NVIDIA s data center revenue could keep growing is that the company is now reportedly taking steps to consolidate its place in the hyperscale data center market  The Next Platform reports that a supercomputer at Indiana University fitted with the next generation of Tesla GPUs is expected to deliver a 70  to 75  improvement in performance 
This is a positive sign of things to come  as more powerful data center GPUs from NVIDIA should help it stay ahead of the curve in the industry and pave the way for long term growth 
NVIDIA s valuation should not be an issue
Given that NVIDIA s two major businesses appear to have bright prospects  the stock s current valuation shouldn t be in the way for anyone looking to buy the stock  We have already seen that NVIDIA is expected to deliver impressive revenue growth this quarter  and the more important thing is that the chipmaker is expected to sustain that momentum 
The company s revenue in the current fiscal year  which has just begun  is expected to jump over 19   according to analyst estimates compiled by Yahoo  Finance  The company s earnings are expected to jump from  5 57 per share in the recently concluded fiscal year to  7 26 per share in the current one  This is why the stock s forward P E ratio of 33 looks more reasonable  and investors looking for a potential growth stock should keep NVIDIA on their radar ",2020-02-06,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pr-h2,2077999
199184,420700,NVDA,NVIDIA s New Cloud Service Could Spell Doom for Google s Stadia,news,"NVIDIA  NASDAQ NVDA  recently ended a three year public beta test for its cloud gaming platform GeForce NOW and formally launched the service for PCs  Macs  Android devices  and SHIELD devices  NVIDIA hosts the games on servers with its high end RTX GPUs  and offers it in free and premium tiers 
The free tier offers an unlimited number of one hour play sessions  After the session expires  gamers need to queue up and wait for the next available session  The paid  Founders  tier costs  4 99 per month and offers on demand streaming without wait times or time limits  The first three months are free 
NVIDIA claims that over 300 000 beta testers streamed more than 70 million hours of gameplay in 30 countries in North America and Europe over the past three years  It also noted that 80  of players  instantly upgraded from systems without GeForce GPUs to the latest PC graphics  via its cloud service 
At first glance  GeForce NOW might just seem like another competitor for Alphabet s  NASDAQ GOOG   NASDAQ GOOGL  Google Stadia  which struggled with with tech issues  a dearth of compelling games  and a confusing business model after its launch last November  But if we take a closer look at GeForce NOW  we ll realize that this new service could spell doom for Google s nascent gaming service 

NVIDIA targets Google s biggest weaknesses
When Google announced Stadia last year  many gamers expected it to mimic Netflix by offering unlimited access to a library of games for a monthly fee 
Yet Google doused those hopes and revealed that Stadia was merely a cloud based locker for purchased games  To play games on Stadia  gamers need to purchase games from its store    even if they previously bought the game from other digital storefronts like Valve s Steam  Ubisoft s Uplay  and Electronic Arts  Origin 
NVIDIA s GeForce Now  however  links with all those major DRM platforms and allows players to stream the games they already own without an additional purchase 
NVIDIA is already letting users stream their own games on the free tier now  while Google currently only offers its paid  Pro  tier for  9 99 per month  In a recent interview with Protocol  Google executive Phil Harrison declared that Stadia s free tier would launch  within the next few months  

GeForce NOW also offers over 30 free to play games for both tiers  as well as support for  hundreds  of purchased titles from over 50 publishers 
Stadia Pro launched with 22 games and currently supports just over 40 titles  but each game needs to be purchased  Google lets Pro subscribers play five of its games without an additional purchase  but its upcoming free tier won t offer any access to those free to play titles 
In short  GeForce NOW s business model is more straightforward and appealing than Stadia s  Gamers can test out the service for free with free to play games or games they already own  then upgrade if they want to play those games for extended sessions  It also costs half as much as Stadia s service and runs more games 
GeForce NOW will weaken Stadia  xCloud could kill it
NVIDIA tested out GeForce NOW for three years before its formal launch  but Google only seemed to test Stadia    formerly known as  Project Stream     for about a year before launching the paid version 
Google s initial vision of Stadia  which teased deep integration with YouTube and the ability to join a live streamed game  has yet to materialize  Its sporadic updates about the platform  the slow trickle of exclusive titles  and the lack of enthusiasm from publishers    which seemed eager to support GeForce NOW    all indicate that Stadia was a half baked project 
To make matters worse  Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT  plans to launch its own cloud gaming platform  xCloud  later this year  It will likely bundle xCloud with its Xbox Live and Game Pass subscription services  which could gain plenty of gamers as it launches the Xbox Series X over the holidays  Simply put  NVIDIA could weaken Stadia with GeForce NOW  and Microsoft s xCloud could pull away even more gamers 
Would Stadia s decline hurt Google 
Google still generates most of its revenue from ads  so Stadia s success or failure won t impact its near term growth  But if Stadia fails  it will mark a missed opportunity for Google to leverage YouTube  Chromecast  and its Google Play gaming ecosystem to create a next gen gaming platform that isn t tethered to a single hardware device 
Meanwhile  NVIDIA seems to clearly understand what publishers and gamers want from a cloud gaming service  It s still too early to tell if it will succeed  but I suspect that it will steal Stadia s thunder over the next few months ",2020-02-07,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/psg2m,2079105
199185,420701,NVDA,Amazon pulls out of major Barcelona telecoms conference over coronavirus,news,"BERLIN MADRID  Reuters    Amazon com Inc  O AMZN  has pulled out of this month s Mobile World Congress because of the coronavirus outbreak  in another blow to one of the telecom industry s biggest gatherings which attracts over 100 000 visitors to Barcelona 
 Due to the outbreak and continued concerns about the new coronavirus  Amazon will withdraw from exhibiting and participating in Mobile World Congress 2020   the company said in a statement on Sunday 
Amazon had planned a significant presence through its cloud computing arm AWS  which was due to host a full day conference track on the first day of the event 
The online retailer is the fourth company to pull out of the annual gathering this week  following South Korea s LG Electronics  KS 066570   Swedish equipment maker Ericsson  ST ERICb  and U S  chipmaker Nvidia  O NVDA  
The Feb  24 27 event will go ahead as planned  the GSMA telecoms industry association  which runs the Congress  confirmed in a statement on Sunday before Amazon said it was pulling out  adding that they would tighten health precautions to guard against the coronavirus outbreak 
No visitors will be allowed to attend from China s Hubei province  where the coronavirus outbreak started  while visitors from China must prove they have been outside the country for two weeks prior to the event  GSMA said

199207,420723,NVDA,Will Qualcomm Overtake NVIDIA in Driverless Cars ,news,"Qualcomm  NASDAQ QCOM   the top mobile chipmaker in the world  generates most of its revenue from the smartphone market  But it s also been diversifying into new markets  and connected cars are a top priority 
Qualcomm s Snapdragon Automotive modems link cars to 4G and 5G networks  and its Snapdragon Automotive Platforms bundle those modems with a CPU  Bluetooth  Wi Fi  USB  GPS  and audio connections to support infotainment and navigation systems 
Qualcomm s Snapdragon Ride platform is a new advanced driver assistance system  ADAS   which enables autonomous driving  Its Snapdragon Digital Cockpit platform controls digital dashboard displays and rear seat entertainment systems  and its new Cloud to Car platform links those systems to 4G 5G networks for over the air updates 
All these products indicate that Qualcomm wants a piece of the growing driverless vehicle market  But can it catch up to NVIDIA  NASDAQ NVDA   which has a head start in the nascent industry 

Why does NVIDIA have a head start 
NVIDIA s Tegra chips originally competed against Qualcomm s Snapdragon chips in the smartphone market  but Qualcomm eventually conquered the market 
NVIDIA abandoned smartphones  but it didn t abandon Tegra  It pivoted the ARM based chipset toward high end automakers instead  which convinced Audi  its subsidiary Lamborghini  and Tesla Motors to install Tegra powered infotainment and navigation systems in select vehicles in 2012 
That foothold led to NVIDIA s launch of Drive  a computer platform for autonomous cars  in 2015  It unveiled the third generation of the platform  Drive PX Pegasus  for Level 5  fully autonomous  vehicles in 2017  NVIDIA also relies on the strength of its GPUs  which process AI tasks faster than stand alone CPUs  to power those platforms 
Today  a growing list of companies    including Ford  Toyota  Daimer s Mercedes Benz  and Baidu    have partnered with NVIDIA across various self driving projects  NVIDIA s automotive revenue accounted for 5  of its top line last quarter 
Can Qualcomm catch up to NVIDIA 
Qualcomm launched its first line of Snapdragon Automotive chipsets in early 2016  It tried to buy NXP Semiconductors  the world s largest automotive chipmaker  later that year  but the deal ultimately collapsed two years later 

Nonetheless  Qualcomm remained invested in the market with new chipsets and automotive platforms  Qualcomm s baseband modem business  the largest in the world  also gave it a valuable edge against NVIDIA  since it could bundle its modems with its CPUs in single system on chips  SoCs  to offer constant cellular connectivity  Automakers who used NVIDIA s Tegra CPUs needed to purchase separate baseband modems 
In other words  Qualcomm could employ the same strategies it used in smartphones to challenge NVIDIA in the automotive market  Qualcomm s list of automotive partners is also growing and includes NVIDIA partners like Ford and Audi  Ford and Audi seem particularly interested in Qualcomm s cellular vehicle to everything  C V2X  technology  which keeps cars constantly connected to wireless networks 
Qualcomm hasn t formally launched a Level 5 autonomous platform like NVIDIA yet  However  it claims that Snapdragon Ride  which offers Level 2   semi autonomous  driving at lower power levels  can scale up to Level 4 and 5 at higher power levels 
Should NVIDIA be worried 
NVIDIA s automotive revenue dipped 6  annually last quarter  During the conference call  CFO Colette Kress blamed the decline on the  roll off  of legacy infotainment revenue and  general industry weakness   but noted that the company s AI cockpit business    which is similar to Qualcomm s cockpit platform    grew as Daimler deployed more AI based infotainment systems into its Mercedes Benz vehicles 
Kress also declared that NVIDIA s Drive remained  the industry s leading end to end platform that enables customers to develop  test  and safely operate autonomous vehicles ranging from cars and trucks to shuttles and robotaxis  
Kress noted that about half of NVIDIA s automotive revenue still comes from older stand alone infotainment systems  and that those systems were being gradually replaced by new cockpit bundles  That ongoing shift  not competition from Qualcomm or other challengers  seems to be the main headwind for its automotive business 
The road ahead
The driverless market is still small  so there could be plenty of room for Qualcomm  NVIDIA  and other players to grow without trampling each other  Qualcomm s baseband modems give its platforms built in cellular connectivity  but NVIDIA s Drive platforms process their surroundings with powerful high end GPUs 
Therefore  Qualcomm and NVIDIA may be launching overlapping platforms in the hopes of dominating driverless cars with end to end solutions  but automakers might prefer using combinations of technologies from both chipmakers  along with other companies 
In short  Qualcomm won t overtake NVIDIA in driverless cars any time soon  but it doesn t need to  It just needs to keep pace with new chips and platforms  which could eventually diversify its core business away from mobile devices ",2020-01-15,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pib4w,2059893

199223,420739,NVDA,Why NVIDIA Stock Soared 76  in 2019,news,"What happened
NVIDIA  NASDAQ NVDA  stock skyrocketed 76 3  last year  according to data from S P Global Market Intelligence  Including dividends  the graphics processing unit  GPU  specialist and artificial intelligence  AI  leader returned 76 9   For context  the S P 500 returned 31 5  in 2019 
This tech stock has made a commendable comeback after losing about half of its value in the last quarter of 2018  The reasons for the market s ire were the company s struggles in its gaming business due to the cryptocurrency bust and slowing growth in its data center platform  As of Jan  7  NVIDIA stock is just 17  off its all time closing high  set on Oct  1  2018  

So what
We can attribute NVIDIA stock s powerful performance in 2019 to the company s improving financial performance in its most recent two quarters  While year over year revenue and earnings have declined in the last four quarters due to the previously noted issues  they have improved sequentially in the fiscal second and third quarters  
In the third quarter  reported in mid November  NVIDIA s revenue slipped 5  year over year to  3 01 billion and earnings per share  EPS   adjusted for one time items  edged down 3  to  1 78  In the second quarter  revenue and adjusted EPS fell 17  and 36   respectively 
Now what
Investors don t have that long to wait for material news  as NVIDIA should be reporting its fourth quarter and full year results for fiscal 2020 in mid February 
Wall Street expects NVIDIA to resume growth on its top and bottom lines in the fourth quarter  Analysts are looking for adjusted EPS of  1 66 on revenue of  2 96 billion  representing growth of 108  and 34   respectively  year over year ",2020-01-08,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pff1q,2054933
199224,420740,NVDA,Can NVIDIA Turbocharge Its Automotive Growth With This Move ,news,"NVIDIA  NASDAQ NVDA  moved into the self driving car market years ago and racked up an impressive list of partners and clients  making it a top tech stock for the future  But even after all these years  the graphics specialist has failed to make the most of the opportunity in autonomous cars  as the broader market has failed to take off as anticipated  Not surprisingly  NVIDIA s automotive business has huffed and puffed as the company has been forced into a change of strategy to attack the autonomous car market 
And now  it seems that NVIDIA is taking things a step further  The chipmaker made a couple of big announcements at CES 2020 that reaffirm its commitment toward autonomous vehicles and have the potential to supercharge its automotive business in the long run  Let s see why 

NVIDIA wants to be the enabler of autonomous cars
NVIDIA has altered its strategy since it first entered the self driving car space  From selling just chips to the likes of Tesla  the graphics specialist is now focused on providing end to end solutions to automakers and component suppliers 
This is why the company s announcement this week at CES that it is opening up its end to end autonomous driving platform  DRIVE AV  to developers to accelerate the development of self driving cars is a big deal  Transport industry participants will be able to access pre trained deep neural networks  DNNs  on DRIVE AV as well as artificial intelligence  AI  training processes available on the NVIDIA GPU Cloud  NGC  container registry 
So  how is this going to help NVIDIA make a mark in the self driving car market  The answer seems quite simple at first  NVIDIA could become the go to company for anyone looking to develop autonomous cars  That s because NVIDIA s DRIVE AV platform will give developers access to all the technology they need to step up autonomous car development 
For instance  anyone looking to accelerate the development of self driving cars can utilize NVIDIA s data center infrastructure and pre trained artificial intelligence models  NVIDIA is also providing an onboard computer that can be fitted into the vehicle to carry out the complex calculations that are necessary for the operation of autonomous cars 
NVIDIA claims that OEMs  original equipment manufacturers  can modify the AI models according to their needs  This is a smart move as automakers now have a ready reckoner in the form of NVIDIA s platform if they are looking to speed up autonomous car development 
After all  the graphics specialist now has years of experience in this field and even allows automakers to virtually test their autonomous vehicles in real world like environments for billions of miles  So  NVIDIA is now offering what seems like a truly end to end system  It should help OEMs extensively test autonomous cars before they hit the roads while making them smarter in tackling real world situations thanks to a huge repository of AI models shared by various customers in NVIDIA s cloud 
Don t expect quick returns  however
NVIDIA has made a bold move to attract more automotive partners and increase its chances of capitalizing on the trend of autonomous cars  But investors shouldn t expect any quick returns out of such a move as NVIDIA has been boasting of a large lineup of partners for a long time now 
In fact  NVIDIA had earlier claimed that it has more than 370 partners using its platform to develop self driving cars  That hasn t led to outsized growth in the company s automotive business despite its small base  In the third quarter of fiscal 2020  NVIDIA s auto business generated  162 million in revenue and accounted for just over 5  of the overall revenue 
Growth has been slow and erratic  and automotive revenue saw a sharp drop last quarter 

At the same time  experts warn that it would be a long time before we get to see autonomous cars hit prime time  even though investments in the field have gone up rapidly  A third party report estimates that investments in autonomous vehicles shot up to  60 billion in 2018 from  6 billion in 2015  But as developers ran into challenges that autonomous cars could face in real world scenarios  deployment timelines were pushed back 
Edwin Olson  the CEO of May Mobility    an autonomous driving start up that recently raised an investment from Toyota    estimates that it could take 16 years before self driving cars become as good as humans 
So  assuming that NVIDIA s announcements at CES can drastically improve its automotive revenue won t be prudent  Instead  opening up its platform could help NVIDIA speed up the development of self driving cars and encourage their mainstream adoption    which is when investors can expect the company s automotive business to hit the jackpot ",2020-01-09,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pfw9p,2055869
199225,420741,NVDA,AMD s RX 5600 XT Goes After NVIDIA Below  300,news,"Advanced Micro Devices  NASDAQ AMD  did something last year that it hadn t done in years  It launched a graphics card that beat rival NVIDIA  NASDAQ NVDA  on performance at the same price point  AMD s RX 5700 series  which includes the  349 RX 5700 and the  399 RX 5700 XT  was the most consequential graphics launch from AMD in a very long time 
The company further filled out its lineup by launching the low end RX 5500 XT toward the end of 2019  The graphics card came in two flavors  one with 4GB of graphics memory for  169  and another with 8GB for  199  The two versions are in competition with NVIDIA s GTX 1650 Super and GTX 1660  respectively 
With the RX 5500XT a full  150 cheaper than the RX 5700  gamers looking for something in between had no option but to turn to NVIDIA  which offers two graphics cards between  200 and  300  AMD fixed the situation at CES in Las Vegas this week  announcing the new RX 5600 series 

Filling the gap
The RX 5600 series includes two new cards  the RX 5600 and the RX 5600 XT  The RX 5600 will only be available in preconfigured desktop systems  but the RX 5600 XT will be sold through AMD s usual board partners 
The RX 5600 XT  which features 6 GB of graphics memory  will be priced at  279 when it becomes available on Jan  21  At that price point  it slides right into the middle of AMD s current generation product stack  giving gamers looking for a midrange graphics card a viable option 
The direct competitor for this new card will be NVIDIA s GTX 1660 Ti  which is also currently priced at  279  While third party testing will determine how competitive the RX 5600 XT really is  AMD claims that the card handily beats the GTX 1660 Ti on performance  According to AMD s testing  the RX 5600 XT was up to 20  faster in popular AAA PC games  and up to 10  faster in popular esports games 
If those results are accurate  the RX 5600 XT appears to be another instance of AMD leapfrogging NVIDIA  To be fair  the GTX 1660 Ti has been available for nearly a year  and in the wake of AMD s announcement  NVIDIA could certainly adjust its pricing to eliminate any advantage for AMD  But being on the defensive is not something that NVIDIA has experienced much of in the past few years 
Still absent at the high end
With the launch of the RX 5600 XT  AMD will be competitive at prices up to  399  Beyond that  NVIDIA still reigns supreme  For gamers looking for graphics cards that can handle the latest games at 4K resolutions  NVIDIA is effectively the only game in town 
This situation will eventually change  since AMD is certain to launch a more powerful graphics card based on its Navi architecture sooner or later  But that announcement didn t come during CES  and it s unclear when such a product will launch  If AMD waits too long  NVIDIA will have launched its next generation Ampere graphics cards  which will be built on a 7nm manufacturing process and will likely bring substantial performance improvements  Ampere is expected to launch sometime in 2020 
After years of trying and failing to catch up with NVIDIA  AMD finally found success with its RX 5000 series graphics cards  The RX 5600 XT will give gamers an alternative to NVIDIA at another price point  and it should help AMD pick up more market share from the market leader ",2020-01-09,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pfxd7,2055961

RBC analyst Joseph Moore upgraded his rating on NVIDIA  NASDAQ NVDA  to overweight from equal weight and increased his price target to  259 from  217  sending shares of chipmaker more than 4  higher 
Nvidia is well position for growth in 2020  led by a return to solid growth in both key segments  gaming and datacenter  both of which have underperformed for the year amid tough semiconductor environment  added Moore 
Powered by ray tracing software  which boosts computer graphics performance  Nvidia s RTX graphics cards  should generate more gamer enthusiasm in gaming products  and new data center workloads around conversational AI   leading to  further data center growth   the Wall Street bank said 
RBC has not always been Nvidia s biggest fan over worries that the chipmaker s short term fundamentals could not back up its lofty valuation  as shares have surged by about 65  for the year 
 The stock is expensive on near term earnings  and we have held back as we thought that January quarter consensus was overly optimistic  which it did prove to be   but obviously that didn t give us the pullback entry point that we had hoped for  we see upside from here   RBC said   All semiconductor stocks are at a premium multiple on 2020 earnings  but across the group we see Nvidia as having one of the best opportunities to maintain a high multiple as we shift to 2021  ",2019-11-25,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/stockbeat-nvidia-surges-on-upgrade-as-rbc-touts-solid-growth-2027641,2027641

199442,420958,NVDA,Nvidia Q4 Earnings Preview  Will NVDA Stock Continue To Soar ,opinion,"Nvidia   NASDAQ NVDA   shares have surged 60  in the last six months to crush the semiconductor market s 30  average  The GPU powerhouse has gone on this run despite the fact that its sales have fallen in the trailing four quarters  as Wall Street and analysts see a turn around on the horizon 
Now investors need to understand if Nvidia stock looks poised to continue its climb  with the chip company set to report its fourth quarter fiscal 2020 results on Thursday  February 13 
NVDA Overview
Nvidia is a GPU firm that will continue to play its part in the ever growing global gaming industry that is  to expand from  151 billion in 2019 to  196 billion by 2022  Gaming accounted for 55  of NVDA s Q3 sales 
The company has also diversified its portfolio  with its data center unit making up 24  of revenue last quarter   We extended our reach beyond the cloud  to the edge  where GPU accelerated 5G  AI and IoT will revolutionize the world s largest industries   CEO Jensen Huang said in prepared Q3 remarks   We see strong data center growth ahead  driven by the rise of conversational AI and inference  
Even though the company has expanded its reach in recent years  NVDA couldn t escape the industry wide downturn in 2019  Nvidia s revenue is down roughly 15  in the trailing 12 months  with quarterly sales down in four straight quarters 
With that said  the declines come against hard to compare periods of outsized expansion  And NVDA s sales dipped only 5  last quarter  compared to 31  in Q1 2020 
Investors should also note that Nvidia announced last March that is would acquire Mellanox   NASDAQ MLNX   for  6 9 billion  The deal  which will be by far its largest  aims to improve its position in the cloud computing market  However  the acquisition still awaits more regulatory approvals and NVDA executives last said they believe the  closing will likely occur in the early part of calendar 2020  
 
 
 
 
Other Fundamentals
Given the historically cyclical nature of the semiconductor market  it s poised for a comeback and it looks set to help fuel the continued technological revolution for the foreseeable future  Recent quarterly results from industry powers Samsung   OTC SSNLF    Intel   NASDAQ INTC    and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co    NYSE TSM    which included improved outlooks  are also promising 
The semiconductor market is coming off one of its worst years since the early 2000s  with overall sales down 12  in 2019  according to the Semiconductor Industry Association  Despite the decline  semiconductor stocks thrived last year  driven by the likes of AMD   NASDAQ AMD   and other high flyers 
The divergence between price movement and performance can be attributed to the combination of a 2018 chip selloff that devalued stocks and Wall Street s expectations for a return to growth 
The nearby chart shows just how far NVDA stock fell in the last quarter of 2018  Since the end of 2018  shares of Nvidia have soared roughly 100  to outpace its industry s 63  average climb and the S P 500 s 41   Despite the climb  NVDA stock still have roughly 10  more room to run before it hits pre 2018 selloff highs of around  281 a share 
 
 
 
 
Outlook 
Our Zacks estimates call for the company s adjusted Q4 FY20 earnings to skyrocket 108  from the year ago period to  1 66 per share  This bottom line expansion is expected to be helped along by 34 2  revenue growth that would see it hit  2 96 billion 
The company s fiscal year sales and earnings are still expected to slip  but the comeback appears to be on  with Q1 2021 s EPS figure projected to jump 72  on 28  revenue growth 
Then  Nvidia s adjusted full year fiscal 2021 earnings are projected to jump 30 5  on 19 4  higher sales that would see it reach  12 86 billion which would easily top 2019 s  11 71 billion 
Bottom Line
Nvidia has a strong history of quarterly earnings beats  which includes outpacing our bottom line estimates by an average of 9  over the trailing four periods  NVDA is currently a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   given its lack of recent earnings revisions 
Nvidia stock might keep on climbing following its Q4 earnings release if its guidance is able to impress investors  However  post earnings drops are always in the cards 
In the end  even if Nvidia underwhelms  the stock appears ready to run over the long haul

199443,420959,NVDA,Powell Steps Up Tomorrow  Coronavirus At Podium As Cautious Air Continues,opinion," Monday Market Open  And the award goes to  Fed Chairman Jerome Powell  who steps onto stage tomorrow to face two days in front of congressional committees  He doesn t get a little statue for that  but anyone who can get through it without losing composure arguably deserves some recognition 
Powell s walk on the Capitol s red carpet is a semi annual occurrence that can sometimes give investors a little insight into what the Fed is thinking  You never know which direction things might go with this kind of event  because it depends partly on what sort of questions he gets from committee members  
Though Powell s testimony and a packed earnings schedule normally would be enough highlights for any week  the biggest focus remains coronavirus  It s the overhang of every conversation  kind of like tariffs were last year  There are a lot of parallels  especially that they re both unknowns and no one is sure if or when they ll end  Every conversation from companies seems to end with   We re going to do this   unless of course the impact of coronavirus gets worse  
At this point  it feels like we re in a watchful waiting period  with people feeling hesitant to jump back in but also not too eager to unload shares as things remain up in the air  Volatility climbed a bit this morning while crude and 10 year yields stayed under pressure amid anxiety about the Chinese economy and the virus impact  
There s some potential deal making in the news today as Xerox  NYSE XRX  raised its takeover bid for HP  NYSE HPQ  to  24 from  22 in a mixed cash stock offer  We talk so much about flashy newer Technology stocks  but here are a couple of old schoolers getting some attention  We ll see where it goes 
The other thing that deserves attention this week is earnings season  There s a ton of earnings coming at us  though many of them are secondary names and not the sexier ones  That said  some of them are going to be pretty important to watch  including Cisco  NASDAQ CSCO   UnderArmour  NYSE UAA   Nvidia  NASDAQ NVDA   PepsiCo  NASDAQ PEP   Kraft Heinz  NASDAQ KHC    Alibaba   NYSE BABA    Lyft   NASDAQ LYFT  and  Roku   NASDAQ ROKU  
Inflation and retail sales data later this week also are probably going to get a close look from investors 
Profit Taking Could Return As Virus Concerns LingerProfit taking hit the market again last Friday  and that might be something to keep in mind later this week as we approach the long holiday weekend  Markets are closed for President s Day a week from today Anxiety levels remain elevated around coronavirus  as anyone who s glanced at 10 year yields or the Cboe Volatility Index  VIX  lately probably knows  One way people tend to deal with anxiety is selling some stocks and going away before a weekend  especially when it s unclear what sort of virus news might scare investors when markets are closed  The weekend is still far away  so perhaps things could change if the virus situation improves Selling mainly hit the cyclical sectors last Friday including Information Technology as Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  reportedly extended the closure of some of its China stores through Feb  15  Meanwhile  defensive sectors like Consumer Staples and Utilities outperformed  Briefing com pointed out Bonds also rallied  pushing the 10 year yield back below 1 6   where it remains this morning  The VIX starts the week at 16  which is elevated relative to last month s lows near 12 but isn t historically high by any stretch of the imagination  And if you re looking for more evidence of an uptick in caution  crude oil futures  CL  dipped below the psychologically significant  50 a barrel level in the early hours Monday  Virus Still A Weight  But Fed Sounds Optimistic NoteFor now  the virus is probably the main thing that could derail the market  Anyone thinking about making trades should consider a day to day game plan at least for the next couple of weeks  because things could move sharply based on virus news on any given day  If we don t have any major outbreaks in the next two weeks or so  investors might come to believe that all is clear and worry about something else  However  there s no guarantee the situation won t last longer 
One sector that could feel the virus bearing down is Consumer Discretionary  but not necessarily every big company there  The ones that did a better job the last few years expanding and refining their online business might handle any virus related disruptions better  putting some leaders in a big lead and laggards in a bigger lag  In other words  the gap we re already seeing in the sector could continue to grow 
The Fed weighed in on the economy Friday as part of its semiannual report to Congress  saying that risks of weaker than expected U S  growth declined late last year  but also noting that virus represents a new risk to its outlook  In the report  the Fed noted  tentative signs of stabilization  in the economy  and added that  the global slowdown in manufacturing and trade appears to be nearing an end  and consumer spending and services activity around the world continue to hold up   
The Fed also said the labor market is providing more than enough jobs to absorb new people coming into the workforce  Jobs growth of 225 000 in January  which was way above analysts  expectations  appeared to reinforce the Fed s mostly sunny forecast  see more below

CHART OF THE DAY  PARTICIPATION TROPHY  It s been 20 years since the civilian labor force participation rate hit the postwar high of 67 3   and it s been mostly downhill since then  But since making a new low of 62 4  in Sept  2015  the rate has been grinding higher  And Friday s jobs data saw an extension of the uptrend in labor participation  Data source  Federal Reserve s FRED database  Chart source  The thinkorswim  platform from TD Ameritrade  FRED  is a registered trademark of the Federal Reserve Bank of St  Louis  The Federal Reserve Bank of St  Louis does not sponsor or endorse and is not affiliated with TD Ameritrade  For illustrative purposes only  Past performance does not guarantee future results 
U S  trade deficit shrinks  That s a first in six years  Data released last week showed the overall U S  trade deficits in goods and services down by 1 7  from a year ago in December  with exports and imports registering a decline  One of the biggest contributors was the reduction of crude oil imports to the U S   mainly due to increased domestic production  Although one data point does not a trend make  it s still an encouraging sign  especially if you focus on China  The overall goods trade deficit with China declined by 17 6   
With trade tensions between the U S  and China easing after the signing of the phase one deal  the trade deficit could continue to shrink  although the coronavirus outbreak could skew it to some extent  A shrinking trade deficit could be encouraging for the U S  dollar  Although other variables can impact the greenback s value  it s possible there may be an uptick in U S  dollar demand  which could give the dollar a boost in value  Something to keep on your radar as the U S  Dollar Index  DXY  has been moving higher in recent days 
Technical Road Map for SPX  If there s anything good you can say about the market s temporary tanking in late January  it s that at least it gives us some technical road signs moving forward  When major indices are at all time highs and keep making new ones nearly every day as they did early last month  it can feel like working without a net  The major moving averages were way below current levels  so any sharp daily loss can feel like a swift ride down without knowing where support might come in  Now there s conceivably a little more natural support under the market at recent lows  which for the S P 500 Index  SPX  ended up being 3214 posted intraday on Jan  31 
What s interesting about 3214 is that it corresponds perfectly with another 3214 low from Jan  6 down to the decimal points  In late December  another intraday low of 3212 also stands out  So it seems fair to say we now have a possible support area down at the 3210 3215 level  while the psychological 3300 mark also could be one to watch on any dip  If you re wondering about the 50 day moving average sometimes seen as a key technical point it s still way below current levels at 3231  
Second Look at Jobs Data  It was hard not to like last Friday s jobs report  One particularly encouraging thing was seeing labor force participation grow  see chart above   With more people out looking for jobs  the unemployment rate rose a notch to 3 6   but that could actually be seen as good news  The official rate doesn t count people who ve given up looking for work  It s great to see that people have hope and want to get back out there into the workforce 
One talking point after the report was the continued slump in manufacturing jobs  That s probably worth noting  but remember that the transportation sector added 28 000 new jobs in January  Why does that matter  Because it suggests the manufacturing downturn is somewhat contained  If manufacturing was really going through rough times  that might start to hit the trade and delivery of goods  So far it doesn t appear to be  but it s something to consider tracking in future reports  Sometimes you can get clues about one sector from looking at another

199444,420960,NVDA,Are NVIDIA Shares Still On Fire ,opinion,"After soaring 76  in 2019  the shares of NVIDIA Corporation  NASDAQ NVDA  are on fire again  The stock has already gained 11  in 2020  helped by analysts  renewed optimism about a revival in chip demand 
NVIDIA is among the group of top semiconductor stocks that defied extreme negative pressure as their fundamentals deteriorated in late 2018  It surged yesterday about 4  to  262 97  As signs appear of a strong rebound in the demand for chips that are used in smartphones and data centres  the key question for investors is just how far chipmaker stocks can go  especially when they re trading at the highest price to future earnings multiples in nearly a decade 
Most analysts expect chipmakers  business to improve in 2020  when they re expected to get a significant boost from the introduction of 5G technology and the expansion of cloud infrastructure spending  But valuations are creating a major cause for concern  especially when taking into account risks such as the coronavirus currently ravaging China s economy  NVIDIA has invested heavily in the world s second largest economy  where many of its chips are used for assembly into other products  especially in industries related to artificial intelligence 
To keep the upward momentum going  chip producers  including NVIDIA  will need to start posting better than expected financial results  according to Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore  who had been one of the first analysts on Wall Street to turn cautious on the group in the second half of 2018 
For NVIDIA investors  the biggest test of whether the stock s rally is sustainable will come on Thursday  after the U S  market close  when the chipmaker reports its fourth quarter earnings  Analysts are expecting EPS of  1 66 a share as revenues are likely to jump about 34  to  2 96 billion from the same period a year ago 
 We expect a strong quarter and outlook in both gaming and data center  with perhaps some marginal conservatism in the gaming outlook driven by coronavirus   Moore wrote in a note on Monday 
 We have been expecting a strong quarter and outlook in both segments  with multiple data points suggesting strong demand from cloud  as well as fairly strong demand  and lean inventory conditions  for higher end gaming cards  
Missed The Boat 
Moore  despite his optimism  didn t raise the price target on NVIDIA  keeping it at  259 a share  but said he sees potential upside to the target  if numbers can move higher  
Unlike the slightly cautionary note from Morgan Stanley  analysts at RBC Capital Markets are quite bullish about NVIDIA s prospects on higher sales from data center customers  Indeed  analyst Mitch Steves has raised his price target  on the shares to  301  representing a 17  upside to the stock from its close yesterday 
 We raise our estimates on NVDA as we think the January quarter will come in a bit ahead of the high end of guidance due to better than expected gaming and data center demand   Steves wrote in a note 
Having watched the stock s powerful rise  the biggest question lurking in the minds of investors is whether they have already missed the boat  is it too late now to buy NVIDIA shares 
On a comparable basis  it doesn t come cheap  The stock s price to earnings ratio is 65 35 compared to Intel s  NASDAQ INTC  13 94  And at 35 7 times forward earnings  NVIDIA is also now one of the most richly valued chip stocks  fetching more than twice the semiconductor group s average multiple 
Bottom Line
A broad based recovery in semiconductor stocks suggests that investors are feeling more comfortable holding these shares  We continue to recommend a cautious approach toward chip stocks as their gains are still on a weak footing  NVIDIA  after a powerful rally last year  is susceptible to some correction before carrying on higher  Its earnings report on Thursday might help to remove some uncertainty ",2020-02-12,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/are-nvidia-shares-still-on-fire-200506293,200506293

Stocks moved higher on February 3  with the S P 500 rising by around 70 basis points back to 3 246  But not all is good news because it would appear that a bearish downtrend has formed

199456,420972,NVDA,Tesla To  7 000  Buy The Launch Abort At  500,opinion,"Tesla   NASDAQ TSLA   bulls have been running well deserved victory laps this week as the stock surged 46  in just the first two days  I m not talking about bulls who thought about buying at  350 in December and then eventually chased it higher at  650 in January I m talking about early investors like Ron Baron  who I profiled in my January 23 video and article Tesla to  6 000 and SpaceX to the Moon And I m talking about early analysts like our own Brian Bolan who bought shares at  39 not long after its 2010 IPO because as a technology focused investor he recognized the long term potential of this hugely disruptive innovator  He celebrated early when he bought himself a Model X last summer  And yes  he still loves it In the video that accompanies this article  I interviewed Brian for over 20 minutes as we discussed the maverick car company from multiple angles  including valuation metrics  the future of autonomous driving  and the massive short squeeze in TSLA shares that drove them over  950 on Tuesday A Bull Who Switched TeamsI also make a big blunder in the video when I gave credit to Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS  analyst Adam Jonas for being an early and steadfast bull on Tesla  Unfortunately  for him   after years of believing in Tesla  Adam switched teams in Q4 when he stuck to a bearish call and  250 price target  even as shares were breaking out above  400  or  420 if you prefer   Here s what he told his clients in a research note    We are not bullish on Tesla longer term  especially as  over time  we believe Tesla could be perceived by the market more and more like a traditional auto OEM  We are prepared for a potential surge in sentiment through 1H20 but question the sustainability  This is precisely the view that I rejected in my January 20 video after I was awoken by 3 reasons to be bullish on Tesla and to buy the stock at  500 1  It s a Tech Company  Adam Volkswagen  DE VOWG p  CEO Herbert Diess  speaking to company managers in Berlin in mid January  said  We are valued like an automobile company  while Tesla is valued like a tech company  This was not the first time Diess publicly recognized the disruptive force of Elon Musk in his industry  After Tesla surprised investors in late October with its Q3 sales  deliveries  and a big jump in profits to  1 86 in EPS    blowing away analyst consensus for a loss by  2    Bloomberg reporter Christoph Rauwald described Diess s reaction to Model 3 sales as turning Tesla into a rival that Volkswagen   OTC VWAGY   takes very seriously At an event where VW was presenting the new Golf hatchback late Thursday October 24   Diess quibbled with reporters who suggested Tesla is in trouble because it s too small   wrote Rauwald  Tesla is not niche   Diess said in Wolfsburg  Germany  where VW is based   The Model 3 is a large series model and they are one of the biggest manufacturers of electric car batteries  Based on the views of Diess  I suddenly realized that Tesla could trade at a much higher multiple than traditional car companies  At  500 and just over a  90 billion market cap  TSLA was trading 3 times sales on Jan 20 I decided growth investors could pay that  even though VW was valued in the opposite direction at only 1 3 of sales totaling  277 billion last year  And if you are truly a Technology company  what s stopping Tesla investors from paying over 5X forward sales  Even the disruptive innovator NVIDIA   NASDAQ NVDA   trades at over 10X sales while stalwart Intel   NASDAQ INTC   is valued 4X sales 2  It s the Deliveries  Dummy What woke up investors  and me  in Q4 was that Musk was convincingly on his way to make good on his promise of delivering over 350 000 vehicles in 2019  And while Toyota Motor   NYSE TM   probably delivered over 2 5 million vehicles last year  they are not growing sales at 30   with gross margins over 20   while doing it This is what started the bonfire in TSLA shares in October  with consecutive 30 million volume days on the 24th and 25th  launching the stock back above  300 for the first time since February 2019 3  It s a Jail Break  Traders Unfortunately  for me   I wasn t paying attention to any of that big October and November buying  But TSLA shares breaking out above  400 in December told me something new and different was going on with investors views of the chaotic innovator with the  disruptive  CEO While Adam Jonas was doubling down bearish in December  serious investors were telling you with their money that they wanted a piece of the potential when Musk could deliver more cars and turn up the cash flow spigot A fourth reason I offered in that Jan 20 video  on MLK Day  was that the prior day  NASA and Musk s SpaceX successfully tested the abort capabilities of the Dragon crew capsule launched on a Falcon rocket  This mission was an essential next step in letting NASA astronauts use the equipment to fly into space and the entire NASA team from engineers to astronauts was very excited about the partnership My immediate reaction that Sunday was that Musk continually surrounds himself with the best engineering talent in the world  And that means he can solve just about any problem that the market and technology throw at him This is especially true when you compare his position with Tesla to traditional auto makers like General Motors   NYSE GM   and Ford   NYSE F   who find themselves cutting costs to hold margins  while Tesla is still in a massive investment phase with new factories in China and soon Germany which are fueled by strong pricing power for his aspirational vehicles Pent Up Energy and a Massive Short SqueezeIn the video interview with Brian Bolan  we talk about the dynamics which drove TSLA from  550 to  950 in just 10 days  Several factors conspired  not least of which was another stellar quarter for the company reported on January 29 According to the investor press release   2019 was a turning point for Tesla  We demonstrated strong organic demand for Model 3  returned to GAAP profitability in 2H19 and generated  1 1B of free cash flow for the year  We achieved strong cash generation through persistent cost control across the business  After record vehicle deliveries of 112 095 in Q4  the company also projected their goal of 500 000 vehicle deliveries this year as production for the new Model Y This report inspired Oppenheimer analysts to raise their price target on Tesla to  684  You can see how the bonfire got more wood to burn In my interview with Brian Bolan  he describes the importance of the new Model Y in the fleet and why profits are expected to soar this year to nearly  8 EPS Also contributing to the euphoria in TSLA shares this week was the long term element I talked about Jan 20  ARK Invest CEO Catherine Wood raising her TSLA price target from  4 000 to  6 000 Well  she did it again by raising her target to  7 000 in 2024  Together  2 or 3 of her innovation focused ETFs hold 2 million shares of TSLAAnd a third major element to the 75   Falcon Heavy  moonshot of TSLA shares was new retail traders who had serious FOMO  fear of missing out   Word is that 12 000 Robinhood brokerage customers were first time TSLA buyers Tuesday above  700  Ouch The Euphoria MachineOn Wednesday  Yahoo  NASDAQ AABA  Finance reporter Myles Udland gave Adam Jonas a chance to explain what he missed  In a note to clients published Tuesday  the Morgan Stanley analyst tried to make sense of the recent rally  outlining his 5 key thoughts for the stock at  780  a share price commentary that was quickly in the rear view mirror since Tesla opened at  865 Udland wrote   One of Jonas  areas of exploration was the  super bull case  for Tesla that creates a potential path towards the company becoming the most valuable auto company in the world  As of Tuesday s close  Tesla s market cap was just below  160 billion  not too far off the  200 billion market cap assigned to Toyota  currently the world s most valuable carmaker As the dominant supplier of EV batteries and powertrain technology for the market  Jonas sees a path towards Tesla earning  8 billion in annual profit  which valued at 10x implies  400 of value per Tesla share today  Similarly  Tesla earning  5 month on subscription revenues from its autonomous driving software could earn  5 billion in annual profit  Value these profits at 15x and Jonas sees another  400 of per share value for Tesla Of course  much of this speculation is Jonas trying to see the massive upside after he glaringly advised his followers to miss most of it Other i bank analysts who were headed in the right direction last month were from Jefferies and Deutsche  according to TheFly com   Jefferies analyst Philippe Houchois raised his price target for Tesla  TSLA  to  600 from  400 and kept a Buy rating on the shares  It would be wrong to exit Tesla on valuation  Houchois said  Tesla is the only car manufacturer engaged in a  positive sum game  in electric vehicles amid rising market acceptance  and its auto business should turn profitable this year excluding tax credits  contended the analyst Deutsche Bank  DE DBKGn  analyst Emmanuel Rosner raised his price target for Tesla to  455 from  290 while keeping a Hold rating on the shares  Tesla  truly seems to be currently firing on all cylinders   with the recent start of China production  a large step up in regulatory credit revenue from January 2020 thanks to the deal with FCA  start of production of Model Y in the near term and the building of a factory in Europe  Rosner said The DB analyst raised his earnings trajectory for Tesla through 2025 as a result  However  with the stock hovering around all time highs  Rosner worries investor sentiment has  gotten bullish too fast  ignoring some of the nearer term execution risks   This is especially the case in China  where it is difficult to gauge in the near term due to a recent slump in new energy vehicles sales  contended the analyst My take  Wait for Tesla to come back to earth and then start scaling in with small positions and or LEAP call options between  550 and  450  This plan could take several quarters to complete

199457,420973,NVDA,Nvidia  NVDA  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Nvidia  NVDA  reports results for the quarter ended January 2020  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 13  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 66 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  107 5  
Revenues are expected to be  2 96 billion  up 34 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Nvidia 
For Nvidia  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Nvidia will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Nvidia would post earnings of  1 57 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 78  delivering a surprise of  13 38  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss

Nvidia   NASDAQ NVDA   and Roku   NASDAQ ROKU   Stocks to Keep an Eye On If the Market CorrectsThe first two days of 2020 trading have been marked with uncertainty  The news of China s central bank cutting the reserve ratio and allowing more money to circulate in the economy pushed all major US indices  except the Russel 2000  to all time highs  Today  the second day of 2020 trading and the markets are down nearly 1   wiping almost all of yesterday s gains off the table  Turbulence on the Iranian front is the primary catalyst for today s sell off The markets seem to be unsure of which direction to go  In December  the markets floated up on low volumes  ending the year at all time highs  This gradually upward move doesn t appear to have much support 2019 is expected to finish up the year with negative earnings growth year over year  which has not been reflected in the stock market s performance  with S P 500 rallying 29  last year  its best year since 2013   Right now  the S P 500 is trading at around 20x forward P E  which is its most expensive level since the early 2000s  The stock market has been pricing in 2020 and 2021 growth that has not come to fruition  I believe that it may have overstepped its bounds Is the market due for a correction  Options are pointing to yes Market bears have been buying up March expiring puts for the markets most traded ETF  the SPDR S P 500 ETF  NYSE SPY      As it stands  there are currently around 50  more puts expiring in March than calls  This means that most options traders are betting the stock market will fall in the next 2 5 months Stocks to Keep an Eye OnThe correction I am anticipating will create a buying opportunity for some of my favorite stocks  Companies with savvy management teams  a sustainable product offering that can ride the trends of the future NVDANvidia is my favorite chip making company that I anticipate will take over the space in this next wave of tech  Nvidia is known for its GPU s which have been primarily used for rendering images  but its speed and efficiency are making these semiconductors particularly useful in datacenters  Nvidia s datacenter chips are being used in for deep learnings  and as its technology continues to progress  with this firm controlling almost 100  of the datacenter GPU market  I expect that NVDA chips will be a part of the first true AI Nvidia is also leveraging

cloud platform  GeForce NOW  This platform allows gamers to use their Macs or PCs for gaming anywhere with the high speed  low latency technology of Nvidia s GPUs without needing Nvidia s hardware locally Nvidia is teaming up with telecommunication providers  to expand and improve the cloud gaming experience globally   Getting in front of the 5G wave to be prepared with a turnkey solution once 5G is widely available These shares have seen a roughly 75  run up over the last 52 weeks  I presume that NVDA would see a sizable fall in the case of a market correction  considering it is sporting a beta north of 2  I like this stock at any price below  200 ROKUThe streaming devices leader  Roku  is another stock that I would love to get a hold of at the right price  These shares are trading at a rich double digit forward P S  and I would like to get into this stock if this valuation would drop into the single digits  ROKU is a highly volatile stock and would undoubtedly take a hit with the broader market  I would look to buy this stock as it approaches  100 or hits its 200 day moving average  which currently sits at around  110 Roku is on the right side of the streaming war as more competition in the space only adds to its product offering  Roku has become almost synonymous with cord cutting  According to Roku s most recent shareholders  letter   roughly 50  of U S  cord cutters

partnering with top brands Take Away The market is expensive right now  and traders are starting to see it  March puts are looking increasingly attractive as options traders pile on  This market has floated up in December and all it needs is a little prick to deflate back to more practical levels As an investor  I would be hesitant to put any substantial long position on until a slight correction is seen  I would like to see the S P 500 forward P E multiple drop down to the mid to upper teens before I feel safe about putting more into the market  although positive trade news could extend this

Stocks Likely to Gain as Facial Recognition Picks Up SteamWith rapid strides in technology  applications that once belonged only in the realm of sci fi movies have increasingly become an integral part of our daily lives  Biometrics technology is a leading proponent of such advancements  This technology of identifying and authenticating individuals on unique biological characteristics in a reliable and fast way is presently being widely used to counter the rising threats from identity theft and document fraud  and curb the growing menace of terrorism and cybercrime  In addition  facial recognition system is gradually being used in airports to validate flier identity  and will probably make passports and long security checks an obsolete thing in the near future  Key sectors such as banking  healthcare  retail and mobile commerce are fast embracing biometrics to authenticate a transaction  access healthcare subsidies and prevent fraudulent activities The biometrics technology is likely to become more pervasive as China rolls out mandatory facial recognition for all new mobile users registered in the country after Dec 1  The United States is also mulling to expand facial recognition checks for all travelers in the country at major airports  both foreign and domestic Facial Recognition  A Brief SynopsisFacial recognition is reportedly considered to be the most natural of all biometric measurements and refers to the process of identifying or verifying the identity of a person using facial details  It typically involves a three pronged process  the step first being detection and locating a given human face in images and videos  The face capture process then transforms an analog information  a face  into a set of digital material  data  based on the person s facial features  while the face match process authenticates if two faces belong to the same person This easy to deploy technology requires no physical interaction by the end user and is very fast  Leveraging AI and ML techniques  the global biometric market is expected to top  50 billion by 2024 according to Global Markets Insights  with applications in security and government sectors being the primary growth drivers China s New Telecom PolicyFacial recognition is being widely used as a tool for government surveillance in China  An estimated 850 million or about 65  of the population use mobile devices to access the Internet  The nation has a stringent  real name registration  policy in place that requires users to link online accounts with their official government ID  The government has now mandated facial scans for new mobile registration to pre empt cyber fraud However  critics have alleged that the purported move would jeopardize the privacy of users and could compromise sensitive information if the country s state run mobile carriers fail to effectively secure the data  In addition  it has raised an alarm among the citizens about increased government surveillance  particularly when the geopolitical situation is highly volatile with continued protests against the administration in Hong Kong Facial Scans to Extend at U S  AirportsThe U S  Homeland Security has issued a draft proposal to extend facial recognition checks at the major airports to all the citizens of the country  eliciting sharp responses from civil liberties group  Facial recognition was earlier mandatory for only foreign travelers to catch illegal immigrants or visitors who overstayed their visa duration  U S  citizens and green card holders were exempt from this process However  the Homeland Security intends to extend this process to all travelers who fly in or out of the country and aims to roll out facial recognition scanners in 20 largest airports across the country by 2021

199575,421091,NVDA,4 Stocks Likely To Gain As Facial Recognition Picks Up Steam,opinion,With rapid strides in technology  applications that once belonged only in the realm of sci fi movies have increasingly become an integral part of our daily lives  Biometrics technology is a leading proponent of such advancements  This technology of identifying and authenticating individuals on unique biological characteristics in a reliable and fast way is presently being widely used to counter the rising threats from identity theft and document fraud  and curb the growing menace of terrorism and cybercrime  In addition  facial recognition system is gradually being used in airports to validate flier identity  and will probably make passports and long security checks an obsolete thing in the near future  Key sectors such as banking  healthcare  retail and mobile commerce are fast embracing biometrics to authenticate a transaction  access healthcare subsidies and prevent fraudulent activities The biometrics technology is likely to become more pervasive as China rolls out mandatory facial recognition for all new mobile users registered in the country after Dec 1  The United States is also mulling to expand facial recognition checks for all travelers in the country at major airports  both foreign and domestic Facial Recognition  A Brief SynopsisFacial recognition is reportedly considered to be the most natural of all biometric measurements and refers to the process of identifying or verifying the identity of a person using facial details  It typically involves a three pronged process  the step first being detection and locating a given human face in images and videos  The face capture process then transforms an analog information  a face  into a set of digital material  data  based on the person s facial features  while the face match process authenticates if two faces belong to the same person This easy to deploy technology requires no physical interaction by the end user and is very fast  Leveraging AI and ML techniques  the global biometric market is expected to top  50 billion by 2024 according to Global Markets Insights  with applications in security and government sectors being the primary growth drivers China s New Telecom PolicyFacial recognition is being widely used as a tool for government surveillance in China  An estimated 850 million or about 65  of the population use mobile devices to access the Internet  The nation has a stringent  real name registration  policy in place that requires users to link online accounts with their official government ID  The government has now mandated facial scans for new mobile registration to pre empt cyber fraud However  critics have alleged that the purported move would jeopardize the privacy of users and could compromise sensitive information if the country s state run mobile carriers fail to effectively secure the data  In addition  it has raised an alarm among the citizens about increased government surveillance  particularly when the geopolitical situation is highly volatile with continued protests against the administration in Hong Kong Facial Scans to Extend at U S  AirportsThe U S  Homeland Security has issued a draft proposal to extend facial recognition checks at the major airports to all the citizens of the country  eliciting sharp responses from civil liberties group  Facial recognition was earlier mandatory for only foreign travelers to catch illegal immigrants or visitors who overstayed their visa duration  U S  citizens and green card holders were exempt from this process However  the Homeland Security intends to extend this process to all travelers who fly in or out of the country and aims to roll out facial recognition scanners in 20 largest airports across the country by 2021  This has evoked strong protests from various sections regarding possible ploy for increased government surveillance and perceived threat of privacy intrusion due to concerns about a lack of sufficient safeguards to protect the data Top 4 Picks Likely to BenefitAmid the spotlight on the industry  we have cherry picked four stocks that are likely

199622,421138,NVDA, Nvidia May Not Be Faring As Well As We Thought When It Comes to Crypto Miners ,news,"Word is spreading that chipmaker Nvidia may be in a pickle  and it s mainly due to the waning appetite of miners to mine 
At issue is Nvidia s graphics processing unit  or GPU  inventory  It seems it s got more of these units than it has willing buyers  which are gamers and crypto miners 
Let s discuss 
Supply and demand
Reports are that a major Taiwanese original equipment manufacturer  or OEM  has returned 300 000 GPU units to NVIDIA  NASDAQ NVDA   The concern with this move is that it could delay Nvidia s next gen GeForce GPUs from getting to market 
In fact  Nvidia s CEO  Jen Hsun  has said those GPUs won t be launched for a long time  He didn t specify what  long time  means 
But we thought all was fine
We  just last month that Nvidia had enjoyed a wonderful first quarter for its 2019 reporting season  One of the reasons for its blow out quarter was due to it raking in extremely healthy revenues from crypto miners buying its GPUs 
For the quarter ending April 29  the company reported selling  289 million worth of the cards that crypto miners thrive on using to do create their coins 
During the conference call to discuss the earnings report  Nvidia s executive vice president and chief financial officer Colette Kress made the somewhat unusual move of pointing out how much crypto miners were contributing to the company s top and bottom lines 
She said 

 Cryptocurrency demand was again stronger than expected  but we were able to fulfill most of it with crypto specific GPUs  which are included in our OEM business at  289 million  Looking into Q2  we expect crypto specific revenue to be about one third of its Q1 level  

Was that a hint 
Kress s statement about being able to fulfill most of the GPU demand speaks volumes about how the chipmaker could have found itself in this overstock predicament  Nvidia officials may not have factored in just how much miners were losing interest in creating cryptos 
At least one pundit saw the writing on the wall  and doesn t see things getting better  DigiTimes noted that the prospects of crypto mining are dim  The paid subscription site notes the situation is only aggravated by Taiwanese graphic cards  suppliers who think shipments and profits will fall this quarter 
DigiTimes spoke to industry players about Nvidia s situation  and reported the following 

 The sources said that the cryptocurrency mining heyday seen between April 2017 and March 2018 suffered an abrupt downturn in April due partly to the Bitcoin value plunging to under US  7 000 from a peak of nearly US  20 000 recorded in December 2017 and partly to governments of China  South Korea  the U  S and many European countries rushing to clamp down on digital coin exchanges following exposures of scams  frauds and market manipulations  ",2018-06-27,Cryptovest,https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/nvidia-may-not-be-faring-as-well-as-we-thought-when-it-comes-to-crypto-miners-1508670,1508670

However  the five wave impulse pattern formed by this plunge indicated that NVDA was ready for a recovery towards  180  190  The stock reached that area in April and is once again trading within its boundaries now  The time seems right to take another look and see what to expect going forward 

The 4 hour chart reveals the impulsive crash from  293 to  125 as well as the following recovery  Wave  2 B  appears to be an a b c flat correction  whose wave  c  is an ending diagonal  According to the Elliott Wave theory  more weakness in wave  3 C  can be expected as soon as wave  2 B  ends 

Furthermore  wave  3 C  is supposed to breach the bottom of wave  1 A   This means targets below  124 a share are plausible  once the downtrend resumes  If this analysis is correct  NVDA can lose more than a third of its market value in the months ahead  Given the company s cyclical nature and the numerous recession indicators flashing red  this is a warning the bulls cannot afford to ignore ",2019-10-15,EWM Interactive,https://www.investing.com/analysis/nvidia-to-take-a-turn-for-the-worse-200473413,200473413

199634,421150,NVDA,Trump May See Easy  Win In 2020   ETFs To Bet On,opinion,"President Donald Trump may see an easy  if the economy stays strong  modeling by Moody s Analytics shows  Moody s projections are based on factors like consumer confidence  gains in the stock market in the Trump presidency and  the prospects for unemployment  which has fallen to a 50 year low   Trump has beaten democrats in all scenarios proposed by Moody s  Notably  the modeling has been right since the 1980 election  falling short only once in 2016 
 If the economy a year from now is the same as it is today  or roughly so  then the power of incumbency is strong and Trump s election odds are very good  particularly if Democrats aren t enthusiastic and don t get out to vote   said Mark Zandi  chief economist at Moody s Analytics 
Also  majority of U S  business leaders expects Trump to be re elected in 2020 as   at least in the near term  Normally  a struggling economy reduces the chance of an incumbent President wining again 
Though this group of business leaders is not a big fan of Trump s trade policies and views that more interest rate cuts are needed for economic expansion  the cohort predicts a win for him in the next election  per  
Against this backdrop  investors might be interested in checking out ETFs that have gained materially in Trump s presidency  Below we highlight a few that have been top performers in the past three years  as of Oct 15  2019

199635,421151,NVDA,DINRF Vs  NVDA  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors interested in stocks from the Semiconductor   General sector have probably already heard of Screen Holdings Co   Ltd  DINRF  and Nvidia  NVDA   But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors  We ll need to take a closer look to find out 
There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks  but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns  The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits 
Screen Holdings Co   Ltd has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Nvidia has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold  right now  This means that DINRF s earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive  so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook  But this is only part of the picture for value investors 
Value investors are also interested in a number of tried and true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics  These include the long favored P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company s fair value 
DINRF currently has a forward P E ratio of 11 69  while NVDA has a forward P E of 36 35  We also note that DINRF has a PEG ratio of 1 17  This popular figure is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company s expected EPS growth rate  NVDA currently has a PEG ratio of 3 80 
Another notable valuation metric for DINRF is its P B ratio of 1 11  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  NVDA has a P B of 11 44 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to DINRF s Value grade of A and NVDA s Value grade of D 
DINRF has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than NVDA  so it seems like value investors will conclude that DINRF is the superior option right now ",2019-10-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/dinrf-vs-nvda-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200474524,200474524

Data from Taiwan s finance ministry showed that export jumped to a record  30 billion in March alone  which represents an increase of 16 7   This growth was  driven by strong demand for high performance chips  cryptocurrency mining  and artificial intelligence applications  
Randy Abrams  who heads regional semiconductors research at  Credit Suisse   SIX CSGN   commented 

 TSMC  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company  is generating about 6 7  of its sales from the ASICs  Application Specific Integrated Circuits  from customers like Bitmain and also some of the GPUs being used from AMD and NVIDIA  NASDAQ NVDA   

TSMC is the biggest chip foundry in the world  with a more than 55  share of global chip production  The boom in the crypto mining space has been a massive driver of profits for the company  it reported  8 46 billion in first quarter earnings this year  mainly driven by strong demand from high performance computing such as cryptocurrency mining and increases from both automotive and IoT   It added that the high demand from crypto mining had offset weaker smartphone sales 
However  TSMC a revised revenue forecast for the rest of 2018  citing uncertainty in digital mining demand  The company modified its forecast from growth of between 10  and 15  to a more conservative 10  
Abrams continued 

 TSMC does not want to invest in much capacity that is unable to be converted to other uses  The market still needs to mature and have more certainty before more suppliers dedicate or invest in specific capacity for mining

199645,421161,NVDA,Least Hurt Tech ETFs On Renewed China Tensions ,opinion,"The U S  China trade tensions as well as worries in the tech space are heightening again  The Trump administration blacklisted eight more Chinese technology giants on Oct 7  accusing the firms of being involved in  in the country s far western region of Xinjiang 
The companies include two video surveillance companies    Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co  and Zhejiang Dahua Technology Co    that almost control about  and have cameras globally  per Bloomberg  Among other affected companies  there were      the world s most valuable artificial intelligence startup    and fellow AI giant Megvii Technology Ltd   which is said to be aiming to raise up to  1 billion in a Hong Kong initial public offering  
This is the first time the Trump administration has cited human rights as a reason for blacklisting Chinese companies  Prior to this  safeguarding of national security was cited as the reason for blacklisting Huawei Technologies Co  
Though entities on the list are barred from doing business with American companies due to the non grant of a U S  government license  some have continued to maintain relationships with barred companies through international subsidiaries  per Bloomberg 
Tech Stocks Hit Hard 
Tech companies  specifically semiconductors and tech hardware and equipment  are exposed the most to this trade war  This is because the rising tariffs will make manufacturing of American tech giant products costlier  This  in turn  will likely compel hardware manufacturers to hike prices at home  while  could also make the products expensive for buyers in that country  per techcrunch com 
Going by the Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS  equity strategists   semiconductor and semiconductor equipment companies have the highest revenue exposure to China at   and are thus prone to maximum risks due to the heightening trade tensions  The Tech Hardware   Equipment companies have about 14  exposure to China  
As a result  the latest tech turmoil comes as a blow to the semiconductor market as well  Video chip maker Ambarella   NASDAQ AMBA   dropped about 9 5  on Oct 8  Other chip stocks like NVIDIA Corp   NASDAQ NVDA    off 3 9  on Oct 8  and Advanced Micro Devices Inc    NASDAQ AMD    down 2 4   also depreciated on Wednesday 
Semiconductor ETFs like VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF  and iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF  shed about 2 6  and 3 1   respectively on Oct 8  The largest tech fund Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund  retreated more than 1 8  on Oct 9  Nonetheless  some tech ETFs did not lose as massively as the semiconductor funds did 
Below we highlight a few tech ETFs that survived the latest U S  China trade turmoil  to a large extent  on Oct 8 and lost considerably lesser than big tech and chip ETFs  see  here

2  Consumer Sentiment Data Eyed 
Consumer sentiment data and a speech by St  Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard will round off the week of mostly negative economic data  which included a duo of weaker wholesale and consumer inflation reports 
James Bullard  a non FOMC voter  is expected to deliver a speech at 08 30 am ET on Friday  a little over week after the Federal Reserve left its benchmark rate unchanged and delivered an upbeat assessment on the U S  economy and inflation 
The subdued inflation reports seen this week  however  had little impact on expectations for a June rate hike  which remained at 100   according to investing com s fed rate monitor tool 
Michigan s preliminary consumer expectations due 10 00 am  is expected to show a reading of 88 0 for May  while consumer sentiment is forecast to show a reading of 98 5  down slightly from 98 8 seen in the previous month 
The dollar fell sharply against its rivals on Thursday as GBP USD pared some of its losses after the Bank of England slashed its growth forecasts after revealing an unchanged rate decision

199653,421169,NVDA,Zacks com Featured Highlights Include  Odonate Therapeutics  Novavax  Beazer Homes USA And NVIDIA,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   September 30  2019   Stocks in this week s article are Odonate Therapeutics  Inc    NASDAQ ODT    Novavax  Inc    NASDAQ NVAX    Beazer Homes USA  Inc    NYSE BZH   and NVIDIA Corporation   NASDAQ NVDA   4 of the Best Stocks with Earnings AccelerationConstant earnings growth captivates almost everyone  right from the top brass to research analysts  This is because earnings are a measure of the money a company is making  Notably  earnings are essentially revenues that the company generates after deducting the cost of production over a given period of time Earnings acceleration  however  works even better when it comes to lifting the stock price  Studies have shown that a majority of successful stocks had seen acceleration in earnings before an uptick in the stock price Future OutperformersSo  what is earnings acceleration  It is the incremental growth in a company s earnings per share  EPS   In other words  if the rate of a company s quarter over quarter earnings growth increases within a stipulated frame of time  it can be called earnings acceleration In case of earnings growth  you pay for something that is already reflected in the stock price  But  earnings acceleration helps spot stocks that haven t caught the attention of investors yet  which once secured will invariably lead to a rally in the share price  This is because earnings acceleration considers both direction and magnitude of growth rates Increasing percentage of earnings growth means that the company is fundamentally sound and has been on the right track for a considerable period of time  Meanwhile  a sideways percentage of earnings growth indicates a period of consolidation or slowdown  while a decelerating percentage of earnings growth may at times drag prices down Hence  earnings acceleration should be viewed as a key

199656,421172,NVDA, Ether Mining Guide  How to Mine ETH Cryptocurrency ,news,"Ethereum  ETH  is an open source public blockchain protocol that features the use of smart contracts  This allows other decentralization applications or Dapps to be built on top of the Ethereum blockchain  Ether is the block reward or cryptocurrency that is generated by verifying transactions and creating new blocks to ultimately maintaining the Ethereum blockchain  Ethereum was proposed and founded by Vitalik Buterin in 2013  There are also many other co founders including Dr  Gavin Woods  Joseph Lubin  Charles Hoskinson  and Anthony Diiorio 
The Ethereum Virtual Machine  EVM   which is decentralized and Turing complete  utilizes an international network of public nodes to execute scripts  The Ethereum blockchain also uses  gas  as an internal transaction pricing mechanism  which is included as part of every transaction on the Ethereum network  The  gas  is considered transaction fuel  and incentivizes miners to include the transaction in a block 
Ether is the 2nd largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization  USD  69  billion   It is one of the few cryptocurrencies that still uses a Proof of Work consensus mechanism that is ASIC resistant  until recently according to rumours  and can still be mined using regular GPU computational power  
If you are considering mining ETH in the short term  there may be a couple of years left   you want to first think about whether you are going to solo mine  pool mine  or cloud mine  Pool mining has associated costs like pool fees but you could see quicker rewards and reduced reward variance in comparison to solo mining  At this point  the most profitable and efficient way to mine ETH would be to pool mine or cloud mine  Let s break down the elements of mining Ether so you get a complete understanding of the underlying technology and how the process works 
Ethereum Mining   Consensus Mechanism
Ethereum currently uses the Proof of Work consensus mechanism based on the original Keccak hash algorithm  which was standardized as SHA 3  Ethash 1 0 was designed to be   resistant with its memory hardness  making it difficult to implement special ASIC chips  There are some traces of slightly modified versions of the earlier Dagger Hashimoto hashes present as well that help reduce computational overhead  Ethash uses a 1GB dataset known as Ethash Directed Acyclic Graph    and also has a 16MB pseudorandom cache for light clients  which are regenerated every 30 000 blocks  This is called an epoch  Ethereum miners use cryptographic nonces along with pieces of the DAG to create mix hashes using receipt and transaction data to generate a hash that is set below a dynamic target difficulty 
There have been many proposals to move Ethereum to a Proof of Stake  PoS  consensus mechanism  as outlined in the original paper  The most recent proposal    was submitted on April 20  2018  outlining the transition to a hybrid consensus mechanism that utilizes both PoW and PoS  This implementation is called Ethereum Casper  It is critical to understand the implications of this  as it will drastically change how Ether is mined once it is implemented  Also be aware that in the long term  Ethereum is looking to change the consensus mechanism to be fully  based  This means Ethereum will no longer be mineable once the full transition to PoS is complete  
In the meantime  let s take a look at some of the top miners on the market 
Ethereum Mining Hardware
ETH was originally mined using consumer grade CPUs and GPUs and was ASIC resistant  Since its inception much has changed  It is no longer profitable to mine using CPUs  GPUs are the primary way to profitably mine Ether and is one of the the most profitable cryptocurrencies to mine due to its price potential  The increase in ETH mining has led to the unavailability of many GPUs for gaming or graphics and has caused a significant price increase in the cost of GPUs on the market  globally 
Ethash DAG is stored in the VRAM of the GPU  so you need to have enough storage to load the DAG  You will also require a graphics card that has at least 3GB of VRAM in order to mine Ethereum  which will rise to 4GB of VRAM later this year  Anything less is insufficient and you WILL NOT be able to mine ETH  There are also a few minimum system hardware specifications that will need to be met  Here are some recommendations 
For rigs of less than 6 GPUs  4GB RAM is required  For more than that  look at getting a 8GB RAM stick 
A motherboard with enough PCIe inputs is critical  You will need these inputs in order to build a multiple GPU rig 
A Powered riser cable for each card 
An open air rig for multiple GPUs 
A reliable power supply with capacity based on the GPUs chosen to mine 
A reliable internet connection 
That being said  it needs to be mentioned  here that there have been recent of Bitmain and a few other firms like Samsung  KS 005930   creating new ASIC  Application Specific Integrated Circuit  miners to be released in Q2 2018  This is definitely something to be on the lookout for if you intend to mine ETH profitability and competitively  If ASIC miners are released  it could drastically reduce GPU mining efficiency if the hashpower is significantly higher than existing GPUs  This may result in the obsolescence of profitable GPU mining 
Below is a table outlining a few GPUs that can currently be utilized to profitably mine ETH 
Ethereum Cloud Mining
If you don t want the hassle and costs associated with buying hardware to mine but still want the exposure  you can look into mining  Essentially  cloud mining involved using shared process power from a remote data centre  This alleviates having to manage and maintain hardware setups but comes with associates risks  The most popular form of cloud mining is called Hashpower Leasing  You essentially lease your desired amount of hashpower from a remote cloud mining firm  typically on a 1 or 2 year lease  in exchange for fiat currency  This gives you the the right to the ETH block reward proportional to your purchased hashpower  Cloud mining is also applicable to many other mineable coins  not just ETH  Below are some advantages and disadvantages of cloud mining 
Ethereum Mining Software
The software used to mine Ethereum is just as important as the hardware  Different software has been created for different hardware  You want to get the most out of your hardware  so utilizing the correct mining software and optimizing your GPU or CPU is essential to reap the most profits 
You will need temperature monitoring and overclocking software to optimally tweak your GPU performance  reduce temperature  and reduce overall energy usage  Many miners use Afterburner for overclocking and  for temperature control  so you may want to take a deeper look at those 
As far as mining software goes  the most reliable and widely used is Claymore s mining   It is the most robust and best all around miner which is easy to set up and has extra functionality  You can also mine two coins at once with this software to increase your income  is also another popular option as well  Setting up the software should be pretty straightforward and involve downloading and extracting  zip files 
You will also need to ensure you have a ETH setup in order to receive your block rewards and hold your ETH balance  If you don t plan on holding large amounts of coins  a web or desktop wallet is more than suitable  you can create a wallet   Remember to NEVER share your private key and it s best to download and use a keystore JSON file which is password protected or use   If you do intend to hold large amounts of coin  the best and most secure way to hold your coins is in a hardware wallet  so a Ledger Nano S or Trezor will be your best option  
Ethereum Mining Difficulty   Profitability
The network hashrate has grown exponentially since inception  which is justified as ETH is the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap and has huge price potential  With the emergence of the  and many other large corporations working on Ethereum blockchain based industry solutions  Ethereum will become a major player in the cryptocurrency space and will help lead mass global adoption across many industries  Ethereum has experienced significant exponential growth since early 2017  The increase in price has lead to higher demand for ETH mining and has increased the difficulty level over time  
 You can take a look at more charts 
Below is a chart outlining the potential profits using   This link will allow you to enter different inputs and see the associated profit potential so you can gauge your overall cost and profits  This is for illustrative purposes and results can vary depending on your inputs and the market price of Ether  It is also based on an ETH price of USD  229 81 
With the potential introduction of ASIC miners and the increased price potential from the PoW to PoS consensus mechanism  ETH is definitely worth mining if you can get hold of an ASIC miner  In the meantime  GPU mining is still profitable  ETH is one of the best cryptocurrencies to mine solely based on future price potential

199675,421191,NVDA,Nvidia  NVDA  Up 22 3  Since Last Earnings Report  Can It Continue ,opinion,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Nvidia  NVDA   Shares have added about 22 3  in that time frame  outperforming the S P 500 
Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is Nvidia due for a pullback  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers  NVIDIA Q2 Earnings and Revenues Top EstimatesNVIDIA s second quarter fiscal 2020 non GAAP earnings per share of  1 24 topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 15 but dropped 36  from the year ago period  However  the bottom line improved 41  sequentially Meanwhile  revenues of  2 58 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 55 billion but declined 17  year over year  However  the top line rose 16  sequentially The better than expected results can be attributed to strength in automotive  gaming plus OEM and IP end markets  However  weaknesses in data center market were a spoiler Nonetheless  as the company witnessed a sequential progress across all its end markets  management expects the business to have  normalized  Top Line DetailsRevenues at the GPU Business fell 21  year over year to  2 1 billion  reflecting deterioration in the gaming and data center GPUs  However  on a sequential basis  the metric grew 4  Tegra Processor Business revenues worth  475 million inched up 2  on a year over year basis and 140  sequentially  driven by higher Automotive revenues  However  lower shipments of SOC modules for gaming platforms were a dampener On the basis of market platform  Gaming revenues were down 27  on a year over year basis to  1 3 billion due to decreased shipments of gaming desktop GPUs and SOC modules for gaming platforms  However  the same was up 24  sequentially  backed by better SOC modules for gaming platforms  gaming notebook GPUs and GeForce RTX SUPER gaming GPUs Notably  the launch of Super line of gaming GPUs is making the management optimistic  The rising momentum in the games supporting the ray tracing feature is a positive Meanwhile  revenues from Data Center deteriorated 14  year over year to  655 million as hyperscale customers witnessed soft sales from the segment  However  3  sequential growth was generated from a rise in enterprise revenues  aided by expanding AI workloads Automotive revenues in the reported quarter totaled  209 million  reflecting a 30  year over year and a 26  sequential increase  This upside was boosted by autonomous vehicle development deals and the solid uptake of AI based smart cockpit infotainment solutions  Most importantly  a new development service agreement  mostly with Volvo  has been a key driver Moving to Professional Visualization  revenues climbed 4  year over year and 9  sequentially to  291 million  Strength across mobile workstation products is a key catalyst OEM and IP revenues dipped 4  year over year to  111 million due to the absence of crypto currency mining GPU sales  However  the same grew 16  sequentially owing to an uptick in shipments of embedded edge AI products MarginsNVIDIA s non GAAP gross margin contracted 340 basis points  bps  from the year ago quarter to 60 1   However  it expanded 110 bps sequentially  riding on lower component costs  automotive development services and a favorable Gaming segment mix Non GAAP operating expenses escalated around 8  from the year earlier quarter to  749 million due to increase in headcount  higher employee compensation and infrastructure costs In dollar terms  non GAAP operating income tanked 38  year over year to  802 million  NVIDIA s non GAAP operating margin deteriorated to 31 1  in the quarter under review from 41 3  in the prior year period Balance Sheet   Cash FlowNVIDIA exited the fiscal second quarter with cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of  8 47 billion compared with  7 8 billion in the previous reported quarter  The company s long term debt is flat at  1 99 billion Cash flow from operating activities was  936 million in the fiscal second quarter  up from  720 million in the sequential quarter Free cash flow came in at  823 million  up from  592 million in the earlier reported quarter The company did not make any stock repurchase in the quarter on account of its pending buyout of Mellanox  Management had earlier stated that the company is committed to returning  3 billion to shareholders through the end of fiscal 2020  During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019  share buybacks worth  700 million were made and the company returned  195 million in the form of quarterly cash dividends in the first half of fiscal 2020 The company intends to return the remaining  2 11 billion via a combination of share repurchases and cash dividends  However  management stated that no buyback can happen prior to the closing of the Mellanox buyout and thus  this phase may extend into fiscal 2021 GuidanceFor the fiscal third quarter  NVIDIA anticipates revenues of  2 9 billion     2   Non GAAP gross margin is projected to be 62 5      50 bps   Improvement in gaming product mix is likely to be a key driver  Non GAAP operating expenses are forecast to be  765 million  GAAP and non GAAP tax rates are envisioned at 10      1   each

199691,421207,NVDA,Computer shops embrace lucrative business  outfitting cryptocurrency miners,news,By Wyman Ma  Dewey Sim and Joyce Lee HONG KONG SINGAPORE  Reuters    Some of the biggest electronics bazaars in Asia are being flooded with customers looking for the latest piece of technology  cryptocurrency mining rigs   Scores of miners from around the world are traveling to places like Hong Kong s Sham Shui Po and Singapore s Sim Lim Square  NYSE SQ  to buy the rigs  which the shops  hardware geeks expertly build behind counters in their cramped boutiques   Some miners only buy components  a motherboard  graphic processing units  fans  power adapters  a display card and a memory card  But even if the vendors assemble them on the spot for a small fee  the finished product is usually still a relative bargain    It s 30 50 percent cheaper to buy equipment related to cryptomining in Hong Kong than in Europe   Russian bitcoin miner Dima Popov said  Hong Kong  for instance  has no sales tax and is closer to component suppliers  Popov buys display cards  motherboards and power supplies in Hong Kong and mines cryptocurrencies in Russia  where electricity is cheaper and the climate is more suitable  The demand for the rigs has added a new dimension to Asia s tech shopping hubs whose once bustling business fizzled out in recent years hit by waning demand for personal computers  Storefronts that once catered mostly to locals  selling phones and other consumer gear  are now greeting foreign visitors searching for hardware that might make them rich       DIGITAL MINING The rigs are often stacked in warehouses as large as airplane hangars and are monitored constantly  Each unit contains energy intensive processors that solve complex mathematical computations  When they do so  they are awarded them the right to validate a blockchain transaction  earning them a  mining  fee  One cryptocurrency expert said anecdotal evidence suggests on average miners would get their money back in about three months  But those with small  home based operations might have to wait much longer for a payoff  In Hong Kong  shopkeepers say most buyers come from Russia  but they have had clients from western Europe  Africa and South Korea  Singapore sees visitors from neighboring countries with cheaper operation costs  Their mining machines  parts are mostly manufactured in China using chips from Advanced Micro Devices  AMD   O AMD  and Nvidia  O NVDA   who are looking for export customers amid fears that Beijing will crack down on cryptocurrency miners   We ve been selling more these few months and we often run out of stock  as miners move elsewhere and components flood out of China  said Grant Mak of C  Base Computer   Jerry Wu  shop manager of Wisetek Digital Technology Co  Ltd  says selling cryptocurrency mining equipment is 50 percent more profitable than selling computer parts and brings him HK 50 000 to 60 000   6 400  7 673  a month in profits    The revenue is large   Wu said  CHIPMAKERS CAPITALIZE As miners hunt for deals on gear  chipmakers see opportunity  Rigs can cost anywhere from a few thousand dollars to tens of thousands or more   and processing chips are the priciest component  Samsung Electronics  KS 005930   the world s biggest microchip producer  said  explosive  demand for the graphics processors used in mining cryptocurrencies is driving fresh growth   A share of clients from the virtual currency industry is expected to grow dramatically this year in our foundry customer base   Lee Sang hyun  vice president of Samsung s foundry business  said during a conference call  Taiwan s Advanced Semiconductor Engineering predicted an upswing in demand this year for chips used for mining rigs  And Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd  TSMC   TW 2330   the world s No 1 foundry by revenue and volume  has embraced cryptocurrency mining as a business venture   But they know how fast that could change    The urge to mine cryptocurrency is very strong  The incentive  of course  depends on the price of cryptocurrency  And the price of cryptocurrency is very volatile  But the demand right now or for the last year has been very strong  and we expect it to continue to be strong   TSMC s chairman  Morris Chang  said on an earnings call last month    THEY TRUST SINGAPORE  Singapore s smaller version of Sham Shui Po  the electronics shopping center at Sim Lim Square  is also seeing increased demand for mining equipment  Anuj Agarwal  a 39 year old consultant for his brother s shop  Bizgram  said he has dealt with buyers from Vietnam  Malaysia  Indonesia and Russia    Foreigners come to Singapore as there is immediate supply of mining rigs here  and they trust Singapore as a country   he said  adding that some were as young as 16 and came with their parents   Nearby at Video Pro  Liu Xiao Yu said he cannot keep up with the demand   There was a customer who asked for a rig with 500 GPU cards  which amounted to over S 350 000   262 700    Liu said   There was another who came by last week asking for 1 000 GPU cards  but I am afraid to accept the offer as supplies are low now    One rig with GPUs usually has six to 12 such cards   Vendors say the 60 percent drop from an all time high of close to  20 000  BTC BTSP  did not deter their regular customers  who tend to own large mining operations   Individual players may be freaked out  but the big players do not really mind  Big players are our major customers   said Roy Chan  shop manager of BNW Technology in Hong Kong  In Singapore  some sellers saw a 40 percent drop in revenue as Bitcoin prices tanked  but the shops are unfazed   Once the value of Bitcoin increases again  we will receive multiple calls and emails from customers all over the world   Agarwal from Bizgram said

199705,421221,NVDA,Week Ahead   Volatility Will Dominate  Stocks  Yields  Oil Could Slip,opinion,"ECB annouces heavy stimulus in sign of economic gloom
3 month 10 year yield curve remains inverted  30 year Treasury yield hovers near all time low
Dollar notches highest weekly close in over two years

As the European Central Bank  ECB  returns to stimulus in a sign of desperation amid increasing signals of a global slowdown  we expect volatility will rule the markets this coming week 
As well  technicals for the unholy trinity of stocks  Treasurys and oil indicate the threesome are set to pressure markets further  extending the downward spiral 
ECB Measures Counterpoint To Trade Rhetoric 
After suffering the worst selloff of the year last week  U S  stocks rebounded Friday  for a second day  on hopes that European measures  which included reports that Germany might be willing to run a budget deficit in order to spur economic growth  would provide a positive counterpoint to the ongoing trade rhetoric  Still  equities finished lower on the week  for a third consecutive time 
Similarly  yields which were at the heart of the selloff rose Friday but plunged for the third straight week  The dollar advanced for a fourth day  Oil rose for the first week in three 
A short lived rally early last week spurred by the U S  decision to delay levying new tariffs on China till after Dec  15 ended after disappointing German and Chinese economic data exacerbated simmering concerns of a global slowdown  deepening the 3 month to 10 year yield curve inversion  inverting the 2 year 10 year curve and pressuring the 30 year yield which reached a record low of 1 916  on Thursday 
Nonetheless  investors bid up stocks Thursday  after the reports of major ECB stimulus turned the selloff into a buying dip  Olli Rehn  Finland s central bank governor and a member of the ECB s rate setting committee  said the eurozone central bank is getting ready to deliver a  very strong  stimulus package 
Traders became euphoric on Friday  driving up all four major U S  indices to over a percent gain each  with the Russell topping 2  
The S P 500 rose  1 44  Friday  with every sector in the green  Industrials outperformed   1 93   followed immediately by Technology   1 87   boosted by chipmakers after NVIDIA  NASDAQ NVDA  sales and profits beat expectations  and Materials   1 78  all trade sensitive sectors  Financials rebounded   1 76   even as the yield curve steepened 
On a weekly basis  the SPX was down 1 03   weighed by Energy which fell  3 52  despite oil s rise  For the week  Financials   2 21   were dragged down by plunging yields  Consumer Discretionary shares slipped as well   2 03   Over the same period  outperformers included Consumer Staples   1 5   followed by Utilities   0 84  and Real Estate   0 49  

Technically  the rebound of the benchmark index was a return move after the price completed a rising flag  bearish after the 6 8  top to bottom drop between July 26 and August 5  It was also its third day below the uptrend line since the December bottom  A drop below the 2 800 level  crossing below the 200 DMA  would establish a downtrend in the medium term 

The VIX may be signaling that equities will return to selloffs  The supply demand balance completed a double bottom and the price is consolidating right on the neckline forming a pennant continuation pattern 
An upside breakout will signal continued volatility  which tends to unnerve investors  driving them into a selloff  The VIX closed at the bottom of the pennant  raising the probability of a volatility spike 

After 10 year yields completed a bearish flag  they are now on course for additional declines  As things stand  the monthly chart is showing signs that 10 year yields will test the 1 4 level 
After posting its lowest rate on record Thursday  the 30 year closed slightly higher  at 2 044  That increases the possibility 10 year yields will resume their slide 

Oil was boosted after reports of Germany s possible pledge of stimulus offset demand concerns  Technically  however  we expect oil will return to its downward trajectory  after it fell below its August uptrend line  set to resume its falling channel since July 
Also  oil s technicals suggest volatility as the 50 DMA managed to climb back on top of the 200 DMA after falling below it during July

However  with Asia Pacific banks in easing mode  markets are expecting additional cuts before year end  If the Fed doesn t give investors what they want  we could expect newfound demand for the dollar  which finished the week at its highest weekly close since May 2017  after triggering a golden cross in May  for the first time since 2012

199713,421229,NVDA,Nvidia  NVDA  Tops Q2 Earnings And Revenue Estimates,opinion,"Nvidia  NVDA  came out with quarterly earnings of  1 24 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 15 per share  This compares to earnings of  1 94 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 7 83   A quarter ago  it was expected that this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence would post earnings of  0 82 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 88  delivering a surprise of 7 32  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times 
Nvidia  which belongs to the Zacks Semiconductor   General industry  posted revenues of  2 58 billion for the quarter ended July 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 30   This compares to year ago revenues of  3 12 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Nvidia shares have added about 12 4  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 13 3  
What s Next for Nvidia 
While Nvidia has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Nvidia was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

but declined 17  year over year  However  the top line rose 16  sequentially The better than expected results can be attributed to strength in automotive  gaming plus OEM and IP end markets  However  weaknesses in data center market were a spoiler Nonetheless  as the company witnessed a sequential progress across all its end markets  management expects the business to have  normalized  Top Line DetailsRevenues at the GPU Business fell 21  year over year to  2 1 billion  reflecting deterioration in the gaming and data center GPUs  However  on a sequential basis  the metric grew 4  Tegra Processor Business revenues worth  475 million inched up 2  on a year over year basis and 140  sequentially  driven by higher Automotive revenues  However  lower shipments of SOC modules for gaming platforms were a dampener On the basis of market platform  Gaming revenues were down 27  on a year over year basis to  1 3 billion due to decreased shipments of gaming desktop GPUs and SOC modules for gaming platforms  However  the same was up 24  sequentially  backed by better SOC modules for gaming platforms  gaming notebook GPUs and GeForce RTX SUPER gaming GPUs Notably  the launch of Super line of gaming GPUs is making the management optimistic  The rising momentum in the games supporting the ray tracing feature is a positive Meanwhile  revenues from Data Center deteriorated 14  year over year to  655 million as hyperscale customers witnessed soft sales from the segment  However  3  sequential growth was generated from a rise in enterprise revenues  aided by expanding AI workloads Automotive revenues in the reported quarter totaled  209 million  reflecting a 30  year over year and a 26  sequential increase  This upside was boosted by autonomous vehicle development deals and the solid uptake of AI based smart cockpit infotainment solutions  Most importantly  a new development service agreement  mostly with Volvo  has been a key driver Moving to Professional Visualization  revenues climbed 4  year over year and 9  sequentially to  291 million  Strength across mobile workstation products is a key catalyst OEM and IP revenues dipped 4  year over year to  111 million due

199725,421241,NVDA,Tech Giants Can t Beat Inner Mongolian Bitcoin Machines  Gadfly,news," Bloomberg Gadfly     Bitcoin pushed beyond  8 000 this week  a boon to those willing to pour money into a risky and speculative piece of code that s hoarded more than spent 
Number of Bitmain machines in Inner Mongolia
25 000
But the crypto craze is leaving behind the very technology companies that were meant to benefit without having to touch the stuff  Despite all the evangelizing about the blockchain s decentralized nature  the days of a global network of laptop toting techies mining Bitcoin from home or the coffee shop appear to be over  They ve been usurped by specialist firms with the resources to make their own powerful mining kit 
This isn t great news for big listed chipmakers such as Advanced Micro Devices  NASDAQ AMD   Inc  and NVIDIA Corp  NASDAQ NVDA    whose graphics cards have been used to do the power sucking computations needed to confirm transactions  These cards are made to handle sophisticated gaming graphics so they re very good at repetitive data crunching 
Still  they haven t kept pace as Bitcoin s supply cap puts ever greater computing demands on each new transaction confirmation  AMD and NVIDIA shares have done better than their peers in recent years  in part because of their usefulness to the crypto crowd  but their stock didn t react much to the latest Bitcoin highs 
For Bitcoin at least  it seems the only way for an equipment supplier to make money is to be involved in the whole chain  that is  make the mining gear  use it yourself and sell it to others  and trade the coins too  It s hard to imagine a  100 billion plus listed company getting that past investors 
Take the world s biggest Bitcoin mining collective  Bitmain  which runs 25 000 custom built machines in Inner Mongolia just to make about  250 000 in daily revenue  or  91 million annually  Why would a big chipmaker compete head on here  At  6 billion globally  Bitcoin mining revenues aren t worth the bet yet 
Bitcoin rival Ethereum is a slightly different story  and has buoyed sales recently at AMD and NVIDIA  Its algorithm is different to Bitcoin s and works better for miners wielding the kind of graphics cards  called GPUs  sold by the listed chipmakers than for those with specialized chipsets  Its price spike in May gave miners the chance to lock in profits quicker  and GPUs flew off the shelves 
Still  that demand surge might not last  The economics of Ethereum mining are getting harder  like Bitcoin s  And its developers are mulling a radical overhaul  which would make mining less about who has the most powerful processor and more about who has the biggest pile of existing tokens   Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS  analysts estimate that AMD s GPU revenue will fall to  1 2 billion next year from an estimated  1 5 billion in 2017  as Ethereum linked sales tail off  The bubble may deflate 
With AMD trading at 100 times this year s earnings  according to Bloomberg data  and NVIDIA at about 50 times  any tail off in crypto demand might hurt  Some of the inflation in the shares is to do with heightened expectations around eSports and data centers too  but it s tough to square the giddy valuations with future growth  Peer NXP trades at 18 times and is more exposed to the well established but technically promising autos sector  
Investors looking for stock market exposure to crypto will probably need to use more direct options such as Riot Blockchain Inc   a tiny digital currency company  or even  Square Inc   NYSE SQ    which is letting some of its app users buy Bitcoin 
For the chipmakers  there s still a hope that crypto s complex rules could be altered for the better  One new Bitcoin spin off   Bitcoin Gold   wants to be an algorithm that will benefit bedroom miners over the Bitmains of the world  But the higher Bitcoin goes  the stronger its  no change  defenders become

199729,421245,NVDA,Nvidia  NVDA  Stock Moves  0 14   What You Should Know,opinion,"In the latest trading session  Nvidia  NVDA  closed at  174 82  marking a  0 14  move from the previous day  This change was narrower than the S P 500 s daily loss of 0 16   Elsewhere  the Dow gained 0 11   while the tech heavy Nasdaq lost 0 44  
Prior to today s trading  shares of the maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence had gained 7 25  over the past month  This has outpaced the Computer and Technology sector s gain of 6 51  and the S P 500 s gain of 4  in that time 
Wall Street will be looking for positivity from NVDA as it approaches its next earnings report date  This is expected to be August 15  2019  On that day  NVDA is projected to report earnings of  1 15 per share  which would represent a year over year decline of 40 72   Meanwhile  our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of  2 55 billion  down 18 48  from the prior year quarter 
Looking at the full year  our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of  5 27 per share and revenue of  10 88 billion  These totals would mark changes of  20 63  and  7 15   respectively  from last year 
It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for NVDA  These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short term business trends  With this in mind  we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company s business outlook 
Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near term stock prices  Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank  This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple  actionable rating system 
Ranging from  1  Strong Buy  to  5  Strong Sell   the Zacks Rank system has a proven  outside audited track record of outperformance  with  1 stocks returning an average of  25  annually since 1988  The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0 66  lower within the past month  NVDA is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold  
Digging into valuation  NVDA currently has a Forward P E ratio of 33 2  This valuation marks a premium compared to its industry s average Forward P E of 18 71 
We can also see that NVDA currently has a PEG ratio of 3 54  The PEG ratio is similar to the widely used P E ratio  but this metric also takes the company s expected earnings growth rate into account  NVDA s industry had an average PEG ratio of 2 38 as of yesterday s close

199730,421246,NVDA,Earnings Preview  Nvidia  NVDA  Q2 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"The market expects Nvidia  NVDA  to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended July 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on August 15  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 15 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  40 7  
Revenues are expected to be  2 55 billion  down 18 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 98  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Nvidia 
For Nvidia  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Nvidia will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Nvidia would post earnings of  0 82 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 88  delivering a surprise of  7 32  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Nvidia doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-08-07,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-nvidia-nvda-q2-earnings-expected-to-decline-200453044,200453044

Bitcoin  8 000 in focus
Bitcoin surged to an all time high of  7 899 on Wednesday  before paring gains  after the developers behind the SegWit2x upgrade   which would have led to split in the digital currency   announced that they were suspending plans for the upgrade 
 Unfortunately  it is clear that we have not built sufficient consensus for a clean blocksize upgrade at this time  Continuing on the current path could divide the community and be a setback to Bitcoin s growth  This was never the goal of Segwit2x   a group of developers said in a note on Wednesday 
Investors are expected to monitor moves in bitcoin closely to assess demand for the digital currency now that a potential split in the underlying software supporting bitcoin has been averted 
Top tier US economic data on tap
In what has been subdued week on the economic calendar for top tier data  the labor department will release its weekly data on the number of people who filled for unemployment insurance for the week ended Nov 4 
The Labor department is expected to show initial jobless claims rose by 2 000 to 231 000 for the week ended Nov 4 
Trading volumes in the dollar have been relatively subdued as investors await top tier data for direction

Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is ON Semiconductor Corp  due for a breakout  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts  ON Semi Beats on Q1 Earnings  Revenues Lag EstimatesON Semiconductor Corporation delivered first quarter 2019 non GAAP earnings of 43 cents per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents  Moreover  the figure increased 7 5  year over year The company reported revenues of  1 386 billion  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 394 billion  Notably  the figure was within management s guided range of  1 365  1 415 billion  However  it grew 1  year over year Notably  ON Semiconductor Aizu Co   Ltd   or OSA accounted for  18 million of first quarter revenues  OSA refers to 8 inch wafer fab manufacturing joint venture based out of Aizu Wakamatsu  Japan Sturdy adoption and favorable product mix of the company s diversified product portfolio and end markets drove year over year growth amid soft demand from Greater China Recently  ON Semiconductor inked a deal to acquire the provider of high performance Wi Fi solutions  Quantenna Communications  Inc  The transaction is expected to strengthen the acquirer s connectivity portfolio Quarter in

about growing influence of its ADAS offerings Moreover  the company recently announced that its CMOS image sensors will support NVIDIA  NASDAQ NVDA  DRIVE Constellation simulation platform with real time data  NVIDIA leverages ON Semiconductor s superior imaging technology and is designed to bolster video adoption within IoT products and accelerate OEMs  ability to offer advanced solutions to the IoT market However  weakness in China weighed on segmental revenues growth Industrial  26   end market revenues decreased 5  year over year to  359 million  Softness in China region impacted industrial market However  the company s latest platform of products including high and medium voltage power modules aimed at providing higher efficiency hold promise  Management is also optimistic regarding the growing influence of company s products in medical domain  primarily in hearing and personal diagnostics markets Communications  19   end market revenues surged 15  year over year to  259 million  The company s strength in medium voltage MOSFETs is aiding it in penetrating key global markets  including 5G infrastructure Notably  slowdown witnessed in smart phone market was partially mitigated by increased adoption of its content on major platforms Computing  10   grew 1  year over year to  144 million  primarily on the back of sturdy server solutions domain Consumer  12   end market revenues came in at  160 million  The figure declined 15  from the year ago quarter  primarily owing to weakness in consumer electronics and white goods segment Operating DetailsNon GAAP gross margin of 37  contracted 60 bps on a year over year basis  OSA venture limited margin expansion by 50 bps in the reported quarter  Further  increase in select input costs impacted the margin Non GAAP operating expenses decreased marginally 0 7  from the year ago quarter to  298 5 million Non GAAP operating margin contracted 20 bps on a year over year basis to 15 5   OSA venture largely impacted operating margin Balance Sheet   Cash FlowAs on Mar 29  2019  ON Semiconductor had cash and cash equivalents of approximately  939 6 million  down from  1 070 billion reported in the previous

from operations came in at  138 2 million compared with the previous quarter s figure of  421 million  The company also generated free cash flow of   18 8  million compared with  289 million reported in the previous quarter The company repurchased 4 4 million shares worth  75 million in the reported quarter GuidanceFor the second quarter of 2019  ON Semiconductor forecasts revenues to be in the range of  1 360  1 410 billion  mid point  1 385 billion   given its booking trends  estimated turn level and backlog level  Revenues for second quarter include roughly  15 million from manufacturing services provided by OSA Seasonality and uncertainty in macroeconomic environment  primarily sluggishness in Greater China is compelling management to stay cautious  Softness in smartphone market and stabilizing capital expenses by cloud service providers  CSPs  remain concerns Non GAAP gross margin is projected to be in the range of approximately 36 5 37 5   Non GAAP operating expenses are

199801,421317,NVDA,Opening Bell  U S  Futures  Yuan Dip On Fears Of Trade Tariff Ramp Up,opinion,"U S  futures dive deeper into the red as investors dread Chinese tariff retaliation
European shares suffer highest selling volumes since Oct  10
Yen  Treasury climb on risk off
Key Events
Futures on the S P 500  Dow and NASDAQ 100 stood firmly in red territory this morning and European shares dropped as the U S  China trade war showed no signs of slowing down 

All charts powered by TradingView
The STOXX 600 slipped to the lowest price since March 25 and another 0 6  decline would push it to the the lowest level since March 12 as investors waited for details on China s retaliatory measures after the U S  pressed ahead with higher tariffs on imports from the Asian country on Friday  Stocks on the pan European benchmark sold off on the highest selling volume since October 10 a month and a half before the infamous global December rout  Technically  the index is in the making of a H S top  with the left shoulder formed with the head s low finding support by the lows of the left shoulder 
Germany s DAX in particular underperformed as the high dependence of its listed companies on exports means they would be harshly hit by any further expansion of trade tariffs from the U S 
In the earlier Asian session  the yuan extended a selloff while the yen and Treasurys advanced as investors ramped up their risk off positions  Perhaps  the most unnerving aspect of the renewed trade headwind  for traders  is the lack of a set date on when high level negotiations between the two economic powers will resume  An open ended risk comes as kryptonite for the market  as it carries the highest uncertainty 
Japan s Nikkei   0 79   suffered the highest volume tumble  amid a selloff since March 8  China s Shanghai Composite   1 21    conversely  slid on contracting volumes which somehow brightens the picture  as low participation may suggest the equity slide won t last  South Korea s KOSPI   1 38   extended a double top but the preceding rally hovered close to October 2018 January 2019 bottom  which was the lowest since November 2016  before the so called Trump trade skyrocketed stocks  Hong Kong s Hang Seng was closed in observance of the Birthday of the Budhha 
Global Financial Affairs
On Friday  U S  shares bounced back from what would have been a fifth day of declines  Although the rebound was insufficient to recoup the sharp losses of the previous few days  it did save the week from the dubious honor of being the worst since December s rout  And it was mainly defensive sectors that managed to seal some gains  demonstrating investor uneasiness  Investors also increased safe haven holdings such as the yen  Treasurys and gold though the precious metal s added demand was more likely a result of the weakening dollar 

The yield on 10 year Treasurys provided a downside breakout on an intraday basis  to a bearish pennant  resuming the medium term downtrend line since the November top  after falling below the short term uptrend line since March 28 

The yen strengthened against the dollar  with the USD JPY pair completing a double top on an intraday basis 

Gold fell even amid widespread risk off  as it became more expensive after the USD rise  The precious metal is struggling against the neckline of a H S top amid a return move  Its current trading pattern is creating a rising  bearish flag 
Overall  we argued that focusing on the ongoing trade headwind alone for a longer term coherent market strategy may not be the wisest option  Mixed signals on the future of trade talks continued on Monday as White House top economic adviser Larry Kudlow said there is a  strong possibility  that Trump will meet Chinese President Xi Jinping at a G20 summit in Japan in late June  On Sunday  he had acknowledged U S  companies and consumers stand to take a hit from the higher tariffs imposed by the White House on Friday 
Meanwhile  Bitcoin held onto gains above  7 000 after soaring as high as  7 448 on Saturday  Is the digital currency finally acting like the safe haven its enthusiasts have long claimed it to be

199810,421326,NVDA,STM Vs  NVDA  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors interested in stocks from the Semiconductor   General sector have probably already heard of STMicroelectronics  STM  and Nvidia  NVDA   But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors  We ll need to take a closer look to find out 
There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks  but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns  The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits 
Currently  STMicroelectronics has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Nvidia has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   Investors should feel comfortable knowing that STM likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than NVDA has recently  But this is only part of the picture for value investors 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics  These include the long favored P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company s fair value 
STM currently has a forward P E ratio of 16 56  while NVDA has a forward P E of 35 10  We also note that STM has a PEG ratio of 3 31  This figure is similar to the commonly used P E ratio  with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company s expected earnings growth rate  NVDA currently has a PEG ratio of 3 78 
Another notable valuation metric for STM is its P B ratio of 2 50  The P B ratio is used to compare a stock s market value with its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  NVDA has a P B of 12 13 
These metrics  and several others  help STM earn a Value grade of A  while NVDA has been given a Value grade of F 
STM has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than NVDA  so it seems like value investors will conclude that STM is the superior option right now ",2019-04-25,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/stm-vs-nvda-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200411745,200411745

199854,421370,NVDA,Nvidia Warned Us Earnings Are Bad  Watch For Signs Of Demand Recovery,opinion,"  Reports Q4 2019 results on Thursday  Feb  14 after the market close
  Revenue expectation   2 3 billion
  EPS expectation   0 71
Global chipmakers have done one thing right in this cycle where demand for their products is sliding fast  they have been able to manage expectations quite well 
When Nvidia  NASDAQ NVDA  reports fiscal fourth quarter 2019 earnings on Thursday  investors have already priced in the worst following the company s advance downward revision in Q4 guidance late last month 
Nvidia cut its outlook for Q4 revenue  citing weaker sales of  gaming and data center platforms   The industry s biggest maker of chips for computer graphics cards blamed a slowing global economy  especially in China  for its lagging growth 
It said it expected fourth quarter revenue of about  2 2 billion  down from a previous forecast of about  2 7 billion 

Earnings per share is likely to be just more than half of what the company made in the same period a year ago  following a  120 million charge that Nvidia said it will book associated with the updated revenue guidance and current market conditions 
But the biggest disappointment for us was the company s revelation that demand for its data center products is also facing a slowdown  That segment of the market was expected to help large chipmakers  like Nvidia  when their sales to cryptocurrency companies were almost wiped out after the collapse of that market 
Under Pressure Until At Least July
This broad based weakness suggests that it will take much longer than expected for chip producers to get back to their growth trajectory  especially when growth in China continues to slow and buyers wait for a further decline in prices for graphic cards  Nvidia generates roughly 18 percent of its revenue from China 
These multiple challenges are likely to keep Nvidia shares under pressure  at least for the first half of this year  After losing more than half of their value since the October high  Nvidia shares have risen just 3 percent in the past month compared with gains of about 13 percent in the Philadelphia Semiconductor index 
The downfall of this once high flying stock is also a reminder to investors that managing inventory in the graphics card market is one of the biggest risks to their earnings once demand dries up and customers stop purchasing 
Nvidia needs to clear inventory from both its crypto and PC gaming cards segments that built up in the current down cycle  The reduction in that inventory has proceeded largely in line with expectations  Nvidia said in the January update  But analysts expect the company s videogaming segment revenues to show year over year declines for the next three quarters 
At its peak in October  Nvidia was worth about  176 billion  nearly 5x its value from just two years earlier  The company is worth about  92 billion now 
Bottom Line
Nvidia s heavy exposure to crypto and gaming markets will continue to have a drag on its share price and we don t see a quick recovery to this down cycle anytime soon  With this bleak picture  investors should watch for any signs of demand recovery when Nvidia reports Q4 earnings and gives an update for 2019 ",2019-02-13,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/nvidia-warned-us-earnings-are-bad-watch-for-signs-of-demand-recovery-200387708,200387708

Nvidia  which belongs to the Zacks Semiconductor   General industry  posted revenues of  2 21 billion for the quarter ended January 2019  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6 94   This compares to year ago revenues of  2 91 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Nvidia shares have added about 14 5  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 9 8  
What s Next for Nvidia 
While Nvidia has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Nvidia was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  0 95 on  2 46 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  5 25 on  11 08 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Semiconductor   General is currently in the bottom 4  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2019-02-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/nvidia-nvda-q4-earnings-beat-estimates-200388517,200388517

199867,421383,NVDA,Qualcomm sees more China trouble  faces probes in U S   Europe,news,"By Noel Randewich SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters    Qualcomm Inc  O QCOM  warned on Wednesday that an antitrust investigation and problems collecting royalties could harm its business in China next year and it also disclosed new regulatory investigations in the United States and Europe 
China s expanding high speed 4G network is driving demand for smartphones with leading edge technology  but Qualcomm s opportunities have been clouded by an 11 month old antitrust investigation there 
Wall Street is worried  Qualcomm could face a fine of more than  1 billion in China as a result of the National Development and Reform Commission  NDRC  investigation  and the company could be forced to make concessions that would hurt its highly profitable business of charging royalties on phones that use its patents 
Qualcomm also said it faces a new probe by the European Commission about rebates and other financial incentives in the sale of its chips  Another preliminary investigation by the U S  Federal Trade Commission concerns a potential breach of licensing terms  the company said 
On Wednesday  Qualcomm s shares slid about 6 percent at  72 50 in extended trading from a  77 20 close on the Nasdaq 
 We re continuing to cooperate with the NDRC  We ve continued to meet with them regularly  exchange some ideas for potential ways to resolve it   Qualcomm President Derek Aberle said in a telephone interview   But we don t have an ability to update in terms of expectations and timing  
Qualcomm has also been struggling to collect licensing revenue from some device makers in China  including local manufacturers the U S  chipmaker has done little or no business with in the past 
Any concessions on royalties that Qualcomm is forced to make in China could spread to manufacturers in other countries  some investors said 
 What people are most worried about is the ability to fence in this issue to Chinese vendors if there s a reduced royalty rate  or does it spread to other geographies   Standard Life portfolio manager Brian Fox said 
Qualcomm said it was difficult to predict the outcome of the U S  and European investigations 
The European probe is separate from a four year old complaint to the European Commission from a subsidiary of Nvidia Corp  O NVDA  over alleged patent related incentives and exclusionary pricing by Qualcomm 
Qualcomm forecast revenue for fiscal 2015 of between  26 8 billion and  28 8 billion  Analysts on average expected  28 91 billion  according to Thomson Reuters I B E S 
The company also expects non GAAP earnings per share in fiscal 2015 to be between  5 05 and  5 35  Analysts on average expected  5 58 
The chipmaker reported revenue of  6 69 billion for its fiscal fourth quarter  ended Sept  28  up 3 percent from the year ago period  Analysts on average had expected  7 016 billion 

Qualcomm posted fourth quarter net income of  1 89 billion  up 26 percent from a year ago  GAAP earnings per share were  1 11  while non GAAP earnings were  1 26 per share

199868,421384,NVDA,Analysts Estimate Nvidia  NVDA  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Nvidia  NVDA  reports results for the quarter ended January 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 14  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 75 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  56 4  
Revenues are expected to be  2 37 billion  down 18 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 39 37  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Nvidia 
For Nvidia  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  5 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Nvidia will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Nvidia would post earnings of  1 91 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 84  delivering a surprise of  3 66  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Nvidia doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-02-06,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-nvidia-nvda-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200385070,200385070

 NEW YORK  Aug 7  Reuters    U S  stocks advanced on Friday
after the government reported fewer workers lost jobs in July
than expected  fueling hopes of an economic recovery and
providing solid footing for a recent market run up

percent in the prior month  the first time the rate had fallen
since April 2008 
  The data was a beat on many different numbers  including
manufacturing and average work week  It shows that not only are
people losing less jobs  but the trend of cutting back working
hours has changed   said Marc Pado  U S  market strategist at
Cantor Fitzgerald   Co  in San Francisco 
  It gives you confidence that if you have a job  you will
be able to keep it and you will be able to work more hours

199908,421424,NVDA,Here s Why You Should Buy Altair Engineering  ALTR  Now,opinion,Altair Engineering Inc    NASDAQ ALTR   is poised to gain from innovative product offerings  inorganic moves and ongoing strong momentum in software related services  Shares of the company have gained 3 6  in the past year against the Zacks  industry s decline of more than 30  Meanwhile  earnings estimates have been upwardly revised over the past few weeks  suggesting that sentiments on Altair Engineering are moving in the right direction  Also  earnings estimates for the to be reported quarter as well as 2018 have increased 11 1  and 3 2   respectively  over the past 60 days This positive trend justifies the company s Zacks Rank  2  Buy   indicating robust fundamentals and the expectation of

inorganic strategy for expansion and has wrapped up a wide array of acquisitions that contributed significantly to growth  The recent acquisitions of Datawatch  SIMSOLID  in October 2018  and FluiDyna GmbH  in May 2018  are classic examples  Datawatch is a data intelligence provider with market leading enterprise data preparation  predictive analytics and visualization solutions SIMSOLID is a CAD software company engaged in developing simulation technology  The company believes that SIMSOLID is a revolutionary technological breakthrough  which will have a profound impact on product design and deliver meaningful additional revenues to Altair Engineering over the next three years  On the contrary  Germany based FluiDyna GmbH is a renowned developer of NVIDIA  NASDAQ NVDA  CUDA and GPU based

13 1  sales growth in 2019 Overall  it constitutes a great pick in terms of growth investment  supported by a Growth Score of A Positive Industry Trends  Positive fundamentals of the simulation market have been providing plenty of growth opportunities for Altair Engineering and peers  There has been a constant demand for simulation solutions  in order to drive efficiencies in the design and production process  This is leading to shorter design cycles and more innovations with reduced costs Altair Engineering is benefiting from these ongoing positive industry trends as well as its focus

199910,421426,NVDA,Nvidia Stock Staging A Deceptive Elliott Wave Recovery,opinion,"The last three months of 2018 may have been bad for stock market investors in general  but few suffered more than NVIDIA Corporation  NASDAQ NVDA  shareholders  Nvidia stock climbed to an all time high of  292 76 a share on October 2nd  By December 24th it was down to  124 50  losing over 57  in less than 90 days 
So it turns out that despite its stellar performance in recent years  Nvidia is still a cyclical company  Due to the very nature of its products  the company simply cannot sustain good business results for very long  Combine this with people s uncontrollable greed during times of prosperity and you get the perfect setup for a spectacular crash when the tide eventually turns 
The obvious conclusion for stock investors is that they should seek to buy when the price nears a bottom and sell when it is at record highs  Unfortunately  so often they do just the opposite 
Now  with Nvidia stock cut in half  is it time to start buying or stay aside in anticipation of even more weakness  NVDA s stock price has been out of line with the company s fundamentals for so long that it would be foolish to rely on them now  Instead  let s try to decipher the market s intentions with the help of the Elliott Wave chart below 
The 4 hour chart of Nvidia stock shows the structure of the entire selloff from the vicinity of  293 to  124 50  As visible  it takes the shape of a textbook five wave impulse pattern  labeled 1 2 3 4 5 in wave  1 A   One of the Elliott Wave principle s rules states that within an impulse  wave 3 cannot be the shortest among waves 1  3 and 5 
Here  wave 3 is definitely shorter than wave 1  but it is longer than wave 5  so there is no violation of the rule  Another rule says that waves 1 and 4 cannot overlap in price  On the chart above  wave 1 ended at  176 01  while wave 4 terminated at  174 68  No violation again 
So what useful information can we extract from this chart  According to the theory  every impulse is followed by a three wave correction in the opposite direction  before the trend resumes in the direction of the five wave pattern 
Since Nvidia s impulsive decline seems complete  this means we can expect a notable recovery in wave  2 B   The resistance area near  180    190 looks like a reasonable bullish target  The MACD indicator gives another reason for short term optimism by revealing a strong bullish divergence between waves 3 and 5 of  1 A  
However  even if the bulls manage to exceed  190  Nvidia stock should be viewed with a grain of salt  We wouldn t be surprised to see Nvidia stock trading in double digits once wave  3 C  down begins  If this count is correct  the recent 57  crash did not make NVDA cheap enough

199944,421460,NVDA,Bitcoin s Death Spiral  And What To Buy Instead ,opinion,"Turkey wasn t the only thing getting roasted over Thanksgiving 
Bitcoin hit a low of just  3 550 04 per coin on Nov  25  That means the once vaunted cryptocurrency has now lost a staggering 82 13  of its value since hitting  19 870 62 a coin last December 
Just this month alone  Bitcoin s off 44 55  
There are all kinds of reasons being bandied about in the press about why it s happening  Everything from low trading volume to potential regulation are being cited as causal factors 
The real reason is far simpler 
People are losing faith 
We re talking about a  700 billion rout here  And  mind you  that s on top of more than what some sources estimate is a grand hacked haul of  15 billion to  20 billion 
Things are so bad that even Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss   they re the guys who sued Mark Zuckerberg for allegedly stealing the idea for Facebook  NASDAQ FB  from them   reportedly got pinched to the tune of  32 million by their former partner  Charlie Shrem   a Bitcoin tycoon recently freed from jail for his role in illegal Silk Road drug sales  Seems to me they have a problem choosing partners  but that s a story for another time 
The faithful don t see Bitcoin this way  of course 
To hear them talk about it  the gut wrenching drop is just part of the  maturation process  
In fact  Shrem himself told Cheddar   a digital business tech news site   that not having a centralized or trusted location  removes the ability for hackers to steal our money and our things   while also removing the possibility of corruption and embezzlement   All those things go out the window   I don t know if that s before or after he supposedly did both of those things to the Winklevoss brothers 
The irony is staggering either way 
The U S  Department of Justice is reportedly preparing criminal charges that allege price manipulation since Bitcoin s inception   not just for 50  of last year s meteoric rise   as studied by financial fraud detection expert and UT professor John Griffin and his graduate student  Amin Shams 
The United Kingdom s Financial Conduct Authority is investigating more than 50 firms suspected of running unlicensed crypto operations  according to The Telegraph and as reported widely Nov  26 
Japan s regulators are clamping down  and so are China s  The latter even went so far as to ban initial coin offerings and cryptocurrency exchanges within China s borders  while simultaneously cutting off access to mobile apps and exchange access earlier this year 
Meanwhile  Russia is pursuing plans to criminalize cryptocurrencies  Morocco  Algeria  South Korea  they re all defending their turf in one way or another 
Good thing 
There are more than 2 000  mostly worthless  cryptocurrencies out there  and consumers are getting fleeced left and right by fast talking crypto soothsayers promising the moon 
Even bottom pickers are getting clobbered at this point 
People like Micheal Novogratz  who famously said  6 000 a coin was  it    the low   via Twitter on Sept  13  are being forced to develop new narratives 

Even that won t ultimately save the day 
Bitcoin has no redeeming value whatsoever  except what the next person is willing to pay  That means you cannot tie it to an asset  nor can you make any kind of rational determination that it s undervalued or  even for that matter  overvalued 
Worthless  though  is pretty easy 
More than half of all cryptocurrency news sites and blogs are  pay to play   meaning contributors pay to publish articles without the telltale kiss of consumer skepticism killing label   sponsored   That s according to Corin Faife of Breaker in October of 2018 and reported by TechCrunch 
I think it s extraordinarily telling that an estimated 600 000 to 800 000 Bitcoin miners have gone out of business as prices have dropped  according to Mao Shixing  founder of F2Pool  The breakeven price for a  miner  is around  7 000  and rising   according to Bloomberg  citing Fundstrat Global Advisors 
That s a lesson in and of itself 
FEAR  PANIC  MISTAKES  RUIN  Investors likely don t have much time left before chaos strikes  and there s zero margin for error  Click here for details 
If Bitcoin  and every other cryptocurrency out there  is so great  why  then  is it valued in the very instrument opponents are ostensibly trying to get away from  U S  dollars 
And why  mind you  have the big boys   meaning the institutions   stayed largely on the sidelines  Usually they re the FIRST in line when there are profits to be had 
I digress 
The real question facing investors right now is how to invest in a  currency  you know is a sham at a time when it s dropping like a rock and the psyche surrounding it is changing  That requires a leap of faith 
I believe cryptocurrencies will have a role in our future  it s just not what the  utopists  think 
That means a two pronged approach 
First  buy NVIDIA Corp  NASDAQ NVDA    Nasdaq  NVDA  
The company has been beaten down 48  from the high of  292 76 a share it put in on Oct  2  The graphics chips it makes are critical to the kind of processing needed to successfully field a cryptocurrency  even if it s not Bitcoin or one of the current mish mash of popular alternatives like Ripple or Ethereum 
Put another way  the company simply won t disappear overnight 
I think traders will come rushing back in a quarter or two from now when NVIDIA works through the inventory  pricing  and product chain challenges that led to it getting hammered  And that  in turn  could easily cause a  melt up  rally as they chase performance 
Second  buy Visa Inc  NYSE V    NYSE  V  
Visa is ideally positioned to capture the lion s share of e commerce  which  by the way  may be growing five to 10 times as fast as face to face transactions  What s more  Visa s already completely digital  not a Johnny come lately cyber shill 
Visa stock is trading at  135 91 right now  which is 10 33  below the peak of  151 56 per share set on Oct  1  It s got a small dividend yield of 0 75   but that s hardly worth writing home about 
What catches my attention is the big picture Visa represents 
Visa is already global  which means that millions of merchants already use this technology to move money  Payment volumes are rising around 20  a year overseas  and that number is highly likely to accelerate as mobile connectivity jumps 
In fact  I think there s a good case to be made that Visa may be THE single best company positioned to form the bridge between cryptocurrencies and real money 
Which means  dare I say it  conventional thinking may actually save the day 
Digitally speaking  of course ",2018-12-02,Keith Fitz-Gerald,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bitcoins-death-spiral-and-what-to-buy-instead-200364257,200364257

199970,421486,NVDA,Nvidia  NVDA  Lags Q3 Earnings And Revenue Estimates,opinion,"Nvidia  NVDA  came out with quarterly earnings of  1 84 per share  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 91 per share  This compares to earnings of  1 33 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of  3 66   A quarter ago  it was expected that this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence would post earnings of  1 84 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 94  delivering a surprise of 5 43  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times 
Nvidia  which belongs to the Zacks Semiconductor   General industry  posted revenues of  3 18 billion for the quarter ended October 2018  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 79   This compares to year ago revenues of  2 64 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Nvidia shares have added about 1 9  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 1 1  
What s Next for Nvidia 
While Nvidia has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Nvidia was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  2 on  3 40 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  7 90 on  12 98 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

199988,421504,NVDA,Nvidia  NVDA  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Nvidia  NVDA  reports results for the quarter ended October 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on November 15  2018  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence is expected to post quarterly earnings of  1 91 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  43 6  
Revenues are expected to be  3 24 billion  up 22 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Nvidia 
For Nvidia  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  4 71  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Nvidia will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Nvidia would post earnings of  1 84 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 94  delivering a surprise of  5 43  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Nvidia doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2018-11-07,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/nvidia-nvda-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200357006,200357006

Investors will be hoping for strength from NVDA as it approaches its next earnings release  which is expected to be November 15  2018  In that report  analysts expect NVDA to post earnings of  1 91 per share  This would mark year over year growth of 43 61   Meanwhile  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of  3 24 billion  up 22 87  from the year ago period 
Looking at the full year  our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of  7 90 per share and revenue of  12 99 billion  These totals would mark changes of  60 57  and  33 72   respectively  from last year

For instance  the strikes that saw the two largest increases in open interest in the last two weeks are the September 250 and 255 calls  where a number of spread trades appear to have taken place  Following those two calls is the August 280 call  but data from the major options exchanges shows mainly sell to open activity here  suggesting some traders may be betting on a post earnings volatility crush  Consider that the  280 level corresponds with a 9 3  move from NVDA stock  roughly in line with the implied earnings deviation being priced in by the options market 
Traders have certainly been buying calls  as well  Take the equity s 10 day call put volume ratio of 1 74 at the International Securities Exchange  ISE   Chicago Board Options Exchange  CBOE   and NASDAQ OMX PHLX  PHLX   Not only does this show that call buying handily outpaced put buying during the past two weeks  but it ranks in the 78th annual percentile  showing such heavy call buying is unusual

China s yuan gains  US dollar slips


Metals selloff eases  copper rebounds after sliding into bear market territory


WTI drops to 10 week low as a US inventories build stokes shrinking demand fears


Key Events
Global selling eased in the European session  as investors turned more optimistic on a possible de escalation of the US China trade war  sending US futures on the S P 500  Dow and NASDAQ 100 higher  The pan European STOXX Europe 600 edged higher as well  with some sectors in green territory helping the index pare some of yesterday s 1 36 percent losses 
Earlier this morning  during Asian trade  disappointing earnings reports pressured most Asian indices  Hong Kong listed Tencent  HK 0700  tumbled 3 percent after earnings missed expectations  Profits for the Chinese tech giant slipped 2 percent to  2 59 billion for the time first in 13 years  The company recently stopped selling the video game  Monster Hunter  World  on regulatory concerns  but analysts remain broadly positive on Tencent s outlook  viewing the current decline as short lived 

The tech giant s falling shares deepened the stock s bear market since June 27  when the price per share dipped below the 20 percent threshold from the January 29  476 60 top  The stock is now down 32 percent since the peak  Technically  between November 2017 and July 2018 it completed a massive H S top 
Global Financial Affairs
Overall  sentiment across equity markets was boosted by reports that China s vice commerce minister will visit the US in late August  The Chinese yuan climbed higher on the news  which in turn should help ease recent accusations by the Trump administration that its main trade opponent is manipulating its currency 
The    Turkish lira   continued to strengthen for a third day after the country moved to curb short selling  while Qatar pledged  15 billion to the country s battered economy  Still  it seemed that the damage has already been done  as emerging market shares slipped  flirting with a bear market  This may deal a fatal blow to EM assets  already vexed by recent US dollar strength 

The USD ticked lower on Thursday  alongside US Treasurys  as investors shifted to risk on sentiment  Technically  the decline confirms yesterday s shooting star  a candle that projects a failed bullish advance 
During yesterday s US session  equity bulls faced the worst US stock selloff in seven weeks as Tencent s earnings miss weighed on technology shares  At the same time  copper entered a bear market  which dragged down commodities overall 

The red metal is now more than 20 percent below the June 7  3 297 peak  However  it is re gaining ground today  helping other metals rebound as well 
The S P 500 dropped 0 76 percent  pressured by Energy stocks  which lost 3 54 percent on oil s lowest price in 10 weeks 

WTI crude lost more than 3 percent on Wednesday  crossing below the  65 threshold on the US inventories weekly release  which showed the most significant supply rise since March 2017  Stockpiles increased by 6 81 million barrels last week  against expectations for a 2 5 million barrel drawdown  Technically  for the first time since November 14  the price fell decisively below the commodity s uptrend line 
Higher inventory numbers stoked fears that the Turkish crisis is adding to the US Sino trade dispute  squeezing oil demand 
The SPX s second worst performer yesterday was Materials  which slid 1 59 percent as trade sensitive sectors led the selloff 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average gave up 0 54 percent  The NASDAQ Composite slipped 1 23 percent  and the Russell 2000 edged 1 27 percent lower  The underperformance of small cap stocks versus larger cap shares listed on the Dow can be explained by a sentiment led selloff driven by ongoing Turkish contagion fears 

In FX markets  Hong Kong policymakers intervened to support the Hong Kong dollar after the currency fell to the lower boundary of its trading band  Technically  this is the fifth time that the HKD threatened to drop below the 7 85 percent level since April

200070,421586,NVDA,Has NVIDIA  NVDA  Outpaced Other Computer And Technology Stocks This Year ,opinion,"The Computer and Technology group has plenty of great stocks  but investors should always be looking for companies that are outperforming their peers  Has NVIDIA  NVDA  been one of those stocks this year  A quick glance at the company s year to date performance in comparison to the rest of the Computer and Technology sector should help us answer this question 
NVIDIA is one of 630 companies in the Computer and Technology group  The Computer and Technology group currently sits at  9 within the Zacks Sector Rank  The Zacks Sector Rank gauges the strength of our 16 individual sector groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups 
The Zacks Rank emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions to find stocks with improving earnings outlooks  This system has a long record of success  and these stocks tend to be on track to beat the market over the next one to three months  NVDA is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy  
The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NVDA s full year earnings has moved 16 17  higher within the past quarter  This is a sign of improving analyst sentiment and a positive earnings outlook trend 
Based on the most recent data  NVDA has returned 37 09  so far this year  At the same time  Computer and Technology stocks have gained an average of 9 60   As we can see  NVIDIA is performing better than its sector in the calendar year 
Looking more specifically  NVDA belongs to the Semiconductor   General industry  a group that includes 8 individual stocks and currently sits at  9 in the Zacks Industry Rank  This group has gained an average of 22 97  so far this year  so NVDA is performing better in this area 
NVDA will likely be looking to continue its solid performance  so investors interested Computer and Technology stocks should continue to pay close attention to the company ",2018-06-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/has-nvidia-nvda-outpaced-other-computer-and-technology-stocks-this-year-200325742,200325742
200095,421611,NVDA,How Big Is Nvidia s  NVDA  Share Of The Cryptocurrency Market  ,opinion,"Once just a popular brand among diehard PC gamers  Nvidia   NASDAQ NVDA   has stepped into the spotlight over the past few years and is now one of the most popular tech companies on Wall Street  The stock is an interesting option not only because its graphics chips are still a hot commodity to its core audience  but also because the emergence of several news businesses has created unlimited growth potential 
Thanks to a variety of new applications for its GPU and SoC devices  the Santa  Clara  California based processor manufacturer is now a major player in many high growth markets  including datacenters  self driving cars  and cryptocurrency mining 

But of course  not all of these new businesses are made the same  While datacenter demand continues to rise and self driving cars approach their commercial debut  cryptocurrencies have tumbled from their New Year highs and appear more volatile than ever 
Still  cryptocurrency mining a process that sees users rewarded with new coins or tokens when they volunteer their own computing power for blockchain maintenance can be profitable when executed correctly  and miners continue to pick GPUs made by Nvidia and rival AMD   NASDAQ AMD   to power the top end computers needed for the task 
Nvidia has been reluctant to acknowledge the new business it has seen from crypto miners  with management seemingly eager to guard itself from the volatility associated with cryptocurrency market  In fact  Nvidia CFO Colette Kress told analysts that cryptocurrency s contribution to the company s business was still  difficult to quantify  as recently as the Q4 2018 conference call 
But that task has apparently gotten easier  or Nvidia has finally decided to pull the curtain back a little more  Speaking to analysts during the firm s latest earnings conference call in the wake of its solid Q1 2019 report executives like Kress and CEO Jensen Huang were much more detailed with their answers to crypto related questions 
 Cryptocurrency demand was again stronger than expected  but we were able to fulfill most of it with crypto specific GPUs  which are included in our OEM business at  289 million   Kress said   Looking into Q2  we expect crypto specific revenue to be about one third of its Q1 level  
Nvidia reported total quarterly revenue of  387 million in its OEM segment up nearly 150  from the prior year period so the company is effectively saying that about 75  of this business came from crypto specific processors 
Nvidia s decision to market crypto specific GPUs speaks to the concern that demand from miners might cause supply issues for traditional customers like gamers  But with nearly  300 million in sales in the quarter and likely more  since miners could still buy gaming GPUs Nvidia is dominating its key competitor in this market  AMD 
Christopher Rolland  an analyst from Susquehanna Financial  touched on these points in the conference call  eventually asking   Is there a pricing dynamic that s allowing you to have such share there  or do you think it s your competitors that don t know what s actually being sold to miners versus gamers  
Huang fielded these questions  describing his company s efforts to point miners toward Nvidia s crypto specific solutions and reminding analysts that fulfilling demand is  just not possible  but stopping short of speculating what Nvidia is doing better than competitors right now 
But the numbers don t lie  If AMD s estimation that 10  of its sales in the most recent quarter came from crypto  that means the company saw about  160 million in revenue from that market  If Nvidia truly does control two thirds of this market  it is clearly doing something right 
Of course  just how big of an impact that two thirds slice will have in the future remains to be seen

200128,421644,NVDA,Can Nvidia  NVDA  Keep Up Its Massive Growth  ,opinion,"Shares of Nvidia   NASDAQ NVDA   have dipped slightly since the GPU power reported yet another quarter of impressive top and bottom line growth last week  Now the question is will Nvidia continue to expand at its current pace  or are its days of rapid growth numbered 
Q1
Nvidia posted adjusted first quarter earnings of  2 05 per share  which crushed our Zacks Consensus Estimate and marked a 141  surge from the year ago period  The Santa Clara  California based company s Q1 revenues soared 66  to  3 21 billion  This also topped our Zacks consensus estimate 
Investors were also likely pleased to see that Nvidia s highly important Gaming revenues skyrocketed 68  to  1 72 billion  It is this outsized top and bottom line expansion that has helped shares of Nvidia skyrocket over 101  during the last year 
Nvidia s main GPU business has helped fuel the company s overall growth  And GPUs will become even more important as high resolution gaming expands  But aside from the transition to 4K likely benefiting Nvidia down the road  the company also looks poised to become a major player in everything from artificial intelligence to self driving vehicles   
Another key growth area  the company s Datacenter unit  saw its revenues climb by 71  in the first quarter   Our datacenter business achieved another record and gaming remained strong   CEO Jensen Huang said in a company statement 
 At the heart of our opportunity is the incredible growth of computing demand of AI  just as traditional computing has slowed  The GPU computing approach we have pioneered is ideal for filling this vacuum  

Looking Ahead 
With all that said  investors must assess Nvidia s future growth prospects in order to make a more informed decision about its stock 
Nvidia expects to report second quarter revenue of  3 10 billion  plus or minus 2   Nvidia s midpoint top line outlook comes in above our current consensus estimate that calls for Q2 revenue of  2 97 billion 
On its face this revenue estimate doesn t provide much information at all  so let s dive a bit deeper  If Nvidia reports Q2 revenues of  3 10 billion it would mark a 39  surge from the prior year period 
Investors will also want to understand how some of Nvidia s key business units are expected to perform  Luckily  we can turn to our exclusive non financial metrics consensus estimate file to prepare  The Zacks Consensus NFM file contains detailed estimate data for business segment metrics and non financial metrics reported by companies 
Based on our latest consensus estimates  Nvidia s GPU revenues are expected to hit  2 76 billion in the second quarter  which would mark a roughly 46  climb from  1 89 billion  Meanwhile  the company s Datacenter business is projected to surge 85  from  416 million to reach  771 1 million 
Furthermore  Nvidia s Automotive business is expected to reach  152 25 million  This would mark just a 7  expansion from the  142 million the company reported in the second quarter last year  But investors should remember that the self driving and connected vehicle age has barely begun 
Bottom Line 
Investors can clearly see that Nvidia s growth isn t expected to slow down  based on these second quarter estimates  They should also be pleased to note that Nvidia is projected to see its earnings climb by over 67  in the second quarter and nearly 45  in the current full year 
Furthermore  while Nvidia waits for some up and coming industries to become more viable and popular  its vital Gaming unit is projected to surge nearly 50  to touch  1 77 billion in the second quarter

US equities rally despite Trump s withdrawal from Iran deal and rising Treasury yields

Investors brace for Bank of England s policy decision  US inflation data

Key Events
This morning  European indices ended what could have been a perfect 24 hours for global markets as they edged lower  spoiling the upbeat performance posted by their Asian counterparts on the back of a surprisingly bullish US session  Investors faced two primary risk factors during the global trading session 

Italy s former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi cleared the path for the populist 5Star Movement and far right Lega parties to form a coalition government  Should this occur it would boost the eurosceptic movement across the continent and ratify the anti establishment shift seen in the US with Donald Trump s presidential victory  The move also reignites fears over EU political stability  which has come under pressure following the Brexit vote in June 2016 
Middle East tensions escalated following Trump s withdrawal Tuesday from the the Iran nuclear deal  with Israel retaliating against Iranian forces in Syria on Thursday after Iranian missiles fired at Israel s Golan Heights 

The STOXX Europe 600 traded lower  pulled down mostly by utility companies  US futures for the S P 500  the Dow and the NASDAQ 100 on the other hand  look unfazed by widespread uncertainty  They re all heading higher ahead of the upcoming US consumer prices release later today 
On Thursday morning  most Asian stock benchmarks advanced  with China s Shanghai Composite  Hong Kong s Hang Seng  Japan s TOPIX and Nikkei 225 and Australia s S P ASX 200 all posting gains 

However  shares on the TOPIX fluctuated intra session  posting an obvious negative correlation to the yen  thereby once again underscoring how sensitive Japanese shares are to the whims of speculators who trade the yen  ever since it managed to replace the Swissy as the world s most popular safe haven currency in the last few years 
Global Financial Affairs
The upbeat Asian session followed the unexpectedly resilient performance posted by US equities in the aftermath of Trump s exit from the Iran deal  Oil s continued rally  past the  71 a barrel level for the first time since 2014  was instead more predictable  WTI prices are extending that rally today  nearing  72 and trading at yesterday s highs 
Yields on 10 year Treasurys retreated  closing half basis point below the crucial 3 percent mark after yesterday reaching an intraday high of 3 014 percent  The benchmark note has continued to ease further on Thursday  US stocks seem to have taken the 3 percent breach in Treasury yields in stride as well 
Elsewhere  former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad overwhelming won yesterdays election  reclaiming his former position as well as ending the six decade rule of Prime Minister Najib Razak s party in a landmark shift for the South East Asian nation  Malaysian markets are expected to be closed Thursday and Friday after the government declared public holidays 
The shocking result sent the iShares MSCI Malaysia ETF  NYSE EWM  to its biggest slump in almost 2 1 2 years  Malaysia s 2045 bonds plunged  to a low last seen in 2016 
Yesterday  Wall Street indices rallied vigorously  The S P 500 climbed 0 97 percent  with only defensive sector Utilities   0 7 percent  in the red  Naturally  Energy outperformed  2 04 percent  on the outlook of 1 million barrels a day removed from the oil market after the US reinstated sanctions against Iran 
Financials came in second   1 48 percent   benefiting from the 10 year Treasury yield crossing the 3 00 percent mark once again intraday  Rising yields drove the dollar index higher for a fourth straight day on the outlook of higher interest rates  Those would increase profits for banks  boosting their share values 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 182 33 points or 0 8 percent  with 23 of the 30 biggest US companies ending the day in the green  The NASDAQ Composite gained 73 points or 1 percent 
We forecast that a US withdrawal from the Iran deal would boost oil prices as well as the dollar  while sending equities lower  As such  yesterday s equity bullishness was clearly shocking 
Not only did the risk of an imminent war in the Middle East became more tangible  but US yields returned above 3 percent  remember  rising yields even long before they reached that key psychological level are what sent the stock market into its first double digit correction since February 2016 
While the combination of low unemployment and muted wage growth may be seen as favorable for economic growth in a Goldilocks Economy  record yields pave the way for a spike in interest rates  which no one would see as positive for markets 

Therefore  we consider this short term bullish movement the prelude to a mid term  if not longer term  bearish move  While we reiterate that equity investors have been tuning out geopolitical headwinds since the 2016 Brexit vote  the fact that they re also disregarding the accelerated risk of a spike in rates after being bearish about that very same event leads us to see the current trend as driven by greed  and expect the S P 500 push will be thwarted as it approaches the top of the triangle 
Of course  should the top of the triangle be breached  we would be forced to reconsider our bearishness 

Meanwhile  we would argue that 10 year yields completed a bullish Falling Flag  eyeing the 3 16 percent level 
Earlier today the New Zealand dollar plunged after the central bank left the door open to an interest rate cut as inflation remains contained  Australia s 10 year bond yield dropped to its lowest level against the greenback since the 1980s

200139,421655,NVDA,BTC s Retreat Pains Short Term Traders,opinion,"The cryptocurrency market continues to suffer losses on Friday  with bitcoin down almost 4  on the day  The coin failed to keep above the key  9 000 threshold and slipped to April 26 lows at  8 676  Should this level give up  we may see a decline toward  8 400 and then to the  8 000 area 
Apart from the technical signals  which are getting more bearish after a break below  9 000 and the 100 DMA  there are some other drivers behind the continued correction from highs close to the  10 000 barrier  Some negative pressure came from NVIDIA  NASDAQ NVDA   as the tech firm predicted a big drop off in cryptocurrency mining demand in the second quarter of 2018  Another source of the increased selling pressure was the news that Mt  Gox trustees have moved another  80 million of digital currency into cold storage 
While the current retreat in the BTC USD pair is rather painful for short term traders who may continue to take profit in the nearest future  long term holders of the digital currency still have nothing to worry about  as the price will likely rise again and challenge the December highs around  20 000 in a wider horizon ",2018-05-11,Helen Rush,https://www.investing.com/analysis/btcs-retreat-is-painful-for-shortterm-traders-200315442,200315442

200143,421659,NVDA,Pre Earnings Nvidia Options Traders Target Volatility Crush,opinion,"Graphics processing units maker NVIDIA  NASDAQ NVDA  is scheduled to report first quarter earnings after tomorrow s close  The stock has been in a long term uptrend  and earlier topped out at a record high  Given NVDA s history of positive earnings reactions  the security could be in store for even more upside tomorrow  with the options market pricing in a big swing in either direction 
Data from  pegs Nvidia s implied daily earnings move at 10     though this is slightly lower than the 11  single day post earnings move the stock has averaged over the last two years  In those eight quarters  the equity has closed higher the next day six times  including the two most recent 
Sentiment toward NVDA is hardly enthusiastic ahead of earnings  The weekly 5 11 260 strike call has seen the biggest rise in open interest over the past 10 days  Data from the major options exchanges shows mostly sell to open activity here  While it s likely that these call writers expect  260 to serve as a ceiling through Friday s close  it s also possible they re hoping to profit from a volatility crush after earnings 
Elsewhere  10 of 25 analysts maintain a  hold  or  strong sell  rating on the stock  while the average 12 month price target of  251 75 is right in line with current trading levels  Another post earnings upside move could have these brokerages following in the footsteps of Barclays  LON BARC   which may create even bigger tailwinds

200144,421660,NVDA,Kiwi Tumbles  BoE Decision And US Inflation In Focus,opinion,"Here are the latest developments in global markets 

FOREX  The US dollar index was practically flat on Thursday  ahead of the release of the US CPI data for April at 1230 GMT  Kiwi dollar plunged nearly 1 0  overnight  after the RBNZ kept its policy unchanged but shifted to a more dovish bias  keeping the possibility of a rate cut on the table  Sterling dollar traded 0 2  higher  as investors awaited the BoE s rate decision today at 1100 GMT 
STOCKS  Wall Street closed higher yesterday  with energy shares leading the way higher amid a surge in oil prices  The Nasdaq Composite climbed by 1 0   while the S P 500 and Dow Jones followed in its tracks  rising by 0 97  and 0 75  respectively  Futures tracking the Dow Jones  S P  and Nasdaq 100 are also pointing to a higher open today  That said  the performance of these indices today may depend to a large extent on the upcoming US CPI data  Most indices in Asia were in the green as well  Japan s Nikkei 225 and Topix indices rose by 0 39  and 0 27  correspondingly  while in Hong Kong  the Hang Seng gained 0 96   In Europe  futures tracking the major benchmarks were also signaling a higher open today  especially for the UK FTSE 100 
COMMODITIES  Oil prices posted another day of spectacular advances on Wednesday  and continued pushing higher today as well  with WTI and Brent crude climbing by 0 8  and 0 7  respectively  Both benchmarks touched fresh multi year highs  The US decision to leave the Iran nuclear accord  a surprising drawdown in the EIA weekly crude inventories  and reports of armed conflict between Israel and Iran appear to be the main forces behind oil s latest gains  In precious metals  gold is higher today but by less than 0 1   recouping some of the losses it posted yesterday  It has been trading in a very narrow range so far this month  between  1 301 and  1 318  largely overlooking reports of rising tensions in the Middle East


Major movers  Kiwi retreats as RBNZ appears dovish  oil races higher amid geopolitical tensions
Overnight  kiwi dollar sank nearly 1 0  after the RBNZ kept its policy unchanged but shifted to a more dovish stance  putting the possibility of a rate cut on the table  In the introductory paragraph of the accompanying statement  the new Governor Adrian Orr noted that  the direction of our next move is equally balanced  up or down  Only time and events will tell   While the prospect of a rate cut appears highly unlikely  this likely signaled the new RBNZ chief will be even more cautious in raising rates than his predecessor  pushing further back rate hike expectations 
Oil continued racing higher yesterday  as markets digested the US decision to impose new sanctions on Iran and after a surprising drawdown in the weekly EIA inventory data  The surge in crude also boosted the Canadian dollar  which posted a one week high against its US counterpart 
Turning to geopolitics  safe haven assets like gold and the yen paid little attention to overnight reports of hostility between Israel and Iran  The Israeli military carried out strikes against Iranian targets in Syria  after Iranian forces launched a rocket attack on Israeli army bases  Israel said  This marks a direct confrontation between the two states  raising the risk of escalation just hours after the US withdrew from the Iran deal  While safe havens didn t react  these reports may have been one of the factors behind oil s rally  Overall  this story is worth watching closely  as any further tensions could carry wider implications for the region s stability and consequently  for oil supply moving forward  
Day ahead  BoE decides  US CPI due  geopolitics still a play  The Bank of England s decision on interest rates and US inflation figures are expected to be the most market sensitive events out of Thursday s calendar  leading to positioning in FX markets 
At 1100 GMT  the Bank of England s rate decision will be made public  with the meeting minutes and the Bank s Inflation Report also released at the same time  Markets widely expect the central bank to maintain its base rate unchanged  Its communication and the number of Monetary Policy Committee  MPC  members voting for a rate hike though  will determine sterling s movement  Polls suggest a 7 2 vote in favor of rates remaining at current levels  More dissenters  i e  more MPC members voting for a hike  and signaling of a  hawkish hold  that puts a hike firmly on the table in an upcoming meeting  is anticipated to push sterling higher  and vice versa 
Before the focus turning to the BoE  the UK will be on the receiving end of data on the goods trade balance  industrial output and manufacturing output  All data points are due at 0830 GMT and pertain to the month of March  Manufacturing production is forecast to fall by 0 2  m m  the same as in February  but grow at a faster pace on an annual basis  2 9  vs 2 5  in February  
Later  1230 GMT   the attention will shift to the US which will see the release of April inflation figures  as gauged by the consumer price index  CPI   Both headline and core CPI   the latter being the measure that excludes volatile food and energy items   are expected to accelerate on a yearly basis  growing at their fastest pace in more than a year  Specifically  they re projected to expand by 2 5  and 2 2  correspondingly  Monthly headline CPI is also expected to return to positive territory after last month s contraction  which was attributed to transitory factors 
The inflation numbers do not relate to the Fed s preferred inflation gauge   that being the core PCE price index   but still can stoke expectations of a steeper interest rate outlook by the US central bank in case of an upside surprise  According to Fed fund futures  markets have fully priced in two additional hikes by the Fed in 2018  while they assign a more than 20  chance for an additional move as well  Meanwhile  weekly data on initial and continued jobless claims out of the US will be made public at the same time as CPI numbers  1230 GMT  
NVIDIA  is among companies releasing quarterly earnings on Thursday  The chipmaker s results will be made public after today s closing bell on Wall Street 
Lastly  geopolitical developments are a factor to be looked at  especially after President Trump s decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal and a possible regional conflict escalation  as Syria  Iranian forces within the country  and Israel appear to be carrying out attacks against one another  
Technical Analysis  GBP USD short term bearish  RSI oversold
GBP USD has contracted considerably after rising to its highest since June 2016 of 1 4376 around mid April  On Tuesday  it touched a four month low of 1 3484  The negatively aligned Tenkan  and Kijun sen lines are projecting a bearish short term picture  The Kijun sen has flatlined though  the implication being that negative momentum is easing  The RSI  which is moving sideways in bearish territory  supports this view as well  notice also that the indicator has entered oversold levels 
A  hawkish hold  by the BoE is anticipated to support the pair  with resistance potentially coming around the current level of the Tenkan sen at 1 3638 and the 1 37 handle in case of steeper advances 
A dovish tone by the central bank is expected to push GBP USD lower  Support could emerge around Tuesday s four month low of 1 3484 and subsequently the 1 34 handle in the event of sharper losses 
US inflation figures are also likely to spur positioning on the pair ",2018-05-10,XM Group,https://www.investing.com/analysis/kiwi-tumbles-boe-decision-and-us-inflation-in-focus-200314911,200314911

Bitcoin to Bounce Back with Tax Day Pressure Passed

NVIDIA  NASDAQ NVDA    NVDA  has been in the news a lot lately  Tied to Bitcoin mining for its excellent graphics chips  whenever the price drops in line with a drop in Bitcoin it is deemed the cause  Just like when Bitcoin was rising it was deemed to be pulling NVIDIA stock price up with it  That tie may be true  at least to some extent  but the price of NVIDIA stock has been rising in a steady channel since May 2016  Where Bitcoin is off 63  from its high in November  NVIDIA is about flat to that level after the recent pullback 
The rise has been along its 100 day SMA and the current pullback found support there last week  The up day Friday confirmed a Morning Star reversal off of that 100 day SMA  The RSI also turned higher Friday  but has been trending lower in a channel  The MACD is falling and now negative as it starts to level out  There is support at 218 and 204 then 198 50 and 195 50  Resistance higher sits at 240 and 252  Short interest is low at 2 1  and the company is expected to report earnings next on May 7th 
The April options chain shows biggest open interest at the 250 strike on both sides  The May 11 Expiry options just opened Thursday and look to have very little open interest  but show an implied move between now and expiry of about  30  The May monthly chain has been around longer and shows open interest concentrated at 210 on both sides and then the majority above with a spike at 250  June options have biggest open interest at 230 on the call side with size holding up to 250 as well  On the put side it is biggest lower centered on 210

After reviewing over 1 000 charts  I have found some good setups for the week  These were selected and should be viewed in the context of the broad  picture reviewed Friday which as the books closed on the 1st Quarter of trading saw the equity indexes with their first down quarter in over 2 years and hanging onto long term bullish trends by a thread 
Elsewhere look for Gold to consolidate with a downward bias while Crude Oil turns from an uptrend to consolidation  The US Dollar Index continues to move sideways while US Treasuries are biased higher  The Shanghai Composite and Emerging Markets look to continue to consolidate  the Shanghai Composite at the retest of lows and Emerging Markets at their highs 
Volatility looks to remain elevated keeping pressure on the equity index ETF s SPY  NYSE SPY   iShares Russell 2000  NYSE IWM  and PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ   Their charts show that the bleeding has stopped in the short run  but no strength for a reversal at this point  That said the longer trend remains to the upside  Use this information as you prepare for the coming week and trad em well

200216,421732,NVDA,Snap Falls On Layoff Announcement As Redesign Issues Persist,opinion,Snap Inc    NYSE SNAP   is losing steam as concerns about its growth potential are rising The redesign of the Snapchat app has garnered significant negative response  which doesn t bode well for the company s advertiser base Moreover  celebrities like Rihanna are using nearest competitor Facebook s   NASDAQ FB   Instagram to criticize Snapchat s advertising practices  This has significantly dented its brand value Snap s back to back layoffs have now come under scrutiny  The concern regarding the company seems to have aggravated with its current revelation to cut down 100 sales and advertising employees  after terminating 120 engineers in March In a recently filed 8 K  the company mentioned that it anticipates to save around   25 million in 2018 and  34 million on an annualized basis  pertaining to the restructuring of the workforce We believe further cost cutting without any significant rise in top line may not be enough to boost profitability in 2018  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 is currently pegged at a loss of 53 cents per share  narrower than loss of 55 cents over the last 30 days Notably  shares of Snap plunged almost 9  to close at  14 46 on Apr 2  In the past year  shares have lost 35 3  against 33 1  growth of its  Stiff Competition HurtsSnap has been introducing features to make the platform more attractive but these are yet to contribute meaningfully to top line growth  This is largely due to the highly competitive environment in which the company operates The user base of Facebook owned Instagram  its biggest rival  is way higher than Snapchat and thus presents a much larger canvas for advertisers Per market research firm eMarketer  U S  user base of Instagram will grow 13  this year  while that of Snapchat s is projected to rise 9  Snap should therefore focus more on creating innovative products in order to lure more users to the platform and increase engagement levels  The termination of so many engineers thus raises questions about its strategy Moreover  per a latest survey by Digiday  42  of the respondents said that Snapchat was the most difficult platform for digital advertisements  Therefore  layoff of so many sales and advertising employees is alarming for a company  which is entirely dependent on advertising revenues Is a Rebound Possible In the first three quarters of 2017  Snap s slowing user base and revenue growth rates posed major concerns for its stakeholders  However  the company reversed the decelerating growth trend in the last reported quarter  which led to a steep rise in its shares We note that the fourth quarter results of the company were mainly driven by robust ad spending by large brands during the holiday season  Management forecast a slowdown in sequential growth for the current quarter We believe Snap s inability to attract advertisers coupled with the latest uproar over redesign amid stiff competition from its well established peers remain a concern  at least in the near term Snap Inc  Price   Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderCurrently  Snap has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  Some better ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Paycom Software   NYSE PAYC   and NVIDIA Corporation   NASDAQ NVDA    both sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see Long term earnings growth rate for Paycom and NVIDIA is projected to be 24 8  and 10 3   respectively The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce   the world s first trillionaires    but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early ,2018-04-02,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/snap-falls-on-layoff-announcement-as-redesign-issues-persist-200302716,200302716

establishes a trend  it is more likely to continue in that direction instead of moving against the drift  Unlike the hugely followed Value or Growth styles  this strategy has barely anything to do

these emotional responses and mistakes are the very reason that momentum strategy works  For instance  we all know of investors who are afraid to book losses  and hence hold on to losing stocks for too long  hoping that they will spring back  Conversely  a few investors sell their winners way too early Furthermore  investors initially tend to under react to news  events or data releases  However  once things become clear  they tend to go with the flow and overreact  causing dramatic price reactions These behavioral problems extend trends and thus open up huge opportunities for momentum players  So basically  it s a way to profit from the general human tendency to extrapolate current trends into the future Momentum investing is based on that gap in time that exists before the mean reversion occurs  i e  before prices become rational again Momentum Versus Other StylesIt is worth reflecting over how the momentum strategy compares with other styles of investing over time  Recent research indicates that the size premium for small cap stocks has shrunk dramatically since the 1980s and value premium has declined radically since the 1990s  Academics are of the opinion that once research on factor premiums  like size and value  becomes known to public  the investment world catches on and the premium gradually erodes However  unlike other investment styles  momentum premium

200278,421794,NVDA,Market Rally Boosts Household Net Worth  5 Top Ranked Picks,opinion,On Mar 8  a report of Federal Reserve stated that the U S  household wealth moved further into record territory of  98 75 trillion in the fourth quarter of 2017  This big push in household wealth was primarily driven by stock market rally and soaring real estate prices The U S  economy is currently positioned on a strong growth trajectory  The unemployment rate is near its 17 year low at 4 1   Expected gains in incomes  jobs and after tax pay of U S  consumers are successfully mitigating worries about rising interest rates Although the boost in household net worth was powered by the real estate boom and stock market rally  real estate prices in the United States is nearing its peak level  However  stock market momentum remained largely unhindered despite the correction experienced in February  This is why it makes great sense to invest in those stocks which provided significant returns in last year Net Worth Spikes in Q4The Federal Reserve report stated that U S  household net worth  including the value of all assets like stocks and real estate less liabilities like mortgage and credit card debt  increased more than  2 trillion in the fourth quarter of 2017  The value of U S  stock portfolios jumped  1 35 trillion in the October December quarter while the value of real estate grew  511 2 billion Household borrowing rose at a 5 2  per annum in the same time period with liabilities increasing by  208 6 billion  Consumer credit increased at a 7 8  annual rate from 3 6  sequentially  Households have  9 272 trillion in deposits  which include checking and savings accounts as well as certificates of deposit Real Estate Prices Hit Peak LevelsOn Mar 1  2018  global property analysts CoreLogic reported that U S  house prices have returned to peak levels  recovering 51  nationally after plummeting 33  during the recession a decade ago In the third quarter of 2017  home equity experienced a year over year gain of  14 888  This reflects that the housing market has widely recovered since the trough of 2008 2009 recession periods  But since home prices have already hit peak levels  further gains in real estate value were unlikely to occur in the near future Stock Market Continues to Fly HighDuring 2017  the S P 500 index surged 20  and the Dow grew 25   Several Wall Street experts believe that the index will increase 5 10  in 2018 courtesy of tax cuts and continued strength in the economy  A recent survey among economists by The Wall Street Journal predicted U S  GDP growth of 2 8  in 2018  better than 2 5  in the fourth quarter of 2017 Moreover  the S P 500 declined in February 2018 by nearly 10  primarily due to a stock market correction  Subsequently  the benchmark has recovered and is currently up 2 4  year to date  Information Technology  Consumer Discretionary  Financials and Healthcare are primarily responsible for the recovery  The fact that the rally has the resilience to recover from the recent downturn means that it is unlikely to peter out quickly Our Top PicksSubstantial increase in wealth could make many Americans more confident and lead them to spend more fueling economic growth  According to Edward Wolff of New York University  in 2016  average household wealth had fully recovered from the Great Recession and was 7  higher than it had been in 2007  But median wealth was still 34  below its pre recession level  This implies that there is sufficient headroom for household wealth to increase further in the days ahead All the above mentioned factors are likely to help the stock market maintain momentum albeit at a slightly slower pace in 2018  The U S  bull market is celebrating its ninth birthday in March  and if it continues till August  it will officially become the longest in history At this stage  we have narrowed down our search to the following stocks  each of which has a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and

200303,421819,NVDA,Chart Of The Day  SOX Signals Bitcoin Is Going Down  Again ,opinion,"Intermarket Analysis Suggests Bitcoin is Going Down  Again
You know that we re bearish on Bitcoin 
In this analysis  we will provide confirmation of potential bearishness with another  related asset  Yesterday  SOX  the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index closed more than one percent lower  dragged down by NVIDIA Corporation  NASDAQ NVDA    3   and Advanced Micro Devices Inc  NASDAQ AMD    2 45    both of which are companies that make graphic cards used for mining cryptocurrencies  These graphic card makers were most likely dragged down by Bitcoin s 6 75  decline 

Yesterday s decline occurred at the same level of two peaks ago  when a potential right shoulder of an H S top was forming  The RSI reveals that momentum has been falling  in negative divergence to the price action  While the January price peak of near 1 400 is higher than the preceding  November peak at the 1 340 level  the RSI peaks have fallen from an oversold 83 7 level to an oversold 75 level  As well  Tuesday s price reached higher than the November peak  while its corresponding momentum via the RSI is drastically lower  at 52 
The pattern will complete with a downside breakout of the neckline at the 1 200 level  which would also include a fall below the uptrend line since June 27  2016  when prices fell in the aftermath of the Brexit vote  as well as the 50 dma  green   100 dma  blue  and possibly the 200 dma  red   which is pointing at the supply demand focal point  the infamous neckline 
Trading Strategies   Short Entry Set up
Conservative traders would wait for a downside breakout of the neckline  with a minimum of 3  penetration  to avoid a bear trap  They may even wait for a crossing below the flatter uptrend line since February 2016 
Moderate traders would wait for a downside breakout  with at least a 2  penetration  Then  depending on their equity management  they may wait for a potential return move to the neckline  for a closer entry and a smaller exposure  The price for such security is that there might not be a return move  On the other hand  the price for not waiting for a return move is the risk of a false breakout and a larger exposure  That is the risk reward balance traders must understand and accept  if they want a shot at ongoing success 
Aggressive traders may short now  They might wait for the price to retest yesterday s or Tuesday s high price for a better entry as described in the previous paragraph  for moderate traders 
Stop Losses  Above Levels 

1 353 36   Tuesday s high price
1 393 40   January 23 s high price

There are many trading strategies available for the same instrument in the same time  A trader must establish a plan  which would include his resources and temperament  This is crucial and determines success or failure 
Pair entries and exits should provide a minimum 1 3 risk reward ratio  They should suit your time frame  with the understanding that the further the prices  the longer it will take to achieve them  Finally  understand that these guidelines are probability based  which means by definition they include losses on individual trades  with the aim of profits on overall trades ",2018-02-22,Pinchas Cohen/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/chart-of-the-day-200292893,200292893

200329,421845,NVDA,Will Higher Expenses Hit TripAdvisor s  TRIP  Q4 Earnings ,opinion,"TripAdvisor Inc    NASDAQ TRIP   is slated to report fourth quarter 2017 results on Feb 15  Last quarter  the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 5 9  
TripAdvisor does not have a decent surprise history  The company missed estimates in two of the trailing four quarters  with an average negative surprise of 7 1  
The company s shares have lost 26 6  in the past 12 months  underperforming the  s gain of 50 7  

Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to Consider
In the last reported third quarter  TripAdvisor s average monthly unique visitors on the company s branded websites and applications reached nearly 455 million  increasing 17  year over year  The number is expected to expand in the upcoming quarter driven by its rich content  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the upcoming quarter is pegged at  347 million 
TripAdvisor s Hotel segment revenues of  312 million decreased 4  sequentially and 3  from the year ago quarter  Also  click based advertising revenues decreased 5  from the year ago quarter and accounted for 44  of total revenues 
Lately  the company has been making efforts for travelers to book hotels directly on its website instead of just using it as a review site  These efforts will continue to boost the company s clicked based advertising and transaction revenues  expanding its top line growth in the upcoming quarter 
TripAdvisor s Non Hotel segment revenues of  127 million increased 30  sequentially and 26  from the year ago quarter  The growth will continue to accelerate  driven primarily by continued strong traction of attractions and restaurant businesses 
However  mounting expenses due to new initiatives and investments are hurting the company s profits  Also  management has been spending huge amounts on acquisitions  Though these continued investments could boost the top line  it can have a negative impact on the company s near term profitability 
What Our Model Says
According to the Zacks model  a company with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive   Sell rated stocks  Zacks Rank  4 or  5  are best avoided 
However  TripAdvisor has a Zacks Rank  3 and an Earnings ESP of  9 40

200330,421846,NVDA,Bitcoin Finds Resistance At  9 000,opinion,"Cryptocurrencies are following a sideways trend  On the one hand  we ve seen some crypto investor relief after SEC and CFTC representatives at the U S  Senate hearing unequivocally decided not to impose any limitations on cryptocurrency trading on a national level  though the IRS plans to put together a control group to monitor operations on the cryptocurrency market  On the other  the Japanese National Tax Agency has started classifying profits from cryptocurrency trading as  miscellaneous income   meaning that investors will incur between 15 55  tax  depending on income level 
Governments find it difficult to monitor or control decentralized cryptocurrencies  yet they are indeed in position to monitor fund withdrawal to traditional currencies  fiat money   stock exchange activities  retail investors and mining companies

200338,421854,NVDA,Should You Buy Nvidia  NVDA  Ahead Of Earnings ,opinion,"Shares of Nvidia   NASDAQ NVDA   opened about 2  higher on Thursday  just hours before the company is set to report its fourth quarter financial results for fiscal 2018  This popular chipmaker has emerged as a favorite tech stock on Wall Street  and investors can expect its latest earnings report to attract significant attention 
Nvidia designs graphics processing units  GPUs  and system on a chip units  SoCs   The Santa Clara  California based firm s traditional business focuses on delivering GPUs to the gaming market and SoCs to the mobile computing market 
But Nvidia has exploded over the past two years thanks to the adoption of its technology in several booming new tech industries  In fact  Nvidia is now considered a leading supplier for  smart  vehicles  datacenters  cryptocurrency mining  artificial intelligence  and autonomous driving 
On the back of these major growth catalysts  Nvidia shares have skyrocketed more than 90  within the past 52 weeks  Of course  this share price explosion has also ushered in much bigger expectations for the company  and investors can bet that the pressure will be on Nvidia to deliver a solid report this afternoon 
Latest Outlook
Based on our latest Zacks Consensus Estimates  we expect Nvidia to report adjusted earnings of  1 16 per share and total revenues of  2 67 billion  These results would represent year over year growth rates of 17 2  and 22 8   respectively 
But of course  earnings and revenue are just two of the many things investors will be concerned with when Nvidia reports on Thursday  Considering the interest in the company s specific business segments  it is entirely possible that the stock s post earnings momentum is determined by Nvidia s performance in key units 
To prepare for this  we can turn to our exclusive non financial metrics consensus estimate file  The Zacks Consensus NFM file contains detailed estimate data for business segment metrics and non financial metrics reported by companies  The data is acquired from digest and contributing broker models and includes the independent research of expert stock market analysts 
Nvidia investors are always interested in hearing about the firm s exciting growth catalysts  but it is also important to track its core video gaming business  Our consensus estimate file is calling for Nvidia to report Gaming revenues of  1 581 billion  up about 17 3  from the year ago period  Nvidia was able to notched 25 5  growth in this business last quarter  so investors will hope that management can prove a strong holiday shopping season by posting a positive surprise here 
Meanwhile  investors are going to want to pay special attention to Nvidia s Datacenter business  which has been one of its fastest growing units in recent quarters  In the previous fiscal period  Nvidia reported Datacenter revenues of  501 million  up 108 8  from the year ago period 
Our current consensus estimates are projecting Datacenter revenues of  549 million for the fourth quarter  That result would represent 85 5  year over year growth  While that rate of expansion is certainly nothing to scoff at  investors have grown to expect triple digit Datacenter growth recently  Look for this to be a catalyst for the stock if Nvidia can surpass estimates 
Earnings ESP
Investors will also want to anticipate the likelihood that Nvidia surprises investors with better than anticipated earnings results  For this  we turn to our Earnings ESP figure 
Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst estimates  This is done because  generally speaking  when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release  it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago 
A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat  In fact  our 10 year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70  of the time 
Just hours ahead of its report  Nvidia is sporting a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and has an Earnings ESP of 4 23   That is because the company s Most Accurate Estimate for earnings sits at  1 21 per share  meaning that the most recent analyst estimates have been higher than the consensus  This improved outlook is a good sign heading into the report 
Price Performance and Surprise History
Another important thing to consider ahead of Nvidia s report is the company s history of earnings surprises and the effect that these surprises have had on share prices NVIDIA Corporation Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   Nvidia clearly has an impeccable earnings surprise history  The company has only missed estimates once over the past five years  and a positive surprise tends to lead to nice surge for the stock  That has not always been the case  but the trend over the past two years of rising share prices has been pretty impressive during earnings season 
Nevertheless  Nvidia shares will likely trade in response to anything that company management says about forward looking expectations and guidance  Another thing to remember is that Nvidia will likely be taking a huge one time charge related to the recent U S  tax reform bill  This will result in a significant difference between GAAP and non GAAP results  but the overall impact of tax reform could lead to favorable earnings guidance for the next few quarters

200380,421896,NVDA,Setting Stop Loss Orders For Covered Call Writing ,opinion,"After entering our covered call writing trades  we immediately go into position management mode  For most of us who started our stock investment careers buying and selling stock  this may include setting stop loss orders to mitigate losses when share price declines  For example  if we purchase a stock at  40 00  we may set a stop loss order at 10  meaning we are instructing our broker to sell the shares if market price drops to  36 00 or lower 
Definitions
Stop loss order  This is an order to sell a stock when its price declines to the stop price  At that point  the stop loss order becomes a market order  best available price 
Stop loss limit order  This is a combination of a stop loss order and a limit order  Once activated  it becomes a limit order which can only be executed at a specific price or better
Additional considerations for covered call writing
Since our long stock position is protecting  hence the term  covered   our short call position  we do not want to set a stop loss order on the stock side and end up susceptible to being in a risky naked option position  Furthermore  there are several scenarios where we may benefit from closing the short call but want to retain the long stock position  An example of this would be when an overall market decline brings down the price of a stock but there is no negative corporate news  Here we may close the short call using our 20  10  guidelines and then consider  or  hitting a double 
More management possibilities
Some broker platforms offer  where long and short positions can be entered and executed simultaneously  In these instances  the trades can be entered with a pre determined stop loss price point 
Some platforms offer one triggers other  OTO  orders  These are two stage brokerage orders  wherein we enter an initial order for a stock sale  for example   and simultaneously place a second order that is contingent upon the fill of the first order  Here we can instruct our broker to buy back the short call option and  once executed  sell the corresponding stock 
Using the 20  10  guidelines  NVIDIA Corporation  NASDAQ NVDA  example
We can automate the buyback of the short calls using our 20  10  guidelines  With NVDA trading at  171 02 on 8 9 2017  let s have a look at the 30 day expiration options chain for calls 

Initial calculations using the multiple tab of the 

The calculator shows an initial return of 5 2  with the possibility of an additional 2 3  if share price moves to the  175 00 strike  This provides an opportunity for a 1 month 7 5  1 month return 
Setting limit orders on the option side
Once both legs of the trade are executed  we can immediately set an option stop loss order using our 20  10  guidelines  This would be a buy to close  BTC  order at  1 80  20  of  8 95  in the first half of the contract and   0 90  10  of  8 95  in the latter part of the contract  These orders should be listed as GTC  good til cancelled   Should these stop orders be executed  we can then decide whether to roll down  wait to  hit a double  or sell the shares 
Discussion
When setting stop loss orders for covered call writing we must factor in avoiding ending up in a naked option situation  The use of buy write combination forms  OTO orders and stop loss orders using the 20  10  guidelines are techniques that must be considered to accomplish this goal

200392,421908,NVDA,AMD  NVIDIA Stocks Rise Due To Ethereum Mining,opinion,"The recent crash in  prices had many investors upset  but the stock for Advanced Micro Devices Inc  NASDAQ AMD  and NVIDIA  NASDAQ NVDA  is on the rise due to high sales of GPUs to power Ethereum mining 
Ethereum Mining Profit
Cryptocurrencies across the board plummeted in value after a record month in December  leaving many crypto enthusiasts on edge  For investors in NVIDIA and AMD  however  things have never been better 
A note on Tuesday from Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS  analysts reports that Ethereum prices have still remained high overall despite the recent crash  growing around 8900  over the past year  Even with the drop  the profitability of Ethereum mining has climbed over 200  since October  according to analyst Joseph More  It remains one of the highest performers overall and is quickly catching up to Bitcoin in terms of market cap  and the potential for profit has driven more and more individuals and organizations to Ethereum mining 
Morgan Stanley estimates regarding the profitability of Ethereum mining suggest that miners earn around  1 76 per day with each GPU owned  Fortune reports that this is a pretty sizeable increase from the 56 cents back in October  These figures assume that the miner is using an AMD Radeon 580 and pays around 70 cents per day to power the electricity 
These figures may seem very low and not worth the time  but when you consider that entire organizations have cropped up in order to take advantage of Ethereum mining  the only real limitations to the process are the supply of graphics cards 
And it turns out that the supply is an issue after all  Much to the  that are trying to get their hands on a GPU to play their favorite games  most of the high end cards on the market have been snatched up by individuals or companies that are looking to turn a profit on Ethereum mining  NVIDIA has even gone so far as to suggest that retailers only sell to those looking to use the cards for gaming  as they were unable to keep up with demand 
Although the lack of stock is concerning  the sales for both NVIDIA and AMD were higher than anticipated and that was reflected in the companies  stock  Based on the increased profitability of Ethereum mining and the flurry of sales that accompany this untapped potential  Morgan Stanley raised its estimates for Q1 2018 to  2 81 billion for NVIDIA and  1 43 billion for AMD  Second quarter estimates were even better  with expectations of  2 55 billion for NVIDIA 
Sure enough  the stocks of both AMD and NVIDIA both rose 2  during trading on Tuesday 
The Problem of Sustainability
Despite the boost in sales for AMD and NVIDIA due to Ethereum mining  there are some problems with sustainability when it comes to this avenue of revenue  Due to the climbing prices of high end GPUs  the potential profit for Ethereum mining continues to decrease as time goes on  resulting in a certain point where the mining won t be worth the initial investment 
Cryptocurrency is also incredibly volatile  with prices spiking and crashing almost daily  While the profit of Ethereum mining has increased overall when compared to the last year  there s always the possibility that a crash will erase any profits which could spell the end for NVIDIA and AMD s boosted sales 
Also worth noting is the potential of governments to have an effect on cryptocurrency mining in general  A recently leaked document from Chinese officials suggested that they would soon crack down on currency mining within the country  which is a problem for many large Ethereum mining corporations  as many call China home due to the low costs of utilities  Outside of regulations specifically affecting Ethereum mining  the hesitation of traditional financial institutions to embrace the world of cryptocurrency has led to some decisions that have impacted the price of these coins across the board  such as strict regulations from Korea that restrict access to currency trading 

 We are raising estimates meaningfully for both graphics vendors  but sustainability is a long term issue especially for AMD   said Morgan Stanley analysts on Tuesday 

Whether or not these profits are here to stay is   but at least in the short term  AMD and NVIDIA stock prices are set to rise   largely due to the influence of Ethereum mining  Provided the companies can ramp up production and keep both gamers and miners satisfied  we could see a significant period of increased sales for the GPU manufacturers  Only time will tell if Ethereum mining will continue to be a profitable endeavor  and the success of the mining will make or break the stock increase for the two main graphics card manufacturers ",2018-01-24,ValueWalk,https://www.investing.com/analysis/amd-nvidia-stocks-rise-due-to-ethereum-mining-200282904,200282904
200404,421920,NVDA,What The Softbank Spinoff Really Means,opinion,"Japanese conglomerate SoftBank Group  OTC SFTBY  may be spinning off its mobile phone business in an effort to raise more capital  According to CNBC  Softbank will sell 30 percent of its shares of this subsidiary and raise 2 trillion yen   18 billion   making it one of the biggest Japanese IPOs in decades 
The initial report stated that Softbank would apply for an IPO in the spring  and would launch in Tokyo at some point between March and May to be possibly be followed by going public in London in the autumn  However  Reuters reported that Softbank made an official statement that while launching some an IPO was a potential strategy to raise capital  no such decision had yet been made 
If Softbank plans to move forward with such plans  it would find a new and willing audience and would be able to further fund its aggressive investing strategy into tech companies across the globe  Softbank and investors would gain alike  and so everyone should hope that this denial is just a temporary brake which will give way to an interesting IPO 
Funding Investment
Softbank is one of the most complicated companies in the world  with a wide array of holdings across the world including Sprint and Alibaba  NYSE BABA   Group Chairman and CEO Masayoshi Son has been burning through cash for years to fund these acquisitions  and that was before the establishment last year of the  100 billion Vision Fund backed by Softbank s holdings and funds from businesses and government across the globe  The Vision Fund has investments in public and private companies such as NVIDIA  NASDAQ NVDA   OneWeb  and SoFi  and it is clear that Son wants to essentially become the Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa  of tech companies 
But that requires funds  and Softbank has had debt problems for years  Its bonds are below investment grade with Moody s and S P  and yet it wants more capital to fund further acquisitions  By creating the Softbank Group spinoff focused on its successful and profitable mobile phone business  it can raise capital without incurring additional debt 
The spinoff also has other benefits for the parent company  Cautious investors who would be leery of Softbank s bold forays into multiple tech companies may be perfectly happy to look into the more stable spinoff  Son would be free to focus on technology as appears to be his inclination  and his company would have additional capital to make investments which could pay off massively over the long run 
Softbank Group s Prospects
If Softbank was to spin off its mobile business  it would raise capital for its tech investments  attract interest and investors  and designate a smooth delineation between its mobile phone business and its investments  But how would the mobile phone business fare  As noted above  it is stable and profitable  The Washington Post reports that Softbank s phone service accounts for 36 percent of Softbank s revenue yet 67 percent of its operating income  Japan is famously phone happy  and its profitability means that the spin off could get loans at lower rates compared to the parent company  Confidence in the Japanese economy also appears to be improving thanks to growth for seven straight quarters  though there are continued concerns about how demand will grow with the demand for men s facial moisturizer as the population rapidly ages and shrinks  Any spinoff would also face intense competition from cheaper phone carriers and the need to keep up with advancing technology 
Nevertheless  there is every reason to believe that a Softbank mobile phone spin off would be a reliable  profitable company worthy of investment  
Will There Be A Spinoff 
Given that Softbank has not indicated that it intends to launch a spin off at all  it is possible that this speculation becomes sound and fury signifying nothing  But if it does move forward  this would be a huge  highly interesting move which could benefit investors as well as both companies alike 
It should be noted that there are some downsides  If Softbank spins off the most profitable part of its company  investors may feel that Softbank is nothing more than a colossal pile of debt and investments which may not pay off quickly enough  Softbank would also have a harder time funding future acquisitions in the long run as some of the phone company s profits would have to be diverted to pay shareholders 
But the risk is probably worth the reward  and investors should be positively interested if Softbank decides to go through with the maneuver  The fact that Softbank is willing to treat assets like tradeable commodities is a good sign for a company aiming to become the investment tech company of the world ",2018-01-16,Alex Newman,https://www.investing.com/analysis/what-the-softbank-spinoff-really-means-200280712,200280712

200441,421957,NVDA,Ambarella Diversifies To Counter Lower Revenues From GoPro,opinion,"On Jan 5  we issued an updated research report on Ambarella  Inc    NASDAQ AMBA   Notably  Ambarella  a producer of video compression and image processing semiconductors is facing decline in revenues from one of its major customer  GoPro   NASDAQ GPRO    However  we remain encouraged by the company s foray into other markets  such as IP security  automotive  non GoPro wearable and drones flying cameras The company posted better than expected results for third quarter fiscal 2018  keeping its earnings streak alive for the 10th time in a row  However  the company registered year over year declines in its top  and bottom lines  primarily due to a notable plunge in chip sales to GoPro  softness in the drone market and increased operating expenses Nevertheless  Ambarella stock has gained 27 1  year to date  substantially outperforming the 12 4  rally of the  it belongs to 

Influencing FactorsAmbarella is pretty well known for its cost and power efficient high performance video processing SoCs  These highly configurable chips are suitable for wearable camera  IP camera  automotive dashboard cameras and drone camera makers Additionally  in an effort to diversify its exposure and decrease its dependency on GoPro  Ambarella entered the VR camera space with the launch of H3 SoC in January last year  The company claims that the chip will work  well in high end drones and VR cameras  Though this space is already occupied by well established players like NVIDIA   NASDAQ NVDA   and Advanced Micro Devices  NASDAQ AMD   the company has the potential to solidify its foothold in this space given its track record of innovation Moreover  Ambarella is planning to make chips for Internet connected security camera companies and drone manufacturers using the technologies of VisLab that the company acquired in July 2015  Furthermore  with the combined technology  the company is anticipated to target auto manufacturers later  which is yet another positive Ambarella  Inc  Revenue  TTM    However  the company is witnessing slowing sales growth rate and deteriorating operating margin  The company  which has registered over 25  sales growth since 2012  suffered a decline for the first time in fiscal 2017  Also  its operating margin  which increased til fiscal 2016  contracted for the first time in fiscal 2017 
Notably  declining revenues from GoPro will continue to adversely impact Ambarella s near term performance  In fiscal third quarter 2018  GoPro s contribution to total revenues went down to 20 7  from 30  in the year ago quarter  which along with softness in drone market resulted in a year over year decline of 11 4  in Ambarella s overall revenues Moreover  the company is facing increasing threat from QUALCOMM   NASDAQ QCOM    which is acquiring NXP Semiconductors to augment its presence in the same space  We are also apprehensive about the company s disappointing guidance for the forthcoming quarter as well as downbeat revenue outlook for fiscal 2018 Nevertheless  its strategic initiatives to overcome the negative impact of the decreasing contribution of GoPro and diversify poise this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock well  This is also validated by its long term earnings growth rate of 14 75  You can see

200474,421990,NVDA,5 Big Myths Of Technical Analysis,opinion,"Is there one system of technical analysis that makes all the others crumble in defeat 
If there were  giant quantitative trading houses like Citadel and Renaissance Technologies would not be employing hundreds of PhDs in mathematics  engineering  and computer science to develop hundreds of new algorithmic programs for exploiting market opportunities 
But does that mean we should abandon technical indicators as a bunch of inconsistent noise that we can t use to compete against the quants  mega firepower 
No way  There are plenty of terrific technical tools and methods that can enhance your stock selection and swing trading  But  first you need to clear away five big myths and pitfalls that get in the way of seeing how to use them 
1  Everything Is Reflected in Price
Even though  8 trillion is indexed to the S P 500 for fundamental reasons by mutual  pension  insurance  and hedge funds  the pure technician believes that the chart holds all the information you need about supply and demand for a stock  They say you don t need to pay attention to fundamentals because  price tells you what the institutional investors think of the fundamentals  
But using a simple indicator that measures earnings momentum    the Zacks Rank    I can show you how thousands of stocks were first discovered to have potential fundamental greatness that led to tremendous returns  Take NVIDIA  NASDAQ NVDA  for example  The Zacks Rank spotted this one as a winner at  25 in 2016  and throughout the second half of 2017  NVDA was a Zacks  1 Strong Buy as shares climbed from  140 to  215 
If markets were completely rational and everything was always reflected in NVDA s price  smart investors who combine  technicals  and fundamentals wouldn t have made 4X to 8X their money in NVDA shares the past two years 
2  Trend Lines Are Meaningful
Markets are the most complex and dynamic systems on the planet  Indeed  they are social beasts with nearly infinite variables and geometric drivers  So why do  old school  traders still draw straight lines connecting price highs and lows    over months or even years of economic events and data    and expect a non linear system to obey them 
Because they are simply stuck in the rituals of the past  I predict that one day very soon the venerable leaders of technical analysis societies will abandon trend lines as mathematically absurd 
More importantly  I am busy forecasting which highly Ranked stocks are lining up with my preferred technical indicators to signal great buying  or shorting  opportunities 
Continued      
                                                                                                      

Our researchers created a breakthrough formula designed to add even more thrust to Zacks  average gain of  25  per year 
It boosts our market doubling  fundamentals based stock system with pinpoint technical analysis  You get greater timeliness  accuracy  and profit potential  Also greater focus because it culls down Zacks  880 best stocks to a small selection poised to make big moves 
Special opportunity ends midnight Saturday  December 23 

                                                                                                      
3  The Algos Have Taken Over the Game
As I mentioned in my intro  the quant houses and their computer algos have changed the game a little bit  Since they can move large amounts of money very fast  in and out of stocks with completely automated risk control  they have no fear    and lots of profits to count 
And they also exploit lots of traditional technical analysis with their hammer blow strikes  forcing false breakouts and breakdowns  toying with trend line traders  and manipulating volume and price with off exchange  dark pool  trades 
But they do not own the game because stocks and investment dollars still follow one eternal trend force  earnings momentum  And that means your job as a trader is to use technical analysis to spot killer entry and exit opportunities in fundamentally strong stocks 
4  Magic Numbers Exist for Moving Averages
I traded currencies at the institutional  interbank  level for a decade  As an FX market maker providing liquidity to the biggest banks and hedge funds in the world  I traded an average of  100 million per day 
During that time  I ran back tests with years of price data to find the  optimal  moving average combination for any time frame  Guess what  No combination was consistently better than any other  No magic numbers or Fibonacci sequences made any more difference than simply using multiples of 5 or 10 and bands of support and resistance 
In most cases  keeping it simple and consistent with technicals really works because the critical skills involve your research process  execution  discipline and risk management 
5  Trading is Simple and Requires Only a Few Chart Setups
Simplicity works to manage the info overload of markets  But  there is a big misconception that anyone can walk into the trading arena with a few simple chart setups or indicators and cash in 
The truth is that building expertise in trading can take many years of mistakes  losses  and frustration before you cross over into a realm where you know how to balance all the macro noise and news with your own solid research and discipline 
For instance  did you know that your brain is emotionally hard wired to break the  golden rule  of trading  Cut thy losses short and let thy winners run is so hard because human behavior is predisposed to emotionally overreact to fast moving green and red bars as your account value fluctuates and greed  fear  worry and regret take over 
You Break the Golden Rule  You Break Your Portfolio
In short  most traders hate to take losses and they grab any gains far too quickly  which is the recipe for a busted trading account 
So even if someone hands you a top trading system or set of rules  you still have to learn the mental and emotional game  and sort through the jungle of technical indicators  patterns  and advice givers  I m grateful I did all that work over the past 2  decades 
But I wouldn t want to start there again without a guide to show me the way  I hope my myth busting helped you a little or a lot on your journey as a trader 
More Profit Potential for Your Trades
Now if you believe in the potency of the Zacks Rank fundamentals but would like to use sound technical analysis principles to detect those near perfect entries and exits  I have some good news 
We have combined our powerful fundamental system with pinpoint technical analysis to achieve the best of both worlds in our  portfolio service 
Of course  you can uncover some of these enhanced trades on your own if you start with the 880 Zacks Rank  1 and  2 stocks  There s no better fundamental indicator of what and when to buy  Then reduce the list down to an investable few by adding technical signals for even greater accuracy and timeliness 
That may sound simple  but as I suggested earlier it takes more than a few chart setups to catch the right trades at the right times   and it can take years of learning through trial and error to get good at it 
That s where TAZR comes in 
Our goal is to land double digit wins in a matter of weeks and you re welcome to follow along  Get started today and you can also be among the first to see our just released Special Report 5 Stocks Set to Double  But don t wait as this opportunity ends Saturday  December 23 at midnight

200563,422079,NVDA,Move Over  Pricey Bitcoin  Invest In These 4 Stocks Instead,opinion,"Bitcoin is touching new highs every week and this morning it reached the historic milestone of  11 000 for the first time  Once considered as a mysterious investment  Bitcoin has gained huge popularity this year  with more and more people expressing their interest in buying the cryptocurrency But is it worth buying a digital coin for over  10 000  particularly when it has soared nearly 800  in less than a year  After all  the way it is crafting fresh highs every week  it depicts the very nature of a speculative valuation Notable financial market experts have criticized bitcoins with Jamie Dimon  CEO of U S  banking major JPMorgan Chase   Co  NYSE JPM    calling it a  fraud   Although we would refrain from using such harsh words  the sudden spurt surely indicates massive risk Hence  we prefer to be cautious as far as investing in bitcoin is concerned despite its massive growth prospects  Instead  we recommend investing in stocks that have a diversified product portfolio  including exposure to cryptocurrencies  Although this strategy will not generate as much returns as bitcoins  it will likely provide a cushion once the bubble bursts Smart investors should have a look at NVIDIA Corp    NASDAQ NVDA   which makes chips that power cryptocurrency mining  Notably  miners require advanced hardware to smoothly run parallel processing  Hence  they need powerful processors and chips  NVIDIA s graphics processing units  GPU  are believed to be the best in creating bitcoin As NVIDIA is well known for offering more advanced and fast GPUs   it is the first choice of most miners  However  revenues from sales of GPUs related to cryptocurrency  contribute a meager portion to the company s total revenues Therefore  any downfall in the cryptocurrency market will not have any material impact on NVIDIA s revenues  The company has much more exposure in other fast growing markets  including artificial intelligence  AI   gaming  datacenter and automotive  which are witnessing tremendous year over year growth for the past several quarters The Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  stock has rallied 97 4  in the year to date  YTD  period  outperforming the  s return of 45 9  to which it belongs to  You can see  
Another pick is Advanced Micro Devices   NASDAQ AMD   which is also one of the leading manufacturers of GPUs  However  like NVIDIA  Advanced Micro has little exposure in the space and derives majority of its revenues from other fast growing markets  including AI  gaming  datacenter and automotive  The Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock has gained 25 4  in the last year 

Overstock com  Inc    NASDAQ OSTK   is our next choice  which through its subsidiary tZERO  is trying to utilize blockchain technology in the financial markets  Notably  blockchain is a platform on which bitcoin operates  The platform stores a decentralized account of all bitcoin transactions  and is updated by all network users However  its main business is e commerce  which will help the company recover from any drastic fall in the bitcoin market  The Zacks Rank  3 stock has soared 229 2  YTD  outperforming the  s gain of 65 1  to which it belongs to 
Investors can also look for Square Inc    NYSE SQ    which is a provider of payments and point of sale solutions globally  The company has recently announced that it is testing support for bitcoin through its mobile application  Cash App  By adding this feature  it is offering a platform to its users for buying and selling bitcoin Analysts believe Square is well capable of handling crypto transactions at the physical point of sale  We anticipate that the increasing acceptance of these payment modes across a wide spectrum of businesses will result in handsome earnings and revenue growth However  if there is any downfall in the bitcoin business  the company s other platform will mitigate most of the loss  This Zacks Rank  3 company has gained 212 2  in the year to date  YTD  period  outperforming the  s return of 34 9   to which it belongs to

Why Should You Prioritize Earnings Beat 
A positive earnings surprise or earnings beat is typically the case when actual or reported earnings come in above the consensus estimate  Historically  if a company s earnings manage to beat market expectations  its stock surges post release 
This is because investors always try to take positions ahead of time and look for stocks that are likely to come up with a stellar performance  Now  since Wall Street analysts project earnings of companies after much deliberation  their estimates act as investment leads 
After all  only earnings beat can give investors a clear picture of a company s strength when an industry wide earnings recession is felt  A 20  earnings rise  though apparently looks good  doesn t tell you everything about the company s performance  This might represent a decelerating earnings growth momentum over the years or quarters  raising questions over the company s fundamentals 
Also  seasonal fluctuations come into play at times  If a company s Q1 is seasonally weak and Q4 is strong  then it is likely to report a sequential earnings decline  In such cases  growth rates are misleading while judging the true health of a company 
How to Find the Hidden Gems 
Now  finding stocks that have the potential to beat on the bottom line may be investors  dream but not an easy job  One way to do this is to look at the earnings surprise history of the company 
An impressive record in this regard generally acts as a catalyst for the stock  It indicates the company s ability to surpass estimates  And investors generally believe that the company will apply the same secret sauce to execute yet another earning beat in its next release 
The Winning Strategy
In order to shortlist stocks that are likely to come up with an earnings surprise  we chose the following as our primary screening parameters 
Last EPS Surprise greater than or equal to 10   Stocks delivering positive surprise in the last quarter tend to surprise again 
Average EPS Surprise in the last four quarters greater than 20   We lifted the bar for outperformance slightly higher by setting the average EPS surprise for the last four quarters at 20  
Average EPS Surprise in the last two quarters greater than 20   This points to a more consistent surprise history and makes the case for another surprise even stronger 
In addition  we place a few other criteria that push up the chance of a surprise 
Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Only companies with a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  can get through 
 greater than zero  A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of  1  2 or 3  Hold  for an earnings beat to happen  as per our proven model 
In order to zero in on those that have long term growth potential and high trading liquidity we have added the following parameters too 
Next 3 5 Years Estimated EPS Growth  Per Year  greater than 10   Solid expected earnings growth exhibits the stock s long term growth prospects 
Average 20 day Volume greater than 100 000  High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity 
A handful of criteria narrowed down the universe from over 7 700 stocks to around 14 
Here are five of the 14 stocks that passed the screen 
Arista Networks Inc    NYSE ANET    The company provides cloud networking solutions  The stock carries a Zacks Rank  1  Its Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 31   You can see

Home Run Investor  The market is unforgiving of stocks that miss or even meet quarterly earnings expectations  Therefore  Brian Bolan has decided to focus on companies that have already reported beat and raise quarters  such as Echo Global Logistics  ECHO   In addition to a strong report  this Zacks Rank  2  Buy  expects revenues between  460 million and  500 million for next quarter  which is well above expectations of  438 million  ECHO is seeing a significant increase in business  and the editor believes the stock has a lot more upside  Read the complete commentary for more on this new addition  Counterstrike   Today it was announced that GOP senators will release the tax bill at 11 00ET tomorrow  So it was no surprise that we saw very low volumes ahead of the details that will be released  The main interest is what the corporate tax rate will be and if it will be phased in or not   If there are no surprises  we should see 2600 tomorrow  If there is a phase in period or the rate is higher than 20   we could see a mild sell off  Today markets were very choppy  but finished in the green in anticipation that everything will go smooth   Let s see what the tax man bring us tomorrow  The GOP sounds like it s somewhat indecisive on certain parts of the bill  What will matter to markets is the corporate rate  20 25  will be good  but anything over that will bring sellers into markets  In addition  any phase in period of the tax cuts would be bearish      Jeremy Mullin Until Tomorrow  Jim Giaquinto

Hubspot stock has gained 84 1  year to date  substantially outperforming the 29 3  rally of the  it belongs to 

Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to Consider
Hubspot s inbound marketing and sales software suite is gaining wide acceptance  During the last reported quarter  total customers increased 40  year over year to 34 326 and marketing customers increased 30  to 26 560  driven by the increased adoption of One Hubspot and a few other freemium products as complementary addition to the company s core paid sales and marketing products 
The recent enhancement of the company s marketing tools included in HubSpot Marketing Hub such as integrations with Facebook   NASDAQ FB   advertisements and Instagram  is expected to help customers better connect with their target audience 
Upgrading the professional tier of its Sales Hub solutions suite with features including automation and prediction based lead scoring is expected to increase the probability of customer acquisition 
Additionally  the acquisitions of Motion AI and Kemvi reflect the company s focus on integrating artificial intelligence  AI  in its offerings as well as expanding its solutions portfolio  Lastly  the launch of Content Strategy  a tool to optimize search engine optimization  SEO  technique  is a positive for the company s product suite and its top line HubSpot  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise

   Why a Likely Positive Surprise 
Our proven model shows that Hubspot is likely to beat on earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients 
Zacks ESP  Hubspot s  is  26 53   A favorable ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive surprise  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our
