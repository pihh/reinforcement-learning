6531,228046,CHCO,Regions  Ratings Reiterated By Moody s  Outlook Upgraded,opinion,"Ratings of Regions Financial Corporation   NYSE RF   and its bank subsidiary  Regions Bank  were recently confirmed by Moody s Investors Service  Moreover  the outlook has been upgraded from stable to positive 
Also  Moody s affirmed the Bank s baa1 standalone baseline credit assessment  BCA  and A2 Prime 1 for deposits ratings for Regions Bank  Also  Regions has a senior unsecured rating of Baa2 
Reasons Behind Ratings Affirmation 
The ratings agency is of opinion that the company will be able to maintain a strong balance sheet position  with enough liquidity to continue engaging in operations  Further  the company s diversified loan portfolio  safe risk taking approach along with a favorable U S  economy have helped improve its asset risk 
Notably  the ratio of problem loans to gross loans remained as low as 1 5  as of Sep 30  2018  which reflects its strong asset quality  Problem loans consist of nonaccruals that are due for more than 90 days and accruing troubled debt restructured loans 
Regions  capital position is expected to remain sound for another 1 1 5 years  in spite of the company s goal to reduce common equity tier 1  CET1  capital ratio to 9 5  from 10 2  reported at the end of third quarter 2018  However  Moody s notes that capitalization is a relative weakness compared to Regions  other rating factors 
What Made Moody s Upgrade Outlook 
Per Moody s  the change in rating outlook reflects improvement in Regions  asset mix and risk management capabilities over the years  Also  the ratings agency feels that the company will be able to sustain its growing profitability  These positive characteristics have placed Regions among its higher rated competitors 
Further  Moody s feels that Regions  management of loan portfolio in the recent years is commendable  The company has reduced commercial real estate lending and indirect auto loan originations exposure matching the weakening markets scenario  Also  its management of oil   gas loan portfolio indicates effectiveness of risk management oversight in controlling concentrations and losses 
Moody s also found the ratio of net income from continuing operations to tangible assets for the nine months ended September 2018 to be strong  Also  the company is seen to take advantage of low deposit beta compared to regional bank peers  which resulted in a considerable expansion in net interest margin for third quarter 2018  Lastly  the company s operating efficiency is seen to have improved 
Factors That Might Trigger Change in Ratings 
An upward ratings change can be brought if Regions continues to improve operational efficiency and maintain low credit costs 
On the other hand  signs of weakening in underwriting discipline or rebuilding of asset concentrations  such as commercial real estate could result in a downward rating movement  Also  deterioration of capital position beyond current expectations will also impact ratings 
Shares of the company have lost 25 3  year to date compared with 20 3  decline recorded by the  it belongs to

6568,228083,CHCO,Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day Twitter  Six Flags Entertainment  Popular  City Holding And First Financial Bankshares,opinion,For Immediate Release Chicago  IL   December 26  2018    Twitter   NYSE TWTR   as the Bull of the Day  Six Flags Entertainment   NYSE SIX   as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Popular  Inc    NASDAQ BPOP    City Holding Company   NASDAQ CHCO   and First Financial Bankshares  Inc    NASDAQ FFIN    Here is a synopsis of all five stocks   The brutal Q4 market correction is making many growth stocks investable again and one of them is Twitter Actually  Twitter saw a strong rally off of its October lows after reporting a 50  EPS surprise for Q3  but has slid back over 25  in the six trading sessions up to December 24 The good news is that the stock held above those October lows just above  26 and should be on growth investor  buy lists  as the market stabilizes My colleague Tracey Ryniec chose Twitter for a Bull of the Day feature in November and some of her post earnings notes are worth reviewing   Twitter is winning over Wall Street quarter by quarter  This Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  is expected to grow both revenue and earnings by the double digits in both 2018 and 2019 Twitter operates a social media platform in 40 languages around the world that provides users with updates on what is happening  including breaking news  globally  Big Earnings Beat in Q3On Oct 25  Twitter reported its third quarter results and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7 cents  Earnings were  0 21 versus the consensus of  0 14  That s a beat of 50  Revenue rose 29  to  758 million  up from  590 million Of that total revenue  most came from advertising revenue which rose 29  to  650 million  Half of the advertising revenue is now coming from the video ad format Wall Street is always watching the Daily Active Users count  which fell to 326 million from 335 million in the second quarter but that was mostly the result of the company s policy of purging fake  spam and abusive accounts  end of excerpt from Tracey s Nov 14 report Social Media Growth That Isn t Fake News The metrics that jump out to me here  besides the big bottom line beat  are year over year revenue growth of 29     on pace to break  3 billion this year    in an environment where social media is under big clouds of political controversy If the Twitter platform is having to  self police  to remove harmful users and accounts  and these kinds of numbers are the damage  large growth investors appear good with that While the Zacks Consensus profit estimate for 2018 was bumped up to  0 80 from  0 71 primarily due to the big EPS beat  a majority of analysts joined in moving 2019 EPS up 13  from  0 78 to  0 88 That s earnings growth of just 10 5  over 2018  a phenomenal year when the company really opened the profit valves with over 80  bottom line growth  But with revenues expected to advance nearly 15  to  3 43 billion next year  the funnel at the top is still offering plenty of opportunities for monetization   Six Flags Entertainment has 17 amusement parks across the United States  and one each in Mexico and Canada  with world class coasters  family rides for all ages  up close animal encounters and thrilling water parks Word is that they also have new locations coming soon in Zhejiang  China  Dubai  UAE  and Riyadh  Saudi Arabia  And stealing a page from the book of Disney theme parks  Six Flags holds long term licenses for Warner Bros  and DC Comics characters  including Bugs Bunny  Daffy Duck  Tweety Bird  Yosemite Sam  Batman  and Superman  Additionally  the company has certain rights to use the Hanna Barbera and Cartoon Network characters  including Yogi Bear  Scooby Doo  The Flintstones and others But when the company released Q3 results in late October  investors were disappointed enough to gap the stock down over 15  from  62 to  52  Quarterly EPS of  2 16 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 32 per share  and only represented year over year growth of 2 4  vs  2 11 last year at this time  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items This showing represented a negative earnings surprise of  6 90   A quarter ago  it was expected that the amusement park operator would post earnings of  0 93 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 88  delivering a negative surprise of  5 38  Six Flags posted revenues of  619 82 million for the quarter ended September 2018  missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 09   This compares to year ago revenues of  580 42 million  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters Six Flags Still a Short SIX belongs to the Zacks Leisure and Recreation Services industry  which currently ranks in the top third of all Zacks Industries The company also pays a generous dividend of  3 28  which currently represents a 6 46  yield This yield became richer on Christmas Eve when shares made a new 52 week low near  50 On December 14  I identified the stock as a high probability short candidate around  60 after shares had closed the Oct 23 gap down and put in a lower high  My first target was  52  near the Oct lows  and my second target was  48  site of the 2017 lows  So with that strong yield and 15 20  gains for short players since earnings  is it time for shorts to close the trade or do new lows suggest a trip to  48 One key indicator may be the duration of the stock s time in the Zacks  penalty box   SIX first became a Zacks  4 Rank  Sell  in early October before their earnings report  as analysts were lowering EPS estimates into the quarterly report Then it slipped to the cellar of the Zacks Rank with a  5 Strong Sell rating after their report  as the analysts delivered a stronger verdict about the declining growth trajectory Now SIX is slowly climbing out of the cellar with a move back to a  4 Rank as older estimate revisions roll off of the model s calculation  which looks only at a 60 day window of analysts changes  Additional content 3 Banks Ready to Continue Their Winning Ways in 2019The banking industry seems to have been benefiting the most from the interest rate hikes this year  Year 2018 has seen four Fed rate hikes so far  the latest one being announced last week  Moreover  this is the ninth rate hike since December 2015 Notably  banks derive benefits from a steep yield curve i e  when long term rates are greater than short term rates  This is because  when short term rates rise  to which deposits are tied   banks can charge more on loans  to which long term rates are tied  if long term rates are higher than short term ones This helps in expanding net interest income  as well as net interest margins  for banks  Moreover  rising rates reflect an improving domestic economy as it implies that the credit quality is improving  which is beneficial for banks  profitability Therefore  while the recent inversion of the yield curve  which is also perceived as an early indication of an impending recession  might temporarily be bad news for banks  the banking industry as a whole is expected to still benefit from these rate hikes going into 2019  given that the Fed now plans two hikes next year as opposed to three In addition to this  the Tax Cut   Jobs Act  which helped banks improve their corporate earnings in 2018  is expected to aid earnings growth in the coming few quarters Further  given the expectation for potential lesser regulations  banks are expected to gain in the future  If the central bank s latest proposal to significantly raise the threshold for SIFI to  250 billion in assets from the current  50 billion gets implemented  compliance costs will come down and banks will be able to utilize the freed up capital to generate more revenues Additionally  the steps toward easing regulations related to the Volcker Rule are a positive for banks as it will no longer prohibit them from conducting proprietary trading Thus  while the uncertainty related to the U S  China trade war and other global issues might have a negative impact on the overall finance sector in 2019  bank stocks are expected to continue to benefit from the rise in rates as well as potential lesser regulations Selecting 2019 Bank Stock WinnersBased on strong fundamentals and solid earnings growth
