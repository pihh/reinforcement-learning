1322,222837,MAS,Miscellaneous Building Products Industry Prospects Look Bright,opinion,The Zacks  industry primarily comprises manufacturers  designers and distributors of home improvement and building products like ceiling systems  doors and windows  as well as flooring and metal products  Some of the industry players provide solutions to rehabilitate aging infrastructure  primarily pipelines in the wastewater  water  energy  mining and refining industries A few industry participants offer glass fiber that is utilized to support composite materials for transportation  electronics  marine  infrastructure  wind energy as well as roofing for residential  commercial and industrial applications  The companies also manufacture expansion joints and structural bearings  ventilation products  ground mounted solar racking and commercial greenhouses  as well as mail storage  solutions including mailboxes and package delivery products  Moreover  companies under this industrial cohort rent equipment to a diverse customer base that includes construction and industrial companies  manufacturers  utilities  municipalities  homeowners and government entities Prominent stocks in this industry are United Rentals  Inc   URI  and Masco Corporation  NYSE MAS   MAS  Let s take a look at the industry s three major themes The industry is poised to benefit from robust construction activities and a strengthening macro backdrop  Construction spending in the United States has ramped up in recent times  supported by a steady increase in outlays on private residential and government projects  Precisely  strong demand stemming from an improved residential construction market has been a boon for the industry participants  As the industry s prospects are highly correlated to U S  housing market conditions  and repair and remodeling activity  the improved housing market fundamentals are expected to provide a major boost to the industry participants  profitability  As home sales tend to spur spending for building products  the latest acceleration in home sales could drive demand  The U S  housing market is likely to continue benefiting from higher demand of new homes courtesy of lower mortgage rates  solid economic growth and favorable demographics  Meanwhile  the industry participants are increasingly focusing on pricing of products to offset higher input expenses  Cost saving initiatives like business consolidation  system implementations  plant branch closures  improvement in the global supply chain and headcount reductions are supporting bottom line growth  The companies are also following a systematic acquisition strategy to enhance domestic and international portfolios  However  the lingering trade conflict between the United States and China is taking a toll on U S  business activities and hence margins  Rising labor costs are also compressing margins further Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Building Products   Miscellaneous industry is a 26 stock group within the broader Zacks  sector  The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank  73  which places it at the top 29  of more than 250 Zacks industries The group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates upbeat near term prospects  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 The industry s position in the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries is a result of negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate  Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions  it appears that analysts are gradually gaining confidence in this group s earnings growth potential  Since November 2019  the industry s earnings estimate for 2020 has gone up by approximately 1 1  Given the solid near term prospects  we will present a few stocks that have the potential to outperform the market  But before that  it s worth taking a look at the industry s shareholder returns and current valuation Industry Outperforms Sector   S P 500The Zacks Building Products   Miscellaneous industry has outperformed the broader Zacks Construction sector as well as the Zacks S P 500 composite over the past year Over this period  the industry has gained 38  compared with the S P 500 s increase of 25  and the broader sector s 34 4  growth One Year Price Performance Industry s Current ValuationOn the basis of forward 12 month price to earnings ratio  which is a commonly used multiple for valuing building products  stocks  the industry trades at 14X versus the S P 500 s 19X and the sector s 15 8X Over the past five years  the industry has traded as high as 17 9X  as low as 7 2X and at the median of 14X  as the chart below shows Industry s P E Ratio  Forward 12 Month  Versus S P 500  Bottom LineFocus on expanding footprint and product portfolio through acquisitions along with cost saving initiatives is expected to drive the industry  Also  investing in new products  support services and advanced manufacturing capabilities should boost revenues  Meanwhile  solid housing market fundamentals are added catalysts  However  the U S  China trade spat is likely to impact the companies  margins as well as volumes  In order to mitigate tariff related woes  higher pricing may have a temporary impact on volume Below we

143989,365504,MAS,AEGN Or MAS  Which Is The Better Value Stock Right Now ,opinion,"Investors looking for stocks in the Building Products   Miscellaneous sector might want to consider either Aegion  AEGN  or Masco  MAS   But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks  Let s take a closer look 
The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits 
Aegion and Masco are sporting Zacks Ranks of  1  Strong Buy  and  4  Sell   respectively  right now  Investors should feel comfortable knowing that AEGN likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than MAS has recently  But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors 
Value investors are also interested in a number of tried and true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics  These include the long favored P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company s fair value 
AEGN currently has a forward P E ratio of 17 69  while MAS has a forward P E of 17 84  We also note that AEGN has a PEG ratio of 1 77  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  MAS currently has a PEG ratio of 2 17 
Another notable valuation metric for AEGN is its P B ratio of 1 55  The P B ratio pits a stock s market value against its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  MAS has a P B of 582 06 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to AEGN s Value grade of B and MAS s Value grade of C 
AEGN is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook  which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model  And  based on the above valuation metrics  we feel that AEGN is likely the superior value option right now ",2019-10-31,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/aegn-or-mas-which-is-the-better-value-stock-right-now-200481484,200481484

144006,365521,MAS,Earnings Preview  Masco  MAS  Q4 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Masco  MAS  reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 11  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of Behr paint  Delta faucets and other building products is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 53 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  17 2  
Revenues are expected to be  1 65 billion  down 18 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Masco 
For Masco  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Masco will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Masco would post earnings of  0 70 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 68  delivering a surprise of  2 86  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Masco doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-02-04,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-masco-mas-q4-earnings-expected-to-decline-200504500,200504500

A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Masco 
For Masco  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 61  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Masco will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Masco would post earnings of  0 81 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 88  delivering a surprise of  8 64  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Masco doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/masco-mas-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200476775,200476775

What s Next for Masco

144064,365579,MAS,Miscellaneous Building Products Industry Prospects Somber,opinion,The Zacks  industry primarily comprises manufacturers  designers and distributors of home improvement and building products like ceiling systems  doors and windows  as well as flooring and metal products  Some of the industry players provide solutions to rehabilitate aging infrastructure  primarily pipelines in the wastewater  water  energy  mining and refining industries A few industry participants offer glass fiber that is utilized to support composite materials for transportation  electronics  marine  infrastructure  wind energy as well as roofing for residential  commercial and industrial applications  The companies also manufacture expansion joints and structural bearings  ventilation products  ground mounted solar racking and commercial greenhouses  as well as mail storage  solutions including mailboxes and package delivery products  Moreover  companies under this industrial cohort rent equipment to a diverse customer base that includes construction and industrial companies  manufacturers  utilities  municipalities  homeowners and government entities Some of the prominent stocks in this industry are United Rentals  Inc   URI   Masco Corporation  NYSE MAS   MAS   and Armstrong World Industries  Inc   AWI  Let s take a look at the industry s three major themes The industry is poised to benefit from robust construction activities and a strengthening macro backdrop  Construction spending in the United States has ramped up lately  supported by a steady increase in outlays on private as well as public construction projects  Precisely  strong infrastructure demand and improving non residential construction demand trends have been a boon for the industry participants  Trump s impetus to boost infrastructure spending appears as the key catalyst to the industry s growth  As the industry s prospects are highly correlated to U S  housing market conditions and repair and remodeling activity  the prevailing slowdown may prove detrimental  As home sales tend to spur spending for building products  the latest deceleration in home sales could hurt demand  Meanwhile  higher raw material costs kept margins under pressure  The lingering trade conflict between the United States and China is taking a toll on U S  business activities and hence margins  Rising logistics and distribution costs are also compressing margins further  Nonetheless  the industry participants are increasingly focusing on pricing of products to offset the higher input expenses  Cost saving initiatives like business consolidation  system implementations  plant branch closures  improvement in the global supply chain and headcount reductions are supporting bottom line growth  The companies are also following a systematic acquisition strategy to enhance domestic and international portfolios  Again  lower mortgage rates since the beginning of 2019 appear to be boosting buyer demand for housing  which is expected to aid the industry s performance  Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull ProspectsThe Zacks Building Products   Miscellaneous industry is a 23 stock group within the broader Zacks  sector  The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank  174  which places it at the bottom 32  of more than 250 Zacks industries The group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks

144083,365598,MAS,Masco  MAS  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Masco  MAS  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 25  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of Behr paint  Delta faucets and other building products is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 82 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  9 3  
Revenues are expected to be  2 35 billion  up 2 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 3  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Masco 
For Masco  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Masco will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Masco would post earnings of  0 47 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 44  delivering a surprise of  6 38  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Masco doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/masco-mas-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200441415,200441415
144084,365599,MAS,Factors Setting The Tone For Masco  MAS  In Q2 Earnings,opinion,Masco Corporation   NYSE MAS   is expected to report second quarter 2019 results on Jul 25  before the opening bell In the last reported quarter  its earnings and revenues lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6 4  and 4 8   respectively  Also  on a year over year basis  the top and bottom lines declined 0 6  and 2 2   respectively  In fact  the company s earnings missed the consensus mark in five of the trailing seven quarters Softness in certain markets served  inventory rebalancing by a few customers and lower volume are pressing concerns Which Way are Estimates Trending For the quarter to be reported  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 81 cents per share  remaining unchanged over the past 60 days  This indicates a gain of 8  from 75 cents per share reported in the year ago quarter  Revenues are expected to be  2 35 billion  up 2 2  year over year  Masco Corporation Price and EPS Surprise    Factors That Might Influence Upcoming Quarterly ResultsLower volume  softness in end markets served and tariff related woes are expected to hurt Masco s second quarter results  Nonetheless  its strength in repair and remodeling activity  portfolio expansion strategy  along with cost saving initiatives are likely to offset the above mentioned headwinds in the to be reported quarter The company s repair and modeling business has been a key growth driver  contributing a significant portion to total net sales  However  the business didn t pay off much in the last reported quarter due to pulled forward sales  a large ERP implementation in the windows business and softer end market demand  The trend is expected to continue in the second quarter as well  considering the ongoing softness in the U S  housing market Meanwhile  cost saving initiatives  which target company wide annual savings through reduction of corporate expense and simplification of Masco s organizational structure  bode well for Masco  In the last reported quarter  selling  general and administrative expenses   as a percentage of net sales   were in line with the prior year period  reflecting fruition of these initiatives Anticipated Segmental PerformanceMasco s Plumbing business  contributing more than 49  to revenues  is expected to benefit from Delta  courtesy of Brizo brand and showrooms  Peerless brand at retail  and strength across all channels of distribution including wholesale  retail as well as e commerce  Strong pricing is expected to have aided the company s plumbing segment during the quarter  However  the upside might be impacted by unfavorable currency headwinds and lower demand The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Plumbing Products revenues of  1 06 billion implies growth from  1 03 billion in the year ago period Meanwhile  the Decorative Architectural Products segment is expected to benefit from Kichler Lighting and its propane initiative  The consensus mark for the segment s revenues is currently pegged at  830 million  suggesting an increase from  806 million in the comparable prior year period and  573 million in the last reported quarter Cabinetry Products  revenues are expected to be  263 million  slightly below  268 million reported in the prior year period but up from  237 million registered in the last reported quarter Costs HighIncrease in commodity costs  higher depreciation expense  and ERP and logistics costs have been denting Masco s margins  Also  lower volumes  unfavorable mix and increased cost from the acquisition of Kichler have been putting pressure on its bottom line  These factors are likely to impact earnings in the quarter to be reported For the Plumbing segment  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for adjusted EBITDA is currently pegged at  218 million  pointing to a nominal increase from  214 million reported in the prior year  Although the Plumbing business is expected to witness an upside  Decorative Architectural Products and Cabinetry Products  adjusted EBITDA is likely to decline In Decorative Architectural Products  adjusted EBITDA for the to be reported quarter is projected at  166 million  down from  175 million a year ago  Adjusted EBITDA from Cabinetry Products is expected to be  27 03 million  implying a decline of  10 million from  37 million registered in the prior year period Quantitative Model PredictionOur proven model does not show that Masco is likely to beat earnings estimates in the to be reported quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1

144139,365654,MAS,5 Best GARP Picks With Discounted PEG,opinion,The investment pattern of the young generation is shifting to hybrid investment from pure play theories like growth or value  According to them  to make a long term investment more effective  the principles of both value and growth strategies need to be combined Consequently  GARP  growth at a reasonable price  investment  often known as a special case of value investment  is gaining popularity  What GARPers look for is whether the stocks are somewhat undervalued and have solid sustainable growth potential  Investopedia  And here lies the importance of a not so popular fundamental metric  the price earnings growth  PEG  ratio  Although it is categorized under value investing  this strategy follows the principles of both growth and value investing The PEG ratio is defined as   Price  Earnings  Earnings Growth RateIt relates the stocks P E ratio with future earnings growth rate While P E alone only gives an idea of stocks that are trading at a discount  PEG  while adding the growth element to it  helps stocks that have solid future potential A lower PEG ratio  preferably less than 1  is always better for GARP investors Say for example  if a stock s P E ratio is 10 and expected long term growth rate is 15   the company s PEG will come down to 0 66  a ratio that indicates both undervaluation and future growth potential Unfortunately  this ratio is often neglected due to investors  limitation to calculate the future earnings growth rate of a stock There are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio though  It doesn t consider the very common situation of changing growth rates such as the forecast of the first three years at very high growth rate followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate in the long term Hence  PEG based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration Here are the screening criteria for a winning strategy PEG

144140,365655,MAS,Masco  MAS  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Masco  MAS  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 7  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of Behr paint  Delta faucets and other building products is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 56 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  27 3  
Revenues are expected to be  2 01 billion  up 7 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3 68  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Masco 
For Masco  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  1 20  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Masco will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Masco would post earnings of  0 70 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 65  delivering a surprise of  7 14  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Masco doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/masco-mas-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200381945,200381945

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 14 29   A quarter ago  it was expected that this maker of Behr paint  Delta faucets and other building products would post earnings of  0 70 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 65  delivering a surprise of  7 14  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once 
Masco  which belongs to the Zacks Building Products   Miscellaneous industry  posted revenues of  2 04 billion for the quarter ended December 2018  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 68   This compares to year ago revenues of  1 87 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Masco shares have added about 13 7  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 9  
What s Next for Masco 
While Masco has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Masco was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  0 54 on  2 05 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  2 70 on  8 72 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year

144191,365706,MAS,5 Stocks To Buy On Massive  1 5 Trillion Infrastructure Plan,opinion,One problem that Americans face is certainly shoddy infrastructure  President Trump had raised this issue in his first State of the Union Address  He wanted to revamp infrastructure  including roads  bridges  highways and railways  This is something that he has been promising since his campaign days In the wake of this  Trump has announced a massive infrastructure bill on Feb 12 to modernize infrastructure  Thus  picking stocks gaining from the infrastructure drive seems judicious Trump Unveils Infrastructure Plan Trump unveiled the long awaited  1 5 trillion plan to fix America s infrastructure over the next 10 years  The plan is primarily centered on using the  200 billion in federal funds to spur massive infrastructure investments on roads  highways  ports and airports  The comprehensive bill will also address issues related to drinking and waste water system  energy and rural infrastructure  veterans  hospitals  to name a few Researchers in McKinsey   Company have figured out that such a massive amount will indeed be needed to refurbish the country s infrastructure  To fund the bill  Trump said that every dollar should be  leveraged by partnering with state and local governments and  where appropriate  tapping into private sector investment  How Will the  200B be Spent Of the  200 billion in federal money  half of it will go to incentives for states and cities  The White House said that this money will ultimately be used in new projects like building airports  passenger rail  drinking water facilities and Superfund sites About  50 billion will be used in Rural Infrastructure Programme  This is aimed at rebuilding and improving infrastructure in rural America  The White House added that  the bulk of the dollars in the Rural Infrastructure Programme will be allocated to State governors  giving States the flexibility to prioritize their communities  needs  The remaining funds will be distributed through rural performance grants to encourage the best use of taxpayer dollars  Nearly  20 billion will be spent on  Transformative Projects Program   while another  20 billion will be allocated toward expanding infrastructure financing programs  US in Desperate Need of Infrastructure OverhaulRhode Island is grappling with problems like dilapidated bridges and roads  while New Hampshire has a lot of catching up to do when it comes to water infrastructure Meanwhile  the broken down Sarah Mildred Long Bridge and poor road conditions are plaguing Maine  Meanwhile  all the three states in the New York City have collapsing roads and railways  with Connecticut being the worst  Last but not the least  Mississippi will see substantial improvement in and around Port of Gulfport owing to the infrastructure plan 5 Solid ChoicesCourtesy of the all inclusive infrastructure bill  for the first time in the history of the United States  investing in

5 Dividend Growth Stocks to Play It Safe

	With 2016 being dominated by volatility  it s not surprising that dividend investing has emerged as one of the most popular investing strategies  Dividends are major sources of consistent income for investors when returns from price movements of stocks are at risk 

Benefit of Dividend Growth
	There are multiple styles of dividend investing out of which dividend growth is the most appealing  Stocks with dividend growth generally outperform their peers and generate increased profits year after year  Thus  the dividend growth strategy has an edge over the steady dividend strategy  By investing in stocks with dividend growth  investors can enjoy rising current income while awaiting capital appreciation 
	Dividend growth stocks also provide some margin of safety  which enables investors to withstand shocks  In fact  stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth as opposed to those that have high yields form a healthy portfolio

Next 3 5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero  This represents the rate at which a company s earnings are expected to grow  Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments 52 Week Price Change greater than S P 500  Median     This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S P 500 over the past one year Zacks Rank Less than or Equal to 2  Stocks having a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  generally perform better than their peers in all types of market environment VGM Style Score of B or better    This is simply a weighted combination of Value  Growth and Momentum Market Capitalization greater than  2 billion  We have eliminated small cap stocks to ensure better flexibility and tradability

144447,365962,MAS,Bullish Trades For A Bearish Market,opinion,"Tuesday s market experienced a semi rally 
Nothing for the bulls to get excited about except for the fact that markets didn t fall  again  on Tuesday  which was not the case in early morning trade  Nonetheless  the bulls managed to put together a fairly respectable rally and an hour before the U S  close  was eyeing a stall out at the 2085 area  If it can break through that price support area  then I could see a push back to 2098 2100 in the next day or two 
None of that  though  changes what has become a bearish outlook on the market for me  I am actually long on  ARCA UPRO  as of Tuesday morning  but don t expect to hold it for long  It was simply a way to make a quick buck off of Tuesday s rising market 
You also have the VIX dropping off pretty hard as well after getting back and above the declining resistance level that started back in October  But like I said  I don t expect this rally to be sustainable over the course of this week and suspect that this is merely a dead cat bounce 
So  here s my bullish list of trade setups  You ll notice that there has been quite a pruning in terms of sheer length of the list as a whole  However  if I m wrong about this market and the direction that it ultimately takes  a few names to watch in particular from the list below will be   NYSE ABBV    NYSE AMTD    NASDAQ EBAY    NYSE FTI    NASDAQ GPRO  and  NYSE MAS  
They all have some nice setups currently working in their favor

144449,365964,MAS,2 Ways Investors Can Take Advantage Of The Fed s Uncertainty,opinion,"Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen last week blinked in the face of as she described it global uncertainty  low inflation  and a still low U S  labor force participation rate  I ve written on the emerging markets slowdown numerous times in recent months  so her reasoning is not at all surprising  Although interest rates could still be hiked in one of the two remaining times the Federal Open Market Committee  FOMC  meets this year  I m inclined to think they ll stay near zero until at least 2016 
The decision is a welcome one for both gold demand and new home purchases  When rates rise  gold becomes less attractive for some investors  who are encouraged to exchange their no yielding gold for income producing assets  As for loans on new or existing homes  they don t necessarily rise and fall in perfect correlation with interest rates they re more directly related to the U S  10 Year Treasury bond yield but there s a strong psychological connection in many potential homebuyers  minds 
An interest rate reprieve  then  might encourage borrowers to act before it s  too late   helping home sales  This could speed up the multiplier effect  or what occurs when there s an increase in spending that increases income and consumption greater than the initial amount spent  When people buy a home  they also put carpenters to work  purchase new furniture  hire landscaping companies and more 
The same is true when taxes are lower  It creates less friction in the flow of money 
A Record Setting Year for Chinese and Indian Gold Demand 
Following Yellen s announcement  I told JT Long of the  that the Fed s decision is a wash for precious metals  oil and gas prices  A rate hike would have likely caused the U S  dollar to strengthen even further  which in turn would have put additional pressure on commodities 
I ll be watching China s purchasing managers  index  PMI  numbers very closely in October and November to see if manufacturing activity will start to turn up  Since China is such an important consumer of metals and other raw materials  it s crucial that its manufacturing sector break out of the recent slowdown 
A recent article by Oxford Club Resource Strategist  points out that China s gold demand  as tracked by deliveries out of the Shanghai Gold Exchange  SGE   is much healthier than many people believe  So far this year  demand has been 36 percent higher than around the same time in 2014  and 13 5 percent higher than in 2013 which was a record year 
Chinese gold demand also tends to increase near the end of the year as the Chinese New Year approaches  so it s possible 2015 could hit a new record 
Demand out of India is likewise surging  reaching 120 tonnes in August  compared to 50 tonnes this time last year  With important Indian fall festivals quickly approaching such as Diwali  the gold Love Trade is in full swing 
Homebuilders Feeling Good About the Future
Speaking of love  U S  homebuilders generally seem to have a rosy feeling about the housing market 
According to a new survey by the National Association of Home Builders  NAHB   builder confidence in the market for new single family homes rose to 62 in September  its highest level since November 2005  A reading over 50 means that builders have a positive attitude about economic conditions 
Driving this sentiment are historically low interest rates  low unemployment and steadily rising rents  which makes purchasing a home more appealing 
Housing starts in August fell for a second straight month  but they remain above the one million unit mark 1 13 million  to be exact so demand is still on solid footing  This week  Evercore ISI wrote 

Housing starts have already more than doubled and are clearly improving here in 2015  But they still have lots of room to increase 

What this means is there s a lot of upside opportunity 
A better indicator of the market might be the number of permits filed for new homes  which ticked up 3 5 percent in August 
We own Masco Corporation  NYSE MAS   which manufactures products for home improvement and new home construction markets  It s up more than 23 percent year to date  while the S P Homebuilders Select Industry Index is up nearly 30 percent during the same period 
Big Data  October Is the Best Time to Close on a New Home
The reason for a rise in permits is likely because the fall and winter months have traditionally been perceived as the best time of year to buy a new home  due to less competition from other buyers because of the colder weather 
Real estate information company  wanted to check the validity of this longstanding theory and found it be to mostly accurate  After analyzing 32 million home and condo sales since 2000  the group found that buyers tend to get the best deals during October just next month when sales prices were 2 6 percent below market value  And if you want to get really precise  October 8 was the absolute best day to close on a home   when on average buyers have purchased 10 8 percent below estimated market value at the time of the sale   according to RealtyTrac 
The worst month to buy a home in was April  when prices were at a 1 2 percent premium 
So the takeaway here is that home buyers who have been sitting on the fence now have a double incentive to act  historically low mortgage rates and a possible chance at killer bargains 
Government Policy Is a Precursor to Change Last week  I discussed how  or the rate at which money is exchanged from one transaction to another  The multiplier effect of the housing market  according to the  is between 1 34 and 1 62 in the first year or two of the initial home purchase  What this means is that for every dollar spent on housing  the overall GDP increases by  1 34 and  1 62 
That s huge  Not just for GDP growth but also job growth 
Global Construction magazine estimates that an average of 22 subcontractors are involved in the building of a single American home  from carpeting specialists to electricians to plumbers  These are just the subcontractors  The count doesn t include full time employees of the homebuilder 
All told  then  many more than 22 people are employed in the construction of each home in the U S   on average  These professionals create wealth not just for themselves but for others as well 
According to Reuters  construction spending by the U S  government increased 0 7 percent to a huge  1 08 trillion  the highest level since May 2008  Construction spending has increased for eight straight months  in fact  This is why we always study government policies  because they re precursors to change  It s why government bond yields spiked in anticipation of the Fed decision  The spike lowered the prices of bonds substantially  
While Americans are in the early stages of the presidential election cycle  and the debate stage is still crowded  Canadians will head to the polls in a month to decide the direction of their federal leadership  I was in Toronto last week where the mood was tense as the effect of falling commodity prices hit the resource based Canadian economy especially hard and the Canadian dollar was at its lowest level against the almighty American dollar since 2004 
If the Conservative Party remains in power  Prime Minister Stephen Harper will be the first person in more than a century to win four consecutive elections in Canada  It s also the first three way toss up in the nation s history of Parliamentary elections 
Harper has been a reliable champion of commodity investments  small government and lower taxes policies that I believe contribute to global growth and prosperity over the long term

144471,365986,MAS,USD SGD  Singapore Growth Forecast Cut But 1 258 Holding,opinion,The latest Survey of Professional Forecasters done quarterly by Central Bank Monetary Authority of Singapore  MAS  showed that analysts expect a growth of only 2 3  for GDP in 2013  slightly lower than the high end of MAS s own estimate of 1 3  and half a percentage point lower than the previous median estimate of 2 8   Inflation outlook has also improved  with CPI expected to rise by only 2 8  this year  much lower than the previous quarter 3 8  median and below MAS s own estimated range of 3 4  Assuming that the private economists are correct  will a 2 3  be disconcerting for MAS  It is unlikely as this figure is still above the mid range of MAS s projection  which should make MAS feeling generally comfortable  However  there is a tendency for MAS to  under promise  and  over deliver  in its projections  as it is historically found to do  If this is true  then perhaps the decline in consensus estimate may start to ring alarm bells for MAS  as it indicates that Singapore s economy is actually under performing compared to previous estimates  with further slowdown potentially waiting in the next half of 2013 MAS may comfort in the fact that the 0 5  fall in GDP estimate is accompanied by a 1 full percentage point fall in inflation  This would actually increase its scope to weaken SGD which it is currently hesitant to do so due to the high inflation rates plaguing Singapore right now  However  even with the expected decline in CPI  the revised numbers are still higher than historical average  Furthermore  inflation is expected to pick up once more to 3 1  in 2014 based on current data  which means MAS will be potentially risking higher inflation in 2014 if it choose to weaken SGD right now for the sake of the economy   which is still within MAS comfort level  Hence the likelihood of any change in SGD NEER policy  which is on a  modest and gradual  appreciation is low and it is highly likely that MAS will maintain current curve for SGD during October s meeting Hourly ChartThis did not stop SGD from weakening during early Asian trading session though  sending price up to 1 258 after the capitulation of USD yesterday brought about by US stock decline  The weakening of SGD wasn t severe  as price quickly reversed during early European hours from the technical bounce off the aforementioned level  Stochastic readings have formed a peak similar to the one found yesterday  and a bearish cycle seems likely from here out  with 1 252 1 254 interim support zone currently under threat  Should the lower end 1 252 gets broken  1 24 round figure may open up as a plausible bearish target  but that is a long way from here and it is likely that price may stall along any of the interim support lines especially if Stochastic readings hit Oversold Daily ChartUSD SGD 2  width  580  height  402  Longer term chart leans towards a weaker SGD  but current bullish outlook  rally since Jan 2013  is under threat with the possibility of price breaking back into the 1 2525 1 243 consolidation range  The failure to push above 1 26 may undo all the good bullish work of the Tweezers Bottom found on 6th and 7th Jun and bearish acceleration may occur should price start to trade below the 2nd candle of the  3 White Soldiers  pattern that extended the 1 243 rebound  Stochastic readings suggest that a bearish cycle may be in play soon  which may line up nicely in conjunction with a 1 2525 break  but caution should be practiced as price may bounce higher from 1 2525 which will validate broader uptrend and also the rebound from 1 243 ,2013-06-12,Mingze Wu,https://www.investing.com/analysis/usd-sgd:-singapore-growth-forecast-cut-but-1.258-holding-171060,171060

144498,366013,MAS,Eurozone Needs Process  Not Money,opinion,Crises are always going to happen  but they are less stressful when sound institutional processes are in place  The most positive takeaway of the recent Eurozone summit was the announcement of an integrated supervisory mechanism as a precondition to any bank bailout  A European guarantee of Spanish bank deposits without a corresponding handover of banking supervision would only perpetuate bad habits It should not be too much to ask for a process  using ECB President Draghi s words  policy makers in the Eurozone must  define roles  deadlines and conditions to be satisfied   Yet  since last summer  the modus operandi in managing the crisis has generally been to take two steps back with each step forward  We may have broken out of this downward spiral with the latest summit  But too many questions remain  for example  will the new bank regulator have a strong resolution authority  and be able to seize and liquidate insolvent Spanish banks  Will the influence of national bank regulators be reduced  in part to disallow banks to treat the debt of their own governments as risk free  Banks are in the business of managing risk and indeed lend to risky customers all the time by unbiasedly pricing in that risk  but when their own regulators indicate that something is risk free when it is not  risky assets are not properly priced and the banking system malfunctions  And while Spain is in the limelight  it would be helpful if regulators of strong countries  such as Germany s BaFin  also ceded control to help root out bad habits  Last summer  when the European Banking Authority  EBA  demanded the publication of sovereign debt holdings  BaFin balked  it was market pressure that  encouraged  German banks to be more transparent  Simply put  national regulators have proven inept at managing their conflicts of interests The euro s surge after the summit shows the currency advances on progress in the process  Well defined processes help markets to function  as buyers and sellers negotiate market based values of assets  In contrast  guarantees ultimately increase volatility as asset prices become more correlated  everything will be safe until the guarantor is deemed unsafe  thus crashing the system as a whole A credible strategy must be in place for investors to regain confidence  Spain is particularly disappointing to investors  Here is a case where a government enjoying an absolute majority at times appears to put more emphasis on negotiating lower borrowing costs than on structural reform that would lower the amounts that need to be borrowed in the first place  This crisis will not end as long as debt is merely shuffled around  Having said that  a lot has been achieved already  in some ways  we already have a United States of Europe  when a weak country asks for help  it receives aid in return for ceding sovereign control over budgeting  The main difference to the emerging vision of Europe is that budgets ought to be reviewed before a crisis erupts  We are inching towards the vision in a typically European piecemeal fashion  with weak countries taking the lead  incentivized by market pressures Investors don t need guarantees  Investors need to be properly compensated for the risks they are taking on  At this stage  however  they also need to take into account the risk that the rules of engagement are constantly changing  And to add insult to injury  if an investor lends money to Spain at 7   they might be labeled a dreadful speculator trying to benefit from Spain s suffering  So why bother In the meantime  central bankers around the world  fearing further fallout  are hoping for the best  but planning for the worst  In the Eurozone  it means Long Term Refinancing Operations  LTROs  and lower interest rates  in the U K   it means quantitative easing  in Japan  it means introducing an inflation target above the current rate of inflation  in the U S   it means Operation Twist  Even as we are encouraged that pieces of a process are finally coming together  we simply cannot ignore the tail risks in the Eurozone  Meanwhile  there are opportunities elsewhere  However  we don t agree with the conventional wisdom that the U S  is the safe haven to flee to  not least because of the unsustainable fiscal situation and our expectation of further Fed easing Our favorite substitute for the euro while we ride out the storm in the Eurozone is the Singapore dollar  While commodity currencies might be prime beneficiaries of the increased trigger friendliness at major central banks  such currencies are historically rather volatile  The Monetary Authority of Singapore  MAS  has shown the utmost restraint in recent years  In many ways  the Singapore dollar behaves like a European currency without the tail risks  It fulfills that role better than Scandinavian currencies that tend to amplify whatever happens to the euro due to the dependency of their economies on the Eurozone ,2012-07-18,Axel G.

144499,366014,MAS,Preempting The Search For Loopholes In Singapore ,opinion,Nearly four years ago  the   MAS  began putting out the word that important revisions to the regulation of fund management companies were under consideration  They would arrive on a Big Day  That Big Day  or two of them  have come and gone  Specifically  on August 6  2012 the MAS announced new rules that were to take effect the following day  August 7  The authority framed the new rules as amendments to three existing codes  the Securities and Futures  Licensing and Conduct of Business  Regulations  Securities and Futures  Financial and Margin Requirements  Regulations  and Financial Advisers Regulations  Risk Management and Base Capital According to GFIA  which offered its own analysis of the new regs in the August issue of its  Research Insights  publication  their key concept is the requirement of a risk management framework which is itself left undefined  except that an FMC must have one  and it must identify  address  and monitor  the risks associated with assets under its management  in a manner  which is appropriate to the nature  scale  and complexity of the assets   The undefined character of the required framework will be frustrating  but GFIA asks that we look at matters from the point of view of the MAS here  Had it codified rules by which a FMC could be sure it has a compliant risk management framework in place  those rules would be  for at least some firms  unexpectedly inappropriate  Further  the exercise would  invite investment banking types to find loopholes   With the frustratingly vague language quoted above  the MAS just might spur managers  to think creatively and sensibly about the risks inherent in their businesses  not just in their portfolios   Base capital requirements constitute another new feature of the regs  How much base capital an FMC must have varies with the category  and the categories are defined by whose assets are being managed  The highest tier case capital requirement is S 1 million  The lowest tier is S 250 000  At current exchange rates those numbers are roughly US  800 000 and  202 000  respectively  These requirements are  not necessarily onerous   GFIA says  but compliance will require ongoing internal monitoring  and the definition of  base capital  can be a little tricky  AML and Valuation GFIA suggests that firms doing business in Singapore  especially those who may not be entirely familiar with the country and its regulatory sensitivities  should be very careful about the cleanliness of the money passing through their hands   As the Republic increasingly becomes a global center for wealth management  it cannot afford to let its reputation be dented  by anyone trying to use it as a laundry for dirty money  Know your customers  Also  the new rules have a valuation aspect  GFIA sees this as simply a matter of codifying what is best practice anyway  that if a manager has an asset base that isn t immediately liquid or market traded  the manager should have a valuation policy in writing  In general  the GFIA concludes  the new regulations won t hamstring the local industry  They are  positive  pragmatic  and in line with global best practice   Recent Economic Developments In a separate development  the MAS also recently put out its latest report on  in  and prospects for  that country  Since Singapore is a great trading hub  this was mostly a summary of the state of its trading partners  and their likely consequences  They are worthy of a moment of review as a demonstration of the interconnectedness of the world s profit centers  This study made the following points  The economy contracted in the second quarter of 2012  GDP fell by a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 0 7 percentThe MAS is watching continued tensions in Europe  uncertainty in the U S   and deceleration in both China and India   factors that do not incline it to optimismIt expects that the economy of Japan will continue growing  though at a decelerating pace  through the remainder of the year  with a low rate of headline inflationASEAN 4 economies  Indonesia  Malaysia  the Philippines  and Thailand  offer a bright spot The ASEAN 4 enjoy  relatively strong macroeconomic fundamentals   In particular  Indonesia s GDP grew 6 4 percent year to year in the second quarter  benefiting form strong foreign direct investment flows  Thailand has seen brisk economic activity  including post flood reconstruction spending ,2012-09-13,AllAboutAlpha,https://www.investing.com/analysis/preempting-the-search-for-loopholes-in-singapore-136213,136213
144500,366015,MAS,Best And Worst ETFs  And Mutual Funds   All Cap Value ,opinion,The all cap value style ranks seventh out of the twelve fund styles as detailed in my style rankings for ETFs and mutual funds  It gets my Dangerous rating  which is based on aggregation of ratings of two ETFs and 266 mutual funds in the all cap value style as of October 19  2012  Figure 1 ranks from best to worst the two all cap value ETFs and Figure 2 shows the five best and worst rated all cap value mutual funds  Not all all cap value style ETFs and mutual funds are created the same  The number of holdings varies widely  from 12 to 2 035   which creates drastically different investment implications and ratings  The best ETFs and mutual funds allocate more value to Attractive or better rated stocks than the worst  which allocate too much value to Neutral or worse rated stocks  To identify the best and avoid the worst ETFs and mutual funds within the all cap value style  investors need a predictive rating based on  1  stocks ratings of the holdings and  2  the all in expenses of each ETF and mutual fund  Investors need not rely on backward looking ratings  Investors should not buy any all cap value ETFs or mutual funds because none get an Attractive or better rating  If you must have exposure to this style  you should buy a basket of Attractive or better rated stocks and avoid paying undeserved fund fees  Active management has a long history of not paying off  Figure 1  ETFs with the Best and Worst Ratings   Best ETFs exclude ETFs with less NAV s less than 100 million Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filingsFigure 2  Mutual Funds with the Best and Worst Ratings   Top 5  Best mutual funds exclude funds with NAV s less than 100 million  Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings 12 mutual funds are excluded from Figure 2 because their total net assets  TNA  are below  100 million and do not meet our liquidity standards iShares Russell 3000 Value  IWW  is my top rated all cap value ETF and Homestead Funds  Inc  Value Fund  HOVLX  is my top rated all cap value mutual fund  Both earn my Neutral rating First Trust Multi Cap Value AlphaDEX Fund  FAB  is my worst rated all cap value ETF and Janus Investment Fund  Perkins Select Value Fund  JVSAX  is my worst rated all cap value mutual fund  Both earn my Dangerous or worse rating Figure 3 shows that 448 out of the 2 144 stocks  over 30  of the total net assets  held by all cap value ETFs and mutual funds get an Attractive or better rating  However  none of the all cap value ETFs and only one mutual fund Attractive or better rating The takeaways are  mutual fund managers allocate too much capital to low quality stocks and all cap value ETFs hold poor quality stocks Figure 3  All cap Value Style Landscape For ETFs  Mutual Funds and StocksSources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings As detailed in     the fund industry offers many cheap funds but very few funds with high quality stocks  or with what I call good portfolio management  Investors need to tread carefully when considering all cap value ETFs and mutual funds as only one fund is worth buying  Investors are better off focusing on individual all cap value stocks  Abbott Laboratories  ABT  is one of my favorite stocks held by all cap value funds  It receives my Very Attractive rating due to its high profitability and low valuation  Abbott has produced a positive economic earnings margin every year since 1998  Over the past five years Abbott increased their after tax operating earnings  NOPAT  at a CAGR of 14  a year  Ironically  in return for this growth in profits  the market has assigned ABT a price to economic book  P EBV  value of 0 8  which means the current valuations of the stock implies the company will experience a permanent decline in profits of 20   The disconnect between the market s expectations and ABT s recent performance makes ABT a Very Attractive stock  Masco Corporation  MAS  is one of the least favorite stocks held by all cap value  Contrary to ABT  MAS receives a Dangerous rating because its lack of profitability and high valuation  MAS has never generated positive economic earnings in all 14 years of my model  On top of this poor profitability  to justify MAS  current stock price of   15 16  the company must grow its after tax profit  NOPAT  by 20  compounded annually for the next twelve years  Over the past 12 years  MAS s NOPAT has decline by 9  compounded annually  It appears MAS  current stock price carries seriously high expectations  Investors would be smart avoid to this stock in favor of more Attractive alternatives  Figures 4 and 5 show the rating landscape of all all cap value ETFs and mutual funds  Figure 4  Separating the Best ETFs From the Worst Fund Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings Figure 5  Separating the Best Mutual Funds From the Worst Funds Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings
