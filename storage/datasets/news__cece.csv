Strength Despite Market Volatility In the stock game  winning means reaching a higher price   However  striking the right chord each time needs a fair amount of luck No matter how disciplined and systematic investors are  equity market volatility will always manage to get the better of them  While a few lucky ones rake in the moolah  others fall victim to ad hoc strategies One could resort to commonly used techniques to find beaten down stocks that have the potential to recover faster than others  However  even such investment choices bear the risk of disappointment  Particularly  one could fall into the value trap if the hidden weaknesses in selected stock are not identified So  wouldn t it be a safer strategy to look for stocks that are winners currently and have the potential to gain further Sounds good  Here s how to execute it One should primarily target stocks that have recently been on a bull run  Actually  stocks seeing price strength recently have a high chance of carrying the momentum forward If a stock is continuously witnessing an uptrend  there must be a solid reason or else it would have probably crashed  So  looking at stocks that are capable of beating the benchmark that they have set for themselves seems rational However  recent price strength alone cannot create the magic  Therefore  you need to set other relevant parameters to create a successful investment strategy Here s how you should create the screen to shortlist the current as well as the potential winners For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at

1400,222915,CECE,Lindsay  LNN  Weighed Down By Weak Demand And Higher Costs,opinion,On Jul 12  we issued an updated research report on Lindsay Corporation   NYSE LNN    Though the company is well poised on its Foundation for Growth initiative and introduction of technologically advanced products in the long run  weak demand for its irritation equipment owing to current weakness in North American agricultural markets and inflated costs continue to weigh on the stock  Weak Demand to Weigh on Near Term ResultsOn Jul 9  2019 Lindsay reported third quarter fiscal 2019  ended May 31  2019  results  which fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimates on both counts   earnings and revenues  Lindsay delivered adjusted net earnings of 50 cents per share in the quarter  which marked a decline of 70  from prior year quarter while revenues suffered a drop of 29  to  121 million  Lower commodity prices and trade uncertainty weighed on irrigation equipment demand during the reported quarter  Further  strong Road Zipper System sales in the year ago quarter led to the challenging year over year comparison  Lindsay s backlog as of May 31  2019 was  42 5 million  down from  55 8 million as of May 31  2018 Agricultural markets have been affected by lower commodity prices  reduced exports  as a result of the ongoing U S China trade dispute and the weakened currency  Further  per USDA s latest available report  from March 2019  net farm income is anticipated to rise 10  to  69 billion in 2019  However  it still remains substantially below the 10 year U S  net farm income average of  85 3 billion  in nominal dollars  primarily owing to weaker prices for most major crops  This weak forecast and lower commodity prices signal the likelihood of persistent constrained demand for irrigation equipment in North America  This will continue to limit Lindsay s revenues Moreover  heavy rainfall and widespread flooding in many parts of the Midwest negatively impacted irrigation equipment demand during the May end quarter Sales of the Road Zipper system have also been soft  of late  Moreover  the considerable duration required for completing these projects is a concern  Lindsay s results will bear the brunt of a constrained government spending environment  In December 2015  the U S  government enacted a five year  305 billion highway funding bill to fund highway and bridge projects   the first long term national transportation spending bill in a decade  Though this provides stability  the funding levels have not increased Inflated Costs to Dent MarginsLindsay utilizes steel as a major raw material to manufacture products  Steel prices in the United States increased primarily as a result of tariffs that were implemented on imported steel  Inflated raw material costs will continue to impair the company s margins Lindsay will also bear the brunt of elevated costs incurred in connection with its Foundation for Growth performance improvement initiative  Results for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 included pre tax costs of  3 9 million in connection with the initiative  of which  3 million represents professional consulting fees  The company also incurred severance costs related to organizational changes  Lindsay anticipates incurring additional consulting fees in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 Foundation for Growth Initiative to Generate Long Term ReturnsMeanwhile  Lindsay remains focused on simplifying its business in order to improve productivity  In sync with this  Lindsay s Foundation for Growth initiative had been launched in 2018  A key financial objective of the initiative is to achieve operating margin performance between 11  and 12  by fiscal 2020  The company is fully focused on gaining margin expansion in four primary areas   manufacturing footprint  G A  the shared services activities  sourcing and commercial  Lindsay anticipates its irrigation operating margin performance in the United States to eventually benefit from the introduction of technologically advanced products Share Price PerformanceOver the past year  Lindsay s shares have declined 6 3  against the  s growth of 0 8  Zacks Rank

1441,222956,CECE,Milacron  MCRN  Falls 42  In A Year  Dismal Run To Continue ,opinion,Milacron Holdings Corp    NYSE MCRN   shares haven t been performing well over the past year  The stock price of global leader in the manufacture  distribution  and service of highly engineered and customized systems utilized in the plastic technology and processing industry has fallen 42  over the past year  compared with the stocks in the  that posted a cumulative decline of 22  Factors Plaguing MilacronMilacron reported adjusted earnings per share of  1 78 in 2018  down 1 7  from the prior year  In 2018  sales increased 2  year over year to  1 26 billion  In 2018  orders declined 7  year over year to  1211 2 million   New orders were primarily impacted by a decline in the equipment business in Europe and North America  a slump in hot runner business in China and the impact of product line de selection within the APPT segment  partially mitigated by an increase in the global fluids business  Backlog at 2018 end was also down to  226 million compared with  257 million at the prior year end owing to its European equipment business  Milacron projects sales to decline 3 4  in 2019  including an anticipated headwind of 1  from foreign currency translation Steel is the primary raw material input for the Advanced Plastic Processing Technologies and Melt Delivery and Control Systems segments  Consequently  tariffs on steel prices will continue to impact Milacron s margins  It is projected to have an impact of  4 2 million on the company s results in 2019  The Advanced Plastic Processing Technologies segment will bear the brunt of the impact which is estimated at  2 5 million while the Melt Delivery and Control Systems segment s results will be impacted by  1 7 million Will the Struggle Persist Analysts have been growing bearish on the stock  currently carrying a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   as evidenced by the downward revision of the company s first quarter 2019 and full year 2019 estimates  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first quarter 2019 earnings has declined 39  over the past 90 days while the same for 2019 has slumped 21  The company remains optimistic on mitigating the headwind from tariffs by focusing on pricing actions  negotiations with existing vendors and making supply chain modifications  Milacron is also seeking exemptions on certain materials that are unavailable or are in short supply in the United States  Consequently  the company s focus on these factors will help lessen the impact of tariffs Further  since 2014  Milacron has undergone a number of organizational redesign and cost reduction initiatives to improve cost structure and operating flexibility  This includes consolidating manufacturing and back office infrastructure in North America and Europe   With the restructuring now complete  the company will focus on enhancing operations  optimizing product mix  improving service to customers and augmenting financial performance The Advanced Plastic Processing Technologies segment will be supported by enhanced demand in the plastic processing machinery industry driven by the overall expected rise in plastic processing  increasing equipment age and continuing advances in technology  In the Melt Delivery and Control Systems segment  the hot runner market is likely to grow faster than the overall global economy based on macro economic drivers involving product life cycles  demographics  technology conversion and greater utilization of plastic In the fluids segment  demand for industrial fluids is closely tied to demand for metal products  which are produced on metalworking machinery through cutting  stamping and other processes  As industrial production and demand for metalworking machinery grows  manufacturers will require increased amounts of high quality coolants  lubricants and cleaners to maximize productivity  and extend the life of equipment and tooling  Market trends indicate elevated demand for technology fluids due to environmental and health concerns We believe that these factors will eventually benefit Milacron results and drive a recovery in its share price Stocks to

1487,223002,CECE,Owens Illinois Poised On Favorable Glass Demand  Debt Rises,opinion,On Dec 24  we issued an updated research report on Owens Illinois  Inc    NYSE OI    The company is poised well on growing demand for glass packaging  benefits from ongoing successful joint venture   JV   with Constellation Brands  Inc    NYSE STZ    and Total System Cost approach  However  unfavorable foreign currency  freight inflation and continued decline of beer in the domestic market remain headwinds  Factors Likely to Weigh On 2018 Earnings The company delivered third quarter earnings per share of 75 cents  declining 3  year over year  This can be attributed to unfavorable foreign currency effect and temporary soft volumes  Unfavorable foreign currency will continue to be a headwind in fiscal 2018  The company also continues to face substantial freight inflation in the United States  Further  poor grape harvest in Europe in 2017 is affecting wine volumes in the region in 2018   On top of this  the continued decline of beer in the domestic market remains a perennial concern  Consequently  Owens Illinois lowered adjusted earnings per share guidance range to  2 72  2 78 for 2018 from its previous guidance of  2 75  2 85  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 is  2 74  reflecting year over year growth of 3 4   Geared for Improved 2019 Results In 2019  the company anticipates top line growth and margin expansion driven by its Total System Cost approach   TSC   and footprint optimization  The company expects earnings per share of around  3 00 in fiscal 2019  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2019 is pegged at  2 95  The company anticipates about 1  volume organic growth in its legacy volumes and continued growth in the JV with Constellation Brands in the fiscal  In Europe  wine sales will be higher in 2019 due to the strong grape harvest in 2018  Further  glass packaging in Western Europe has been growing for last two years   in line with total packaging  Premium products in Europe are growing significantly faster than overall market  The company s efforts to add capacity in Europe  supply chain performance  and footprint optimization poises it well for growing volumes and expanding margins in the region Considering the improving market demand in Mexico and Brazil  the company is adding capacity  In the United States  demand for glass is improving bolstered by favorable consumer trends and increased preference of customers for glass packaging  Non beer categories in the United States continue to improve at low single digits over time  Consequently  the company has been focusing on these categories by improving customer relationships  commercial and design capabilities  and converting almost 20  of its beer capacity into flexible capacity to meet non beer customer demand  Overall  the Americas are expected to generate higher sales  profit and margin in the coming year  In Asia Pacific  growing demand in emerging markets will drive volumes  Owens Illinois has completed its asset improvements program in the region  and expects higher volumes and lower manufacturing expense to drive margins higher going forward  Bets on Successful JV to Assist Growth Owens Illinois is striving to mitigate the impact of the ongoing decline in mega beer in the United States by positioning itself to benefit from the rapidly growing market of U S  beer imports  It intends to achieve this through its JV with Constellation and long term sales contracts in Mexico  The JV has exceeded expectations so far   productivity has been higher than anticipated  capital costs were considerably lesser than initially expected  and earnings have been growing every year  The company has built four furnaces at the JV in just four years and is currently building a fifth furnace that is expected to come on line in the second half of 2009  The fifth furnace will help cater to the rising demand from Constellation s adjacent brewery  With the installation of the fifth furnace  the Nava plant will be the largest  most modern glass container factory globally  The total cost of approximately  140 million  will be financed by equal contributions from both partners  High Debt   Competition Remain Woes Despite Owens Illinois  deleveraging and refinancing actions in the past 12 months  its debt to capitalization ratio remains high at 84   Higher interest levels will impact its margins  Further  its margins will bear the impact of the company s incremental investments in R D in the near term  Owens Illinois faces intense competition from manufacturers of alternative forms of packaging  such as aluminum cans and plastic containers  persists  Advantages in price  quality  and functional attributes of these alternative containers may lead to customers considering a change of suppliers or the form of packaging  which could affect Owens Illinois  Further  persistent decline of beer in the domestic market remains a major headwind  Share Price Performance  Shares of Owens Illinois have dropped 28  in the past year  compared with the  s decline of 31   Owens Illinois carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Stocks to

Coverage   Price MovementIt is interesting to note that the price movement is generally a function of recommendations from new analysts  Stocks typically see an upward price movement with a new analyst coverage compared to what they witness with a rating upgrade under an existing coverage  Positive recommendations   Buy and Strong Buy   generally lead to a significantly positive price reaction than Hold recommendations  On the contrary  analysts hardly initiate coverage with a Strong Sell or Sell recommendation Now  if an analyst issues a new recommendation on a company that has very few or no existing coverage  investors start paying more attention to it  Also  any new information attracts portfolio managers to build a position in the stock So  it s a good strategy to bet on stocks that have seen increased analyst coverage over the last few weeks Screening CriteriaNumber of Broker Ratings now greater than the Number of Broker Ratings four weeks ago  This will shortlist stocks that have recent new coverage  Average Broker Rating less than Average Broker Rating four weeks ago   Less than  means  better than  four weeks ago  Increased analyst coverage and improving average rating are the primary criteria of this strategy but one should consider other relevant parameters to make the strategy foolproof Here are the other screening parameters Price greater than or equal to  5  as a stock below  5 will not likely create significant interest for most investors  Average Daily Volume greater than or equal to 100 000 shares  if volume isn t enough  it will not

2018  Caterpillar reported average sales growth of 25   In third quarter 2018  Caterpillar delivered adjusted earnings per share of  2 86  surging 47  year over year  This can be attributed to

recent dip in sales growth is likely to be transitory in nature as the company is anticipated to benefit from strong order rates and an increasing backlog through the rest of 2018  The Construction segment will gain from infrastructure development in China  and continued demand in North American residential  non residential and infrastructure markets  Rising commodity prices will drive revenues of Resource Industries and Energy   Transportation  Further  cost cutting efforts  and additional investments in expanded offerings and services will drive growth  Caterpillar currently carries a

1534,223049,CECE,Terex  TEX  Stock Declines 35  YTD  Will It Bounce Back ,opinion,Shares of Terex Corporation   NYSE TEX   have slumped 45  year to date compared with the  s decline of 24   The decline can be attributed to headwinds plaguing the company   What s Pulling the Stock Down  The company s Cranes segment  which contributed 24  to the company s revenues  witnessed supply chain challenges in mobile crane operations during the first three quarters of 2018  Notably  the segment s operating results were negatively impacted by disruption in mobile cranes factory  owing to material shortages  Even though the company addressed supply chain challenges in the third quarter of 2018  the results were not as expected  Terex anticipates the Cranes segment to break even or generate a small profit in the fourth quarter owing to the abovementioned headwind and raw material inflation  However  it will suffer an operating loss margin of 2 3  for the full year  down from the previous expectation of operating loss margin of between 1  and 1 5  for fiscal 2018  The company guides sales growth of 11  for fiscal 2018  lower than its previous expectation of growth of 13   Moreover  the company updated production plans for the segment owing to the abovementioned supply chain challenges  Terex anticipates fiscal 2018 sales to be up 17  to  5 1 billion  down from the prior projection of 18    Additionally  the company anticipates operating margin at around 6 6  in 2018  a tad lower than the prior guidance of 7   The company lowered adjusted earnings per share guidance for 2018 to  2 60  2 70 from the previous guidance of  2 80  3 00 owing to lower than expected third quarter results  Further  higher input costs  including tariffs  and foreign exchange headwinds resulted in the trimmed guidance  The company s margin outlook has been lately tempered by pricing and steel cost headwinds  The market prices and futures prices for steel increased significantly since the first quarter due to the imposition on certain steel imports  Inability of the company to pass on the increase by implementing price hikes owing to the competitive environment adds to concern  This is likely to dent its margins  The negativity around the stock can be gauged from the Zacks Consensus Estimate being revised downward by 32  in the past 60 days for current quarter earnings  Over the same time period  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 has been revised downward by 9  and 6   respectively  Terex s Zacks Rank  4  Sell  only reaffirms that it is plagued with several headwinds at the moment  The unfavorable rank implies that investors should get rid of the stock from their respective portfolios  In fact  stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Strong Sell  are likely to underperform the broader market over the next one to three months  Will the Stock Rebound  Terex s Aerial Work Platforms segment will gain from strong global markets  operational execution and innovative new products  The segment is in the early point of the growth cycle  both in North America and Western Europe  China and other developing markets are still in the early phase of adopting products  Macroeconomic fundamentals and customers feedback all hint toward a multi year growth period for the segment  The company expects that its AWP segment will achieve an operating margin of between 10 5  and 11 0  in 2018  and net sales growth of 22   With strong markets and a significantly higher backlog than last year  the Material Processing segment is well positioned for 2018  Further  rising global demand for crushing and screening equipment spurred by economic growth  construction activity and aggregate consumption bodes well  Its Fuchs material handlers and broad line of environmental products continue to grow in global markets which are likely drive the segment s growth  Operating margin at the MP segment is projected at 12 5  for 2018 while sales growth will be around 16   Further  Terex s backlog has been growing year over year in every segment for seven quarters in a row  An improving backlog  along with an enhanced global market   environment positions the company well for the future  We believe these factors will benefit Terex s results going forward  and lift its share price  However  the stock will remain under pressure due to the abovementioned headwinds for the time being  Stocks to Consider Some better ranked stocks in the same sector are DMC Global Inc    NASDAQ BOOM    CECO Environmental Corp    NASDAQ CECE   and Northwest Pipe Company   NASDAQ NWPX    While DMC Global sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   CECO Environmental and Northwest Pipe carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see   DMC

an Eye on as Analysts Initiate CoverageCoverage initiation on a stock by analyst s  majorly helps in interpreting information pertaining to capital markets  creating value for investors  Lack of information creates inefficiencies that might trigger misinterpretation of stocks  over  or under valued  In fact  coverage initiation usually depicts increased investor inclination  Investors  on their part  often assume that there is something in the stock that has attracted analyst attention  In other words  they believe that the company coming under the microscope definitely has some value Obviously  stocks are not arbitrarily chosen to cover  New coverage on a stock usually reflects an encouraging future envisioned by the analyst s   At times  increased investor focus on a stock motivates analysts to take a closer look at it However  the average change in broker recommendation is preferred over a single recommendation change Analyst Coverage   Price MovementIt is interesting to note that the price movement is generally a function of recommendations from new analysts  Stocks typically see an upward price movement with a new analyst coverage compared to what they witness with a rating upgrade under an existing coverage  Positive recommendations   Buy and Strong Buy   generally lead to a significantly positive price reaction than Hold recommendations  On the contrary  analysts hardly initiate coverage with a Strong Sell or Sell recommendation Now  if an analyst issues a new recommendation on a company that has very few or no existing coverage  investors start paying more attention to it  Also  any new information attracts portfolio managers to build a position in the stock So  it s a good strategy to bet on stocks that have seen increased analyst coverage

1570,223085,CECE,CECO Environmental  3 Reasons Why CECE Is A Top Choice For Momentum Investors,opinion,Many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  but this can be very tough to define  There is great debate regarding which metrics are the best to focus on in this regard  and which are not really quality indicators of future performance  Fortunately  with our new  we have identified the key statistics to pay close attention to and thus which stocks might be the best for momentum investors in the near term This method discovered several great candidates for momentum oriented investors  but today let s focus in on CECO Environmental Corp    NASDAQ CECE   as this stock is looking especially impressive right now  And while there are numerous ways in which this company could be a great choice  we have highlighted three of the most vital reasons for CECE s status as a solid momentum stock below Short Term Price Change for CECO Environmental A great place to look for finding momentum stocks is by inspecting short term price activity  This can help to reflect the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand right now  It is especially useful to compare it to the industry as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area With a one week price change of 4 25  compared to an industry average of  1 74   CECE is certainly well positioned in this regard  The stock is also looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the four week price change compares favorably with the industry at large as well Longer Term Price Change for CECO Environmental While any stock can see a spike in price  it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market  That is why looking at longer term price metrics such as performance over the past three months or year   and comparing these to an industry at large can be very useful And in the case of CECE  the results are quite impressive  The company has beaten out the industry at large over the past 12 weeks by a margin of 25 91  to 4 55  while it has also outperformed when looking at the past year  putting up a gain of77 56   Clearly  CECE is riding a bit of a hot streak and is worth a closer look by investors  CECE Earnings Estimate Revisions Moving in the Right DirectionWhile the great momentum factors outlined in the preceding paragraphs might be enough for some investors  we should also take into account broad earnings estimate revision trends  A nice path here can really help to show us a promising stock  and we have actually been seeing that with CECE as of late too Over the past two months 4 earning estimates have gone higher compared to none lower for the full year  while we are also seeing that 3 estimates have moved upwards with no downward revisions for the next year time frame too  These revisions have helped to boost the consensus estimate as two months ago CECE was expected to post earnings of 79 cents share for the full year  though today it looks to have EPS of 84 cents for the full year now  representing a solid increase which is something that should definitely be welcomed news to would be investors CECO ENVIRNMNTL Price and Consensus   Bottom LineGiven these factors  investors shouldn t be surprised to note that we have CECE as a security with a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and a Momentum Score of  A  You can see  So if you are looking for a fresh pick that has potential to move in the right direction  definitely keep CECE on your short list as this looks be a stock that is very well positioned to soar in the near term Zacks  Top Investment Ideas for Long Term Profit How would you like to see our best recommendations to help you find today s most promising long term stocks  Starting now  you can look inside our portfolios featuring stocks under  10  income stocks  value investments and more  These picks  which have double and triple digit profit potential  are rarely available to the public  But you can see them now ,2016-12-05,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/ceco-environmental:-3-reasons-why-cece-is-a-top-choice-for-momentum-investors-200168375,200168375
1572,223087,CECE,Will CECO Environmental Be A Suitable Pick For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put CECO Environmental Corp    NASDAQ CECE   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  CECO Environmental has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 10 72  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 36  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts CECO Environmental s PE ratio below its midpoint over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares pretty favorably with the Zacks classified Pollution Control Equipment Services industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 26 48  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that CECE has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 11 39  so it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near future P CF RatioAn often overlooked ratio that can still be a great indicator of value is the price cash flow metric  This ratio doesn t take amortization and depreciation into account  so can give a more accurate picture of the financial health in a business This is a preferred metric to some valuation investors because cash flows are  a  generally less prone to manipulation by the company s management and  b  are less affected by variation in accounting policies between different companies The ratio is generally applied to find out whether a company s stock is overpriced or underpriced with reference to its cash flows generation potential compared with its competitors  However  it is not commonly used for cross industry comparison  as the average price to cash flow ratio varies from industry to industry In this case  CECO Environmental s P CF ratio of 9 33 is lower than the Zacks classified Pollution Control Equipment Services industry average of 12 98  which indicates that the stock is somewhat undervalued in this respect Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  CECE currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  A   putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes CECE a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the Price Sales ratio for CECE is just 0 88  a level that is lower than the industry average of 1 08  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better What About the Stock Overall Though CECO Environmental might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  A  and a Momentum score of  C   This gives CECE a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  A    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been discouraging  The current quarter has seen one estimates go higher in the past 60 days and two lower  while the full year estimate has seen one upward revisions and three downward revision in the same time frame As a result  the current quarter consensus estimate has dipped by 14 3  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has dropped by about 1 1   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below CECO Environmental Corp  Price and Consensus   This negative trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  despite strong value metrics and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineCECE is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  Bottom 41  out of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and broader factors to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happen  this stock could be a compelling pick More Stock News  8 Companies Verge on Apple Like RunDid you miss Apple  NASDAQ

1574,223089,CECE,Should You Get Rid Of CECO Environmental Corp   CECE  Now ,opinion,Similar to wise buying decisions  exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns  Selling off losers can be difficult  but if both the share price and estimates are falling  it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is CECO Environmental Corp    NASDAQ CECE    which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks  and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year  A Zacks Rank  4  Sell  further confirms weakness in CECE A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions  For the full year  we have seen two estimates moving down in the past 30 days  compared with no upward revisions  This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower  going from 81 cents a share a month ago to its current level of 68 cents Also  for the current quarter  CECO Environmental Corp  has seen two downward estimate revisions versus no revisions in the opposite direction  dragging the consensus estimate down to 18 cents a share from 21 cents over the past 30 days    The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately  as the share price has dropped 28 8  in the past month CECO Environmental Corp  Price and Consensus   So it may not be a good decision to keep this stock in your portfolio anymore  at least if you don t have a long time horizon to wait If you are still interested in the Pollution Control industry  you may instead consider a better ranked stock   Landauer  Inc    NYSE LDR    The stock currently sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and may be a better selection at this time  You can see  4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye OnTech stocks have been a major force behind the market s record highs  but picking the best ones to buy can be tough  There s a simple way to invest in the success of the entire sector  Zacks has just released a Special Report revealing one thing tech companies literally cannot function without  More importantly  it reveals 4 top stocks set to skyrocket on increasing demand for these devices  I encourage you to get the report now   before the next wave of innovations really takes off ,2017-08-25,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/should-you-get-rid-of-ceco-environmental-corp-cece-now-200209581,200209581
1575,223090,CECE,Cemtrex  Value Stock Pick,opinion,"Cemtrex  Inc  is a value stock pick with plenty of upside potential in this strong stock market 
Cemtrex Inc   NASDAQ CETX  is a stock pick with strong focus on value investing  which we believe has a lot of upside potential  being undervalued at current price levels of about  3 30  The stock belongs to the Sector of Industrial Goods and to the Industry of Industrial Equipment   Components  and the first step to our fundamental analysis will be the macroeconomic outlook of the Industrial Goods Sector  The Sector is very important for any stock as a starting point of fundamental analysis as it highlights current and future opportunities and trends  which are crucial for any business and its future growth and attractiveness  
Company description  Cemtrex Inc is a diversified technology company  The Company provides electronic manufacturing services of electronic system assemblies  instruments and emission monitors for industrial processes  industrial air filtration  environmental control systems  
Macroeconomic outlook  A report from  mentions that the industrials sector will probably have a strong year in 2017  based on two major factors and trends 
1  Increased investment in infrastructure  2  Rising budget for U S  defense spending 
Government spending on infrastructure projects and increased investments in defense strategic purposes can prove to be supportive and beneficial for a strong performance of the sector  something that has proved to be the case so far in 2017  as the ETF Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund  NYSE XLI   which tracks closely the industrial sector of the S P 500 index has as of 08 31 2017 closing price a 1 year return of 19 26  and a year to date return of 11 11   We see on the weekly chart that a current strong uptrend is evident 
Also another report from   NYSE SCHW  has a market perform rating on the industrials sector  with positive factors the  potential productivity gains  room for growth and accommodative monetary policy   The 5 year trend for the Industrial Production Index is also an uptrend  with increased volatility  but a resumed uptrend since March of 2016  an economic factor we consider positive for the business outlook of the company  Overall the macroeconomic outlook for the industrial sector looks positive  with a strong performance in 2017 
Fundamental analysis 
We will start our fundamental analysis of Cemtrex with the Nasdaq Dozen process  a method of analyzing a stock in 12 steps  Each of the 12 factors gets a pass or fail grade and the higher overall score  there is more confidence in the stock as it presents very important fundamental aspects  Here are the scores for each of the Nasdaq Dozen factors process for shares of Cemtrex  Inc  
1  Revenue A passing score as revenue in FY 2016 is  93 70 million  higher than the  56 89 million in FY 2015  and June 2017 quarterly revenue of  27 806 million was higher than June 2016 quarterly revenue of  24 714 million 
2  Earnings per share The FY 2017 is not yet complete  so on a quarterly basis we compare the EPS in the most recent quarter with the same quarter in the previous year  For June 2017 the EPS were  0 08  lower than the EPS of  0 17 in June 2016  so there is a failing score 
3  Return on Equity The stock gets a passing score if it has a rising ROE for two consecutive years  It gets a failing score because the After Tax ROE for FY 2014 was 73   for FY 2015 was 40  and for FY 2016 was 32  
4  Analyst Recommendations The stock gets a passing score as the analyst recommendations consensus is a buy  although there is only one analyst opinion 
5  Positive Earnings Surprises The stock gets a failing score  as in the past four consecutive quarters not all EPS surprises have been positive  There have been two positive and two negative EPS surprises 
6  Earnings Forecast The stock gets a passing score as the consensus EPS forecast numbers increase year over year  For FY 2017 the consensus EPS forecast is  0 29  for FY 2018  0 72 and for FY 2019  1 19 respectively 
7  Earnings Growth The stock gets a passing score if the long term 5 year earnings growth is higher than 8  But for the CETX stock the average long term 5 year earnings growth is 0 00  so the stock gets a failing score 
8  PEG Ratio The stock gets a passing score if the PEG ratio is less than 1 0  For the CETX stock there is insufficient information on the Nasdaq website  so we will not take it into consideration into our final score and we will calculate the score based on the other 11 out of 12 factors 
9  Industry Price Earnings The stock gets a failing score as the company s earnings are lower than the industry s earnings 
10  Days to Cover This figure measures the number of days  based on the average trading volume of the stock  that it would take all short sellers to cover their short positions  A stock gets a passing score if the number of days is less than 2 days  For the latest settlement date of 8 31 2017 the actual number of days to cover is 5 404281  so the stock gets a failing score 
11  Insider Trading The stock gets a passing score as the net activity for the past 3 months has been positive  The CETX stock shows a positive net activity of 3 800 shares so it gets a passing score 
12  Weighted Alpha Weighted Alpha measures 1 year growth with an emphasis on the most recent price activity  with a positive number indicating the stock is trending higher  The stock gets a passing score if the Weighted Alpha score is positive  On the Nasdaq Website the score for the CETX score is  17 90  negative  so the stock gets a failing score  The total score for the 12 factors if we exclude the factor of PEG Ratio for which there is not enough information is a score of 4 passing scores and 7 failing scores  and a ratio of 4 7 for passing and failing scores  This is only one part of the fundamental analysis  and more emphasis on the trends of financial performance will follow to help us support a well detailed argument for the recommendation of the stock 
We will analyze the financial performance and trends for the CETX stock for a 5 year period analysis for the years 2012 2016  as the fiscal year 2017 has not ended yet  Starting with the Income Statement there is an uptrend for the Sales Revenue  Gross Income  Net Income  EPS  basic and diluted  and EBITDA for these 5 years  a very positive fundamental feature  The revenues grew 64 72  in FY 2016 as compared to FY 2015 to 93 70M  while Net income grew 75 96  to 4 99M  and EPS  diluted  grew to  0 58 compared to  0 40  an increase of 45   Also the increase of about 125  to the EBITDA in FY 2016 of  7 36 million  compared to the EBITDA of  3 27 million in FY 2015 is very significant and positive for the valuation of the stock 
The company has a strong Balance Sheet and strong financial strength  with increased cash available in our 5 year trend analysis  increased Total Equity  and a low Debt Equity ratio of 0 35  while liquidity is strong with a current ratio of 2 55 and a quick ratio of 1 66 
The Cash Flow Statement present a volatile trend for Net Operating Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow for the 5 year period of our analysis  For FY 2016 and FY 2015  the company has positive and increasing cash flows  with a large increase of 247 52  for the Net Operating Cash Flow in FY 2016 to  14 04 million compared to the figure of  4 04 million in FY 2015  and an increase of 430 55  for the Free Cash Flow in FY 2016 with a reading of  13 37 million compared to the figure of  2 52 million for the FY 2015  This very large increase in the Free Cash Flow in FY 2016 supports at a very large degree our valuation of the stock and the statement that it is undervalued at current stock price of about  3 30 
Financial Ratios Analysis  Profitability ratios and margins ratios present a mixed trend  The company has managed to increase its Gross Margin from 11 31  in FY 2012 to 31 18  in FY 2016  but for Operating and Net Margin there is an inconsistent trend  However Operating Margin and Net Margin have increased in FY 2016 compared to FY 2015  with readings of 5 40  for Operating Margin and 5 33  for Net Margin in FY 2016  while in FY 2015 the figures were 4 40  and 4 99  accordingly  There is also an inconsistent trend for other measures of profitability  such as the Return on Assets and Return on Equity financial ratios  Both of them have declined in the FY 2016 compared to the FY 2015  but on a trailing twelve months basis the company has higher ROE and ROA compared to the average ratios of its industry and sector  The company has a trailing twelve months ROE of 18 83   when the relevant ROE average readings for the industry and sector are 13 82  and 13 87   and a trailing twelve months ROA of 8 0   when the relevant ROA ratios for the industry and sector are 3 73  and 7 71  accordingly 
Activity ratios present a weak efficiency for the company as all of the following activity ratios Receivables Turnover  inventory Turnover  Fixed Assets turnover and Asset Turnover  present a downtrend  which is consistent for all of the previous 5 years for the Receivables and Asset Turnover  while for the rest of the efficiency ratios there is a decline for the latest three consecutive years 
Liquidity and solvency ratios present also increased volatility for the 5 year period of financial analysis  but their trend shows a company with increased financial health  good liquidity with a Current Ratio and Quick Ratio readings of 2 55 and 1 55 respectively for the latest quarter  while Debt Equity Ratio has declined to 0 26 in the latest quarter  down from a reading of 0 96 for FY 2016  The company also is reducing its Financial Leverage Ratio with a reading of 1 77 for the latest quarter compared to a reading of 3 57 for FY 2016  and it has a trailing twelve months reading of 7 04 for its Interest Coverage Ratio  which is considered strong enough  posing not any short term financial worries 
Growth  Growth is very important for any stock  especially for valuation purposes  and this sector is very strong for the company which grows at both attractive and not excessive levels  Again we focus on long term growth rates based on a 5 year period analysis for years 2012 2016 to have a more indicative trend  as short term trends often are prone to specific factors  which can distort the actual trends  The 5 year average growth rates for the company in FY 2016 for the Revenue  Operating Income  Net Income and EPS are 46 83   35 61   37 64  and 37 04  respectively  The company therefore shows consistent growth both in Revenue and Profitability  which we consider a very positive aspect of our fundamental analysis 
Analyst Recommendation and Historical Surprises  Although there are not many analyst opinions  only one  the consensus recommendation is outperform  and this has not changed for the past three consecutive months  The company for the past five quarters has three positive and two negative surprises for sales  with an average surprise of 6 776   and also three positive surprises and two negative surprises for EPS  with an average surprise of  0 128  
Valuation Analysis  We will compare the shares of Cemtrex  Inc   NASDAQ CETX  to the average financial ratios of its industry and S P 500 Index  and also to some of its major competitors as a basis for our relative valuation analysis 
Relative valuation table 1 Price Ratio CETX
Industry Average S P 500
Price Earnings 6 8 69 6 21 5
Price Book 0 9 2 7 3 0
Price Sales 0 3 1 4 2 1
Price Cash Flow 17 8 24 1 13 5
From the relative valuation table 1 the CETX stock seems relatively significantly undervalued compared to all the average price ratios of its industry  and the relative price ratios of the S P 500 index  with the only exception of Price Cash Flow Ratio  as CETX stock has a higher current price ratio compared to the current price ratio of S P 500 index  If we compare the company to some of its major competitors in the stock market  we get the following results summarized in relative valuation table 2 
Relative valuation table 2 Price Ratio CETX CECE FTEK ENTG
Price Earnings 6 80 N A N A 33 12
Price Book 1 95 1 45 0 53 4 39
Price Sales 0 35 0 67 0 43 3 37
We refer to related companies CECO Environmental Corp   NASDAQ CECE   Fuel Tech Inc   NASDAQ FTEK  and Entegris Inc   NASDAQ ENTG   For the FY 2016  CECO Environmental and Fuel Tech had losses and therefore their Price Earnings Ratio is not meaningful  The second relative valuation table above  shows that for two out of three price ratios  the CETX stock has the lowest ratios for Price Earnings and Price Sales compared to the three other companies  And for the Price Book ratio the CETX stock has a lower ratio than the other company  which has positive profitability  So compared to three other major competitors  the CETX stock seems also relatively undervalued  There is a difference in the current price ratios of CETX stock in the relative valuation table 2 compared to the price ratios of relative valuation table 1  due to the difference source used 
The one analyst has a 1 year target of  4 50 per share for the CETX stock  a forecast we believe is not unreasonable based on our relative valuation analysis  offering a potential upside gain of about 37  from the closing price of  3 24 on September 19th 2017  The stock also has a dividend yield of 0 60   which although is not large enough  it can contribute positively to the holding period return  
Technical Analysis  Technical analysis of a stock can prove to be very important in terms of timing the entry for a trade  as an undervalued stock can continue to move lower if its current trend is a downtrend  something that is also true for overvalued stocks in a strong uptrend  The technical analysis for the CETX stock shows that the long term trend is a downtrend  as the stock is currently trading below its 200 day moving average currently at 4 05 which is declining  However we can highlight the following positive and bullish signs about the stock  a bullish MACD indicator which is rising  the stock has closed above its falling 50 day moving average currently at 3 18  which can show a trend change  and the ADX 14  indicator which measures the strength of the trend and its direction shows a reading of 26 67  and in essence this means that the trend is gaining strength and momentum  while the  DI reading is at 28 40   above the  DI reading of 12 50  indicating that the current dominant trend is an uptrend 
The daily Bollinger  bands with 2 standard deviations containing 95  of the stock price are at 2 71 and 3 40 for the lower and upper band respectively  and the stock price has made a strong bounce from the level of  2 71  a recent bottom  The stock has strong support at the levels of  3 00 and  3 15  and strong resistance at the levels of  3 30   3 45 and  3 70  The stock recently made a high around the level of  3 48  where there is strong resistance and now is making a correction lower  so a better and less risky trade would be to wait possibly for a correction at lower levels  reaching oversold levels in readings of popular indicators such as the Full Stochastics  At present the stock is not in any extreme overbought or oversold conditions 
Analyzing the weekly chart for a long term technical analysis  the stock shows a bullish picture  with a rising MACD indicator  a trend which is not yet strong  but with a  DI reading of 23 12  higher than the  DI reading of 18 78  indicating again that the current dominant trend is an uptrend  and adding a Fibonacci retracement from the high price of around  8 41 to the low price of around  2 66  we observe that the 50  retracement level lies around  5 50  We believe that if the stock breaks above the daily 200 day moving average currently at 4 05  can move to our profit target of  5 00  5 50  which is more conservative than the 61 8  retracement level price of around  6 20  On the weekly chart we consider crucial the resistance levels of  3 75  3 95  as a closing price above them can confirm the shift in the trend from a downtrend to an uptrend  
Investment Thesis Conclusion  Shares of Cemtrex have the following fundamental features that we strongly believe are supportive for our buy recommendation at current price levels around  3 30 and a target of  5 00  5 50 in a time period of 6 months to 1 year  The company and its stock show higher profitability compared to the average profitability ratios of the Industrial Goods Sector and the Industry of Industrial Equipment   Components  the company has a strong balance sheet and strong financial health  there are positive and increasing cash flows  both operating and free cash flows  there is positive growth in terms of Sales Revenue and EPS  and the stock seems to be significant relatively undervalued compared to the price ratios of its industry  S P 500 index and some of its major competitors 
There are points of concern  mainly the weakness in the operating efficiency in our 5 year period of fundamental analysis  but the company operates in a sector with promising and optimistic future outlook  We reckon that infrastructure government spending and higher spending in the defense sector  along with future promised tax cuts in corporate profits can be positive factors for the company and its stock  A stock with great fundamentals in a sector with poor prospects can be a laggard in price action  and for CETX stock this is not the case by all means  On the contrary the stock according to our fundamental analysis is both a value pick and a momentum pick  and our conservative price target of  5 00  5 50  is supported also by the technical analysis  The current trend for the stock seems to change from a downtrend to an uptrend  and there is potential for an upside movement and gains of about 35  from current stock price level  The stock in addition a low dividend yield of about 0 60   which is not a crucial factor to support our buy recommendation  but it can add an increased holding period return according to our timeframe for the trade of 6 months to 1 year

1591,223106,CECE,U S  Markets Look Past Negatives To Close Up,opinion,U S  stocks overcame disappointing guidance from Caterpillar and an unexpected dip in existing home sales to finish higher Monday  Energy and materials stocks led the markets higher  rebounding with the price of crude oil and precious metals in commodities trading  Healthcare and consumer stocks also turned around from early declines to end moderately higher  Most other industry sectors in the S P 500 finished narrowly higher although utilities failed to make up enough ground before the close  Catepillar  CAT     often viewed as a bellwether for the global economy    helped establish a negative tone when the heavy equipment maker missed Q1 EPS and revenue expectations and cut its FY13 revenue forecast by at least  3 bln to a new range of  57 bln to  61 bln  CAT also trimmed its EPS EPS guidance  now projecting earnings this year of around  7 per share  compared to its prior guidance looking for earnings of  7 to

1598,223113,CECE,Can Donaldson  DCI  Pull Off A Surprise In Q1 Earnings ,opinion,"Donaldson Company  Inc    NYSE DCI   is set to report first quarter fiscal 2017 results  before the opening bell on Dec 1 
Last quarter  the company had posted a negative earnings surprise of 8 0   Donaldson has had a choppy earnings history  having beaten estimates twice for as many misses over the four trailing quarters  with an average negative surprise of 1 7  
Factors to Consider
Donaldson s fiscal first quarter results are likely to benefit from consistent first fit program wins and sturdy aftermarket performance  As a matter of fact  the company s programs in Engine air and liquid market enjoy a win rate of over 75   with the potential to generate at least half a billion dollars in future revenues  Also  during the fiscal fourth quarter  the company had commenced manufacturing heavy duty air filters for both on road and off road equipment markets  in order to fortify its foothold in Europe 
This facility is expected to be conducive for the company s liquid business  thus supplementing top line performance for the soon to be reported quarter and beyond  In addition  Donaldson s Down Flow Evolution or DFE family of dust collectors  which has been a key profit churner ever since its launch  is anticipated to stoke top line growth for the fiscal first quarter  Also  increasing replacement on the first fit program and higher retention rates in the aftermarket business have been fueling growth of the company s industry defining filtration product  PowerCore 
Impressive market traction of the company s major products looks promising for the fiscal first quarter results  This apart  Donaldson s quarterly results are likely to reap the incremental restructuring benefits of the streamlining initiatives implemented earlier  Globally  Donaldson has identified opportunities to trim about  8 million of expenses out of their respective businesses from these restructuring actions  In this regard  the ERP implementation scheme executed earlier is expected to improve inventory management  pricing   processes and benefit expense run rate  by a few million dollars 
Despite these positives  Donaldson has been grappling with a host of macroeconomic issues for the past few quarters  These have been affecting its financial performance  Persistent weakness in the global agriculture  mining equipment and construction markets are estimated to hamper both Engine Products and Industrial Products sales  Project deferrals and volatility in global demand are likely to weigh down on Gas Turbines  sales  Moreover  weakness in membrane and semiconductor businesses is adding to the company s concern 
Especially  precipitous decline in the disk drive business has accelerated over the past few quarters  adding to the woes of the Industrial Products segment  In addition  currency fluctuations had caused sales to decline by  5 1 million during fourth quarter fiscal 2016 and are estimated to play a spoilsport for the quarter to be reported as well  This apart  strong competition and fluctuations in commodity process add to Donaldson s woes for this quarter 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Donaldson will beat earnings this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP for the company is currently 0 00   This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 35 cents  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our

1608,223123,CECE,5 Affordable Breakout Stocks Providing Attractive Returns ,opinion,Possibly one of the most preferred methods for those using an active investing approach  selecting breakout stocks offers the promise of substantial returns  This approach involves identifying stocks whose prices are varying within a narrow band If the price of the stock falls below this channel  it could be the best time to sell of this stock  However  the best time to buy a stock as per this strategy is when it is about to break above this trading band  Such stocks offer the prospect of impressive gains Determining Breakout LevelsThe first step to selecting the right breakout stock is to calculate its support and resistance level  A support level is the lower bound for stock movements while a resistance level refers to the maximum price which it trades within over a considerable period In other words  the demand for a stock is at its lowest at its support level  which means most traders are willing to sell it  At the resistance level  most traders are willing to go long on the stock  which means that they would like to add them to their portfolios  The key to identifying breakout stocks is to zero in on those that are on the verge of a breakout or those that have just broken above the resistance level Has a Breakout Really Occurred The primary risk associated with such a strategy is that the decision to buy an apparent breakout candidate has been incorrectly timed  When a stock moves above the resistance level  it should be a highly prized commodity for traders  However  whether such a breakout is at all genuine is another matter altogether For a bona fide breakout  the stock s earlier resistance barrier should become its new support level  This only happens if the trading channel that has been established is tested by observing long term price trends  The strength of the support and resistance levels can be ascertained only through such a study  Despite the risk of misidentification  correctly identifying such stocks can yield considerable returns  even at a price which may not seem attractive at first glance Screening Parameters  Percentage price change over four weeks between 10  and 20   Stocks which are showing considerable price increases  but whose gains are not excessive    Current Price  52 Week High greater than or equal to 0 9  Stocks which are trading 90  close to their 52 week highs    Zacks Rank less than or equal to  2  Only Strong Buy and Buy rated stocks can get through    Beta for 60 months less than or equal to 2  Stocks
