amortization of goodwill  along with decreases in net gains on equity securities and equity in earnings of equity method investees For the reported period  lower net gains on equity securities and net interest income  along with reduced net fees and commissions  were negatives  Further  elevated general   administrative expenses and high credit costs acted as headwinds  However  elevated gross profits  higher net trading profits and solid capital were driving factors Gross Profits Up  General   Administrative Expenses EscalateGross profits for the reported period were  2 94 trillion   0 03 trillion   up 3 9  year over year  This upsurge mainly resulted from higher net gains on debt securities  partly offset by lower net interest income due to fall in interest rates The results reflect a

154082,375598,UBSG,Exclusive  Banco do Brasil plans reforms after failed privatization bid   sources,news,By Carolina Mandl and Marcela Ayres SAO PAULO BRASILIA  Reuters    Brazilian state controlled bank Banco do Brasil SA  SA BBAS3  is planning reforms to better compete with private rivals  after President Jair Bolsonaro quashed an attempt by management to fully privatize the lender  according to four people familiar with the matter  The plan includes changing employment rules to make it easier for the bank to hire and fire staff and remove some pay restrictions  said these people  who declined to be identified because the plan is not public yet   They added the plan also calls for the bank to maintain its dividend payout ratio even as it expects asset sale proceeds to add to profits in the coming months  and form partnerships with financial technology and other startups  The plan was approved by the bank s board late last year  two of the sources said  Portuguese language paper Valor Economico reported on Thursday the bank s plan to form joint ventures with fintech startups  but the other details have not been previously reported  The bank will still need to seek approvals from the government to move ahead  Some elements of the plan  such as weaker job protections  could prove to be politically tricky and face resistance from within the bank s nearly 94 000 workforce  The sources said the conversations with the Economy Ministry on job rules started last year and any changes are likely to apply to other listed state controlled companies as well  However  the outcome of those discussions remains unclear  Banco do Brasil declined to comment on the matter   The Economy Ministry denied that it was considering changing employment rules  But two ministry sources said discussions were ongoing  One of these sources described the talks as preliminary  The bank s latest attempt at reforms underscores how the realities of Brazilian politics are slowing Bolsonaro s agenda  The right wing populist  who became president in January 2019  raised investor expectations that he would reduce the role of the state in Latin America s largest economy  But he has fallen short on delivering on some of those promises  Soon after taking over  his administration installed new management at Banco do Brasil  the country s second largest bank with a market cap of  35 billion  and the bank initiated a series of divestitures  Helio Magalhaes  who previously headed  Citigroup  Inc  N C  and  American Express  Co  N AXP  in Brazil  was named chairman  Rubem Novaes  a University of Chicago trained economist who had been an academic most of his career  was named chief executive  The management argued in public and private that the government needed to give up its 50  stake in the lender for it to better compete against rivals such as Itau Unibanco Holding SA  SA ITUB4   Banco Bradesco SA  SA BBDC4  and  Banco Santander   MC SAN  Brasil SA  SA SANB3   They argued that the bank could rapidly fall behind such rivals if it was not quick to offer clients new products  upgrade technology and retain and hire talent  Bolsonaro  however  rejected the idea  The bank believed that was in part because he would face opposition from members of congress whose constituents rely heavily on Banco do Brasil  one of the sources said  Banco do Brasil is often the only bank in rural and other underbanked regions  Bolsonaro did not immediately comment on the matter  In December  the Brazilian president told journalists that discussions on the bank s privatization was a closed matter  PLAN B The latest proposal is Plan B  two of the sources said   One of the key pillars of the plan is to change how the bank hires and fires staff  and gain more flexibility in how much it is able to pay employees  the four sources said   Depending on how strategic the position is  the bank wants to be able to pay higher salaries to attract and retain talent without having to ask for permission from the Economy Ministry  the sources said  The pay differences among senior managers could be substantial  a review of publicly available pay data shows  For example  top managers at Santander Brasil  on average  were paid more than four times what Banco do Brasil pays for similar roles  Lower level jobs  however  are paid more at Banco do Brasil  While arguing for privatization  Novaes has said the bank lost 50 top executives to competitors in 2019 in part because they could not afford to pay those people as much as the private sector paid   If the government approves the change  it would also allow Banco do Brasil to reduce headcount faster through initiatives such as voluntary severance programs  The workforce reforms  however  are likely to face resistance from public servants who are used to generous benefits and job protections  In a private Facebook  NASDAQ FB  page for employees called  BB Down to Earth Workers   seen by Reuters  some staff complained about Novaes  privatization efforts and called for his resignation as they worried about its implications  DIVIDENDS AND DEALS Other parts of the reforms plan include a larger dividend payout in absolute terms as planned asset sales in the coming months boost profits  two of the sources said   The bank is planning to keep its payout ratio at 40   the sources said  A third element of the plan is to negotiate joint ventures and acquire minority stakes in startups  the four sources said  Banco do Brasil wants to offer startups access to its wide network in Brazil   37 3 million clients and more than 4 000 branches   in return for stakes in those companies  these sources said  It will also continue to strike deals with big financial institutions  as it did last year

154107,375623,UBSG,Virgin Galactic Unveils Spacesuits As IPO Nears  ,opinion,"On Wednesday  Under Armour   NYSE UAA   unveiled the spacesuits it is making for people to wear during trips with Richard Branson s Virgin Galactic spaceflight company  The two companies are collaborating on a full line of space wear  which they claim is the first collection  created specifically for private astronauts  
The collaboration between the two companies comes as Virgin Galactic nears its potential public listing  The company s cofounder and billionaire  Richard Branson  commented that once the company begins to fly regularly  they will look to branch out their operations all over the world 
Company Overview 
Virgin Galactic is a spaceflight company within the Virgin Group  It is developing commercial spacecraft and aims to provide suborbital spaceflights to space tourists and suborbital launches for space science missions 
Virgin Galactic s spacecraft can carry as many as six passengers  along with the two pilots  to the edge of space  The spaceship is dropped from a jet powered aircraft and fires a rocket motor  reaching over three times the speed of sound as it climbs though the Earth s atmosphere  Then the spacecraft and its passengers float weightless for a few minutes  before gliding back down to land on Earth much like a traditional aircraft  A ticket for a Virgin Galactic flight goes for about  250 000 per person  and the company has a list of 603 customers waiting to fly 
Virgin Galactic is preparing to become the first human spaceflight company to go public  Through a merger announced in July with Social Capital Hedosophia  a special purpose acquisition company  Virgin Galactic is planning to list on the New York Stock Exchange  The company originally planned on listing themselves in the public market later in the fourth quarter of 2019  but Branson hinted that an IPO may be coming sooner than expected 
Market Potential 
A lengthy UBS Group   NYSE UBS   report published in March found that in a decade  high speed travel via outer space will represent an annual market of at least  20 billion and compete with long distance airline flights  This would bode well for companies like Virgin Galactic  SpaceX and Blue Origin  who are leading the effort to make space tourism a reality 
UBS analysts Jarrod Castle and Myles Walton wrote in a note that  While space tourism is still at a nascent phase  we think that as technology becomes proven  and the cost falls due to technology and competition  space tourism will become more mainstream   Richard Branson stated that several international markets are interested in the development of a space station such as Abu Dhabi  Italy  the United Kingdom  and Australia   Not only are these companies trying to trailblaze the space tourism industry  they are also trying to revolutionize long distance travel 
SpaceX is attempting to revolutionize air travel through the massive Starship rocket they are developing  which would be able to fly 100 people around the world in minutes  The Starship rocket is said to be able to fly from New York to Shanghai in 39 minutes  rather than the 15 hours it takes with traditional airplanes 
Bottom Line 
It seems like the next generation of human travel is developing before our very own eyes  The potential public listing of one of these innovative and futuristic companies makes things all the more exciting for eager investors 
The positive response Virgin Galactic received from international markets is a welcoming sight for the company and investors who are eying the company s IPO  Additionally  Under Armour s decision to partner with Virgin Galactic as their official apparel provider shows the confidence Under Armour has in the company s potential

The outbreak of the disease  which has spread from the central city of Wuhan  is still in its early stages  However  there have been four confirmed deaths and it comes right before the peak travel season during the Lunar New Year holidays  raising risks that it could spread further  
This all prompts fears of a repeat of the 2002 SARS pandemic  On that occasion more than 8 000 people across 37 countries were affected  with around 800 deaths  A 2003 academic study estimated the global economic cost at close to  40 billion

National European airlines are lower amid fears travel to Asia will be hit hard  Deutsche Lufthansa  DE LHAG  was hit hardest  down 2 2   while Air France KLM  PA AIRF  dropped 1 7   However  low cost airlines pushed higher  helped by strong revenue news from EasyJet  LON EZJ  in the first quarter  Its shares climbed 4 9

154132,375648,UBSG,StockBeat  UBS Cuts Its Targets  Eyeing Another Year of Low Rates,news,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing com    For most of the last few years  UBS Group  SIX UBSG  has been one of the few European banks that could be relied upon to pay its way in a world of cripplingly low interest rates  But even that seems less certain after the Swiss giant s latest quarterly update 
The investment case for UBS has long been that its reliance on managing the wealth of the world s ultra rich makes it immune to cycles in parts of the banking industry reserved for mere mortals such as lending  investment funds and even  gasp  investment banking  But with performance at the investment bank and the core lending business faltering  that s becoming a tougher ask   as the bank acknowledged on Tuesday with a new  lower set of medium term targets 
UBS stock fell 5 1   the most of any bank in Europe on Tuesday  to their lowest in over a month  The benchmark Stoxx 600 lost 0 7  to 421 02  while the Swiss SMI index was actually the best performing across the continent with a loss of only 0 3   That often happens on down days in Europe  given the heavy weighting of defensive stalwarts such as Nestle  Roche and Novartis  Elsewhere  the German DAX fell 0 5  and the FTSE 100 fell 1 2   as sterling rebounded on stronger than expected labor market data 
UBS s profit before tax fell 7  in 2019  and the bank missed most of its targets from operating costs to profitability  Return on core equity fell to 12 4   missing its target of 15  by a wide margin  The bank announced a new target range of 12  15   Conspicuously  it made no mention of any further share buybacks once its current program is completed 
Of course  even a 12  return on equity is something that the likes of Germany s big banks can only dream of  And the crucial wealth management division did manage to eke out a further 4  gain in pretax profit for the year overall  while the more mundane asset management business posted an even stronger 17  increase 
However  the group s investment bank saw profit fall 37   not least due to another  110 million charge in the fourth quarter against goodwill that reflects the fading power of the brand in investment banking 
UBS tried to put a brave face on the coming year  saying that  clients are more active  which should lead to an improvement in transaction related revenues   and adding that higher asset prices should boost the commissions it gets on managing all those multi billion dollar fortunes 
But it still struck a note of foreboding with regard to the year ahead  specifically noting that  low and persistently negative interest rates and expectations of continuing easy monetary policy will continue to provide some headwinds to net interest income   That update comes against a background of increased speculation that the Swiss National Bank will take fresh action to stop the franc rising any further against the euro and dollar  The SNB already runs the world s most savage negative interest rate regime  with a key rate at 0 75  ",2020-01-21,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/stockbeat-ubs-cuts-its-targets-eyeing-another-year-of-low-rates-2063601,2063601

154146,375662,UBSG,The Case For Gold Gets Stronger As Negative Interest Rates Spread,opinion,"By Clint Siegner  
 
The world has truly entered uncharted waters with negative interest rates spreading so far and wide 
Frank Holmes  CEO of US Global Investors  recently noted that a whopping 25  of all bonds sold globally now carry a negative yield   Investors  are even buying some  junk  rated bonds which will repay the bearer less than purchase price upon maturity 
Now European banks  who have been absorbing the European Central Bank s 0 4  charge to hold deposits  are throwing in the towel and getting ready to pass those charges on to clients 

Wealthy depositors at the Swiss bank UBS  NYSE UBS  will soon start paying the bank 3 4 percent to hold cash balances above 2 million Swiss francs 

Some of those clients may turn to physical gold  For starters  the 0 75  negative interest rate to hold cash is roughly double the cost of storing  2 million in gold bullion 

And holding gold in allocated storage means investors don t have to rely on an institution like UBS as their counterparty 

The Swiss firm  like other major European banks including Deutsche Bank  NYSE DB   is troubled  It has legal liabilities  including a  5 billion fine recently imposed for assisting clients in tax evasion 

The bank s share price is back at the lows seen during the 2008 Financial Crisis  The Financial Times observed wealthy clients leaving UBS early in the year 

At this point  investors are wondering if UBS will survive  Yet remaining wealthy clients will be asked to pay the struggling bank for safeguarding large deposits  The UBS customer exodus could soon pick up speed 

There is something both broken and ominous about the spread of negative interest rates  In a healthy economy  lenders do not pay borrowers to take their money  And depositors do not pay their bank  Both scenarios are unnatural and unprecedented 

Central bankers  in all of their wisdom  are determined to force people with capital to deploy it  They want people to spend  to make capital investments  to continue buying real estate and stocks despite extraordinarily high valuations 

The trouble is that many investors are not seeing growth and opportunities for investment  Instead they seek safe haven  They buy more and more bonds with negative yields and they hold cash in the bank  despite the fact that deposits have earned nothing for years 

Meanwhile  perpetual inflation exacts its own toll on the purchasing power of all this capital 

To calculate the real cost of holding negative yielding bonds and deposits  the rate of inflation must be added  In Europe  consumer prices have been rising at a little over 1 5  per year  The true cost of holding large balances at UBS will soon exceed 2 25  annually 

First  zero interest rates failed  Then moving the rate for deposits to negative 0 4  failed as reluctant retail banks were slow to pass the cost along to their clients 

Now these banks are starting to fall in line  They have little choice as the ECB signals its intention to keep pushing  forcing rates even more deeply negative in the months ahead  Yet there is little reason to expect the central banker s gambit to succeed this time 

If the wealthy did not find great opportunities everywhere for their capital when it yielded nothing  they aren t likely to suddenly find them now that central bankers are turning the screws on them another crank

154166,375682,UBSG,UBS faces uphill battle to regain ground after HK IPO ban lifted,news,"By Scott Murdoch  Alun John and Julie Zhu
HONG KONG  Reuters    UBS Group AG  S UBSG  is likely to have a hard time regaining ground lost in the 10 months it was banned from the big money business of sponsoring IPOs in Hong Kong  where Chinese rivals have become formidable players  bankers and analysts said 
The Swiss bank s unprecedented year long ban ended two months early after regulators last week said standards had improved since it found due diligence failings during an industry wide probe that has led to HK 900 million   116 million  in fines 
 After the fines  international banks   especially UBS   have the problem of clients perceiving due diligence processes as more rigorous and protracted with an international bank than a Chinese firm  making the latter more attractive   said Benjamin Quinlan  chief executive of consultancy Quinlan   Associates 
Equity capital markets  ECM    including initial public offering  IPO  sponsorship   on average make up a third of investment banks  fee pool in the Asia Pacific region  or a quarter globally 
Hong Kong ranked third globally last year for IPOs behind the Saudi Exchange and Nasdaq  raising  25 billion 
Among banks in Hong Kong  UBS has ranked in the top 10 in each of the past 15 years bar two  which came in the four years since the lender first disclosed the regulatory probe  Dealogic data showed  During its ban  UBS was limited to minor IPO roles 
 ECM business in Hong Kong has become harder for international banks  who face fierce competition from Chinese competitors  many of whom have much larger onshore coverage     allowing them to serve a broader range of potential clients   said Quinlan 
Mainland China based banks accounted for an average 34  of new listings by volume in Hong Kong over the past four years  versus 22  in the decade to 2016  showed Reuters calculations from Delaogic data 
BUSIER
UBS made 30  of its 2018 investment banking pre tax profit in the Asia Pacific region  where it stood out from international rivals due to its ties with Chinese state owned enterprises   many of which it helped list in Hong Kong   as well as its market leading position in Australian deals and ECM 
 I ll certainly be busier than last year  It s good news for the franchise and for us who didn t leave for rivals after the ban   said one China focused UBS investment banker 
 It s also a good time to win back several important clients which didn t feel very comfortable working with us  during the ban    the banker said 
Another Hong Kong based UBS banker said staff would feel the pressure   We have to work harder as there won t be any excuses for the lack of good deals or low league table ranking  
Both declined to be identified as they were not authorized to speak publicly on the topic  A UBS spokesman declined to comment 
The early end to the IPO sponsorship ban  coming just ahead of UBS  earnings report on Tuesday  offers the Swiss bank a brighter start to the year after a difficult 2019 
In November  UBS paid the joint largest ever fine levied on a bank in Hong Kong of HK 400 million for overcharging as many as 5 000 clients 
That followed a comment in June related to pork prices by a UBS economist was interpreted as racist by some in China and necessitated extra work with clients by senior bankers

154196,375712,UBSG,Hong Kong securities regulator told to speed up enforcement,news,"By Alun John
HONG KONG  Reuters    A review panel has urged Hong Kong s markets watchdog to speed up actions to enforce compliance with securities rules by banks and other firms  noting that the longer an investigation took  the less powerful the deterrent effect 
The Securities and Futures Commission  SFC  last year levied some its largest fines ever  These included a combined  100 million fine for four banks  including UBS  S UBSG  and  Morgan Stanley   N MS  for due diligence failings on a series of IPOs  two of which took place in 2009  and a separate  51 million fine for UBS for overcharging clients between 2008 and 2017 
Lawrence Lee  chairman of the Process Review Panel  PRP  for the SFC    an independent panel tasked with reviewing the regulator s operations    said that  in a number of enforcement cases reviewed this year  PRP noted how the investigation process     could have been expedited and refined  
The comments were part of the PRP s annual report  which also warned it was concerned that the SFC did not inform the subjects of its investigations as quickly as it could 
In order to speed up enforcement cases the PRP urged the regulator to improve internal handover procedures  expand its pool of external market experts  make greater use of information technology  and seek legal advice more efficiently 
In one case it found that the SFC s enforcement division had taken a year to seek advice from the organization s legal division

154235,375751,UBSG,Deutsche  DB  Q1 Earnings Improve Y Y On Lower Expenses,opinion,"Deutsche Bank  DE DBKGn    NYSE DB   reported net income of  201 million   467 1 million  in first quarter 2019  up 67  from  120 million in the year ago quarter  The bank reported profit before taxes of  292 million   364 3 million  
First quarter results benefited from net asset inflows and prudent expense management  Also  strong capital position remains a tailwind  However  lower revenues and higher provisions were the key undermining factors 
Lower Costs Offset Fall in Revenues   Higher Provisions 
The bank generated net revenues of  6 4 billion   6 4 billion  in the first quarter  down 9  year over year  Lower revenues across all the segments  primarily due to implementation of strategic measures and a challenging market environment  led to this downside 
Revenues at the Corporate   Investment Banking division of  3 3 billion   3 billion  declined 13  from the year ago quarter  Lower revenues in Sales   Trading  Fixed Income and Equity  along with Origination   Advisory revenues led to the fall 
The Private   Commercial Bank   PCB   segment s revenues totaled  2 5 billion   2 9 billion   down 5  year over year  Lower revenues from business in and outside Germany resulted in the decline 
The Asset Management segment generated revenues of  525 million   587 million   down 4  year over year  mainly due to lower management fees  Notably  the company reported net asset inflows of  10 billion during the quarter  
Provision for credit losses increased 60  from the year ago quarter to  140 million   287 8 million   The rise resulted largely from higher provisions in the PCB unit 
Non interest expenses of  5 9 billion   6 4 billion  were down 8  from the prior year quarter  The decline resulted from the bank s successful implementation of cost savings initiatives 
Deutsche Bank s Common Equity Tier 1  CET1  capital ratio  pro forma Capital Requirements Regulation Capital Requirements Directive 4 fully loaded  came in at 13 7  as of Mar 31  2019  compared with 13 4  as of Mar 31  2018  Leverage ratio  on an adjusted fully loaded basis  was 3 9   up from 3 7  in the prior year quarter  Risk weighted assets declined  3 billion in the March end quarter 
Our Viewpoint
Deutsche Bank reported a decent quarter  Decline in revenues was offset by relatively lower expenses  The company has made several strategic moves to boost revenues and drive improvement across all the business segments 
Though Deutsche Bank s restructuring efforts look encouraging  it is really difficult to determine how much the bank will gain  considering the lingering headwinds  Moreover  dismal revenue performance remains another concern

154236,375752,UBSG,UBS Shareholders Retain Right To Legal Action Against Board,opinion,"Shareholders of UBS Group   NYSE UBS   has rebuked top management by not endorsing its prior year s performance  on account of the  5 billion penalty that was imposed on the lender in February for helping French clients evade taxes As an outcome  shareholders have retained the power to take legal action against management 
At the annual meeting held on Thursday  only 41 7  of investors voted to formally discharge the board and top executives from any legal liability on the tax case  Thus  it failed to reach the majority  It does not necessarily indicate any immediate consequences  but keeps the board exposed to any potential lawsuits from shareholders 
Chairman Axel Webersaid   I interpret your decision that the uncertainty about the open French court case worries you and you want to keep all legal possibilities open  I can understand this  
The other time when UBS shareholders had taken a similar step against management was during 2010  when they voted against performance in 2007 for incurring billions of losses related to subprime mortgages 
Last week  UBS reported first quarter 2019 net profit of  1 1 billion  which was 27  below the prior year quarter figure  Results were affected by disappointing performance in Global wealth management and Investment Bank units 
UBS is focused on its goal to strengthen core operations  Also  it undertakes cost cutting measures  which will aid bottom line growth  However  the top line remains under pressure due to a persistent negative interest rate environment in the domestic economy  Also  constant legal hassles pose a headwind 
In six months  time  UBS has gained 4 3  on the NYSE against 1  decline recorded by the

154238,375754,UBSG,UBS Group To Face  93M Penalty For German Tax Evasion Case,opinion,"UBS Group s   NYSE UBS   German unit is likely to face a fine of about  83 million   93 million  for allegedly helping clients evade taxes in the period between 2001 and 2012  The prosecutors have forwarded request for fine in a local court in Mannheim 
The prosecutors are of the opinion that managers of the Swiss bank  with support from executives at the Swiss parent were involved in wrongdoings by showing cross border bank transfers as if they were made within Germany 
Investigations on the matter were being conducted since 2012  and during the period prosecutors have raided offices and homes of bank employees  per a Bloomberg s article 
In a recent release  prosecutors said that they have strong evidence against UBS and that it was sufficient to fine the bank for wrongdoing by its executives  However  the firm has chosen to fight these allegations 
UBS said   The prosecutor s office in Mannheim has been investigating the alleged conduct from before 2012 for six years  We do not believe the prosecutor s claim is supported by the facts or the law and we intend to vigorously oppose this administrative proceeding  
In another major legal setback  UBS  French unit was found guilty of similar charges  The court penalized the bank  4 5 billion   5 1 billion   including civil damages of  800 million 
In this case too  UBS persistently denied any criminal wrongdoing throughout the investigation and during the trial  and therefore  has contested the verdict and plans to appeal 
Our Take
Heightened investigations and lawsuits surrounding tax evasions reflect efforts of the regulators and the government to bring transparency and stability in the trading industry and thereby  safeguard investors  interests 
Though  UBS undertakes cost cutting measures  which will aid bottom line growth  persistent negative interest rate environment in the domestic economy and constant legal hassles pose as headwinds 
In three months  time  UBS has lost 3 7  on the NYSE against 1 1  growth recorded by the

ZURICH  Reuters    A private investigator from the firm tasked with tailing former  Credit Suisse   S CSGN  banker Iqbal Khan has countered Khan s legal action with criminal complaints against the banker  his wife and the police  Swiss prosecutors said on Wednesday 
Khan  who left Credit Suisse in July to became rival UBS s  S UBSG  co head of wealth management  filed a criminal complaint in Switzerland following a confrontation with private detectives tailing him and his wife on Sept  17 
The scandal led to an investigation by Switzerland s bank watchdog into Credit Suisse s conduct and criminal proceedings in Zurich which remain ongoing 
The Swiss Investigo detective agency which was hired to follow Khan has said the ensuing publicity caused it severe reputational and financial damage 
An Investigo employee has since submitted a criminal complaint against Khan and his wife to the state prosecutors office handling the criminal proceedings  a spokesman for Zurich prosecutors said  adding that the complaint was under review 
The prosecutors said they were also reviewing a separate criminal complaint by the Investigo employee against members of the Zurich police lodged shortly before Christmas  but declined comment on the specific accusations made in both complaints 
A legal representative for Khan said he stood by his version of events  Investigo did not respond to an emailed request for comment

China s New Wealth Industry Charges Up Global Banks
Amid recent rules issued by China  aimed at strengthening the risk management practices of its commercial banks  wealth management subsidiaries  foreign firms are being tempted to quicken their plans of entering and expanding in the local markets of this country  The news was reported by Reuters 
While the wealth management industry in China is the world s fastest growing business  its products are generally considered as illiquid high risk products 
Therefore  in order to reduce debt and decrease the sale of risky products  the country has asked its domestic banks to separate their wealth management businesses  per sources 
The private banking units of China s five major commercial banks   including Industrial and Commercial Bank of China   have already received regulatory approval to set up their wealth management units  Hence  these banks are expected to launch their operations soon  per the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission  CBIRC  
Per the guidelines issued by China regulators in December  these units are required to maintain separate books of accounts and  perform the duties of entrusted wealth management honestly  diligently  and responsibly  
This move comes after the China Securities Regulatory Commission  CSRC  announced in 2017 that it will allow greater access to global banks into the country s financial markets  presenting foreign companies the chance to increase majority stake to 51  in securities  joint ventures  up from the existing ceiling of 49  
Notably  Swiss bank   UBS Group AG   became the first foreign bank to get approval from CSRC to increase majority stake in its securities joint venture 
Moreover  Nomura Holdings Inc  and JPMorgan are looking to seek permission for majority stake  JPMorgan is considering the option of establishing a private bank in China and hence is conducting a feasibility study on its onshore wealth business 
Notably  in the past year  a 51  owned securities joint venture was initiated in China by HSBC Holdings under rules permitting special rights to Hong Kong based firms 
Morgan Stanley is also among the major brokerages likely to acquire majority stakes in their China joint ventures

 We can t rule it out   Jordan said told Swiss newspaper Blick when asked whether the SNB s minus 0 75  interest rate   one of the lowest in the world   could be lowered further 
 But we carry out a very precise cost benefit analysis and we would never simply cut the interest rates if that brought no benefit  At the moment  however  a further reduction is not necessary  
Negative interest rates have become increasingly controversial in Switzerland  Banks say they punish savers and risk producing asset bubbles 
Several Swiss banks  including UBS  S UBSG    Credit Suisse   S CSGN  and  Julius Baer   S BAER   have passed on the cost of negative rates to rich customers  triggering an outcry from the Swiss Bankers Association  which said ultra low rates damage the country s pension system 
The SNB last week kept its rates locked down at minus 0 75   the same level it has for nearly five years  and indicated negative rates would remain in place for the foreseeable future   nL8N28M1ST 
In the interview  Jordan said it was difficult to predict how long the measure would remain in force 
 That depends very much on the economic development  above all in Europe   he said 
He added that negative rates were needed to prevent a rapid appreciation in the Swiss franc  EURCHF   which would damage the country s export reliant economy 
 Imagine what would happen if we raised interest rates  for example to zero  That would mean the franc would strongly appreciate   Jordan told the newspaper

ZURICH  Reuters    A second probe into staff surveillance at  Credit Suisse   S CSGN  is set to clear Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam  Swiss newspaper SonntagsZeitung reported on Sunday 
Credit Suisse last week said it had initiated an investigation after a Swiss newspaper reported that its former head of human resources  Peter Goerke  was followed by private detectives in February 
That revived concerns about the bank s practices after the tailing of wealth management star Iqbal Khan in September led to a scandal and upheaval in Credit Suisse s highest ranks 
An investigation ordered by the bank had concluded the surveillance on Khan    now employed by UBS  S UBSG     was a one off  organized by then Chief Operating Officer Pierre Olivier Bouee and the security boss under him  both of whom resigned 
But law firm Homburger  which conducted the investigation  said deleted messages on a secure messaging platform used by Bouee and security personnel had limited the scope of the findings 
Credit Suisse said on Friday the new inquiry was nearing completion  with results to be published on Monday 
SonntagsZeitung  citing unnamed sources  reported on Sunday that the investigation  also conducted by Homburger  had substantiated the claims surrounding Goerke but had so far found no evidence of further instances of shadowing  nor that CEO Thiam knew private detectives had been hired to tail the two executives 
The investigation is continuing  with only interim findings to be communicated on Dec  23  the paper reported 
Credit Suisse declined to comment on the contents of the SonntagsZeitung article  A spokesman said the bank would communicate on Monday as previously announced 
Finance watchdog FINMA is also examining the issue of staff surveillance at Credit Suisse and on Friday appointed an independent auditor to clarify relevant corporate governance questions

Excluding the significant items  UBS Group s adjusted operating income increased 3 5  to  6 8 billion from the prior year quarter 
Adjusted operating expenses edged down slightly year over year to  5 9 billion in the fourth quarter  Expenses included provisions for litigation  regulatory and similar matters of  151 million 
Business Division Performance
The Global wealth management division s adjusted operating profit before tax came in at  769 million  down 22  year over year  Lower transaction based revenues due to fall in client activity were partially offset by higher net interest margins and income along with loan growth  Net new money outflows were  7 9 billion in the fourth quarter 
The Asset Management unit s adjusted operating profit rose 15  year over year to  134 million in the quarter under review  supported by higher performance fees along with reduced personnel costs 
Personal   Corporate banking division s adjusted operating profit before tax was down 13  year over year to  375 million  Lower transaction based income  together with higher credit loss expenses  resulted in the decline  Notably  annualized net new business volume growth for personal banking was 2 2  
The company s Investment Bank unit s adjusted operating profit before tax came in at  26 million  down 84  from the prior year quarter  Challenging market conditions affected both Equities and Corporate Client Solutions revenues  Notably  decline in expenses was a positive factor

Strong Capital Position

Outlook
As geopolitical tensions  rising protectionism and trade disputes persist  management expects these factors to affect investor sentiment and confidence and thus  client activity in first quarter 2019 
Also  lower invested assets as a result of market declines in the fourth quarter are expected to affect recurring revenues in Global Wealth Management and Asset Management 
Our Take
Results highlight a decent quarter for UBS Group  with its Asset Management unit displaying growth  The company managed to sustain profitability amid several headwinds encountered in the quarter  Nonetheless  prevailing pressure from the negative interest rate environment and regulatory expenses are concerns 
UBS Group AG Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Results of Itau Unibanco highlight an encouraging quarter  Furthermore  the company s prospects look encouraging as it remains focused on building strategies to expand inorganically  In addition to these  the merger with CorpBanca has fortified its footprint in Latin America while acquiring Citibank s operations has fueled growth

Gross Profits Down  General   Administrative Expenses Rise
Gross profits for the period under review were  2 83 trillion   0 03 trillion   down 3 4  year over year  The decline was mainly due to reduced net gains on debt securities along with lower fees and commissions  partly offset by increased net interest income from overseas loans and deposits

Strong Balance Sheet Position
As of Dec 31  2018  Mitsubishi UFJ reported total loans of  108 4 trillion   0 98 trillion   up from  108 3 trillion   1 02 trillion  as of Mar 31  2018  The increase can be chiefly attributed to rise in overseas loans 
However  deposits decreased to  176 8 trillion   1 59 trillion  from  177 3 trillion   1 67 trillion  as of Mar 31  2018  due to decline in domestic corporate and overseas deposits

six months of fiscal 2018  ended Sep 30   of  650 7 billion   5 86 billion   up 3 8  year over year For the period under review  low credit costs and strong capital drove the upside  while elevated general   administrative expenses  decreased gross profits and decline in net trading profits acted as headwinds  Nevertheless  higher net fees and commissions were a positive Gross Profits Down  General   Administrative Expenses EscalateGross profits for the reported quarter were  1 88 trillion   0 02 trillion   down 6 5  year over year  The decline was mainly due to reduced net gains on debt

154353,375869,UBSG,Swiss court outlines rules for helping countries chase tax cheats,news,"ZURICH  Reuters    Switzerland s highest court spelled out the steps foreign authorities must take if they want legal assistance in chasing tax cheats as it released the written verdict on why it made UBS Group  S UBSG  in July share client data with France 
The Federal Court ruled that Switzerland s biggest bank must hand over historical data on more than 40 000 client accounts to French tax authorities in a landmark case keenly watched by other countries seeking similar information 
The ruling was also closely watched for the impact it might have on the Swiss bank s separate 4 5 billion euro   5 billion  legal battle with France in a criminal case over alleged tax avoidance by UBS clients 
Revenue hungry governments  for years thwarted by Switzerland s strict secrecy rules  are monitoring developments to see if they can use historical evidence of their citizens  trying to hide money from tax authorities 
In its written ruling released on Wednesday  the court said it would not help  fishing expeditions  by foreign tax authorities seeking potential evidence of wrongdoing by groups of citizens 
Tax authorities must give a detailed description of the group involved and specific circumstances that led to the request  explain the applicable law and reasons to assume that taxpayers did not fulfill their obligations  and demonstrate that the information requested could help make them do so 
The court reinforced its stance that the client data UBS is providing French tax authorities cannot be used by French prosecutors in the criminal investigation of UBS  the world s biggest wealth manager 
The data is solely to help go after French tax dodgers 
The thousands of accounts in question and the more than 11 billion Swiss francs   11 billion  they held justified Switzerland s granting legal assistance in this case  the court has said 
 It should be noted that the periods from which the transmitted lists came  2006 and 2008  fall within the period for which UBS is suspected of having set up a comprehensive tax evasion system   it added 
 In this context  it was essential for the French tax administration to carry out systematic checks on the information supplied by the German tax authorities  
German authorities acting on information bought from a leaker had discovered the list of account numbers held by French taxpayers at UBS  The Germans shared the information with France  which wanted names of the account holders to see whether they had properly declared and taxed their foreign assets

154359,375875,UBSG,Vanished communist cash still causing pain for Swiss bank Baer,news,"By John Miller
ZURICH  Reuters    Thirty years after the Berlin Wall fell  private bank  Julius Baer   S BAER  is still fighting German government efforts to recover hundreds of millions in East German cash that vanished via Swiss accounts after the communist state collapsed 
Julius Baer said late on Wednesday it had set aside 153 million Swiss francs   153 million  to fight the case  but vowed to appeal a Zurich court s ruling this week that withdrawals dating back nearly three decades that the German government contends were illegal  should be returned 
The money is part of a stash allegedly worth hundreds of millions of euros that an East German registered company that handled import export business with the West  Vienna based Novum Handelsgesellschaft  helped funnel out of East Germany 
Julius Baer was swept up in the case because it bought Zurich based Bank Cantrade from UBS in 2005  which the German government contends allowed unauthorized withdrawals from Novum accounts between 1989 and 1992 
 Julius Baer will claim for reimbursement  from UBS  of any finally awarded amount   Zurich based Baer said in a statement   Julius Baer has always contested and continues contesting the claims  
UBS  S UBSG  declined to comment 
 RED FINE 
Baer is just the latest European money manager to be snared in this long running post Cold War dispute over communist cash  which Novum s ex director  an Austrian communist named Rudolfine  Red Fine  Steindling who died in 2012  was accused of moving into Austrian Communist Party accounts that later went missing 
In 2013  UniCredit s Bank Austria took a profit hit after the German government demanded 254 million euros   280 million  that Steindling was alleged to have moved via Novum accounts at a Swiss subsidiary    
In the ongoing Swiss case  the Zurich Court of Appeals originally sided with Julius Baer in 2018  but reconsidered its verdict this year when the Swiss Federal Supreme Court sent it back to be reheard 
The Swiss high court concluded there were  obvious shortcomings  in Bank Cantrade s handling of the Novum funds 
The German agency seeking to recover the money  called the Federal Office for Reunification related Special Tasks  BvS   could not immediately be reached for comment 
The Austrian Communist Party did not return an email and phone call seeking comment

154369,375885,UBSG,Sale of  29 billion in Brazil government assets hinges on BNDES spat  sources,news,"By Tatiana Bautzer and Rodrigo Viga Gaier
SAO PAULO RIO DE JANEIRO  Reuters    The sale of some 120 billion reais   29 billion  worth of shares owned by Brazilian development bank BNDES has snagged on a dispute among the bank s executives  three people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters 
On Friday  BNDES director Andre Laloni requested a temporary leave after clashing with staff over a share offering of state controlled bank Banco do Brasil SA  SA BBAS3  set for Thursday  the sources said on condition of anonymity 
BNDES did not respond to a request for comment  Laloni declined to comment 
The dispute within BNDES adds to doubts about how quickly Brazil can follow through on the bold privatization plans of Economy Minister Paulo Guedes as he tries to reverse more than a decade of government investments in  national champions  
Laloni got the BNDES job in July after managing the sale of around  3 billion in assets owned by Brazilian state lender Caixa Economica Federal 
At BNDES  the former UBS Group AG  S UBSG  banker was tasked with managing sale of stakes owned by the bank in firms such as meatpacker JBS SA  SA JBSS3   oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA  Petrobras   SA PETR4  and miner Vale SA  SA VALE3  
For the Banco do Brasil shares  staffers resisted the sale of stakes managed by BNDES through a follow on offering  arguing that such a transaction generates fees for investment banks and would result in a discount to listed prices  the sources said 
The BNDES staffers pushed to sell the stakes through the bank s own equity desk in Rio de Janeiro  according to sources  In a presentation to the board  Laloni defended the use of follow on offerings  citing data from recent stake sales suggesting better returns even after fees and discounting 
Laloni also faced resistance in trying to scrap an internal BNDES rule that equity stakes should be sold at a valuation based on discounted cash flow  even when a company is listed on the stock exchange  The rule has complicated major transactions such as the sale of 50 billion reais worth of Petrobras 
The plans to sell Banco do Brasil shares managed by BNDES fell apart last week after Laloni clashed in a meeting with the development bank s general counsel  according to sources 
BNDES Chief Executive Gustavo Montezano decided the sale should be approved by all directors  Laloni asked for a leave of absence 
It is unclear whether Laloni will return to his post at the bank or if the government intends to change the internal rules  the sources added 
Montezano did not reply to a request for comment sent through BNDES press representatives

Practically  a hard Brexit means that the United Kingdom would crash out of the European Union without any trade deal to take its place  Sound scary  It is  and it will put astounding pressure on UK equities and bonds especially  ETFs like the iShares United Kingdom ETF  NYSE EWU  may fall hard 
However  take comfort  We ve seen this whole movie before with Greece  which threatened to crash out of the EU several times already  and never did  The UK might  briefly  but shortly afterwards a deal will be struck in the aftermath and probably ensuing market chaos  In the event of a bona fide hard brexit  buying the dip in UK stocks and ETFs will be scary and difficult  but it will be worth it  Here s why 
When Greece threatened to crash out of the Euro  it was a very lopsided back and forth between Brussels and Athens  The EU did not really need Greece  but Greece needed the EU  Greek equities were of course crushed and many never recovered  The UK is different because compared to Greece  it is an economic powerhouse and it s not bankrupt  While the EU could have afforded to let Greece crash out of the EU without a trade deal had a bailout not occurred  neither the EU nor the UK can afford a hard Brexit for any sustained period of time  In other words  a hard Brexit may happen  however briefly  but in the ensuing freefall  the two sides will quickly understand that they are both severely hurt by the lack of a deal  They will come together and hash out something  It ll just take something scary to get there  From that point  European  and probably global equity markets  will breathe a huge sigh of relief 
Why must there by a deal eventually  Because total trade between the UK and the rest of the EU in 2016 totaled  560B  combining imports and exports  You can t have that kind of trade come to a standstill and expect calm in the streets for long  The only questions are which side will hold out longer  how long will the brinkmanship last  and how long will a hard Brexit last without a deal  
Here are a few things to consider  First  in Britain  companies are already starting to stockpile supplies in preparation for a hard Brexit  Sanofi  PA SASY  for example is expanding its stockpiles to a 14 week supply over its current 10 week maximum  Novartis  NYSE NVS  is doing the same  as is AstraZeneca  NYSE AZN   expanding current stockpiles by 20   That should put the maximum deadline for a hard Brexit without a deal at about 3 months  European leaders will simply not allow a situation that chokes off life saving medications like insulin for diabetics  Brinkmanship can go far  but not that far 
As for which side will be more desperate  the quick answer most people assume is the UK  simply because it s smaller than what will remain of the EU  But it s actually not quite clear  The EU could actually be in worse trouble than the UK without a deal within that 3 month timeframe before a medical shortage ensues  Why  Because no deal will roil bond markets throughout the EU  which already has severe pressure points in Italy  Spain  and Portugal that are still raw and not ready for any sustained pressure  No deal could cause the festering sovereign debt crisis in the Eurozone  which has never been healed and which the UK is not a part of since it never joined the Eurozone  to reemerge quickly  putting severe pressure on Brussels to get a Brexit deal done before sovereign defaults become a significant threat 
Consider  Italian bonds spiked to nearly 3  on August 2 with no apparent catalyst causing it  Spain s political situation is getting increasingly muddled and the Catalonia secessionist question could resurface on any new elections there  The EU is still coming apart at the seams  and the UK is not  This might be what the diehard Brexiteers are relying on as they have refused to compromise to the level that British Prime Minister Theresa May has  The hard line Brexiters have all pretty much left the May Administration  leaving her government extremely vulnerable 
It could be then  that in order to get a better deal  Brexiters in the UK government are willing to try out a temporary but hard Brexit  and see if Brussels will grant concessions if the fabric of the remaining EU comes under serious stress 
Either way  whichever side croaks first  a deal will be struck  and UK stocks will bounce back hard  The most volatile shares will probably be UK banks like HSBC  NYSE HSBC  and UBS  NYSE UBS   A hard Brexit will smash UK financials  and when a deal is finally hashed out  they will catapult back up just as quickly

154374,375890,UBSG,Credit Suisse to start charging wealthy clients for cash deposits,news,"ZURICH  Reuters     Credit Suisse   S CSGN  will start charging wealthy clients with large cash deposits in Swiss francs  the latest Swiss bank to pass on negative interest rates to customers 
Individual and business customers will be charged a rate of  0 75  on cash balances above 2 million Swiss francs   2 02 million   Switzerland s second biggest lender said  Balances of less than 2 million francs will be unaffected 
A rate of  0 85  will be imposed on business customers with balances above 10 million francs 
The new rules take effect from Jan  1 for individual customers and Nov  15 for business customers 
Credit Suisse s cross town rival UBS  S UBSG  in July said it would charge a  0 75  rate on deposits above 2 million francs  while Postfinance charges fees to private customers with balances above 500 000 francs 
Several banks in Switzerland  including private bank  Julius Baer   S BAER   and the eurozone also pass on the cost of negative official rates to corporate depositors  though most large players have refrained from doing so with individual clients 
 As other banks have been doing for some time  Credit Suisse is introducing negative interest rates for clients with very high Swiss franc cash holdings   Credit Suisse said on Friday 
 The reason for this is the persistent negative interest rate environment  
The Swiss National Bank  SNB  has charged a negative rate of  0 75  since January 2015 on deposits parked with the central bank by commercial banks overnight  one of the tools the SNB uses to deter investor appetite for the Swiss franc

154378,375894,UBSG,UBS tightens investment banking belt as earnings slide continues,news,"By Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi
ZURICH  Reuters    Swiss bank UBS  S UBSG  is axing high paying investment banking staff after a disappointing performance at the division prompted a 16  slide in third quarter net profit and put the group s 2019 profit goals further out of reach 
Chief Executive Sergio Ermotti  credited for rapidly turning UBS around after the financial crisis  announced a further  90 million in expected annual cost savings at the investment bank on Tuesday  following a prolonged performance dip which Ermotti described as unsatisfying even given a tough market 
An earnings beat in its core global wealth management unit helped offset a 59  adjusted profit decline in its investment bank  putting the group s third quarter net earnings of  1 05 billion ahead of analyst expectations 
Ermotti is running up against a number of headwinds in UBS s core markets  as wealthy clients hold back from trading  negative rates eat into margins and investment banking activity remains muted 
The bank s share price is down 16  over the past year  hitting a six year low in August and edging back towards the level it was when Ermotti took charge in 2011 
In its investment bank a fall in M A work meant its advisory revenue fell 21   while equity and debt capital markets income were down 22  and 15  respectively  On the trading side equities revenue fell 7   while foreign exchange  rates and credit revenue was steadier with just a 1  fall 
UBS said it expects to take restructuring expenses of around  100 million in the fourth quarter related to structural changes it is making to the business  run by co heads Piero Novelli and Robert Karofsky 
Measures include streamlining and merging its securities and trading activities and reducing headcount 
OPERATIONAL GROWTH
The bank brought in net new money of  15 7 billion in its flagship wealth management business  as a sizeable jump in transaction based income for the unit  newly under the joint management of long time wealth management co head Tom Naratil and former  Credit Suisse   SIX CSGN  star Iqbal Khan  saw a sizeable jump in transaction based income  helped restore operational growth 
Shares in UBS opened 1 9  higher on wealth management strength 
While the group last year announced targets for a 15  return on common equity for the year and a 77  adjusted cost income ratio  Ermotti in March hinted the bank faced a steep climb to attain the profitability increase implied by the targets 
Its return on common equity tier 1  CET1  capital slid to 12 1  in the third quarter  bringing the return down to 13 8  for the first nine months  compared with 16 3  over the first nine months of 2018

 Because of trade issues and manufacturing data  it looks as if expectations had gone a bit too negative for the industrial side and a bit too positive for the consumer side  which is why we re seeing a bit of a mixed shift in the market

154387,375903,UBSG,StockBeat  UBS Rides Out Low Rate Environment With Solid Wealth Unit,news,"By Geoffrey Smith
Investing com    The big bank earnings season in Europe got under way Tuesday  a week after Wall Street s mixed bag left them with their best chance in ages of not looking shoddy by comparison 
UBS Group  SIX UBSG  took up the challenge with gusto  announcing that it pulled in  15 7 billion in new money to its wealth management unit in the three months to September  That s the key figure because the Swiss based group has placed an increasingly concentrated bet on managing the money of the world s richest people  Sadly for the rest of the sector  because wealth management is an area where UBS is uniquely strong for UBS  there s no obvious read across for the rest of the sector 
It s still a pleasant enough situation for Iqbal Khan  the star banker who joined UBS as head of wealth management and heir apparent to CEO Sergio Ermotti at the start of October  to be arriving in  Khan and co head Tom Naratil are due to present their ideas for taking the unit to the next stage by December  Ermotti told Bloomberg on Tuesday 
The bank was also able to post a  24 billion increase in net assets at its asset management unit  which takes care of the not so ultra rich s money  That  too  is something of an achievement in an increasingly challenging landscape for traditional money managers 
The bank s shares rose 2 1  in response to the news initially  but soon pared them as the market digested the less pleasant elements of the release  Those included another  100 million to restructure a shrinking securities business  part of an investment bank that focuses on Asia and Europe rather than the healthier markets of North America 
Additionally  the bank warned that  low and persistent negative interest rates and expectations of further monetary easing will adversely affect net interest income compared with last year  
There  at least  is a theme that one can confidently see recurring in other European bank earnings over the next couple of weeks

UBS s board would welcome it if Khan abandoned his complaint against the three private detectives who followed him during his last weeks as a Credit Suisse employee  the paper said  citing sources close to the UBS board 
The board at Switzerland s biggest lender thinks a trial cold pose dangers for Khan and the bank  especially if new details emerged that could incriminate Khan  the paper said 
It could also be embarrassing for Khan if prosecutors dropped the proceedings without a result  it added 
Khan  who left Switzerland s second biggest bank in July and began working at UBS in October  was under surveillance by private detectives hired by Credit Suisse from Sept  4 to Sept  17  when he spotted them 
The affair saw suicide and espionage invade the secretive world of Swiss private banking  and exposed a feud between Khan and Credit Suisse CEO Tidjane Thiam 
Credit Suisse has cleared Thiam of involvement in the affair  which was blamed on Chief Operating Officer Pierre Olivier Bouee  Thiam s right hand man  Bouee resigned following the investigation

154393,375909,UBSG,UBS could double Americas wealth business profit within a decade,news,"By Angelika Gruber and Oliver Hirt
ZURICH  Reuters    UBS Group  S UBSG  could double the profit it makes from its American wealth management arm within a decade even as it cuts staff numbers by targeting the super rich  the co head of the business told Reuters 
By encouraging customers to use more lucrative services  such as loans and mandates  where the wealth manager takes more control of a client s investments  UBS could make do with significantly fewer U S  customer advisers than the 6 600 it now employs  its co head of wealth management  Tom Naratil  said in an interview 
 Even if our total adviser count in the U S  drops below 6 000  it would be a group of advisers who are twice as productive as they are today  measured in revenue per adviser   he said 
 If we get that kind of profile  then in 5 to 10 years from now we ll have a business that could probably makes twice as much as we do today  
Naratil heads the business alongside former  Credit Suisse   S CSGN  star manager Iqbal Khan  who joined UBS last month  While at Credit Suisse  Khan managed to double his division s pre tax income in just three years 
Both are considered candidates to succeed Chief Executive Sergio Ermotti in the years ahead 
In the U S  market  UBS defines the high net worth segment as starting at roughly  1 million in investable assets  Over time  that threshold may rise to  5 million  so clients with  5 100 million would be served by its core adviser group 
It is shifting to a model in which those with more than  100 million to invest would be served primarily in partnership with UBS s family office consultants 
Last year UBS made a pretax profit of just over  1 5 billion in wealth management in North and South America  significantly more than in any other region  It was  6 4 billion across the group     The bank announced its focus on the American market at an investor conference a year ago  Outside the United States  UBS is already heavily involved in the super rich business 
In the highly competitive U S  market  the focus has been on wealthy individuals with assets of up to  100 million  Now UBS explicitly wants to address super rich people with even more money     New advisers which UBS is wooing from rivals such as JP Morgan  N JPM  or Goldman Sachs  N GS  should also help with this growth 
But UBS is being selective  Naratil said  The number of U S  advisers has shrunk in recent years 
In the first three quarters of 2019 UBS recorded outflows of  8 billion in the Americas region  but much of this is linked to less wealthy customers with whom UBS also earns less  according to people close to the matter ",2019-11-01,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/ubs-could-double-americas-wealth-business-profit-within-a-decade-2009995,2009995
154403,375919,UBSG,UBS Group  UBS  Might Witness Ratings Upgrades By Moody s,opinion,Long term ratings for UBS Group AG s   NYSE UBS   along with long term senior unsecured debt and deposit ratings of its subsidiaries  including its principal bank subsidiary  UBS AG have been placed under review for upgrade by Moody s Investors Service UBS Group s Ba1 hyb  preferred stock ratings is also under review  Moreover  UBS AG s Aa3 long term deposit ratings  A1 long term issuer and senior unsecured debt ratings  baa1 Baseline Credit Assessment  BCA   baa1 Adjusted BCA and its Aa3 cr  Counterparty Risk  CR  Assessment are being reviewed for upgrade Factors to be ConsideredThe rating agency is taking into consideration the company s efforts to cut exposure to capital intensive capital market activities along with volatile fixed income product lines  Moody s feels that this has reduced the complexity of UBS Group s investment banking business and has better aligned it with wealth and asset management businesses with greater focus on equities  foreign exchange and advisory segment  This restructuring will help combat the volatile earnings trend that the company has faced so far Further  Moody s plans to review the group s risk governance framework  The company s business planning  capital allocation and distribution processes are restricted by the outputs of its board approved capital management and stress testing framework  which requires the company to maintain a common equity Tier 1  CET1  capital ratio of around 13   Per the rating agency  weakening in the requirements of combined stress testing and its influence on limit setting and risk appetite or inconsistent application of UBS s risk governance throughout the various group segments would be regarded as credit negative Moody s would also be considering UBS Group s ability to further improve its profitability levels or to sustain current levels under less favorable market conditions  Thus  Moody s will be reviewing the stability and earnings potential of the group s key earnings sources  i e  its global wealth management and asset management businesses as well as its Swiss domestic universal banking businesses and investigate whether these would provide sufficient loss absorption capacity to mitigate the risks and earnings volatility related to the capital markets businesses UBS Group s current ratings are based on its still sizeable capital markets activities  the inherent volatility  risk opacity and confidence sensitivity within and of the capital markets related client base  and moderate reliance on wholesale funding  which continue to restrictits credit profile  Despite reduction in exposure to capital markets related risks  Moody s believes that potential additional litigation charges remain a key threat to the bank s improving profitability and in a highly adverse scenario  its solid capitalization  However  Moody s is optimistic of the company s move to create provisions for the U S  residential mortgage backed securitiesprobe which reduces the risk that any additional provisions required could have a significant negative impact on earnings or capital Also  the rating agency is positive on the company s strong liquidity profile  robust risk based capital ratios and solid leverage ratios  Moody s anticipates UBS Group s risk based capital ratios to remain above its peers and expects the company to continue growing its capital stock and maintain solid capital ratios despite expected regulatory pressures over the next three to five years Factors That Can Trigger a Ratings UpgradeUBS Group s BCA can be upgraded if Moody s feels that the company can improve or maintain its performance even under less favorable market conditions and if the risks from capital markets remain under control along with the group s capacity to absorb larger unexpected losses achieving a level such that those losses no longer risk diluting its strong capital position  Also  the company should continue to satisfy bondholders  and shareholders  interests while building upon its capital position The subsidiaries  long term senior unsecured debt ratings could be upgraded if the bank continues to issue and thereby maintain the current proportion of bail in able liabilities in relation to tangible banking assets  affording greater protection to the bank s senior creditors Factors That Can Trigger a Ratings DowngradeRatings can go down if there is lack in control or risk management or due to a significant decline in the Swiss economy  Also  if the bank was to materially increase its risk appetite by expanding the investment banking division or face a deterioration in its capital or liquidity profiles  ratings can be downgraded  The ratings could also face downward

The Swiss banking giant s fourth quarter 2017 net profit attributable to common shareholders increased 25 2  year over year  Results primarily benefited from increase in net fees and commissions  higher trading income and efficient expense management  However  lower net interest income remained the main concern

Will the stock s performance improve post Q1 earnings release  This majorly depends on whether the firm is able to impress the market with its results 
Factors That Might Influence Q1 Results
Low Interest Rates to Dampen Revenues  UBS Group s top line is likely to be hit by the continued negative interest rate environment  which was adopted by the Swiss National Bank in late 2014 to boost growth and inflation of the economy  However  improvement in lending scenario during the quarter is likely to offset it to some extent 
Fee Income Might Increase Slightly  During the quarter  trading environment was decent as markets experienced higher volatility  Revenues from advisory and underwriting might be on the higher side due to an increase in overall global M A activities and equity issuances during the quarter  Also  the Wealth Management division might benefit to some extent from the company s consistent focus on loan growth 
However  consumer spending activities remained muted in the domestic economy due to unusually cold weather in March 
Expenses Likely to Rise  Seasonally higher compensation costs along with significant legal expenses that the bank had incurred during the quarter  are expected to keep costs up

OutlookThough geopolitical tensions persist  management believes global economic growth prospects will continue to support markets Some factors expected to impact the bank s businesses in the second quarter include economic growth expectations  interest rates  equity market levels and foreign exchange rates  Moreover  though market volatility improved from the prior year quarter s historic lows  it remains subdued leading to low client activity levels  Therefore  due to seasonality  the second quarter transaction based income in Investment Bank and Global Wealth Management businesses will likely record a decline Funding costs associated with long term debt and capital instruments issued as per regulatory requirements are projected to escalate in the second quarter Notably  management expects gradual rise in U S  dollar interest rates and improved U S  economy to aid net interest income  Additionally  continued momentum in businesses is estimated to report improved results in the second quarter  reflecting a diversified business model  as well as progress toward achievement of strategic and financial targets Our TakeResults highlight a decent quarter for UBS Group AG  with its major units displaying growth  We remain optimistic as the company managed to sustain profitability amid a number of headwinds encountered in the quarter  Though the bank remains focused on building

The rejection is a further hiccup for the German lender  which has reshuffled management  is cutting thousands of jobs and closing down some businesses in an effort to make a profit 
 Deutsche Bank  chair Paul Achleitner had announced in August the appointment of former UBS  S UBSG  manager Juerg Zeltner  praising him as a valuable addition and  a top level European banker with proven expertise  
Zeltner was also to represent the interests of Qatar s royal family   a top shareholder in the German lender  KBL is controlled by the same family

154431,375947,UBSG,UniCredit to apply negative rates only on deposits over 1 million euros,news,"MILAN  Reuters    UniCredit  MI CRDI  will only apply negative rates to customer deposits of more than 1 million euros   1 1 million   the Italian bank said on Monday  clarifying comments by its CEO last week which drew angry reactions from unions and consumer groups 
European banks are grappling with the consequences of the European Central Bank s September decision to cut its key deposit rate further into negative territory  making it tough for banks to earn money from their traditional lending business 
UniCredit Chief Executive Jean Pierre Mustier last week said the bank was working on measures to pass on the European Central Bank s negative rates to customers holding more than 100 000 euros in their accounts 
Italian banking unions were critical of Mustier s announcement which they described as  reckless  
Consumer group Codacons said it would fight banks in the courts that planned to hit customers with negative returns on deposits 
A UniCredit spokesman said the negative rates would only apply to clients with more than 1 million euros in their bank accounts  meaning less than 0 1  of the bank s client base  And customers will be offered a number of alternatives 
 We will offer as an alternative investments in money market funds targeting positive returns  with no fees charged   the spokesman said 
 For     deposits with a balance in excess of the 1 million euro threshold  ad hoc measures will be discussed with clients to take into account the extraordinary changes in the macroeconomic environment  
Mustier  speaking in his capacity as Chairman of the European Banking Federation earlier this month  urged the ECB to take action to reduce the impact of negative interest rates on banks  recommending general charges for cash deposits 
Italy has high levels of private savings  where people have been increasing current account deposits this year to reach 1 17 trillion euros in August  according to Italy s central bank 
Banks in Italy are currently free to charge for cash deposits  but most avoid doing so  fearing depositors would transfer their savings to other lenders 
Italian banks are taking countermeasures against negative rates through fees   Banca Generali   MI BGN  CEO Gian Maria Mossa said in an interview published on Monday 
 UniCredit had the courage to stir up a debate which was already taking place abroad  for example in Switzerland      but  I don t think in the end single banks will apply negative rates   he told daily La Stampa 
UBS  S UBSG  in July said it would impose from November a negative interest rate of 0 75  on wealthy clients who deposit more than 2 million Swiss francs   2 million  with its Swiss bank 
In Denmark  which was among the first countries to introduce negative rates  Spar Nord  CO SPNO  said earlier this month it would impose negative rates on large deposits by private clients  making it the third Danish bank to do

During his tenure  the Securities and Futures Commission  SFC  took a more active  interventionist role as part of its so called  front loaded approach  to policing Hong Kong s capital markets after a series of stock crashes and wild price swings threatened to undermine the market 
The SFC also imposed larger penalties for wrongdoing by the companies it regulates in recent years than it had done previously  in line with global trends 
In March this year  it banned UBS  S UBSG  from leading initial public offerings in Hong Kong for a year and fined it and rivals including  Morgan Stanley   N MS  a combined  100 million for due diligence failures on a series of IPOs 
 Mr Alder has been at the helm of the SFC for eight years during which the organization has pursued a set of intensive policy and operational reforms to tackle market risks as well as setting itself as a tough  competent and effective market regulator   the SFC spokesman said in an email

Facebook  O FB   the world s largest social media network  announced plans in June to launch the new digital currency  but Geneva based Libra has come under fire from regulators who fear it could destabilize the global financial system 
The Libra Association said on Wednesday it planned to apply to become a Swiss licensed payments system  casting the spotlight on how the Swiss Financial market Supervisory Authority  FINMA  handles the matter 
FINMA head Mark Branson told the Neue Zuercher Zeitung paper he was ready for the challenge 
 If a financial center has ambitions  it must be able to live with attention   he said in an interview published on Thursday  noting the Swiss embrace of fintech put it in a good place to handle such innovative and ambitious projects 
It was ready to work with other countries taking a keen interest in Libra  as visits from top level U S  officials and warnings from the Group of Seven advanced economies have shown 
 A project of such a global dimension can be addressed only via international coordination and consultation with other supervisors and regulators   Branson said   It is illusory to believe a single country can regulate and oversee a project like Libra on its own  The supervision of  big Swiss banks  UBS  S UBSG  or  Credit Suisse   S CSGN  also does not take place in complete isolation  
Much concern about Libra and other cryptocurrencies centers on the potential of abuse for laundering money or financing crime 
 Our approach aims to regulate the crypto world in terms of money laundering the same as the conventional financial world  Our requirements here are among the strictest worldwide   Branson said 
 At the same time  new technologies can also bring benefits in the fight against money laundering  for example if traceability of transactions becomes fully available  So there are risks and opportunities  
Branson insisted that the Libra project did not choose Switzerland as its base after a  beauty contest  to see where it might face the lightest regulatory touch

154461,375977,UBSG,Private detective acted  defensively  in Credit Suisse case  memo,news,"By Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi and Oliver Hirt
ZURICH  Reuters    Private detectives from security firm Investigo  hired to shadow a former  Credit Suisse   S CSGN  manager Iqbal Khan  took defensive action when Khan tried to photograph one of them with his mobile phone  an Investigo memo seen by Reuters said 
Credit Suisse hired security firm Investigo to tail former International Wealth Management boss Iqbal Khan  who left the bank in July  to try to ensure he did not poach any colleagues before starting a new job next month at rival UBS  S UBSG   two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters 
Credit Suisse declined to comment on Tuesday 
Khan filed a criminal complaint last week alleging threats and coercion after a confrontation on Sept  17  during which Swiss media reported that Investigo detectives sought to take Khan s mobile phone after he tried to take a photo of their car 
A spokesman for Khan declined to comment on the incident  Khan s spokesman denied that Khan tried to poach Credit Suisse staff for his new employer  calling such suspicions  absurd  
Prosecutors have opened an investigation into possible threats or coercion  Credit Suisse on Monday said an internal inquiry was under way 
The Investigo memo seen by Reuters on Tuesday  which referred to the alleged confrontation with Khan  said the detectives were taking defensive action 
 Our employee acted as per instructions defensively   the Investigo memo  seen by Reuters  stated 
An Investigo representative said he could not comment on the memo or any details of the incident prior to the release of other parties  statements  but said it was very unlikely that one of the firm s detectives would act in such a way 
 I can t imagine that any of the employees  as I know them  would pull the phone out of Mr Khan s hands   he said   That would be one of the most ill advised actions you could take  
Credit Suisse Chairman Urs Rohner and CEO Tidjane Thiam had earlier pointed to  significant inaccuracies  in media reporting of the incident  which they said in a staff memo  sensationalised  the facts and events

The confrontation in Zurich last week triggered a criminal investigation by Swiss prosecutors and raised questions about who ordered a detective bureau to trail star banker Khan  who left Credit Suisse in July and will co head private banking at arch rival UBS  S UBSG  from next month 
A number of sources familiar with the matter have told Reuters that Credit Suisse hired security firm Investigo to tail Khan to try to ensure he did not poach any colleagues before joining UBS 
Credit Suisse  Switzerland s second biggest bank  has declined to comment publicly on either the confrontation or whether it hired detectives to tail Kahn 
The confrontation between Kahn and the private detectives has been the talk of Switzerland s banking community for days after it was widely reported in local media 
Credit Suisse Chairman Urs Rohner and Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam told staff in an internal memo this week they would get to the bottom of the matter  which they said had prompted  significant inaccuracies  in sensational media reporting 
Sources had pointed to a serious fallout between CEO Thiam and rising wealth management star Khan  who shared side by side villas in Zurich s Herrliberg suburb  prior to Khan s departure in July 
A spokesman for Khan  43  has denied as  absurd  Credit Suisse suspicions that he might be trying to poach former colleagues away to join his new employer 
Contradictory versions of the confrontation have emerged 
Khan filed a criminal complaint alleging threats and coercion after the confrontation on Sept  17  during which Swiss media reported that Investigo agency detectives sought to take Khan s mobile phone after he tried to take a photo of their car 
But an Investigo memo seen by Reuters said a single detective had taken only defensive action when Khan tried to photograph him with his mobile phone 
An Investigo representative has said he could not comment on the memo or any details of the incident  but it was very unlikely that one of the firm s detectives would try to pull the phone from the hands of someone being tailed 
Three employees of the security firm were briefly detained by authorities over the incident  Investigo s representative has said 
Credit Suisse hired an external law firm to conduct the inquiry  according to a source

The Financial Times and Bloomberg both reported that the board would not look to remove Thiam  although the FT noted that the board had not yet fully processed an internal report into the episode 
Thiam has notched up some notable successes in his tenure at the bank so far but failed to overcome the headwinds of low interest rates and trade conflicts that have held back its lending business and complicated the business of managing the wealth of China s richest men and women 
Thiam s record is under scrutiny for his use of detectives to monitor Khan and stop him luring away other key members of his team after Khan agreed to join CS s arch rival UBS  NYSE UBS  last month  Khan defected after appearing to lose an internal power struggle with Thiam  He s expected to take up his duties on Tuesday  UBS chairman Axel Weber told Bloomberg last week 
CS wasn t immediately able to comment on the FT and Bloomberg reports 
UBS could certainly do with a little bit of Khan s magic  Its stock is down 7  so far this year  while Credit Suisse s is up 14   And Thiam s house also looks better on a three year comparison  up 3  while UBS has fallen 14  
In part  that s because UBS moved faster and more radically to cut its investment bank division after the regulatory backlash to the financial crisis  and focus on the more predictable wealth management business  It has lost momentum in recent months  losing  2 billion through net client withdrawals in the second quarter   Thiam s restructuring has been a more recent affair

154472,375988,UBSG,5 Reasons Bitcoin Won t Survive,opinion,"Bitcoin  arguably the world s most popular cryptocurrency  has endured a rough 2018 so far  After enjoying a banner year in 2017  prices are down about 20  so far this year 
At around  11 500  the price of one Bitcoin is more than 40  below its record high of around  20 000 touched in mid December  wiping approximately  140 billion off its market cap 

Besides its recent price correction  Bitcoin has also lost its dominance in the cryptocurrency market and now only holds a roughly 32  share  significantly lower than the 85  it held at its peak last year 
While it s still too early to proclaim that the Bitcoin party is over  it certainly feels as if future prospects are shifting from bright to dark for the world s most valuable digital coin  Below are the five factors that have the potential to lead to the demise of Bitcoin 

1  Slowing Transaction Times
Right now  it takes an average time of around 200 minutes to confirm a single Bitcoin transaction  according to Blockchain com  The average time for the month of December was a whopping 2 322 minutes  or roughly 38 hours  with market experts blaming the unprecedented interest in the digital currency for clogging up the blockchain network 

Slow transaction speeds have led to a number of splits in the original Bitcoin blockchain  In August  the blockchain was  in an event known as a  hard fork   This led to the creation of a Bitcoin spinoff called Bitcoin Cash  Another fork occurred   birthing another Bitcoin offshoot called Bitcoin Gold  as the community attempted to take measures to increase the size of blocks on the network 
In comparison  Ripple s network can settle up to 1 500 transactions every second  Other alt coins also have the ability to enable transactions in seconds  For instance  an Ethereum transaction takes under 20 seconds to confirm 
However  those figures pale in comparison to traditional payment service giants like Visa  NYSE V   which can confirm up to 24 000 transactions per second 

2  Skyrocketing Fees
Skyrocketing transaction fees are fundamentally changing Bitcoin  Originally  one of Bitcoin s biggest selling points was that transaction payments would be fast  convenient  and most importantly   cheap 
 The cost of mediation increases transaction costs  limiting the minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions    in the white paper announcing the technology  Up until the beginning of 2017  Bitcoin fees tended to be well below  1  But in recent months  its growing popularity has outstripped the network s ability to cope with soaring demand 
As a result  the Bitcoin network as we know it today is radically different from what it was in its infancy  People are currently paying around  25 on average to make transactions using the digital currency  much higher than seen in the early days of 2017  according to data by BitInfoCharts 

In contrast  the cost of an average Ripple transaction fee is currently a fraction of a penny  while Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash boast an average transaction fee of 35 cents and 30 cents respectively 
This development has led to a growing number of merchants and businesses who are trying to realize Satoshi s vision of Bitcoin as a platform for  small casual transactions  to begin shifting away from BTC  toward alternative networks and other cryptocoins 

3  Tighter Rules and Regulations
After last year s remarkable 1 900  rally  Bitcoin has started 2018 on a rocky note  Ongoing chatter of tighter rules and stricter regulations has rattled investor sentiment  especially in Asia 
South Korea  and just this past weekend   were the latest countries to come out charging against Bitcoin trading  with South Korea s Justice Minister saying that the government was considering a  ban  on cryptocurrency trading  Many of India s largest private banks have suspended cryptocurrency exchange accounts tied to Bitcoin trade  Law enforcement agencies in South Korea also began investigating the country s largest exchanges for tax evasion 
China effected a similar ban last year and has recently signaled that it will escalate its clampdown on cryptocurrency trading  targeting online platforms and mobile apps that offer exchange like services 
Adding to fears over rising scrutiny from global regulators  a director at Germany s central bank said this week that any attempt to regulate cryptocurrencies must be on a global scale  as national or regional rules would be hard to enforce on a virtual  borderless community 

While the cryptocurrency has sidestepped similar obstacles in the past  a joint effort from the world s leading governments and regulatory authorities aimed at tackling the issue can potentially be the straw that finally breaks Bitcoin s back 

4  Mining Problems
China s government is planning to shut down Bitcoin miners as part of its latest crackdown on the cryptocurrency  On January 10  the Leading Group of Internet Financial Risks Remediation requested that local governments make an  orderly exit  from the industry 
The news is significant because China mines about 60  of the world s Bitcoins  making it by far the biggest Bitcoin mining country in the world  The fact that the majority of Bitcoin mining occurs in China could bring chaos to the Bitcoin community 

Another cause for concern  one Bitcoin mining session originally created 50 Bitcoins  then the number dropped to 25 and now it stands at roughly 12 5  Some forecast that by 2020  it will fall to 6 25 Bitcoins which will make mining unprofitable 
If Bitcoin isn t mined  transactions aren t approved and new Bitcoins aren t produced  Over 16 800 000 Bitcoins have been mined as of January 13  getting close to the maximum amount of 21 million coins mined  Once all of the Bitcoins are mined it means supply can no longer grow 

5  Loss of Anonymity
Early on  one of the most appealing aspects about Bitcoin was its anonymity  That  however  seems to be changing rapidly  with regulators and tax authorities leaning toward forcing traders to disclose their true identities 
South Korea has just announced a major change to cryptocurrency trading  stating that everyone within the nation who trades will need to use their real name  Indeed  any scheme that reduces the anonymity of Bitcoin transactions could strip away much of the cryptocurrency s appeal 
In November 2017  leading cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase suffered a major defeat at the hands of the U S  Internal Revenue Service  IRS   when a California federal court ordered the exchange to turn over identifying records for all users who have bought  sold  sent  or received more than  20 000 through their accounts in a single year between 2013 and 2015 
The FBI has also made it very clear that they are watching Bitcoin very closely  and are getting better and better at finding the true identities of the people who use it for illegal activity  In light of the threat it poses to tax collection as well as mounting fears by law enforcement of its ability to fuel illicit markets  it would not be a surprise for authorities around the world to get even tougher on Bitcoin 
With all that being said  it doesn t appear that cryptos are going away anytime soon  Our bet is that in the long run  the blockchain technology on which Bitcoin is built will thrive  but the price of the coin itself will collapse  causing it to be supplanted by one of its more efficient  younger cousins  While no one knows for sure  we believe the altcoins that have the best shot at becoming the next market leader in place of Bitcoin are Ripple  Dash and NEM 
In recent months  Ripple has signed up several additional financial institutions to its blockchain network  bringing its clientele to more than 100  including big name financials like Spain s Santander  NYSE SAN   Italy s UniCredit  OTC UNCFY   Switzerland s UBS Group  NYSE UBS  and the UK s Standard Chartered  OTC SCBFF   More financial institutions are reportedly set to join Ripple s growing global network this year  as it allows banks to settle cross border payments faster and more cheaply than they currently do via conventional global payment networks 
The main appeal behind Ripple is that it connects banks  payment providers  digital asset exchanges and corporates via its distributed ledger network  RippleNet  to provide one frictionless experience to send money globally 

Dash has been in the headlines thanks to indications of growing acceptance by online vendors and even physical stores to accept it as a form of payment So far  the cryptocurrency can be used at over 100 websites and 300 physical stores to purchase goods or services 

Dash offers all the same features as Bitcoin but also has advanced capabilities that solve many of the problems found in its older cousin  including instant transactions  which make it a more attractive payment option 

Finally  the NEM blockchain software is currently used in a commercial blockchain called Mijin  which is being tested by financial institutions and private companies in Japan and internationally  The developers claim that it will reduce banking institutional costs by 90  while making the banking industry more secure ",2018-01-22,Jesse Cohen/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/5-reasons-bitcoin-wont-survive-200282110,200282110

154474,375990,UBSG,UBS Group Raises Bonus Pool For Asian Investment Bankers ,opinion,"Per a Bloomberg article  UBS Group AG   NYSE UBS   increased the bonus pool for investment bankers in the Asia Pacific region by nearly 6  as part of its retention efforts 
People familiar with the matter said that overall compensation for bankers in junior positions was raised by an average of 12   whereas for those in China  hikes were about 15 20   the article mentioned 
UBS Group had lost some key people last year to other Chinese corporates and private equity firms due to a cut in investment banking pool by nearly 17  in 2016  For 2017  the bank is doing the opposite to retain its employees 
Moreover  in December 2017  Andrea Orcel  head of investment banking called 2017 a  tricky year  for compensation in the financial industry  However  he also noted that the bank had performed slightly better than in 2016 
Also  per the people  the bank benefited from a rebound in China equity and equity related deals in 2017 along with a recovery in Australia 
According to the latest earnings report the bank s Investment Bank unit reported adjusted operating profit before tax of CHF 1 5 billion for 2017  which declined slightly year over year  Primary reasons for the fallwere low volatility and reduced client activity levels  Moreover  advisory revenues declined due to lower fee pool in mergers and acquisitions 
Bonus Plans of Other Banks
Credit Suisse  SIX CSGN  Group AG   NYSE CS   is planning to increase the bonus pool by a low single digit percentage from the amount it paid for 2016  Previously  CEO Tidjane Thiam had told its bankers not to expect a big raise for 2017 as the company is emerging from two years of restructuring and cost cuts 
Despite posting its third consecutive annual loss in 2017 Deutsche Bank AG   NYSE DB   might raise its bonus pool to more than  1 2 billion  Per a German weekly Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung  the bank is forced to take such step amid concerns that another year of low bonuses could lead investment bankers to be poached by more generous competitors 
Our Viewpoint
UBS Group s restructuring initiatives along with cost control efforts keep us encouraged of its growth prospects  However  its profitability continues to be challenged by negative interest rates in the domestic economy

154488,376004,UBSG,Goldman moves to take majority control of China joint venture,news,"By Jennifer Hughes and Alun John
HONG KONG  Reuters    Goldman Sachs  N GS  has applied for majority control of its Chinese joint venture  the bank confirmed on Wednesday  the latest international bank to do so ahead of Chinese plans to eventually allow foreigners full control 
The bank submitted an application with the China Securities Regulatory Commission  CSRC  on Monday to take its stake in Goldman Sachs Gao Hua Securities to 51    the maximum permitted   from its current 33  holding 
A spokesman for the bank confirmed the filing  which was first reported by Bloomberg 
Western banks  lack of control over the JVs  along with their limited contribution to revenues  have long been a source of frustration for foreign banks in China 
Management control would allow foreign banks to offer more services through their JVs and potentially leverage their global networks to win China market share  bankers have said 
Unlike most of the other joint ventures  Goldman Sachs already has day to day operational control of its joint venture  which offers investment banking services such as equities and bond underwriting and deal advice 
Despite that managerial control  Goldman has long made it clear it would eventually seek to take a majority stake too 
Under the new agreement submitted to regulators  the securities sales  trading and research operations that currently sit in the business of its partner  Beijing Gao Hua Securities  will be folded into the joint venture 
Beijing Gao Hua is controlled by veteran Chinese banker Fang Fenglei 
Goldman s move to go to 51  follows similar actions by many of its rivals following a relaxation of the rules in late 2017 
UBS  S UBSG  was the first to get approval under the new rules as well as the stake it needed for control   Morgan Stanley   N MS  is waiting for its stake purchase to be approved 
JPMorgan  N JPM  and Nomura  T 8604  have approval and are working to start up joint ventures from scratch 
 Credit Suisse   S CSGN  is seeking approval to inject fresh capital into its JV in a move that would take it to 51

154489,376005,UBSG,Picking a Bank CEO in Europe  How Hard Can it Be ,news," Bloomberg Opinion     Picking a new CEO is one of the most important decisions a board can take  yet one that Europe s banks appear to be intent on flubbing  Lenders are struggling to find successors for the current crop of leaders 
Take UBS Group AG  NYSE UBS   On Thursday  the Swiss bank revamped its management board  hiring a star banker from a rival and promoting two more insiders  Yes  the revamp is a step forward for gender diversity for firm whose senior ranks were distinctly lacking in women  and the appointees may turn out to be potential candidates for the top job in future years 
But the reshuffle is also a sign that the number of potential internal successors for CEO Sergio Ermotti isn t as big as it should be by now  Almost eight years into his tenure  the chairman and board of directors have few excuses  By now  there should already be several candidates just about ready to replace him 
UBS isn t alone in grappling with succession  Hours after naming a new CEO    Swedbank AB    OTC SWDBY  was criticized by Sweden s biggest shareholder group for picking such an insider   and one who had failed to prevent the bank from engaging in alleged money laundering  Given the scandal wiped more than 40  off the bank s shares this year and triggered the exit of the previous CEO  discontinuity wouldn t have hurt 
Then there s Santander SA  NYSE SAN   A year ago  the Spanish bank hired UBS s then investment banking chief  Andrea Orcel  as its new CEO  Yet before he had even started the two fell out over compensation and are now locked in an acrimonious legal battle after Santander rescinded its offer  Santander resorted to asking the existing executive to stay in the job  raising doubts both about how the board came to hire Orcel in the first place 
Among the global finance titans  HSBC  NYSE HSBC  ousted CEO John Flint earlier this month  He was just 18 months into the job  Tensions with Chairman Mark Tucker and a clash of style were among the reasons for the exit  Bloomberg News reported  Surely the HSBC lifer s strengths and weaknesses would have been a known quantity to the board by the time he was appointed 
Europe s diverse languages and cultures that go along with them do make filling the CEO post more challenging than in the U S   but that means the boards and the incumbent executives should be even more focused on the task of avoiding leaving succession to chance 
It would help to align CEOs  pay more closely with how they have groomed and retained top talent so that if they were to be hit by the proverbial bus an internal replacement would be on hand  While financial targets are clearly important for any CEO  shielding the company from potential instability if they were to leave is perhaps an underrated but critical function 
It s up to shareholders to ramp up the pressure on companies  boards  Choosing the right CEO is only going to get tougher as technology advances alter the economics  competitive landscape and opportunities  The next wave of CEOs may not be working in finance right now  Boards  poor showing of late should be a cause for investor concern ",2019-08-30,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/picking-a-bank-ceo-in-europe-how-hard-can-it-be-1967200,1967200

President Trump has opened doors for banks to bring back billions of dollars of cash they had stacked in other countries in order to avoid high tax rate in the United States  This is likely to strengthen the economy by increasing business spending 
The companies based in the United States are to pay a mandatory repatriation tax of 15 5  on cash and liquid assets  and 8  on illiquid assets  irrespective of whether the earnings are brought home immediately or not  However  upon payment of the tax  the companies would be free to bring the earnings back without any further taxes

154504,376020,UBSG,Stellar s Success Hangs On Ripple s Reputation,opinion,"Recent star performers in the cryptocurrency space have included Bitcoin  Ethereum  Ripple  Bitcoin Cash Litecoin  Cardano and lately Stellar  XLM   which started 2018   elbowing its way into the top 10 list of most popular digital currencies when it surged more than 60   hitting a record high of  0 9185 cents on Wednesday January 3  2018  Though it s currently trading lower  it remains within the top 10 as of this writing  despite some fresh price volatility weighing on the currency 
Right now  has a market cap of  9 28 billion and is trading at  0 450  It s jumped 284  since December  10  2017 

Who s behind Stellar  The team includes developer Bartek Nowotarski  Boris Reznikov who is head of partnerships as well as David Mazi res the chief scientist  Jed McCaleb  Ripple s founder as well as the founder of Bitcoin exchange Mt  Gox is also Stellar s co creator  which dates back to 2014 
The digital currency is backed by   the digital currency unit that is the native asset of the Stellar network  One Lumen is a unit of currency  like a bitcoin  Stellar was born out of a  and is a  distributed  hybrid blockchain that is fully open source  according to its founders  By  native  the group means that Lumens are built into the network and asset  which is how the network refers to an item of value that is stored on the ledger 
Free Lumens give away in 2017 enticed users
Via its website  Stellar said the reason for giving away Lumens was  to achieve a more inclusive digital economy   Of course  that also helped spur the uptake of the fledgling alternative currency 
Jeff Mahony CEO of Ubiquicoin  a decentralized digital currency  explains that Stellar since it s a Ripple clone is currently riding Ripple s favorable wave based on the positive developments for the more popular currency  In addition  Stellar s give away event which began in June 2017   16 billion Stellar Lumens to individuals who had holdings of Bitcoin block  472889 
Stellar  like it s parent Ripple  is popular with banks and financial institutions  Yoav Dror  the CEO of Decentralized Vision  which is currently working on a blockchain based billing protocol called PumaPay  says 

 Stellar technology is similar to Ripple s  actually  Stellar is a fork of Ripple  and it is backed up by an excellent team  While their focus is a bit different   Ripple focuses on banks and other financial institutions  while Stellar presents itself as an alternative to banks for ordinary people and P2P transactions  both are in the Fintech space and competing each other to become the future standard for financial payment platforms  Stellar s total supply is  50  of Ripple s but its market cap is only  12  Ripple  It is reasonable to assume XLM will rise in value  at least in the near future  

Some see Stellar is a superior version of Ripple  Kain Warwick  founder of Havven  believes that in many ways  Stellar is a better implementation 
Warwick s reasons  It is run by an open source foundation and targeted at end users versus banks  He adds 

 Arguably it has a lot more potential than Ripple  It also has the ability to launch ICOs  one of the major drivers of the price rise in ether over the last 18 months  

Stellar and Ripple to revolutionize banking
Nolan Bauerle  director of research for CoinDesk says 

 Both Ripple s XRP and Stellar s Lumens aim to alter a banking industry defined by the limitations of physical borders  The low hanging fruit of correspondent banking  cross border payments  and trade finance represent several trillion dollar industries  There are lots of opportunities and more than one digital asset can be powerful agents of change   However  the usefulness of both of these coins cannot be measured simply by their trade value and speculative activity  They are both in a race to bring useful digital assets into the hands of people around the world  

Slowly but steadily the banking industry and traditional financial institutions appear to be coming round to the fact that cryptocurrencies are not a  fraud   Global financials including the US s American Express  NYSE AXP   Spain s Santander  NYSE SAN   Italy s UniCredit  OTC UNCFY   Switzerland s UBS Group  NYSE UBS  and the UK s Standard Chartered  OTC SCBFF  are all working on  or have already inked  partnerships with Ripple  Stellar network members include IBM  NYSE IBM   Deloitte  China s Wanxiang Labs and global payment processor Stripe 
As acceptance grows  it s inevitable that the technology behind digital assets will become mainstream  Ripple and Stellar are two leading contenders currently at the forefront of change within the banking industry ",2018-01-10,Tanzeel Akhtar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cryptocurrency-stellar-hangs-on-ripples-reputation-200279024,200279024
154505,376021,UBSG,Can Q4 Earnings Propel UBS Group  UBS  Stock To New Highs ,opinion,"Shares of UBS Group AG   NYSE UBS    which are trading close to their 52 week high  might reach new peaks post the company s fourth quarter 2017 results on Jan 22  Results might benefit from equity market rally and improved business sentiments during the quarter  However  a persistent low rate environment in the domestic economy is likely to weigh on the bank s revenues 
The Swiss banking giant s third quarter 2017 net profit attributable to common shareholders increased 14  year over year  Results primarily benefited from increase in net fees and commissions  and efficient expense management  However  lower net interest income and trading income were the main concerns 
Looking at the price performance  UBS Group stock has gained 8  year to date  outperforming the 6 6  rally of its  
The stock s rally post fourth quarter earnings release majorly depends on whether the firm is able to impress the market with its results 
Factors That Might Influence Q4 Results
Low Interest Rates to Dampen Revenues  UBS Group s profitability is likely to be hit by the continued negative interest rate environment  which was adopted by the Swiss National Bank in late 2014 to boost growth and inflation of the economy 
Fee Income Might Remain Stable  During the quarter  trading environment was disappointing as markets experienced low volatility  Revenues from advisory and underwriting might be on the lower side due to a decrease in M A activities during the quarter 
However  the equity market remained strong and might support UBS Group s financials  Also  the Wealth Management division might benefit to some extent from the company s consistent focus on loan growth 
Expenses Likely to Decline  The bank s focus on reducing expenses is likely to be reflected in fourth quarter results  It anticipates achieving CHF 2 1 billion in net cost reductions in 2017 
Adverse Effect of Tax Reform  Following the passage of the U S  tax act in December 2017  UBS Group expects one time charge of nearly CHF 3 billion in the fourth quarter related to write down of certain net deferred tax assets

154517,376033,UBSG,Morgan Stanley buys 2  needed for control of China securities joint venture,news,"By Cheng Leng and Alun John
HONG KONG BEIJING  Reuters     Morgan Stanley   N MS  moved closer to taking a controlling stake in its Chinese securities joint venture  JV  after picking up a 2  share for  54 million  exchange filings show 
Huaxin Securities signed an equity transfer contract on Aug  1 to move the 2  stake in Morgan Stanley Huaxin Securities to the U S  bank  according to a statement dated Aug  2 filed to the Shanghai Stock Exchange by Huaxin s parent  Shanghai China Fortune Co  SS 600621  
Morgan Stanley  which currently owns 49  of the JV  was the only bidder  the filing said 
An unnamed buyer will pay 376 2 million yuan   54 24 million  for the 2  stake in Morgan Stanley Huaxin Securities  according to a separate notice on the Shanghai United Assets and Equity Exchange website dated Aug  1 
The transfer still has to be approved by the China Securities Regulatory Commission  CSRC   and the JV s business registration license must be changed by the Ministry of Commerce to reflect its foreign ownership  the filing added 
Morgan Stanley declined to comment 
Morgan Stanley Huaxin Securities  whose offerings include underwriting and sponsoring of stock and bond sales  told the CSRC earlier this year about plans to change its equity holdings  Reuters reported in June  citing people with direct knowledge of the matter 
The outcome of Sino U S  trade talks could  however  impact the approval timeline  the people said at that time  declining to be identified as they were not authorized to discuss regulatory matters with media 
U S  President Donald Trump vowed  on Thursday  to impose a 10  tariff on the remaining  300 billion of Chinese imports from Sept  1  escalating the bruising trade war between the world s largest economies and jolting financial markets

Lack of control and limited contribution to revenue have long been a source of frustration for Wall Street banks  and became a key issue in Washington s push to persuade Beijing to open up its market for wider foreign participation 
Management control would allow foreign banks  including Morgan Stanley  to offer more services through their JVs and potentially leverage their global networks to win China market share  bankers have previously said ",2019-08-02,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/morgan-stanley-buys-2-needed-for-control-of-china-securities-joint-venture-1943661,1943661

People covered by the request now have 20 days to make themselves known  the Swiss authorities said 
The bank is facing two separate investigations in Italy and a court case in France over allegations it enabled cross border tax cheats to hide assets in Switzerland 
Italian prosecutors allege that unidentified UBS managers were responsible for money laundering because they invested client funds that were the fruit of tax evasion 
The bank agreed in June to pay 101 million euros   113 million  to resolve a dispute over money laundering and taxes with Italy s tax authority  according to regulatory filings released with UBS s second quarter earnings 
UBS has declined to comment on the settlement  It wasn t able to comment immediately on the second investigation 
Switzerland s highest court ruled last month that historical data of about 40 000 UBS clients must be handed to French tax authorities in a landmark case that could set a precedent for foreign governments seeking information from Swiss banks

The PNG investigation comes after the loan was also scrutinized by the PNG s Ombudsman Commission  Former Treasurer Don Polye had said the deal breached budget guidelines 
Swiss financial watchdog FINMA said in March it was in contact with UBS about the loan 
Marape said the PNG government had asked for the investigation to be concluded within three months  although the timeframe could be extended

Jyske Bank  Denmark s second largest lender  said it would introduce a negative interest rate of 0 6  for clients depositing more than 7 5 million Danish crowns   1 1 million  
 The negative interest rate environment that has affected the Danish market since the spring of 2012  only interrupted in 2014  now seems to be of a rather permanent nature   Jyske Chief Executive Anders Dam said in a statement

The Nordic country was among the first to introduce negative rates in 2012  Earlier this month  Jyske became the first to offer a negative rate on a home loan  in effect paying customers 0 5  to borrow money for 10 years 
Such moves reflect prospects of a global recession  prompting central banks to try to kick start the economy by measures such as cutting lending rates

The Asset Management unit s adjusted operating profit rose 10 9  year over year to CHF 153 million   159 million  in the quarter  supported by higher net management fees along with lower operating expenses 
The company s Investment Bank unit s adjusted operating profit before tax came in at CHF 352 million   366 million   up 2 9  from the prior year quarter  Increased revenues in equity derivatives were partially offset by low volatility and reduced client activity levels 
Personal   Corporate banking division s adjusted operating profit before tax was down 7 8  year over year to CHF 436 million   453 million   Lower net interest income and higher costs were recorded  partially offset by elevated transaction based and recurring net fee income  Notably  annualized net new business volume growth for personal banking was 3 7

Outlook
Wealth management client activity levels have improved on optimism among investors  However  management remains concerned about geo political tensions and underlying macroeconomic uncertainties  which have been contributing to client risk aversion and low transaction volumes  Though investors  sentiments have improved  a sustained increase in client activity levels is not visible 
The company also highlighted several concerns  including headwinds from negative interest rates  though partially mitigated by the favorable impact of increasing U S  dollar interest rates and normalization of monetary policy  Further  the proposed changes to the Swiss bank capital standards and global regulatory framework in Switzerland  will lead to higher capital requirements and expenses  However  amid a challenging operating environment  the company remains committed to the execution of its strategies 
Our Take
Results highlight a decent quarter for UBS Group with its major units displaying growth  though the Wealth Management Americas unit disappointed  Pressure on net interest income due to low rates remains a concern  Though UBS Group has been successful in trimming costs this quarter  its exposure to legal matters is likely to keep costs elevated in the near term 
Currently  UBS Group AG carries a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell

Amid these ongoing restructuring  the New York s banking regulator imposed a fine of  135 million on Credit Suisse  accusing it of trading ahead of client orders and sharing information with other banks to boost its profit by influencing currency prices and benchmark rates

Investing com    Who needs Andrea Orcel  
Not   Banco Santander    MC SAN   apparently  Spain s largest bank  which is facing a 100 million euro dollar lawsuit from the man who nearly became its chief executive last year  reported what it said was the best underlying quarterly result in eight years Tuesday 
Profit before one off charges rose 5  to 2 1 billion euros   2 35 billion   The net result was 1 4 billion euros  still around 7  higher than expectations 
In large part  that was due to the bank s strategy of regional diversification paying off  with its units in the U S   Mexico and Brazil all posting solid gains  Its European operations fared less well 
Santander s Spanish business has had to absorb some 600 million euros of charges in the first half related to the integration of Banco Popular  which it bought for a token sum in 2017 when regulators declared it  failing or likely to fail   It s also had to absorb a further 172 million euros in charges that were taken in the U K  in respect of mis sold payment protection insurance  the problem that never seems to go away for U K  banks 
The solid earnings helped Santander  one of Europe s largest bank by assets  to a healthier core tier one capital ratio of 11 3   That measure of financial strength is up from a thin looking 10 8  a year ago   
The bank s shares were up 2 7  by mid morning in Madrid  one of the best performing in the sector in Europe  But they re still down 11  since April  when the European Central Bank re adopted an easing bias that has put fresh pressure on its lending margins  And the shares will face a fresh test on Thursday when the ECB s policy making governing council meets  amid expectations that it will cut its interest rates still further into negative territory 
The Spanish IBEX 35 index was up 0 7   slightly ahead of the Stoxx 600 benchmark  Germany s Dax led the way in Europe with a 1 2  gain as the euro s decline against the dollar boosted the outlook for its battered exporters 
Orcel s absence was arguably more felt at his old employer  UBS Group  SIX UBSG   While the Swiss bank  too  managed to post decent group results  the investment bank that Orcel headed until his departure was unable to escape the negative trends already evidenced by its Wall Street rivals 
Adjusted profit before tax at UBS s investment bank fell 23  from a year earlier  while the unit s adjusted cost income ratio  a measure of profitability  rose to 78 7   some 20 points higher than rivals like JPMorgan  NYSE JPM   Equities trading revenue fell 9  and fixed income trading fell 7  ",2019-07-23,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/stockbeat-who-needs-orcel-santander-and-ubs-rise-on-solid-2q-1931193,1931193

154560,376076,UBSG,UBS close to settling in Italy money laundering probe  sources,news,"By Emilio Parodi
MILAN  Reuters    Swiss bank UBS  S UBSG  has reached a provisional deal with Italian prosecutors to pay 3 million euros   3 3 million  to settle a money laundering investigation  two sources said  in a move to end one of its biggest legal headaches in Europe 
The bank has been grappling with two separate investigations in Italy and a court case in France over allegations it enabled cross border tax cheats to hide assets in Switzerland 
The proposed money laundering settlement  known as an  agreed penalty   has yet to be confirmed by a judge but it has already been backed by Milan prosecutors and has a strong chance of being approved  said the sources familiar with the matter 
Last month  UBS settled its other Italian case  a related financial investigation  with tax authorities for 101 million euros 
No charges have been laid against UBS in the money laundering investigation which began in late 2017 
UBS declined to comment 
The settlement would go before a judge in the autumn  the sources said  UBS had already deposited in a Milan court s bank account 10 million euros that the judge is expected to confiscate as profit of alleged money laundering  they added 
The settlement would apply only to potential charges against the bank s parent group  UBS AG  and two subsidiaries  UBS Switzerland and UBS Monaco  the sources said  adding that each company would pay an agreed settlement of 1 million euros 
Prosecutors allege that unidentified UBS managers were responsible for money laundering because they invested client funds that were the fruit of tax evasion 
Last week  the Swiss Supreme Court ruled that data about 40 000 UBS clients must be handed to French tax authorities in a landmark case that could set a precedent for foreign governments seeking information from Swiss banks

recommendations    Here are highlights from Friday s Analyst Blog  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  FDIC  recently sued six major international banks and British Bankers  Association  the trade group which supervises the Libor setting process  accusing them of deceptive misrepresentation  The banks have been accused for  lowballing  in the London court after a similar lawsuit was dismissed in the federal court of New York due to lack of jurisdiction last year Notably  lowballing means submission of artificially low estimates to the Libor rate setting process  which misrepresents increased creditworthiness of these companies  FDIC accused banks for lowballing between 2007 and 2009  which showed them more creditworthy than they actually were The list of accused banks includes   Deutsche Bank AG  NYSE        Barclays PLC  NYSE        Lloyds Banking Group plc  NYSE        The Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc  NYSE        Rabobank and UBS Group AG  NYSE        These banks have been charged with allegations on behalf of 39 failed U S  banks which suffered due to such malpractices  Per the allegations  these U S  banks considered manipulated LIBOR while carrying out derivative transactions and calculating interest for which they suffered huge losses Among above mentioned banks  UBS Group AG and Lloyds carry a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   while RBS and Deutsche Bank carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  However  the amount of losses is yet to be disclosed as the scale of lowballing has not been determined by the FDIC  Though the lawsuit in London has not quoted any value  the FDIC s New York lawsuit has sought damages around  1 billion LIBOR is a widely accepted benchmark rate  Several financial institutions  mortgage lenders and credit card agencies lay down their own rates in relation to this  Derivatives and other financial products are connected to this rate Therefore  manipulation of benchmark interest rates by major financial institutions has triggered thorough investigations by regulatory bodies across Europe  Asia and America  Investigations revealed huge scams  with nearly  300 trillion of loans  mortgages  financial products and contracts being linked to the tampered interest rates Lloyds said in a statement   We do not believe the claim has any merit and is being contested vigorously  Further  the other banks  the BBA and the FDIC refrained from comments Regulatory authorities are investigating the matter and plan to put forward a landmark judgment  in a bid to curb the occurrence of such shrewd practices in future  bring justice to the sufferers and punish the wrongdoers  While the settlements will put to rest a long drawn investigation and banks can breathe relief  this comes as a huge blow to their financials  Further  such settlements could be called exemplary and trigger similar settlements by other banks depending on the charges against them 4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye onTech

154593,376109,UBSG,UBS CEO Says He Feels a  Biting Headwind  From Swiss Regulators,news," Bloomberg     UBS Group AG Chief Executive Officer Sergio Ermotti attacked Switzerland s banking regulators  saying that a discussion around too big to fail rules has been set off by local authorities who are trying too hard 
With the financial crisis almost a decade behind  a continued  biting headwind  of new rules set by financial watchdog Finma and other regulators is a drag on profitability  he said 
 The majority of foreign analysts and investors find the Swiss system increasingly difficult to understand   Ermotti said late Tuesday in a speech in Zurich   The Swiss finish has gone from being a seal of approval to a burden  
Switzerland s Finance Ministry is weighing tougher capital requirements for the biggest firms playing a key role in the financial system  a move backed by the Swiss National Bank  Strict capital rules    which build on international standards and are known as the  Swiss finish     have proved a thorn in the side of the nation s biggest banks as they shift into growth mode after years of painful restructurings 
UBS  NYSE UBS  was little changed little changed as of 9 04 a m  in Zurich 
Its not the first time Ermotti has taken aim at local regulation  In 2017  the CEO told Bloomberg Markets that  people should never take things for granted   including staying in Switzerland  Ermotti has led UBS since 2011  a time during which he trimmed down huge trading floors at Switzerland s largest bank and steered the institution increasingly towards wealth management 
 Big is bad  small is good   Ermotti said was the message he received from regulators   I am criticizing the constant fear mongering

154595,376111,UBSG,China to push forward opening up of financial  manufacturing sectors  Premier Li,news,"By Kevin Yao DALIAN  China  Reuters    China will end ownership limits for foreign investors in its financial sector in 2020  a year earlier than scheduled  to show the world it will keep opening up its markets  Premier Li Keqiang said on Tuesday  China will also further open its manufacturing sector  including the auto industry  while reducing its negative investment list that restricts foreign investment in some areas  Li told the World Economic Forum in the northeastern Chinese port city of Dalian   Beijing s signal that it is quickening the pace of opening up came after the presidents of China and the United States agreed over the weekend to restart trade talks in another attempt to strike a deal and end a bruising tariff war   But analysts doubt the ceasefire will lead to a sustained easing of tensions  and warn lingering uncertainty could dampen corporate spending and global growth   We will achieve the goal of abolishing ownership limits in securities  futures  life insurance for foreign investors by 2020  a year earlier than the original schedule of 2021   Li said  Foreign investment banks such as  Morgan Stanley   N MS  are looking to join  HSBC Holdings  PLC  L HSBA   JPMorgan Chase   Co  N JPM   Nomura Holdings Inc  T 8604  and UBS Group AG  S UBSG  in owning controlling stakes in onshore securities joint ventures in China under liberalized rules announced in 2017    JPMorgan welcomes any decision made by the Chinese government that looks to liberalize its financial sector further   said JPMorgan China CEO Mark Leung    Citigroup   N C   which is in the process of setting up a majority owned securities joint venture in China  also applauded the news    Citi welcomes any move that leads to the further opening up of the Chinese financial system   said a Hong Kong based spokesman   The United States and other countries in the West have long complained that Beijing is blocking foreign access to its fast growing financial markets and not allowing a level playing field when multinational companies are allowed in  But in recent months  China has allowed many foreign financial firms to either set up new businesses onshore or expand their presence through majority ownership in domestic joint ventures across mutual funds  insurance and brokerage businesses   Sources with direct knowledge of the matter previously told Reuters that Morgan Stanley is likely to get regulatory approval for owning a majority stake in the second half of this year  Li also said the government will reduce restrictions next year on market access for foreign investors in the value added telecoms services and transport sectors   On Sunday  China cut the number of sectors subject to foreign investment restrictions  a widely expected move  to 40 from 48 in the previous version  published in June last year  GLOBAL RISKS On Saturday  leaders of the Group of 20 major economies warned of growing risks to the global economy but stopped short of denouncing protectionism  calling instead for a free and fair trade environment after talks some members described as difficult  Echoing the sentiment  Li said protectionism is rising  but did not make references to specific economies    In the face of pressure from a slowing global economy  I believe people are all in the same boat  We should promote the spirit of partnership  carry out equal consultations  seek common ground while reserving differences and manage and control disputes   Li said   The U S  China trade war has hit business confidence worldwide  disrupted supply chains and shaken financial markets  adding to worries about a global economic slowdown  Fallout from the dispute is spreading  Business surveys this week showed factory activity shrank in China and much of the rest of Asia in June  as well as in Europe  while manufacturing growth cooled in the United States  keeping pressure on policymakers to shore up growth  Rising worries over global growth have compelled some central banks  such as those in Australia  New Zealand  India and Russia to cut interest rates   Currently  global economic risks are rising somewhat  international investment and trade growth is slowing  protectionism is rising and unstable and uncertain factors are increasing   Li said    We should actively cope with this  Some countries have taken measures including cutting interest rates  or sent clear signals on quantitative easing    But China will not resort to competitive currency devaluation  Li said  and will keep the yuan exchange rate  basically stable at a reasonable and balanced level  China is likely to hit its economic growth target of 6  6 5  this year provided the trade dispute with the United States does not worsen  and hence will not need  very big  stimulus measures to prop up growth  a central bank adviser said on Monday  The People s Bank of China  PBOC  has already slashed the amount of cash banks must hold as reserve six times since early 2018 to help turn around soft credit growth  and more cuts in banks  reserve requirement ratios  RRRs  are widely expected in coming months   China has also injected large amounts of liquidity into the financial system and guided short term interest rates lower  while ramping

154599,376115,UBSG,After Deutsche Bank cuts  where will the growth be ,news,"By Rachel Armstrong and Tom Sims
LONDON FRANKFURT  Reuters    For  Deutsche Bank   DE DBKGn  chief executive Christian Sewing  shrinking the group s investment bank will be the relatively easy   if expensive   part of his restructuring plan 
Finding steady revenue streams to produce the 7 4 billion euros   8 31 billion  the bank expects in charges from cutting down its trading arm will be more challenging 
Germany s biggest bank said on Sunday it planned to focus on corporate banking  foreign exchange  deal making  asset management  and private banking  All these areas potentially could provide less volatile revenue streams than the bank s equity and rates trading arms  but they are already fiercely competitive and undergoing sweeping technological changes 
CORPORATE BANKING
Deutsche Bank wants corporate banking to be the center of its business 
This involves building on its strengths in transaction banking   such as trade finance and cash management 
The bank is held up by rivals as a traditionally strong performer in these areas  but its standing has slipped recently with the lender dipping from 5th to 6th last year in the global league tables for transaction banking compiled by banking analytics firm Coalition 
Transaction banking  one of the less glamorous areas of finance  is a growing focus at several of Deutsche s rivals  as it requires less capital and is not as cyclical as investment banking 
Goldman Sachs  N GS  for example is looking to launch a cash management business next year while HSBC  L HSBA  and  Standard Chartered   L STAN  are trying to build on their strong Asian franchises by beefing up their European operations 
In investment banking Deutsche has said it wants to retain a focus on advising on M A deals and on helping to list companies and issue bonds  The bank remains a major player in this space  but trails U S  rivals  while some European competitors are gaining some market share 
In Refinitiv s investment banking scorecard  which tracks how firms do on advising on M A  equity and debt capital markets  loans and leveraged finance  Deutsche currently ranks 8th so far this year globally   steady compared with 2018  In Europe  it has slipped to 8th from 7th a year ago  with  BNP Paribas   PA BNPP  edging above it 
MANAGING MONEY
In asset management  Deutsche Bank s DWS arm is seen as another of its strong points  and one the bank leaned on to extract value last year when it listed 22 5  of the business 
But with the sweeping rise of passive investments  asset managers need scale and technology to compete  Deutsche had held talks with rival UBS  S UBSG  earlier this year about a merger of their asset management arms  but talks broke down due to a clash over who would ultimately control the business 
In private banking  Deutsche has said it plans to hire 300 new relationship and investment managers by 2021 as part of a plan to bulk up in the sector 
But the bank will be tracing a path already beaten by several of its rivals  and it will need to find a strong niche if it is to make much headway 
Its wealth management arm had 213 billion euros under management at the end of the first quarter  BNP Paribas  which is just inside the top 10 wealth managers globally  had 361 billion euros at the end of 2018 
TECHNOLOGY
A broader challenge for Deutsche is technology  with the lender trying to update legacy IT systems that are blamed in part for the bank s failure to control costs while also keeping up with the wave of fintech innovation in the industry 
Deutsche has established a board level Technology  Data and Innovation Committee to tackle this  and in a memo to staff on Sunday Sewing said Deutsche Bank would invest 13 billion euros in technology by 2022 
That should help  but it will be doing so amid a technology arms race in banking 
Research from UBS earlier this year found that JPMorgan  N JPM  has budgeted  11 4 billion for technology in 2019 alone ",2019-07-07,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/after-deutsche-bank-cuts-where-will-the-growth-be-1916836,1916836
154600,376116,UBSG,UBS Australia s  rock star  banking chief Matthew Grounds to leave,news,"By Byron Kaye and Paulina Duran
SYDNEY  Reuters    The head of UBS  S UBSG  in Australia and New Zealand  Matthew Grounds  is leaving the Swiss bank at the end of the year  a spokeswoman confirmed on Tuesday  possibly ending one of the most storied careers in Australian investment banking 
Grounds  49  who brokered some of the most talked about deals of post financial crisis Australia over his 11 year stint as CEO  will spend the next six months handling a leadership change to UBS investment banking head Anthony Sweetman and chief operating officer Nick Hughes  the spokeswoman said 
 This is not a decision that Matthew has taken lightly  but he considers this is the right time given the current strong performance of the business and the opportunities that this will provide for the next generation of leaders   said an internal memo seen by Reuters and confirmed by the spokeswoman 
Grounds declined to comment when contacted by Reuters 
The departure is a second shake up in two days for the Australian investment banking industry  after  Deutsche Bank  AG  DE DBKGn  began laying off dozens of local staff on Monday as part of a global restructure 
Grounds played a leading role in some of Australia s costliest M A deals and was frequently sought out by its major banks for advice 
UBS under Grounds s leadership advised mining giant BHP Group Ltd  AX BHP  on a 2001 merger with Anglo Dutch Billiton Plc to create the world s biggest miner and one of Australia s largest companies 
From 2014  Grounds s UBS advised the government on Australia s biggest privatization sale  the electricity infrastructure of New South Wales state 
That appointment led to Grounds testifying in parliament after UBS was accused of changing a supposedly independent report about the sale from skeptical to positive  according to media reports 
Grounds was also in charge when UBS made A 1 2 billion   834 5 million  in loans to Papua New Guinea in 2014  which the government used to buy shares of oil and gas producer Oil Search Ltd  AX OSH  
The deal soured when Oil Search shares fell sharply and Papua New Guinea was forced to sell them at a loss  Authorities in Switzerland and Papua New Guinea are investigating whether the government followed its own borrowing rules in agreeing to the loan 
UBS has said it does not comment on specific client transactions but adheres to strict standards in due diligence and execution 
The firm held the top position in league tables for equity capital markets  ECM  and investment banking fees for M A in the first six months of 2019  ahead of  Macquarie Group  Ltd  AX MQG  and Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  Bank AG  GLDSH UL   according to Refinitiv data 
In 2012  another year when UBS was the country s top dealmaker  Reuters reported that Grounds pulled off a bonus protection deal to quarantine executives from budgeting cutbacks affecting the rest of the company s global operations 
The bonus arrangement  known as the Kangaroo Deal  ended in late 2018  the Australian Financial Review reported on Tuesday 
Another thing that ended for Grounds in 2018 was his friendship with James Packer  the billionaire founder of casino operator  Crown  Resorts Ltd  AX CWN   according to reports in The Australian newspaper 
Packer had made Grounds executor of his will and godfather to one of his children  but the relationship soured over Grounds s handling of Packer s personal finances  the paper reported 
In 2012  though  the Australian Financial Review quoted Packer as calling Grounds a  rock star  ",2019-07-09,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/ubs-australias-rock-star-banking-chief-matthew-grounds-to-leave-1918150,1918150
154601,376117,UBSG,UBS creates team to promote private capital markets deals,news,"ZURICH  Reuters    UBS Group  S UBSG  has created a private capital markets team to help wealth management clients invest in the burgeoning sector  the Swiss bank said on Wednesday 
The new team will focus on transactions and investments including last stage financing of companies before initial public offerings  structured private credit  infrastructure investments  and secondary equity monetizations  UBS said in a staff memo 
Alan Felder will head the team in the Americas  Isabelle Toledano Koutsouris in Europe  the Middle East and Africa  and Nicolo Magni in Asia Pacific  in addition to their current roles 
Paul Crisci  who is leading the global roll out of the team  will oversee the business 
 Giving billionaires more direct investment opportunities in private markets is something they will value more than lending  which they can get from almost anyone   said Piero Novelli  the co head of UBS s investment bank 
Such transactions are attractive to banks because they offer relatively solid fees  although UBS did not reveal these 
Novelli said it was difficult to forecast deal volumes 
 I think in 12 months we will be in a much better position to scope and size the opportunity   he said 
 It will take several years to get it into the full regime  But I would not be surprised if it became a half a billion dollar business one day  
The global net asset value of private equity has grown twice as fast as public market capitalization since 2000 as more companies stay private for longer  its investment bank co heads Robert Karofsky and Novelli said ",2019-07-10,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/ubs-creates-team-to-promote-private-capital-markets-deals-1919462,1919462

154614,376130,UBSG,UBS Group   Credit Suisse Reduce Share In Domestic Mortgage,opinion,"UBS Group AG   NYSE UBS   and Credit Suisse  SIX CSGN  Group AG   NYSE CS   recently made news for reducing their share in the domestic mortgage market  Their combined market share reduced 8 basis points year over year to 27 4  of the Swiss mortgage market worth  996 billion as of Apr 2017  per a Financial Times article 
The reason for the cut back is the prevailing low interest rate environment in the European economy  Also  increasing property rates along with intensified competition in the market led these banking giants to take this action 
Per the article  UBS Group disclosed that it followed a plan of growing its mortgage business qualitatively by granting loans on a substantial basis  Though this strategy led to an increase in mortgage volumes in absolute terms  UBS Group lost its share in relative terms  Thus  it is expected to revamp its profitability and quality of mortgage business 
Credit Suisse had been expanding its mortgage business on sustainable risk and returns basis  However  the bank noted that the conditions were more favorable to private real estate than commercial markets 
Moreover  Cantonal banks  Swiss government owned commercial banks and Raiffeisen  the third largest bank in Switzerland  have been increasing their share in mortgage business 
Cantonal banks have  in fact  outpaced Raiffeisen in the race to increasing mortgage volumes  Pressure on margins leaves Cantonal Banks with no other options than to increase their mortgage business share 
First quarter 2017 results for both UBS Group and Credit Suisse improved on a sequential basis  We remain optimistic about their restructuring initiatives to reduce costs and aid revenues 
Shares of UBS Group and Credit Suisse have gained 40 3  and 41 4   respectively over the last one year  outperforming the Zacks categorized  industry s rally of 33 4  

Currently  UBS Group sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   whereas Credit Suisse carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  
A couple of other stocks worth considering in the same space include ING Group  N V    NYSE ING   and HSBC Holdings  LON HSBA  PLC   NYSE HSBC    Both these stocks sport a Zacks Rank  1  You can see  
ING Group s current year earnings estimates were revised 14 1  upward  over the last 60 days  Further  its shares have rallied 81 9   in the last one year 
HSBC Holdings witnessed a nearly 1  upward revision in the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year  in the past 60 days  Also  its shares have jumped 61 1   over the last one year

154615,376131,UBSG,UBS Group  UBS  To Post Q2 Earnings  What s In The Cards ,opinion,"UBS Group AG   NYSE UBS   is scheduled to report second quarter 2017 results on Aug 4 
The Swiss banking giant s first quarter 2017 net profit attributable to common shareholders increased 79 5  year over year  Results primarily benefited from improved trading income  Further  the company s efficient expense management initiatives led to stable expenses on a year over year basis 
Looking at the price performance  UBS stock has gained 16  year to date  marginally underperforming the 16 2  rally of its  
Factors to Influence Q2 ResultsThe company s profitability is likely to be hit by the lingering negative interest rate environment which was adopted by the Swiss National Bank   SNB   in late 2014  Later in Jan 2015  SNB lowered the rate on bank deposits  While the central bank s aim is to boost growth and inflation by keeping interest rates low  this will keep UBS Group s net interest income under pressure In 2017  management expects a CHF350 million year over year decline in net interest income  In addition  a substantial increase in funding costs  related to achieving TLAC requirements  is foreseen However  the Wealth Management division might benefit to some extent from the company s consistent focus on loan growth UBS  which had gradually shifted focus on the wealth management business  post crisis  to reduce dependence on more capital intensive investment banking business  remains confident of achieving its target for net new money growth During the second quarter  the market experienced low volatility  Thus  the company is likely to face fixed income trading slump  Moreover  trading in equities is likely to be down due to lower client activities Revenues from advisory and underwriting might be on the lower side due to decrease in M A activities during the quarter  However  improved equity underwriting might support them to some extent

over year   partially offset by lower trading income  down 23  year over year   Notably  the quarter benefited from the company s consistent focus on expense management Further  the Swiss banking giant s net profit attributable to shareholders of CHF 1 17 billion   1 19 billion   up 13 6  year over year  Results included net restructuring expenses of CHF 258 million The company recorded

positives  Net new money came in at CHF 7 5 billion in the quarter The Wealth Management division s adjusted operating profit before tax jumped 14  year over year to CHF 691 million   701 4 million  in the quarter  Elevated transaction based income and recurring net fee income  along with reduced operating expenses mainly led to the upsurge  Notably  net new money remained strong during the quarter Wealth Management Americas division s adjusted operating profit before tax jumped 17 1  from the prior year quarter figure to CHF 322 million   326 8 million   Notably  net new money was a

The company s Investment Bank unit s adjusted operating profit before tax came in at CHF 419 million   425 3 million   down 6 3  from the prior year quarter  Low volatility and reduced client activity levels led to a decrease in Foreign Exchange  Rates and Credit revenues  partially offset by higher corporate client solutions revenues Personal   Corporate banking division s adjusted operating profit before tax was down 18 1  year over year to CHF 379 million   384 7 million   Lower net interest income was recorded  partially offset by elevated transaction based and recurring net fee income

billion   270 1 billion  OutlookWealth management client activity levels have improved on optimism among investors   However  management remains concerned about geo political tensions and underlying macroeconomic uncertainties  which have been contributing to client risk aversion and low transaction volumes  Though investors  sentiments have improved  a sustained increase in client activity levels is not visible The company also highlighted several concerns  including headwinds from negative interest rates  though partially mitigated by the favorable impact of increasing U S  dollar interest rates and normalization of monetary policy  Further  the proposed changes to the Swiss bank capital standards and global regulatory framework in Switzerland  will lead to higher capital requirements and expenses  However  amid a challenging operating environment  the company remains committed to the execution of its strategies Our TakeResults highlight a decent quarter for UBS Group

Investing com    Money doesn t stink   is one of the oldest principles in business  The first century Roman emperor Vespasian first coined the phrase to defend raising taxes on the urine extracted from Rome s sewers 
But the idea that money isn t tainted by its origins is one that Europe s banks have taken too closely to heart in the past  and they are suffering for it now in a big way 
Switzerland s UBS  SIX UBSG  is down 2  this morning after a French court fined it 4 5 billion euros   5 billion  for helping its clients avoid taxes  a sum that will swallow around 80  of last year s pretax profit 
Meanwhile  Sweden s  Swedbank   ST SWEDa  is down another 8 2    after losing 15  on Wednesday on allegations linking it to Danske Bank s  CO DANSKE  funnelling of illicit funds out of the former Soviet Union  Broadcaster SVT said the bank was linked to  5 8 billion of questionable transactions  including some linked to the case involving Sergey Magnitsky  the lawyer who died in prison after helping to expose money laundering by Russian officials 
Swedbank s Scandinavian rival Nordea  HE NDAFI  and  Deutsche Bank   DE DBKGn  are also under pressure  Arguably the only thing that smells worse this morning is the lingering whiff of Juventus   MI JUVE  defending in the Champions League defeat in Madrid last night  Its shares are down 8  
Despite all that  the Stoxx 600 index was down only 0 2  at 370 80 by 05 00 AM ET  1000 GMT   That s because flash readings of IHS Markit s purchasing managers indexes suggest the euro zone economy may be bottoming out in February   even if it s still on course for only 0 1  growth in the first quarter 
Swedbank s CEO Birgitte Bonnesen acknowledged  there is a risk  that some payments could have gone unnoticed by its internal controls  but said she  does not recognize  the scale of the payments alleged by SVT  UBS meanwhile has said it will appeal the French fine  But it will be some time before any of the banks involved can hope to draw a line under the affairs 
Of course  when they finally do  they ll find shareholders are a forgiving bunch after all  The U K  s  Standard Chartered   LON STAN  is up 0 2  Thursday morning after setting aside  only   900 million to settle allegations of violating U S  sanctions on Iran and manipulating foreign exchange rates ",2019-02-21,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/marketpulse-europe-the-pervasive-stench-of-moneylaundering-1785917,1785917

154639,376155,UBSG,UBS Investors Revolt Over Record French Tax Evasion Penalty,news," Bloomberg     UBS Group AG  NYSE UBS  shareholders refused to back management and directors in a revolt against the bank s handling of events that led to a  5 billion penalty for helping French clients evade taxes 
A usually routine vote to release directors and executives from liability failed to get the 50 percent needed at the bank s annual general meeting in Basel on Thursday  The decision means shareholders reserve the right to legal action against management  The last time UBS investors refused to back executives was in 2010  after the bank ran up massive losses during the financial crisis 
The decision adds to pressure on Chief Executive Officer Sergio Ermotti  who has suffered a number of executive departures as well as criticism from some shareholders over strategy  UBS  the world s largest wealth manager  has set aside just one tenth of the 4 5 billion euro   5 billion  it was ordered to pay as it appeals one of the highest penalties ever imposed on a Swiss bank 
It s at least the third time in two weeks that shareholders at a large European company are standing up against management  On Friday  investors in  Bayer AG   DE BAYGN  rebuked the drugmaker s chief executive officer over the  63 billion acquisition of  Monsanto   NYSE MON  and the handling of legal challenges linked to the deal  ING shareholders refused to back the supervisory and executive boards over their handling of money laundering issues 
 Criminal Wrongdoing 
UBS s investors had been advised ahead of the meeting by U S  based Institutional Shareholder Services Inc  to reject the annual request to release directors and executives from liability  Glass Lewis  another adviser  said shareholders should abstain when asked to vote on the directors  liability at the May 2 annual general meeting
While the French verdict could be overturned on appeal   it remains the case that the company has been convicted of criminal wrongdoing and has incurred a record penalty as a result  this is of serious concern to shareholders   ISS said at the time 
The last time UBS shareholders refused to back management was almost a decade ago  In 2010 they voted against actions for 2007  the year the Zurich based bank amassed billions of losses related to subprime mortgages 
In 2012  early in Ermotti s tenure  shareholders protested against management actions for the prior year after Switzerland s biggest bank suffered a  2 3 billion loss from unauthorized trading  At that time  however  the motion was approved by a slim margin

154689,376205,UBSG,Deutsche Bank To Make Settlement With The Fed On Russia Soon,opinion,"Deutsche Bank AG  DE DBKGn    NYSE DB   is expected to reach a settlement with the Federal Reserve soon over an inquiry about the bank s involvement in helping clients move about  10 billion out of Russia in the 2011 2015 period  However  people familiar with the matter declined to comment on the amount of fine that can be imposed 
Per the New York Department of Financial Services  the bank is charged of buying blue chip Russian stocks in rubles and selling them in London  converting rubles to dollars outside Russia  This practice  known as mirror trades  is sometimes legal but can also be used by banks in money laundering or tax evasion 
Though the bank is hopeful on the Fed settlement  the investigation of U S  Justice Department is unlikely to end anytime soon  Further  the department is said to have registered a number of requests with Deutsche Bank for disclosing information related to the matter since last year 
Following the deferred prosecution deal signed between the bank and Justice Department after the bank confessed its involvement in interest rate manipulation  prosecutors have always kept a close watch on the bank s activities  Per the terms of the agreement  Deutsche Bank will cooperate with the government in return for not being prosecuted 
Furthermore  the matter seems to have gained further political interest because of Trump s  300 million loan outstanding with the bank  along with connection of associates of Russian President Vladimir Putin with the money transferred from Russia 
Seeing this as an opportunity  the Democrats have raised questions on the authenticity of investigation being performed by Trump appointed leaders of the Justice Department  Moreover  they have recently requested the bank to provide reports related to the matter and details on accounts held by Trump and his family members 
The bank has recently been involved in various legal matters which significantly impacted its financials  The latest is a  7 2 billion agreement signed with the U S  Department of Justice over its sale of toxic mortgage securities Also  Deutsche Bank recently received the approval of its shareholders with regard to raising capital  This capital raise is seen by the bank as an opportunity to build its capital position

154716,376232,UBSG,SNB Ignores Critics and Keeps Negative Rates in Play,news," Bloomberg     Swiss National Bank interest rates are stuck to the floor and 2019 could see criticism of the policy growing louder  The financial sector hates it and there s trouble brewing in the real estate market 
After nine years of economic growth and the eradication of deflation risks  the arguments are building for the SNB to call time on the world s lowest rates  Switzerland s banks blame them for crimping profits  and insurers are pumping money into property to get better returns  creating a potential bubble 
According to the Swiss Bankers  Association  the effectiveness of SNB policy is diminishing as its risks increase  But as the four year anniversary of the minus 0 75 percent benchmark approaches  President Thomas Jordan s focus remains on the franc  He s concerned that tighter monetary policy could push it too high against the euro  hurting exports and the wider economy 
 It was sensible to introduce them in 2015   said Daniel Kalt  an economist at UBS in Zurich  Yet  the balance between costs and benefits is increasingly shifting against them  
The SNB set the rock bottom rate when it scrapped a currency cap that had forced it to spend massively on interventions 
With markets volatile  the currency is now at just over 1 13 per euro    far stronger than the level of almost 1 70 before the financial crisis or even the 1 20 mark at which the SNB had its cap 
Jordan said this month that shifting policy isn t necessary and could even be  counterproductive   As for difficulties for banks and pension funds  he argued that it s the low yield environment generally that s to blame 
 They should begin very quickly with the abolition of negative rates   said Kurt Schiltknecht  who was chief economist at the SNB in the 1980s before a career in commercial banking   One needs to make things that hurt the economy disappear as quickly as possible  But I don t think the SNB shares this opinion  
The record low rate initially appeared to help curb Swiss property exuberance as banks pushed up mortgage rates to compensate  But they ve also encouraged more activity in residential investment property    with prices up nearly 80 percent over the past 13 years 
Inflation Hedge
Swiss Life Holding AG  the country s biggest private property owner  has boosted its real estate exposure  primarily with acquisitions in the center of larger Swiss cities  Renato Piffaretti  its head of real estate for Switzerland  said the investments provide  constant  predictable cash flow  and a hedge against inflation 
The proportion of real estate in pension fund portfolios has risen over the past five years  according to asset manager Swisscanto  making them overly exposed to a market downturn 
Both UBS  NYSE UBS  and  Credit Suisse   SIX CSGN   Switzerland s two biggest banks  say negative rates have dragged on profits  They squeeze the margins from customer deposits and loans  according to UBS wealth management chief Martin Blessing 
Concerned about residential investment property risks  SNB officials this month urged the government to take action  But measures such as loan to value ratio restrictions may not do much because the major players aren t borrowing to buy 
According to Credit Suisse economist Claude Maurer  if the central bank is really concerned  the only solution is ending negative rates

154729,376245,UBSG,Dollar Recoups Losses  Equities Lower,opinion,"The dollar extended its recovery against a basket of other currencies on Friday  while banks dragged European shares slightly lower following underwhelming results from Swiss major UBS  NYSE UBS  
The two day recovery comes after the dollar suffered a 4 percent drop in the three weeks from Jan  3 reflecting doubts about how U S  President Donald Trump s policies will play out for the currency  particularly after both Trump and Treasury Secretary designate Steven Mnuchin hinted at concerns over its strength 
The dollar index  which measures its strength against a basket of six major currencies rose 0 2 percent to 100 54 

Trump suggested overnight he would push ahead with a 20 percent border tax on Mexico  spurring a slump on the peso and refocusing market expectations on his pro business policies which  along with healthy corporate results  helped stocks on Wall Street to fresh record highs 
Some U S  protectionism is seen as dollar positive as it may bring capital home 
 The  dollar  has experienced a powerful rebound re establishing post U S  election relationships between the performance of risk assets and U S  bond yields on the one hand and the  dollar  on the other hand   said Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS  FX strategists led by Hans Redekker  in a note to clients 
Benchmark German bonds are headed for their worst week since the aftermath of November s U S  election on Friday  as Trump s first week in office fuels expectations of inflation and growth boosting policies in the world s biggest economy 
Investor flows continue to point to a preference for so called  reflation  trades  according to the latest weekly data from Bank of America Merrill Lynch and fund tracker EPFR 
Funds investing in TIPS  which offer protection against rising inflation  high yield bonds and Japanese equities  attracted inflows over the past week  the data showed 
 But the re positioning feels grudging and flows have yet to show big asset allocation capitulation out of bonds into stocks   Bank of America Merrill Lynch strategists said 

European stocks were headed for a weekly gain of about 1 percent though were slightly lower on Friday as weakness in the banking shares weighed 
A fall in profits sent UBS shares down more than 3 percent as investors locked in some gains following a strong rally in financials stocks following the U S  election  The European banking index fell 1 2 percent 
In the UK  the FTSE was also slightly lower but outperformed other regional benchmarks supported by merger activity as leading supermarket operator Tesco  LON TSCO  snapped a smaller wholesaler  Tesco shares surged 10 percent 
In commodity markets  oil prices gave up earlier gains as rising crude output from the United States was seen offsetting efforts by OPEC and other producers to prop up the market by cutting supplies 
Trading was choppy however as volumes were lighter than average with much of Asia closed due to the start of the Lunar New Year holiday 
Brent crude futures  the international benchmark for oil prices  were trading at  55 98 per barrel  down 0 5 percent from their last close 
U S  West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures were down 0 2 percent at  53 67 a barrel ",2017-01-27,Dean Popplewell,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/dollar-recoups-losses,-equities-lower-200173808",200173808

154779,376295,UBSG,Market Dysfunction Sends Sterling Spiralling,opinion,"Another day  another fall in the value of sterling
I could ve written this line on almost any day of this week and  frankly  it s getting tiring  the pound closed lower against the dollar yesterday as fears surrounding the state of the UK s trade relationships post Brexit rose  knocking investor sentiment toward the pound  This rhetoric reached fever pitch in the wee hours this morning as thin liquidity triggered erratic and nonsensical price action that sent the pound lower by as much as 6 1   Likely prompted by a haywire algorithm or a  fat finger trade   much of those losses have since been recouped  but GBP USD is still nursing a loss of over 1  as dawn breaks over the UK 
PM May s speech has triggered a near 4  fall in the pound
Sterling s decline is now inching towards a 4  loss since Monday morning as Theresa May s EU rhetoric comes closer to resembling scorched earth policy  If the government s tactic is to play hardball and hope Brussels blinks  German chancellor Angela Merkel certainly now holds the advantage after she openly appealed to German business leaders to support her tough stance on single market access coming with the conditionality of free movement of labour 
The moves in the financial markets may no longer be making headline news in the papers  but they ll certainly be top of mind for Chancellor Hammond as he puts pen to paper to write his Autumn budget statement  Taking into account yesterday s run higher in Gilt yields and the weakness of the pound  it appears the market is conspiring to put the UK economy in as precarious a position as possible for the Chancellor to turn on the spending taps  making his plans that little bit more expensive and that little bit more difficult to finance  As Jeremy pointed out earlier in the week  there are four major factors keeping markets under pressure at the moment  fear of a withdrawal of foreign direct investment  the expectation of import price led inflation  lower availability of migrant labour and a sharp deterioration in the relationship between the City of London and their EU customers 
Many see further pain in store for UK exchange rates
This week s political focus has prompted investment banks and research houses across the globe to double down on their bets of further weakness in the pound  Both UBS  NYSE UBS  and Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  this week have reiterated their calls for renewed pressure on sterling  eyeing 1 20 in GBP USD and even a one for one exchange rate against the euro 
Nonfarm Payrolls could cement the case for a rate hike in December
Mercifully  today s session will take some of the focus away from the goings on in politics with UK trade balance  industrial and manufacturing production data due at 09 30  These are August figures and will likely reflect the surprisingly strong PMI numbers we ve seen over the past few weeks  More importantly  13 30 sees September s Nonfarm payrolls release from the US  expected to show the addition of around 170 000 jobs  Should this be beaten and the unemployment rate fall further  it ll likely cement the market s expectations of a rate hike on December 14   an outcome that s seen with a probability of almost 65  at present ",2016-10-07,Jeremy Cook,https://www.investing.com/analysis/market-dysfunction-sends-sterling-spiralling-200157642,200157642

154794,376310,UBSG,Mind your language  Markets obsess about central bank lingo,news,"By Sujata Rao LONDON  Reuters    When the U S  Federal Reserve issued a statement of 250 words after raising interest rates last month  markets focused on just one  accommodative  And it wasn t even mentioned  The omission of a word that had featured in Fed statements for years sent bond yields lower as investors interpreted it as a signal the Fed s policy stance was no longer accommodative   so rates might not go up again  for a while at least   But a week later  Fed Chairman Jerome Powell quashed the speculation saying omitting  accommodative  just meant policy was proceeding in line with its expectations  When he went on to say rates were a long way from neutral  bond yields surged to seven year highs  Welcome to the world of central bank communication  Much like ancient Greek oracles  policymakers can convey volumes with one word   even without saying it  Central bankers have long watched their language but with asset buying programs tailing off and rock bottom rates  they have recognized that giving markets the right signals about future policy   known as forward guidance   has never been more important  The Fed is not alone in giving hypersensitive markets a bum steer in recent weeks  Bond yields soared in September after European Central Bank  ECB  President Mario Draghi talked about a  vigorous  inflation rise  He too came out later to say the word he had used wasn t intended to be a policy signal  These latest market gyrations following misinterpretations of Fed and ECB comments are now intensifying debate around the heft given to such semantical nuances   and whether speaking in code risks doing more harm than good to the world s economies   If you plan to raise rates  say so  If you insist on using these quaint phrases  publish a glossary so everyone can crack the code   said Richard Barwell  a former Bank of England  BoE  economist who is now head of macro research at  BNP Paribas   PA BNPP  Asset Management  EXPECT VS INTEND Barwell pointed out that the ECB says it  intends  to reinvest maturing bonds purchased under its stimulus program but  expects  to raise interest rates   Expect vs intend  Does this imply a different level of commitment  According to the codebook  they are signaling to ECB watchers they are less committed to the guidance on rates than they are on reinvestment  But why not come out and say that   he said  Such is the concern about misinterpretation  the Bank for International Settlements  BIS   an umbrella body for the world s central banks  weighed in this month with a paper  arguing that varying interpretations of policy clues offered little benefit   and even risked inflicting economic damage  Its study of a past Fed pledge to keep rates low for a specific period found that pessimistic forecasters saw it as a signal the economic outlook was deteriorating  But optimists  who interpreted it as a promise of more stimulus  lifted growth and inflation forecasts  in turn encouraging greater spending       Our findings suggest forward guidance is most effective when observers see it as a promise of future stimulus  This supports the argument that  unless central banks can make this more explicit when explaining their policy frameworks  forward guidance may fail to stimulate economic growth  In fact  it may even deter it   the BIS said  Central bank commentary also seems to have become far more complex  In the Fed s case  post meeting statements average 360 words  but text complexity and nuance has steadily risen since the financial crisis  Reuters analysis shows    Click for an interactive version of the chart   SILENCE IS GOLDEN Central bankers have not always been so talkative   It is only 24 years since the Fed started publicly announcing interest rate changes at all  and just 20 years since its first post meeting statements  Forward guidance then emerged a decade ago after the financial crisis as a tool to direct markets at a time of near zero interest rates and complex bond buying stimulus programs  To be sure  markets were always sensitive to policy language  In 1996  former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan s bombshell description of heady stock markets as  irrational exuberance  knocked markets back sharply   But back then  it was rare to direct markets at all  It was said that the German Bundesbank s communications policy during the 1980s and 1990s was to let markets know what they were doing   just not what they would do tomorrow  So way before verbal nods and winks became the norm  investors still had to read the central bank tea leaves   Guy Miller  chief market strategist at Zurich Insurance Group  S ZURN   recalls watching Greenspan s briefcase not his lips  a document filled briefcase was seen heralding a policy change   Things have come on a long way and partly that was a function of the financial crisis  Times were desperate and one of the ways central banks were trying to help was to give markets forward guidance   Miller said  The BoE was also tight lipped  delivering one speech a year a century ago and only gained the power to change rates in 1997   Investors did seek clues though  such as the governor s facial expressions  BOE chief economist Andy Haldane recalled last year  quipping   Sterling crisis   sad face   Fast forward to 2016  and BoE communications ran to 4 5 million words  Haldane said  It hasn t necessarily improved communication with Governor Mark Carney criticized for sending mixed signals over the timing of rate rises   CODE CRACKERS The question for asset managers is how best to leverage nuances in language for profit  One way is to employ people familiar with the lingo   Aside from economists such as Barwell  prominent ex central bankers working for banks or funds include the Bundesbank s Axel Weber who chairs Swiss Bank UBS  S UBSG  and former Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher who is now at  Barclays   L BARC    That kind of profile is very good when you re trying to decode what a policymaker really means   Nick Gartside  fixed income chief investment officer at J P  Morgan Asset Management    Tech can be useful too in cracking the code  Firms such as Prattle  map language patterns for a quick analysis of statements  assigning speeches  dovish  or  hawkish  scores  According to CEO Evan Schnidman  Prattle has accurately predicted over 96 percent of monetary policy decisions in G10 countries since it started keeping records three years ago  But as central banks wind down stimulus programs  many analysts such as Miller who watched Greenspan s briefcase in the 1990s  confess they are tired of reading between the lines  
 People are more fixated  on central bankers  views  than data and to me  that s dangerous   he said ",2018-10-25,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/mind-your-language-markets-obsess-about-central-bank-lingo-1659761,1659761

154824,376340,UBSG,DOJ To Rescind HSBC s Deferred Prosecution Agreement  ,opinion,Shares of HSBC Holdings  LON HSBA  plc   NYSE HSBC   fell 1 3  following a Bloomberg report stating that the U S  prosecutors are considering a criminal charge against one of its units due to the bank s conduct on its foreign exchange desk  according to people familiar with the matter  Notably  this charge could rescind the deferred prosecution agreement  DPA   signed by the bank in 2012 Analysis of the ChargeIn Jul 2016  a group of prosecutors had brought up the fraud case against the former head of HSBC s foreign exchange cash trading in London  Mark Johnson and a former colleague Stuart Scott  per sources  These men were charged with conspiracy and wire fraud  originating from a foreign exchange transaction in 2011  in which they manipulated prices to help the bank profit  at the expense of its clients Notably  the prosecutors will be considering many factors before deciding whether to file a criminal charge against the bank in the currency case  including the severity of the conduct on the foreign exchange desk and the extent to which the bank addressed it Will The DPA Be Rescinded HSBC is currently in its probation period  In 2012  the company was fined  1 9 billion on money laundering charges  Further  as part of the settlement deal  HSBC signed the DPA agreement  which required the bank to improve its internal controls and submit it to an outside monitor over a period of five years   read more   Post completion of the current investigation  if the Justice Department finds that the bank broke the U S  law after it entered into the agreement  it can invoke a section of the deal that says HSBC would be held responsible for the conduct it admitted to in 2012  Such a flow of events could lead to a conviction in the laundering and sanctions case  thereby threatening the bank with more legal troubles Nonetheless  an important argument against charging HSBC is that the foreign exchange transaction  on which the charge is based  appears to be a one time event  and which has not been linked to a wider pattern of behavior  Also  the event had occurred prior to the 2012 agreement Moreover  the Justice Department has said that a DPA would be rescinded only after a significant misconduct  However  the prosecutors are concerned that HSBC that has barely escaped criminal prosecution and was operating under heavy monitoring could not control the principal foreign exchange traders involved in the conduct Road AheadDue to the DPA agreement  any unlawful activity carried out by HSBC after 2012 will result in a breach of the agreement  In this case  if the prosecutors determine that the bank could not properly discipline its employee s alleged misconduct  then HSBC would also be charged  The bank would then be comparable to an individual  who on his parole for a previous crime commits a new crime  In such situation  the defendant would be charged with two crimes  the new offense and the crime of violating the terms of his probation Notably  if the prosecutors in the current case and those from the 2012 settlement agree to file a criminal charge against HSBC and abandon the DPA  they will have to notify the bank and give a chance to respond  according to the terms of the settlement Moreover  because of the notoriety of the case  the decision to withdraw the DPA might eventually be appealed to the deputy attorney general  Sally Quillian Yates and Attorney General Loretta Lynch  who signed the 2012 pact  Nonetheless  the lawyers of HSBC are also likely to appeal against such decision to Caldwell  chief of the Justice Department s criminal division ConclusionCaldwell has recently broadcasted her willingness at various occasions to walk away from DPAs when the defendants violate the terms  In 2015  the Justice Department voided its DPA with the UBS Group AG   NYSE UBS    after the bank acknowledged unlawful conduct in its foreign exchange desk Hence  HSBC should start taking intensive care to maintain proper discipline along all of its business activities so as to stay away from severe regulatory probes Currently  HSBC carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  Other Stocks That Warrant a LookSome better ranked foreign bank stocks include Ita  Unibanco Holding S A    NYSE ITUB   and Grupo Financiero Galicia S A    NASDAQ GGAL    both sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see Confidential from Zacks Beyond this Analyst Blog  would you like to see Zacks  best recommendations that are not available to the public  Our Executive VP  Steve Reitmeister  knows when key trades are about to be triggered and which of our experts has the hottest hand ,2016-09-07,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/doj-to-rescind-hsbc's-deferred-prosecution-agreement-200152492,200152492

154862,376378,UBSG,Swiss Markets Tumble On Brexit,opinion,"Swiss stocks fell sharply and the franc rose in strength as news of Britain s vote to leave the European Union reverberated around the markets  The key SMI index tumbled 5 3  on opening on Friday morning before regaining some ground by midday 
Swiss banks were particularly badly hit  with Credit Suisse  SIX CSGN  seeing 11  wiped off its value in early trading  while UBS  NYSE UBS  and Julius B r suffered share price falls of nearly 9  
The euro fell to just above CHF1 06 against the franc but recovered to around CHF1 08  The British pound also lost ground against the safe haven franc in early trading  The Swiss National Bank  SNB  confirmed that it is currently active in the foreign exchange markets in an effort to keep the franc s value in check 
The strengthening franc places further pressure on Switzerland s exporters and tourism industry  which was plunged into disarray in January last year when the SNB abandoned its euro franc exchange rate peg 
On Friday the Federal Statistical Office published figures showing a 3 4  reduction  to CHF15 7 billion  in spending by foreign guests visiting Switzerland on holiday last year 
Swiss Business Community Reacts
The Swiss Business Federation  economiesuisse  reacted with concern to the Brexit news  pointing out that Britain is the fifth largest destination for Swiss exports and fourth for direct Swiss investments  The lobby group also noted that Britain s departure from the EU will complicate the already fraught relationship between Switzerland and the European bloc 
In the long run  economiesuisse fears the potential of Brexit to plunge one of Switzerland s most valuable trading partners into recession   Studies expect a recession in Britain due to declining trade and investment flows  This may last until 2020   the federation said in a statement 
Swissmem  the umbrella lobby group for machine builders  electrical engineers  precision tool makers and metal workers  said in a tweet that it expected  negative consequences  for its members from the Brexit vote 

The group expressed hopes that the inevitable period of turbulence would be short lived 
The Swiss Watch Association labelled the EU exit of its seventh largest export destination as  bad news  and called for the central bank to do its utmost to keep the franc in check 
Economic research group BAK Basel painted a depressing picture for Switzerland in light of the Brexit vote   Brexit will result in a chain reaction that will lead to erosion of the European Union   it said in a statement   This inevitably  will lead to many repercussions for Switzerland  Given the close and diverse links  between Switzerland and the EU   we can assume that a weakened Europe will be bad for Switzerland  
Bright Spots
The only bright spot of the Brexit vote for BAK Basel is the possibility that some of London s financial strengths will emigrate to Switzerland  although it believes most will go to Frankfurt or other EU financial centres 
The KOF Swiss Economic Institute at Zurich s Federal Institute of Technology said it would probably revise its economic growth prospects for Switzerland downwards from its current 1  growth forecast for 2016 and 2  for 2017 
However  KOF director Jan Egbert Sturm told the Swiss news agency SDA that he did not expect a deep recession in Switzerland   I cannot imagine that Brexit will have any dramatic effect on Switzerland   he said 
Swiss British Trade
Last year Swiss firms sent around CHF11 7 billion of exports to Britain and received some CHF6 6 billion of imported goods  without jewels or precious metals   That makes Britain the fifth largest receiver of Swiss goods and the eighth largest provider of imports to Switzerland 
If precious metals and jewellery are included to the statistics  Britain is the second largest supplier of goods to Switzerland 
Switzerland s record of investing in Britain is even more impressive  At CHF78 7 billion  2013   Britain is the third largest beneficiary of direct foreign investments  buildings and machinery  by Swiss companies  At the end of 2013  Swiss firms employed 193 700 people in Britain   the fourth largest concentration of Swiss paid jobs abroad 
By the end of 2013  British firms had invested an accumulated CHF21 3 billion in Switzerland  creating 26 800 jobs  HSBC  NYSE HSBC   Vodafone  LON VOD   BP  LON BP  and Unilever  LON ULVR  have the biggest Swiss presence of all British firms  according to the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs  Seco

06 million   down 14  year over year  The results were impacted by a 22  year over year decrease in net interest income and a 7  drop in net fee and commission income  partially offset by a 15  increase in net trading incomeThe reported quarter recorded several significant items including a gain of CHF 123 million on the sale of its investment in Visa Europe  CHF 120 million gains on sales of real estate in Switzerland  and net restructuring expenses of CHF 377 million The Swiss banking giant s results were impacted by reduced profitability in its Investment Bank and Wealth Management units  However  the quarter saw improved profitability in the Wealth Management Americas  Personal   Corporate banking and Asset Management wings Lower Expenses Lent SupportExcluding the significant items  UBS Group AG s adjusted operating income increased 3 7  from the prior year quarter to CHF 7 21 billion   7 43 billion  Adjusted operating expenses decreased 5 4  year over year to CHF 5 54 billion   5 70 billion   Expenses included provisions for litigation  regulatory and similar matters of CHF 72 million   74 2 million    relatively stable year over year  Notably  as of Jun 2016  UBS Group AG achieved net cost savings of CHF 1 4 billion and remains on track to achieve CHF 2 1 billion in net cost reductions by the end of 2017 UBS Group AG s pre tax operating profit on an adjusted basis came in at CHF 1 67 billion   1 72 billion  in the quarter  up 2 3  from the prior year quarter Business Division PerformanceWealth Management Americas division s adjusted operating profit before tax increased 27 9  from the prior year quarter to CHF 275 million   283 3 million   Notably  net new money growth in the quarter was 0 9   compared with negative 0 3  in the prior year quarter Personal   Corporate banking division s adjusted operating profit before tax was up 11 8  year over year to  CHF 463 million   476 9 million   Additionally  the Asset Management unit s adjusted operating profit improved 10 4  year over year to CHF148 million   152 4 million  in the quarter However   the company s Investment Bank unit s adjusted operating profit before tax came in at CHF 447 million   460 4 million   down 27 6  from the prior year quarter  The decline was mainly due to lower revenues in Equities business and in Corporate Client Solutions   Notably  driven the Brexit volatility at the close of the second quarter  UBS Group witnessed higher revenues from foreign exchange  rates and credit  on a year over year basis Also  the Wealth Management division s adjusted operating profit before tax declined nearly 21 2  year over year to CHF 606 million   624 2million  in the quarter  However driven by strong net inflows from Asia Pacific and Switzerland  the unit saw net new money growth of 2 6  in the quarter  up from 0 7  in the prior year quarter Corporate Center reported adjusted operating loss before tax of CHF 198 million   203 9 million  compared with a

over year to CHF 213 84 billion   221 3 billion  OutlookManagement warned that the persistent market volatility and underlying macroeconomic uncertainties  aggravated by Brexit vote  will result in continued client risk aversion and low transaction volumes and that the current scenario is unlikely to change in the near term  Notably  considering the current scenario  the company removed short term targets for annual adjusted return on tangible equity  RoTE  and adjusted cost to income ratio  However UBS reaffirmed its targeted adjusted RoTE of over 15  and targeted adjusted cost to income ratio of 60 70  to be achieved in a  normalized environment  The company also highlighted several concerns including headwinds from negative interest rates  and the strengthening of Swiss franc  particularly against euro   Further  the proposed changes to Swiss bank capital standards and global regulatory framework in Switzerland  will lead to higher capital requirements and costs  However  amid a challenging operating environment  the company remains committed to the execution of its strategies Our TakeResults do not reflect a strong quarter for UBS Group as its major units failed to exhibit growth  but we remain optimistic as the company managed to sustain profitability amid a number of headwinds witnessed in the quarter  UBS Group remains focused on building its capital levels

154868,376384,UBSG,Barclays  BCS  Agrees To  100 Million Settlement Over Interest Rate Manipulation,opinion,"On Monday  Barclays  LON BARC  PLC   NYSE BCS   agreed to pay a  100 million settlement to 44 U S  states after an investigation into manipulation of Libor  one of the most common benchmark interest rate indexes  by the firm 
Between 2005 and 2009  Barclays schemed to hide the damage of the global financial crisis through the use of false rates  This benefited their own traders while serving as extra burden to entities that had their contracts linked to those rates 
The borrowing rates of the interbank market were evaluated using the submissions of a 16 bank panel  Basically  the daily Libor rate was calculated using the middle eight submissions  and Barclays managers told their employees to submit lower than accurate rates 
In doing so  the bank appeared stronger than it actually was  since higher interest rates are generally given to those with higher risk of not paying back the amount  or in other words are in weaker standing 
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman stated that  There has to be one set of rules for everyone  no matter how rich or how powerful  and that includes big banks and other financial institutions that engage in fraud or impair the far functioning of financial markets  
Other banks that have either settled deals or are still being investigated for Libor manipulation include the Royal Bank of Scotland   TO RBS    Deutsche Bank   NYSE DB    and UBS Group   NYSE UBS    amongst others 
Barclays has seen downward earnings estimate revisions for both this and next fiscal year  Estimates for this year stand at  0 62 in earnings per share  down dramatically from the  1 26 of 60 days ago  Estimates for next year stand at  0 83 in earnings per share  down from the  1 44 estimate of 60 days ago 
The uncertainty that came with Brexit as well as the Bank of England s decision on August 4 to cut interest rates for the first time since 2009 will hurt Barclays and other U K  banks moving forward  This  coupled with the settlement and recent estimate revisions paints a dreary forecast for Barclays  immediate future

154880,376396,UBSG,Holes in Swiss property market ring mortgage alarm bells,news,"By Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi and Rupert Pretterklieber ZURICH  Reuters    Nearly four years after a 1930s telephone switchboard center was transformed into 18 industrial style loft apartments in Zurich s Wiedikon neighborhood it is still not fully occupied  With rent plus utility bills of just over 5 400 Swiss francs per month for a three bedroom apartment  the development by part of Swiss bank  Credit Suisse   S CSGN  is indicative of a real estate rush which is raising regulatory red flags  A search for yield driven by Switzerland s negative interest rates has driven investors to build up their residential property portfolios and commission new luxury complexes  But although the country s vacancy rates have hit their highest levels in more than two decades  Swiss banks have upped mortgage lending as more investors seek to cash in  This is causing alarm among Swiss authorities who warn banks could be exposed when interest rates rise from the abnormally low levels used by the central bank to rein in the Swiss franc   A real estate bubble is the biggest asset risk on the banking side   one regulatory official said   The investment property  buy to let segment is definitely overheated   Vacancies on rental apartments more than doubled in nine years and the Swiss National Bank in June suggested implementing  targeted measures  for residential investment property lending  In an indication of the dependency on low interest rates to sustain demand  UBS  S UBSG  says nearly one in five mortgage applicants in Switzerland is looking to rent the property out  With rates for ten year mortgages at below 2 percent  compared to an average of around 5 percent from 1960 to the onset of the financial crisis a decade ago  creditors and investors are exposed to the risk of not being able to refinance their loans when interest rates do rise  But with insurers Zurich  S ZURN    Swiss Life   S SLHN  and  Axa  Winterthur  along with a number of pension funds  offering 10 year rates of 1 3 to 1 4 percent developers have pressed ahead with their building bonanza  TENANTS IN DEMAND The stresses are most apparent in rural areas such as Remigen in the Aargau canton  where high end projects have failed to find tenants  developers are offering discounts and bonuses  including rent free introductory offers   There are regions where I wouldn t build anymore   said Anton Affentranger  chief executive of Implenia  S IMPN   Switzerland s largest construction firm  which converted the Swisscom building that Credit Suisse took on in Zurich   I wouldn t build out in the sticks   he added  Credit Suisse s Real Estate Switzerland group  an investment vehicle for pension funds which focuses on residential properties  saw its portfolio grow by nearly 13 percent to 7 billion francs from June 2014 to June 2017  But while its vacancy rate nearly doubled to 8 2 percent  its generated returns    although down 11 percent over a three year period    remain comparably attractive at 4 59 percent  What is worrying some property market analysts is that while rents have fallen  purchase prices have risen  posing a persistent affordability risk and bringing back memories of a late 1980s Swiss real estate bubble which triggered a damaging banking crisis in the 1990s when it burst  It now costs the equivalent of 30 7 annual rental payments to purchase a comparable home  according to UBS s second quarter real estate bubble index  the highest purchase price to rent ratio in a 36 year survey and above the previous peak of March 1989 at almost the height of the earlier real estate bubble   There will have to be a price correction in the investment business  The appetite for real estate investment is so large that it s caused large distortions   Axa s  PA AXAF  head of Swiss real estate  Ernst Schaufelberger  said    Many private  investors  are taking on a lot of debt   SLEEP EASY There are also concerns about affordability for commercial borrowers  with ratings agency Moody s saying more than half the loans granted failed banks  own self regulation tests   These tests assess whether a mortgage would remain affordable    calculated as no more than a third of a borrower s gross income or a third of net rent on investment properties    should interest rates rise to 5 percent   For residential investment property held by commercial borrowers  51 percent of loans transgressed this guideline in 2017  up from 37 percent in 2016   Moody s said   A sharp fall in house prices may result in collateral values no longer covering the value of the loans  which would imply outright losses for the bank in the event of default   The Swiss National Bank has said new rules boosting capital requirements for domestic focused banks of systemic importance should help cushion against any fallout  but there is growing concern that the government may also need to step in   All major financial crises have been precipitated by a real estate crash   the regulatory official said  adding the big question was how sharp the correction would be  While many banks agree that prices have reached a high level and that certain lenders have been over generous in granting loans  they see the worries as overblown  Switzerland s third largest bank  cooperative lender Raiffeisen  RFSHW

154881,376397,UBSG,Swiss watchdog raps Credit Suisse for anti corruption failings,news,By John Miller ZURICH  Reuters     Credit Suisse   S CSGN  failed to adequately combat money laundering in suspected corruption cases linked to soccer s ruling body FIFA and Venezuelan and Brazilian state oil companies  Switzerland s financial watchdog FINMA said on Monday  dealing a blow to the bank s reputation  Watchdog FINMA will appoint an independent auditor to oversee the bank s anti money laundering processes  but stopped short of forcing it to return any profits that it might have illegally reaped  FINMA has no authority to fine banks it supervises  Switzerland s second biggest bank behind UBS  S UBSG  also fell short of its obligations to fight corruption while managing  a significant business relationship  with a politically exposed person  the authority said on Monday  Credit Suisse said in a statement the Swiss watchdog had uncovered  legacy weaknesses   adding it has acted to bolster compliance since Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam took over from his predecessor  Brady Dougan  in March 2015  Instead of disciplining a star private banker who breached compliance regulations for years  FINMA said Credit Suisse boosted his pay   A banking source identified the manager as Patrice Lescaudron  jailed for five years in February    The identified shortcomings occurred repeatedly over a number of years  mainly before 2014   FINMA said  adding that many of the problems emerged from group subsidiary Clariden Leu AG  which was fully merged into Credit Suisse in 2012    FINMA identified deficiencies in the anti money laundering process  as well as shortcomings in the bank s control mechanisms and risk management   the authority added  The independent auditor will monitor Credit Suisse to ensure it follows through on improvements  The enforcement action against Credit Suisse emerged from FINMA s investigation into several Swiss financial institutions starting in 2015 in relation to suspected corruption involving FIFA  Brazil s Petrobras  SA PETR4  and the Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA   PDVSA UL  The shares fell 0 1 percent at 0840 GMT  in line with the benchmark Swiss Market Index  SSMI    PAST FAILINGS Thiam has been forced to manage repeated allegations of wrongdoing that Credit Suisse said preceded his arrival  including charges of foreign exchange rates rigging in Europe  a hiring corruption probe in Asia and a  1 billion graft probe involving Venezuela s state oil company   FINMA last year reprimanded Credit Suisse over its dealings with Malaysian state fund 1MDB  Singapore s central bank also fined the bank for breaching money laundering rules in the case  Analysts said the regulator s harsh tone and the instalment of a monitor could dent confidence in Credit Suisse s efforts to fix problems of the past   FINMA s statements will hardly calm things down  since it put it out there in black and white what it thinks about the quality of the bank s efforts to fight money laundering   Zuercher Kantonalbank analyst Javier Lodeiro said   Still  this enforcement action did focus on the time between 2006 and 2015    FINMA acknowledged Credit Suisse has undertaken measures since 2015 to strengthen compliance and anti money laundering protections  but said more must be done  to prove that higher risk business relationships and transactions are adequately detected  categorised  monitored and documented   Lescaudron  the Geneva based relationship manager  was found guilty of serious fraud and forgery in his handling of clients  including former Georgian Prime Minister Bidzina Ivanishvili and Russian oligarch Vitaly Malkin  over an eight year period  That case reveals weaknesses in the bank s organization and risk management  FINMA said   Instead of disciplining the client manager promptly and proportionately  the bank rewarded him with high payments and positive employee assessments   Credit Suisse said it has not been fined  ordered to hand over profits or had any curbs on its business activities  suggesting its failings were less serious than those committed by some other Swiss financial institutions  Earlier this year  FINMA ordered PKB Privatbank SA Lugano to surrender 1 3 million Swiss francs   1 35 million  in unlawfully generated profits after concluding it committed serious breaches linked to its business with Petrobras  Credit Suisse said that it has already made thousands of improvements to correct weaknesses as part of a restructuring program that Thiam began  including hiring 800 compliance specialists in the last three years ,2018-09-17,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/finma-finds-shortcomings-in-credit-suisses-antimoney-laundering-processes-1612212,1612212

loss attributable to shareholders of  968 million   1 4 billion  as compared with a loss of  459 million in the prior year quarter  Results included payment of the final Dividend Access Share  DAS  dividend of  1 193 million to the U K  Government Further  reduced net interest and non interest income was a major drag  However  contraction in adjusted operating expenses reflected prudent expense management Operating loss totaled  341 million   488 4 million  as compared with loss of  469 million in the prior year quarter  The loss resulted from restructuring charges and litigation and conduct costs along with other costs  Adjusted operating profit  excluding certain items came in at  440 million   630 2 million   down 67 5  on a year over year basis Furthermore  division wise  Personal   Business Banking  PBB   Commercial   Private Banking  CPB  and Williams   Glyn segments reported operating profit in both the reported and prior year quarter  Corporate   Institutional Banking  CIB

a loss of  172 million in the prior year quarter Notably  the divestment process of the Williams   Glyn business was in full swing  but the completion is not expected even by the end of 2017 due to some complexities in the customer and product mix of the business and the aim to form a cloned banking platform  Therefore  management is seeking alternatives for divestment Performance in DetailNet interest income inched down 2 1  on a year over year basis to  2 2 billion   3 2 billion  in the reported quarter  attributed to the winding down of Capital Resolution  Net interest margin remained stable at 2 15   as the benefit in reductions in the low yielding non core assets were offset by slight asset margin pressure and mix impacts in the core businesses Non interest income came in at  908 million   1 3 billion   down 31  year over year  The decline primarily reflected lower income by Capital Resolution due to asset disposal  deterioration in CIB and increased charges from volatile items under IFRS Operating expenses totaled  2 4 billion   3 4 billion   down 33 3  year over year  Adjusted operating expenses  excluding restructuring costs  litigation and conduct costs and write

targeting reductions of  800 million in 2016 in adjusted operating expenses  Notably  the charge of about  50 million is expected to be incurred related to the Financial Services Compensation Scheme  FSCS  implemented in second quarter 2016 Income at the PBB and CPB segments is expected to be stable in 2016 compared with 2015 as balance  sheet  growth   mainly in  mortgages  and  core  commercial

in PBB and CPB customer loans Impairments on core portfolios are expected to remain modest in 2016 Further  management expects restructuring costs to remain high in 2016  totaling over  1 billion

expect RBS  diversified business model and its sound financial position to contribute to overall growth  going forward  Though increased competition  volatility in the global economy  litigation costs

154926,376442,UBSG,China securities fee revenue expected to more than double by 2023  study,news,"HONG KONG  Reuters    Revenue from securities fees in China is expected to more than double to  103 billion in the next six years  a new report by a financial consultancy said on Wednesday  emphasizing the sector s attractiveness to foreign banks 
The growth is expected to be driven by Chinese securities firms seeking new investment and funding opportunities as well as rising cross border deal activities  consultancy Quinlan   Associates said on Wednesday 
It forecast China s total securities revenue pool to rise to 708 billion yuan   103 billion  by 2023  up from 311 billion yuan in 2017 
China s securities industry  which includes brokerage and underwriting services  has historically been dominated by domestic players  Foreign firms  which can only own minority stakes in joint ventures with Chinese companies  have struggled to gain market share 
Income from the top eight domestic Chinese brokerages was more than eight times that of the top eight joint ventures last year  according to the consultancy s analysis of data from the Securities Association of China 
However  China s vice finance minister Zhu Guangyao announced last November that foreign firms could own 51 percent of securities joint ventures  and their domestic partners did not need to be securities firms 
The rule change would allow foreign banks to benefit from the rapidly growing fee pool in China  though it is unclear when it would take effect 
 Foreign banks can t compete with the local players on price or balance sheet  but they can when it comes to creating complex products that aren t available on the mainland  and in cross border activities   said Quinlan   Associates Chief Executive Officer Ben Quinlan 
Foreign banks such as JPMorgan  N JPM   UBS  S UBSG  and Nomura  T 8604  have applied for approval to hold majority stakes in Chinese securities joint ventures 
However  little is known publicly about the status of these applications

154928,376444,UBSG,ECB hawk Weidmann sees chances dimming of succeeding Draghi,news,By Paul Carrel and Balazs Koranyi BERLIN FRANKFURT  Reuters    Germany s Jens Weidmann is seeing his prospects of becoming European Central Bank president fade  amid signs that trade issues handled in Brussels are eclipsing Berlin s concerns about securing its man to steer monetary policy  German business daily Handelsblatt reported on Wednesday that Chancellor Angela Merkel is focusing on winning the European Commission presidency for a German rather than backing Bundesbank chief Weidmann to succeed Mario Draghi  Asked by Reuters about the report  Merkel told journalists on Thursday she had taken no decision yet on who she wanted to be the next ECB president    Discussions about the personal decisions to be made in conjunction with elections to the European Parliament are now slowly starting to take place   she told a news conference during a visit to Georgia   That means no decisions at all have been taken and the post of European Central Bank chief is to be filled much later  so I can t confirm any wishes I have  Rather  we will wait for the developments and then see how the German positions develop   She might have her work cut out to secure either the ECB or the Commission job for a German candidate   Both jobs come up next year  Weidmann has a strong central banking profile but has antagonized much of southern Europe  Securing the Commission post would also not be easy  with many EU states wary of a German taking charge in Brussels  The Bundesbank and a German government spokesman declined to comment on the Handelsblatt report  and sources close to Merkel have told Reuters it was too soon to determine Germany s priorities for the European posts  However  the European Commission role is crucial in leading the EU s trade policy  a critical area for Germany  Its export orientated economy is starting to feel the impact of increasing U S  protectionism  even if current Commission head Jean Claude Juncker last month achieved some success in scaling back U S  President Donald Trump s trade threats  By contrast  the ECB has already indicated it wants to exit the unprecedented package of monetary stimulus deployed by Draghi   and resisted by Weidmann   to fight the euro zone crisis  The next ECB president will simply manage that exit  guided by economic data  and may not get the opportunity to employ more dynamic policies   It would make more sense to have a German as the head of the Commission given Merkel s focus on issues like immigration  security  infrastructure and EU budget   Frederik Ducrozet  an economist at wealth manager Pictet in Geneva  Dirk Schumacher  an economist at French investment bank Natixis in Frankfurt  said that  in the more political commission job   there is more room for maneuver  especially if you have an active person    The price for Weidmann at the ECB was high     so I m not surprised there has been a shift of focus in Berlin   he added  But even if she trains her sights fully on the Commission post  Merkel may struggle to secure it for Germany as some other states are sure to have reservations about the bloc s biggest country taking the influential role  The outcome of the jobs merry go round will also likely be influenced by European Parliament elections in May  and which group French President Emmanuel Macron s En Marche movement joins  The two largest groups in the Parliament usually decide between them who gets the top Commission job  But they risk not winning a combined majority this time  meaning at least one other group may have to be involved in any deal  HORSE TRADING Weidmann  as the most hawkish member of the ECB s policymaking Governing Council  is deeply unpopular in those parts of the euro zone hit hardest by the crisis that Draghi sought to fight with the German resisting him  Speaking in Berlin on Thursday  Weidmann made no reference to the ECB succession but kept up his push for the central bank to unwind its stimulus  His approach to monetary policy is shaped by  Ordnungspolitik   the Bundesbank dogma in which the role of a totally independent central bank is solely to ensure stable prices  not to promote economic growth and employment or help governments with fiscal problems  This put him at odds with Draghi  who   at the height of the euro zone crisis   vowed to do  whatever it takes  to save the single currency before embarking on increasingly ambitious policy steps  culminating in purchases of government bonds  Weidmann s predecessor as Bundesbank chief  Axel Weber  also grew frustrated with ECB policy at the outset of the euro zone crisis and bowed out of his race with Draghi for the top job  instead becoming UBS  S UBSG  chairman  If Merkel gives up on the ECB job  she is likely to have three options  opt for a candidate who toes the German policy line  trade the position with France in exchange for their support elsewhere or opt for a candidate from a small country  Highly qualified candidates who may be considered German proxies could include Dutch central bank chief Klaas Knot or Estonia s Ardo Hansson  both among the more conservative members of the Governing Council  Although policy is set collectively  Governing Councils have always backed their president to maintain unity  Most decisions are taken with a relative consensus  so Weidmann s persistent opposition ruffled feathers  While it is not mandatory to pick one of the 19 euro zone governors to succeed Draghi  EU leaders have always picked an ECB chief from among them ,2018-08-23,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/ecb-hawk-weidmann-sees-chances-dim-of-succeeding-draghi-1584468,1584468

154947,376463,UBSG,Gold And The Dow  Options Expiry,opinion,"As I write this update  US stock markets have already given up all of yesterday s gains this morning  To make an already bad situation worse   Quadruple Witching Hour  occurs on Friday 
Individual stock options  stock futures  stock indexes and stock index futures all expire then  and this expiry could ignite a new wave of panic selling 

The volume on this daily chart of the Dow is very bearish  It s surging on declines  while drying up on rallies 

A closer look at this morning s action  That s the hourly bars chart  using December futures  There s a head and shoulders top pattern in play 
The Fed s QE program fostered the growth of government size and power  while causing banks to hoard capital  rather than loaning it out to businesses 
QE also caused US companies to borrow money and engage in stock buybacks  This created phoney PE ratios  and made the market look less overvalued than it was  and is 
With low rates  banks have no incentive to make loans  and government has massive incentive to borrow money and expand itself  The bottom line  The stock market and the government are not the US economy  but QE and low rates make it appear that they are 
In my professional opinion  the Western gold community needs to stop cheering for deflationary QE and deflationary rate cuts  and start thanking Janet Yellen for her taper  and for her upcoming rate hikes 
Those rate hikes will increase money supply velocity  cause inflation  and significantly boost gold prices 

UBS  NYSE UBS  bank economists just presented a highly rational view of gold to their clients  Their statements feel  solid   and that s appealing to institutional investors 
UBS bank can move significant client risk capital with their research reports  and this one is great news for gold price enthusiasts around the world 
Also  I expect the new and fully transparent PBOC gold buy program to become a  game changer  for most gold market fundamentalists in the coming months  When bank economists begin focusing on the PBOC buying  that will bring even more institutional money into gold 

Gold stocks tend to lead gold  and this daily chart suggests that Market Vectors Gold Miners  NYSE GDX  is poised to leap upwards  above a key downtrend line 
A GDX breakout would likely usher in an acceleration of the current gold market rally  and my key 14 7 7 series Stochastics oscillator suggests that the breakout will happen 

When will the breakout happen  The next COMEX gold option expiry date is Thursday 
Gold has a tendency to lose upside momentum in front of expiry days  and then rally after the options expire 

That s the daily chart for gold  While the technical picture looks solid  a decline to the minor support zone at  1115    1125 ahead of options expiry day is likely 
From there  I expect the US dollar to run into serious trouble against the yen  and create a surge of FOREX liquidity into both the yen and gold 

That s the daily chart of the dollar versus the yen  The uptrend line is broken  my Stochastics oscillator is verging on a sell signal  and there s a nasty symmetrical triangle pattern in play  The implications for the dollar are clearly bearish  and that s good news for gold 
Janet Yellen spoke several months ago about the  waning effects of the rising dollar  and my technical analysis suggests her outlook
was very timely 

Another look at that key dollar versus yen chart  There s a double top pattern in play  with major implications for downside price action in the dollar 

President Xi Jinping looks and acts like a  Golden Terminator   and I want to remind the Western gold community that a large part of his reform include the internationalization of the yuan 
On that note  please click here now  This key policy paper from PBOC official Dr  Yao Yudong is arguably the most important paper published about central banking and gold in decades  Gold is clearly going to play a very transparent and official role in the reformation of China s currency  and ultimately in the entire global financial system 
Like an arrow shot by a  bull era  archer  Dr  Yudong s roadmap for gold and the yuan can t be taken back  Both China and India want to see global gold price discovery less pinned to things like Thursday s COMEX option expiry  and more to gold jewellery demand versus mine supply  They re taking the steps to make this  reformation  of the world s ultimate asset a wonderful reality  Good times await the Western gold community in the coming years  and the dollar versus yen chart suggests the good times may begin  in just a few days 
Thanks 
Cheers

154948,376464,UBSG,What Will Happen To Silver And Gold ,opinion,"It has been a while since I have written anything close to being considered a  rant   Instead  using cool and common sense logic of connecting dots for readers has been my method of choice  Over just the last several weeks  the  obviousness  of what is coming has been astounding  I can only wonder why the  inevitable  has not yet been seen by the masses  Though Mark Dice giving the choice of a candy bar or a 10 ounce silver bar    only to run out of candy may be the answer 
The tone has definitely changed in the markets  nearly ALL markets  Maybe it is because of the things I wrote about recently  central bank s loss of credibility or U S  power and strength being questioned not only in the Middle East and elsewhere  Mainstream media who barraged the gold market with hit pieces and laughed at anyone not in equities only two months back have had to change their tone dramatically     because they had some explaining to do 
For brevity let s just look at the gold and silver markets  While recently talking to Jim Sinclair  he said the price of gold is like someone walking up to you in a clown suit and wondering why you thought something might be wrong  I ask you this  what do you suppose will happen with silver and gold after UBS Group AG  N UBS  becomes the state s witness in Switzerland s gold rigging investigation  Before going any further  doesn t this just confirm that us  conspiracy whackos  or  GIAMATTs   gold is manipulated all the time  according to the Norcini s Gartman s Christian s and Casey s of the world    were correct  Are we to believe gold and silver are THE only markets in the world that are not manipulated  Only an idiot or the disingenuous could believe this 
It is most obviously clear the world needs to REFLATE  Not just part of the world  the entire world    which includes China as their bubble has burst  Zerohedge remarked yesterday  if China is indeed set to reflate at all costs  watch as a few hundred million Chinese drop their infatuation with the housing and stock bubbles  and go back to the one asset class that throughout history has been the best defense for currency devaluation and runaway inflation   I ask  what do you suppose will happen to gold and silver 
As for the crazy  gold bugs   what the heck has happened to them  They were on the right track and now become scared and petrified    just at the very moment they will need their insurance  The brain washing has worked  even the once sane are questioning their sanity  As Jim has said   this is most probably the bull market in gold you never sell     yet hard money people are in a panic 
Let me explain the above and also answer the question in the title  Simply put  gold and silver will ultimately go  no offer   The laughable inventories at COMEX and LBMA will be gobbled up and erased within mere minutes  Gold will go into hiding and not be offered at any dollar price   for  a time  but I ll get to this shortly  What  price  will gold reach in dollars  This is a question no one can answer because we have no idea how many new dollars will be created by the Fed to battle the financial monster of their own making  We also have no idea if even one ounce remains in Ft  Knox  Is the number  5 000   10 000   50 000  When literally  100 s of trillion in debt and over  1 quadrillion in derivatives come down  and they mathematically will   they will seek the safe haven of  cash    Cash  without liability that is  The above ground gold stock is only about  5 trillion  what do you suppose will happen when several  100 trillion sets their sight on the safety of real money  The number of  50 000 may be off by a zero or two 
As for Jim s comment about this rally being the one you never sell  I d like to clean this up a bit   Never  is a very long time and one should  never say never   What he meant to say is this  this coming rally will be the one you NEVER sell for dollars  euros  yen  pounds or maybe even yuan  It will be foolish to  sell  your gold for a fiat currency    ANY fiat currency  I believe when the system breaks and gold does go into hiding  it will not reappear for sale until new and credible currencies are issued  The mindset will change and holders of gold will only be coaxed to sell for something they can have confidence in  It is this thought process which will be at the center of asset repricings as we re set 
Let me finish with this  I and many others have been called  fearmongers  for writing about the coming collapse   We   those who said these same things in 2007 and 2008 were branded fearmongers then also  The thing is this  nothing has changed  nothing has been fixed and in fact the world is more in debt and further leveraged than it was back then  This is 2008 all over again only worse and this time    the global central banks and sovereign treasuries cannot ride in and fix anything because they have already blown their credibility 
We live in a world that is financially foundationed by the currency of a bankrupt issuer who prints this money to purchase their own bonds  Several  100 trillion of debt and over  1 quadrillion in derivatives rely on this currency for their  value and pricing   It amazes me how so many people who once knew  what  exactly they owned  now don t even have a clue because of the psy ops so well orchestrated  This is for ALL THE MARBLES and THE MOST IMPORTANT CROSSROADS IN MODERN DAY HISTORY  Please dig deep for your own common sense and logic    your financial life depends on it ",2015-10-14,Bill Holter,https://www.investing.com/analysis/what-will-happen-to-silver-and-gold-268137,268137

Low and behold  price did indeed break below  25 which I noted in my December 11  2015 post titled   I showed again not only how broken the long term chart was  but how DB had grossly underperformed relative to its financial peers  re posted here  


Things went from bad to worse for the big German bank as it has plunged 40  since my December post and now sits in the low  15s  This is remarkable given the size of the bank  Remember  it s not only Germany s largest bank  by a mile   but it also has nearly  55 Trillion in total derivative exposure  To put that in context  the entire German GDP is approximately  3 0 Trillion  Long story short  here s an updated monthly chart of DB with some support and resistance lines thrown in  That MACD is just atrocious 

ZeroHedge has been all over the Deutsche Bank story as well  In   they again compared DB s price action to that of Lehman Brother s from 2007 2008 right before they went under  It s a compelling chart and worth noting the similarities 

Getting on to the point of this post  I want to show you that while all eyes are on Deutsche Bank  there s another massive European bank that s in exactly the same death spiral as DB  It hasn t received nearly the same amount of press  but the charts are nearly identical  That bank is Credit Suisse  SIX CSGN    the Swiss bank with a  26 Billion market cap  negative earnings and over a  1 trillion  Does this look chart remind you of anything 

While Credit Suisse isn t as  systemically risky  as DB  it s still a huge bank  the second largest in Switzerland in fact   only behind UBS  NYSE UBS  in terms of assets 
OK  the chart looks terrible  so what  Well  for one thing  when two of Europe s largest banks are trading at or near 20 year lows while equity markets are just a stone s throw from all time highs  something must be seriously wrong  I have a feeling there are major problems under the surface that smart money has already identified but the companies have yet to announce publicly  What else could account for such poor price performance  These banks are easily  too big to fail  so they will have an implicit central bank backstop   and yet they both still languish  I think we ll soon find out what kind of skeletons are hiding in the closet  but  unfortunately  by that time it will be too late ",2016-04-10,Tim Knight,https://www.investing.com/analysis/deutsche-bank-isn’t-the-only-sick-mega-bank-200124511,200124511

154959,376475,UBSG,Worsening trade row deepens chill felt by Chinese dealmakers seeking to do U S  takeovers,news,"By Kane Wu
HONG KONG  Reuters    The rapidly deteriorating trade and investment relationship between Washington and Beijing is sending a further chill through Chinese dealmakers who have already seen the number of Chinese acquisitions of American assets take a big hit 
So far this year  Chinese companies have spent just  1 6 billion on U S  assets  down almost 80 per cent from the year earlier period  according to Thomson Reuters data  By contrast the amount China has spent on European assets has risen 39 per cent from last year to  45 1 billion 
 We are now focusing on Europe bound deals and having U S  deals on hold  The trade war between China and U S   if not short term  will be a mid term thing and will take some time to conclude   said Lin Feng  founder and CEO of Chinese investment and advisory firm DealGlobe 
 Opportunities in the U S  will be more small investments  or joint ventures in China  It will definitely hurt significant minority stake acquisitions  but on the other hand it may help targets in Europe and Israel   he added 
In 2016  which stands as the record for Chinese cross border dealmaking  China acquired U S assets worth  62 6 billion and spent  88 4 billion on European assets 
Since then  China s imposition of capital controls and in particular a regulatory crackdown on some of its most acquisitive companies  such as HNA Group  HNAIRC UL   Dalian Wanda Group Co and Anbang Insurance Group  ANBANG UL   have badly dented Chinese investment flows heading for American shores 
FURTHER DETERRENT
The rejection by Washington of some major deals on national security grounds have only acted as a further deterrent to bankers and the Chinese companies they advise 
And this week  Washington has been signaling there will be tougher restrictions on Chinese investment  especially in sensitive areas of the economy  such as technology 
On Tuesday  the U S  House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed a bill to tighten foreign investment rules  spurred by bipartisan concerns about Chinese attempts to acquire sophisticated U S  technology 
Then on Friday  the Trump administration is due to issue to proposed new restrictions on foreign investment in U S  technology companies 
And there is also the escalating tit fot tat trade dispute  in which the United States has threatened to impose duties on up to  450 billion of Chinese imports  with the first  34 billion portion set to go into effect next month 
MORE HOSTILE Since U S  President Donald Trump took office early last year  dealmakers have steadily become accustomed to a more hostile U S environment 
Headline deals blocked by Washington in recent months included  notably  the  1 2 billion acquisition of Moneygram International  O MGI  by China s Ant Financial  ANTFIN UL  in January  Delays in gaining approval led to the abandonment of a plan for HNA to buy a  200 million stake in Skybridge Capital LLC  a hedge fund founded by Trump s former aide Anthony Scaramucci 
Other scrapped deals have ranged from a  25 million bid for a stake in the Chicago Stock Exchange  which was blocked by the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission  to a  16 5 million offer for a U S  pig breeder
The door is not entirely closed  though  This month the U S  approved the  2 7 billion takeover of U S  insurer Genworth Financial  N GNW  by China Oceanwide Holdings Group  OWREAC UL    a deal first struck in October 2016 
And dealmakers remain hopeful that any easing in the current tensions could boost China U S  deal volumes once more 
 This may not be the best timing  When the trade war is over  people will come back   said Samson Lo  head of Asia M A at UBS  S UBSG    Investors will continue to seek to identify attractive assets in the U S  
A senior executive with a Hong Kong based investment firm confirmed he was still looking at U S  deals  The new U S  measures  will definitely impact future deals and curb China s enthusiasm   he said   but we are still engaged in conversations  
Another executive at the private equity arm of a Chinese state bank said the firm is also still actively studying U S  deals 
 We are trying to see how we can participate   she said   Maybe we will just go for a very small stake  
Still  investments in technology have become a whole front in their own right in what some bankers consider a  cold war  for cross border deals in the sector 
Reuters reported this week that China has begun downplaying Made in China 2025   a key policy designed  among other things  to back overseas investment in key sectors  but which had provoked alarm in the West 
 Many of our tech clients understand the prospects  They are all cautious and will not pursue big investments at this point in time   said one senior Hong Kong based investment banker  Chinese investors have announced just five U S  technology company acquisitions so far this year  totaling just  278 million  Thomson Reuters data shows   the lowest figure in five years 
Mind you  Joseph Gallagher  head of Asia Pacific M A at  Credit Suisse   SIX CSGN   CSAG UL   noted that issues around tech deals were not only a U S  China issue as European governments are also wary of China getting hold of key technology 

 Europe is becoming more difficult for Chinese acquisitions as well   he said    If the tech cold war went away  there would be significant tech M A activity  but that s not likely to happen  ",2018-06-27,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/worsening-trade-row-deepens-chill-felt-by-chinese-dealmakers-seeking-to-do-us-takeovers-1509042,1509042

154978,376494,UBSG,The Gold Cartel And  3 500 Gold ,opinion,"In a recent interview   predicted that a tipping point is near that will end the Gold Cartel s suppression of gold and silver prices  leading to  3 500 gold and  100 silver 

Greg Hunter of USA Watchdog com interviewed Murphy  who has extensive hedge fund experience  including with Bridgewater  one of the largest hedge funds in the world 

The US Justice Department recently granted UBS  NYSE UBS  immunity in a criminal investigation of  manipulation of  or fraud in  the gold and silver markets 

Murphy said manipulation has been found in  the energy market  the mortgage market  the interest rate market  the currency market   but  probably the biggest of all is what they re doing in the gold and silver markets  

Why is gold being manipulated 

 Gold is looked at as a barometer of US financial market health   Murphy said   When gold goes up sharply it s always bad for the bankers and the politicians in power  So many years ago they decided they were going to keep the gold price under control as much as they could  

Murphy explained that in 1994  Allan Greenspan and Will McDonough of the New York Fed joined the BIS  Bank for International Settlements   This was prohibited under US law at the time  And that was at about the same time that Robert Rubin  the Treasury Secretary who came from Goldman Sachs  started leasing gold to suppress the gold price as a foundation of the strong dollar policy   The essence of it was to rig the gold price because it affects so many markets  like the dollar  like the bond market  and it s become a bigger and bigger deal  The more they suppressed it  the more they re getting themselves in bigtime trouble because they are going to run out of physical gold and silver as time goes by  and the market will go bonkers  

Murphy calls the manipulators the Gold Cartel  made up of the Fed  the Treasury  the big banks  the BIS  and other central banks  He said   They keep going through the supply of central bank gold to keep the price down  At some point it s going to hit a tipping point  the same with silver  and the thing is going to go crazy  

Murphy said that if gold had just kept pace with inflation   it would be double what it is today  That s how artificially low the price of gold is today  and so is silver  And once they lose control of silver  it ll go from  22 to  100 very fast  It s astounding what they ve been able to do  and they re very good at it  

 Complex derivatives have aided them in their schemes   Murphy said  but  They re afraid that when the gold market convulses it s going to set off a derivatives nightmare in the interest rate markets and so on   with  one default after another  like 2008   Because derivatives have exploded  something like  250 trillion  they don t know what the outcome could be if they start getting this kind of reaction  So they are maniacal in trying to keep the price of silver and gold aligned  

In relation to the current investigation  Murphy said   I am so skeptical after all these years  and it s a question of where they go with this  If they are just talking about the gold fix itself big deal  The ramification of how they are interfering with the markets all the time is the real issue  Why are they doing this now  Well  probably because it is so obvious  and they been doing it in so many other markets they feel compelled to do something        This is going to effect a lot of people  if I am correct  when this market blows up  Maybe they see something coming with allocated accounts and the gold isn t there        They know it s coming  and maybe they are trying to preempt something here so they don t look so bad  

With the massive printing of money and low interest rates  gold and silver should go up  Art  real estate  and the stock market all are going up  yet gold and silver are not   It makes no sense   Murphy said   unless you know what GATA knows  As frustrating as it is to stay with it  these markets will explode  This can t go on too much longer  

Murphy said that gold should be  3 500 and silver  100  When gold hit  1 900  he said  the cartel got more aggressive  When they start to lose control next time  the move up will be much faster than in the past  although  We don t know when that tipping point will hit   He did predict  however  that  When they lose control of silver  that will be the tipping point  then gold will follow

155018,376534,UBSG,HK regulator fines Citi  7 million for failings as Real Gold IPO sponsor,news,"By Alun John
HONG KONG  Reuters    Hong Kong s securities regulator said it had fined  Citigroup  s Asian business HK 57 million   7 26 million  for failings related to its discharge of duties as sponsor of the 2009 initial public offering  IPO  of Real Gold Mining Ltd  
The disciplinary action is the second in what is expected to be a series of measures by the Securities and Futures Commission  SFC  against banks for misconduct when sponsoring IPOs in the Asian financial hub 
The SFC said on Thursday that Citigroup  NYSE C  Global Markets Asia had failed to conduct adequate and reasonable due diligence on Real Gold s customers 
It also failed to properly supervise its staff when carrying out the sponsor work on the listing application  the SFC said 
The due diligence on Real Gold s customers was done over the telephone by the most junior members of Citi s transaction team with little supervision  using phone numbers provided by the miner  without independently verifying customers  identities and details 
Trading in Real Gold s shares has been suspended since 2011 
Citi said in a statement the resolution of the issue did not involve any license suspension and  does not place any constraints on Citi s business activities or on any individual in Hong Kong or elsewhere  
It added   Citi cooperated fully with the SFC s investigation and has already taken appropriate action to ensure that it meets its legal and regulatory obligations at all times  
In March  the SFC said it had found serious deficiencies in the work of several IPO sponsors from its review of new listings between 2013 and 2017 
The regulator had issued proceedings against eight IPO sponsors  its enforcement director  Tom Atkinson  said that month 
A few days earlier  UBS  S UBSG  said in its annual report the SFC had blocked it from sponsoring initial public offerings for 18 months  adding it planned to appeal against the decision ",2018-05-17,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/hk-regulator-fines-citi-7-million-for-failings-as-real-gold-ipo-sponsor-1451349,1451349

155056,376572,UBSG,Barclays board may be a step too far for activist Bramson,news,"By Sinead Cruise and Simon Jessop LONDON  Reuters    Major  Barclays   L BARC  shareholders will baulk at any bid by activist Edward Bramson to gain a seat on the bank s board  despite giving their cautious backing to the biggest bet of his career  Bramson s 5 percent shareholding  revealed last month  was broadly cheered by investors as pressure mounts on Barclays to fix low returns at its investment bank  the lender s biggest profit engine before the financial crisis  But there is speculation that Bramson  a turnaround expert   famed for leading corporate shake ups from within   might push for a boardroom makeover at Barclays  annual shareholder meeting on May 1 as part of a plan to boost its depressed stock  Bramson  together with Stephen Welker  co managing director of investment vehicle Sherborne Investors  has pursued 10 activist campaigns since 2003  six of which involved direct engagement with the companies  boards  according to filings  All six of the campaigns eventually saw principals of Sherborne Investors join those boards  But several shareholders in the British bank said any agitation for a Barclays board seat would be inappropriate given that so little is known about Bramson s aims  forcing him to tackle Barclays as an outsider   I can t think of any particular reason to want him on the board with a 5 percent stake   James Mahon  chief executive and chief investment officer at Church House Investments  said   I know it s forever getting bad press  but actually I think  Barclays management  are doing the right things now and I m not quite sure what Bramson is going to bring to it   he added  Sherborne Investors C  the investment vehicle which owns the 5 percent stake  has until April 24 to make any statement to shareholders that might affect the tone of the AGM or prompt a management response   Bramson has until 48 hours before the May 1 meeting to call for an amendment to any resolution already proposed and could requisition a special shareholder meeting  EGM  at any time  A spokesman for Sherborne declined to comment  Barclays declined to comment  LONDON VISIT Industry sources said New York based Bramson had visited London in recent weeks to reconnect with Sherborne shareholders but details on his Barclays plans remain sparse  Some shareholders say Bramson is most likely to target perceived structural and operational weaknesses in Barclays International  where capital is shared between the successful corporate lending  credit cards and payments businesses and the investment bank   You d think it was something to do with the investment bank as it s the nettle to be grasped  The trouble is  a lot of the value that s created goes to the staff   one investor told Reuters  highlighting the issue of staff costs that Bramson might have in his sights   I don t believe a shareholding of 5 percent merits a position on the board in a company as large and as complex as this   the investor  who did not want to be named  added  Some question whether Bramson s strategy would be materially different from the bank s own drive to boost performance   I think management are doing quite a good job   Steve Magill  Head of European Value at UBS Asset Management  S UBSG  told Reuters    Barclays Chief Executive  Jes Staley and his predecessors have done a lot of work and the company is in much better shape than it was   Magill said  adding that he would need more information on Bramson s agenda before backing any move to join the board  Neverthless  Bramson s track record in forcing companies to deliver greater shareholder value has given investors grounds for optimism  According to filings  Sherborne made an average 166 percent total return for unaffiliated shareholders in four of its UK targets   4imprint  L FOUR   Elementis  L ELM    Spirent  Communications  L SPT  and F C  now BMO Global Asset Management  LOW PROFILE Bramson s low profile approach has unsettled some longer term investors  who say greater transparency is important for minimizing the potential for market rumors  which could distract management and destabilize the shares  One top 50 investor said any Bramson move to trim capital employed in the investment bank would hit revenues and raise costs at arguably the wrong point in the cycle  It could even need a new CEO and chairman to push the plans through   For this reason we wouldn t  I suspect  support Bramson going on the board   he said  speaking on condition of anonymity  To date  Sherborne has had one meeting with Barclays  Company Secretary and the head of investor relations after the bank s results in February  but is yet to meet Staley or Chairman John McFarlane  two sources familiar with the matter said   We are all sitting a little bit in the dark until he s a bit more vocal   said a top 20 investor  who would also resist a push for a board seat with such a small shareholding   For me it s more a point of principle   Barclays is approaching the end of a multi year revamp  including the sale of billions of pounds of assets and the settlement of almost all its historic misconduct charges  The arrival of rainmakers like Tim Throsby at Barclays and a focus on key businesses like bond  stock and currency trading and M A advisory has put the investment bank on track to deliver higher returns by the next financial year  The bank has also restored its dividend and pledged to consider share buybacks after settling a U S  probe into the bank s alleged misselling of mortgage backed bonds  Barclays shares are up 5 3 percent in the year to date  but are down 0 5 percent since Sherborne s stake became public on March 19  Some industry sources say this reflects scepticism that Bramson can achieve anything more than holding management to account for their restructuring efforts  With the bank s makeover mostly complete  and a profit boosting change in global interest rates imminent  Mahon said Bramson was just  pushing on an open door    Because we ve all hated the banks for so long  one has rather lost sight of the fact that if rates go up  banks will benefit   Mahon said  
 So I think that he has probably  quite shrewdly  timed it rather well  I m not sure it s much more subtle than that  ",2018-04-19,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/barclays-board-may-be-a-step-too-far-for-activist-bramson-1402968,1402968

155197,376713,UBSG,China widens foreign access to its giant financial sector,news,"BEIJING  Reuters    China will raise foreign ownership limits in financial firms in a step granting access to a tantalizing multi trillion dollar financial services market  as the world s second biggest economy seeks to position itself as a major global finance hub  The move  announced on Friday by vice finance minister Zhu Guangyao  comes a day after U S  President Donald Trump reiterated calls for better access to Chinese markets in meetings with Chinese President Xi Jinping  Xi is driving broad economic reforms by opening up China s capital markets  internationalizing the yuan currency  and seeking technical know how through the pursuit of massive inbound and outbound investments   The latest changes include raising the limit on foreign ownership in joint venture firms involved in the futures  securities and funds markets to 51 percent from the current 49 percent   They will take effect immediately following the drafting of specific related rules  Zhu told a news conference  adding China is  formulating a timetable and roadmap for financial sector reform and opening up   The foreign business community gave a cautious welcome to the news    Financial services further opening definitely has been high on our list   said Ken Jarrett  President of American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai   It s a step in the right direction  We ll have to see the detailed rules  In China you always have to pay attention to the fine print to see how quickly it moves  but to finally ease up on the cap is something that is welcome   The plan to ease ownership restrictions comes as Beijing faces mounting pressure from Western governments and business lobbies to remove investment barriers and onerous regulations that restrict overseas companies  operations in its markets  During his trip to Beijing this week  Trump said that trade between the two nations was unfair  and called for greater market access for U S  companies   We really have to look at access  forced technology transfer  and the theft of intellectual property  which just  by and of itself  is costing the United States and its companies at least  300 billion a year   Trump said   Both the United States and China will have a more prosperous future if we can achieve a level economic playing field  Right now  unfortunately  it is a very one sided and unfair one   CHANNELING FOREIGN MONEY Reuters reported on Tuesday that China planned to allow global banks to take a stake of up to 51 percent in their onshore securities ventures for the first time and tie up with local non financial firms  China has been sluggish to give foreign players more access to its financial sector  but has promised to quicken the pace as foreign investment into Asia s economic powerhouse slows   It has implemented strict capital controls to contain capital outflows  while opening up new channels for foreign money to come into the domestic markets  Foreign financial firms are still small players in the financial sector  and the sheer size of the market is a big lure for overseas players   Western investment banks operating through joint ventures with local partners in China have struggled to make much headway in the last decade  with many of them loss making as they struggle to win business against much larger local rivals  A Reuters survey of data from China s Securities Association in 2014 found that the average sino foreign JV lost 21 million yuan a year over the prior 10 years  However  several have said they would be keen to invest more in China and do more broking and investment banking if they had full control over their joint ventures  UBS  S UBSG   which holds a 25 percent interest in domestic firm UBS Securities Co Ltd  said the changes on Friday were an important step in further opening up China s financial sector   China is a key market for UBS and  as indicated previously  we continue to work towards increasing our stake in UBS Securities Co Ltd   said Eugene Qian  Chairman of UBS China Strategy Board and a member of the Asia Pacific Executive Committee   Morgan Stanley   N MS   which earlier this year increased its stake in joint venture Morgan Stanley Huaxin Securities from 33 percent to the then upper limit of 49 percent  said the reforms would create new momentum for the finance industry in China   Morgan Stanley is committed to growing our businesses in China   said a spokesman for the firm  TOO LITTLE TOO LATE  Some industry watchers said the changes are too little too late    This looks good  but in reality it is pretty small and it is too late   said Keith Pogson  head of the Asia financial services team at EY   If you are an international investment bank  you will be there for the sake of your global franchise and having it as part of your network  not because you think you will make much money in China   All the same  markets reacted positively to the news  with insurers and futures related firms rallying strongly   New China Life Insurance  SS 601336  jumped nearly 6 percent after the announcement  while Ping An Insurance  HK 2318   SS 601318  advanced more than 4 percent and  China Pacific  Insurance Group  SS 601601  rose over 3 percent   China will drop foreign ownership restrictions on local banks and asset management companies  Zhu said  Full foreign ownership of local firms involved in the futures  securities and funds markets will not be permitted until after three years  while full overseas ownership of insurance firms will

155199,376715,UBSG,Few banks seen queuing for China s red carpet invite,news,"By Sumeet Chatterjee HONG KONG  Reuters    China stunned the finance world last week when it unveiled plans to allow foreign control of its financial institutions  Few bankers thought their long held dream of better access to the world s largest banking market was within reach  The likelihood  however  is that even fewer will rush to take advantage of that opening  In theory  foreign banks will be allowed to take larger stakes in their Chinese commercial peers   currently capped at 20 percent   while investment banks will be able to take control of their securities joint ventures  In practice  a combination of well entrenched local companies and an opaque regulatory regime means global banks will move only very cautiously to exploit the new rules  bankers and lawyers said  Besides its stringent ownership limits  China has for decades carefully controlled the range of activities open to foreign banks in an effort to protect domestic players  they say  and few expect that to change soon   Lifting shareholding limits is just one part of the problem  the bigger concern is whether the foreigners will get a level playing field in the country   said a Beijing based lawyer  who works with Chinese banking and securities regulators   The global financial industry has changed a lot in the last few years and there s a lot more scrutiny happening on capital allocation  compliance and risks   he said  he said referring to bank managements   The impact of this move would have been very different four  five years ago   Before the 2008 global financial crisis  many western banks took stakes in Chinese peers  But most of the banks were forced to sell them after the crisis as global regulators tightened capital standards   The banks also found that their investments did not give them the solid foothold they had hoped for in China  Tighter capital regulations are also likely to curb interest this time around by making already costly acquisitions even tougher  Since the global financial crisis   most foreign banks have refocused on home markets  serving key customers overseas and  for some  had to repair balance sheets   said Paul McSheaffrey  head of banking at KPMG  With a 19 percent equity holding in Bank of Communications  SS 601328   HSBC  L HSBA   is one of the few global banks to still hold a substantial stake in a Chinese bank  China s banking system has also grown rapidly  along with the Chinese economy in the last few years  Ten years ago  foreign lenders held 2 4 percent of the country s banking assets  according to KPMG   In spite of those foreign held assets growing at 20 percent a year for the past decade  today foreigners hold just 1 4 percent of what has become a 181 7 trillion yuan   27 40 trillion  market   Foreign entrants also face a banking market dominated by China s big five state backed lenders who themselves face a tough environment due to rising bad loans and the country s hard to read regulatory regime   It would be very difficult for them to change the  business  landscape   said a banker with an European bank  The bankers and lawyers declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue  The China Banking Regulatory Commission  CBRC  did not respond to a request for comment   SECURITIES JOINT VENTURES One area with potential could be the securities joint ventures operated by big global investment banks in partnership with local players  industry insiders said   China has said banks will be able to raise stakes to 51 percent from the current cap of 49 percent  and that in three years  even those restrictions will be lifted   The joint ventures  operated by banks including  Citigroup   N C   whose joint venture topped the foreign securities  business list in China last year in terms of profit   Credit Suisse   S CSGN   and UBS  S UBSG  among others  These joint ventures offer services like stock and bond underwriting  sales and trading   The lack of management control and regulatory curbs have limited the range of services the ventures can offer and compete with local players  who dominate the market  industry data showed  None of the foreign ventures figure in lists of the top 70 securities firms in China in terms of profit  Citi welcomes any government moves to further liberalize the financial markets  said Christine Lam  chief executive of Citi China  adding that the bank continued to grow its own retail and institutional business in the country  UBS Securities  the bank s China joint venture  was ranked 85th in China with profit of about  14 million last year  even as it remains an investment banking powerhouse in Asia  Meanwhile  the local industry leader  Gutai Junan Securities  raked in  1 5 billion in the same period   China is a key market for UBS and  as indicated previously  we continue to work toward increasing our stake in UBS Securities Co  Ltd    Eugene Qian  the chairman of the UBS China Strategy Board  said in a statement  Last year  JPMorgan  NYSE JPM  reported global corporate and investment banking profits of  10 8 billion  while its Chinese joint venture produced  8 million   to be split with its partner   The U S  bank sold its 33 percent holding in that entity to its partner last December but is in talks to set up a new joint venture  people with knowledge of the matter have previously said  JPMorgan said the bank was fully committed to China and had a strategic long term approach to its business in the country  It will continue to  evaluate viable options to strengthen its position  in China  the bank said in a statement  Credit Suisse looks forward to being a part of China s financial markets development  the bank said in a statement  without elaborating  The China Securities Regulatory Commission did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment  Taking over management control of these joint ventures would help foreign banks by allowing their staff to run the businesses and better integrate local operations with their global networks  the bankers said   It would also minimize any  reputational risk  by tightening governance  they said  But stringent  know your customer  requirements and limited business lines would mean it would be years before they manage to take market share away from local players such as Gutai Junan  CITIC Securities and Haitong Securities  they said   Pricing competition is also intense  particularly in the brokerage and underwriting segments  where brokerage commission rates have fallen to less than 3 basis points   Fitch Ratings analysts wrote in a report on Tuesday

155202,376718,UBSG,China s financial sector opening raises prospect of talent war,news,"By Sumeet Chatterjee HONG KONG  Reuters    In the last two years  more than 30 global asset managers have been awarded licences to set up wholly owned units in China as they sought a share of the country s  1 5 trillion private fund management market  Yet only about half a dozen of those asset managers   a group that includes the likes of Aberdeen Standard Investments  Invesco and Vanguard   have so far managed to come closer to getting their first funds off the ground   One of the biggest problems holding the others back is an acute shortage of qualified and experienced financial sector professionals in the world s second largest economy  said people familiar with the matter  Although China is gradually opening up its financial sector   from investment banking to insurance   to greater foreign participation  its rules make it hard to import many foreigners to run businesses onshore  In the newly opened up private fund management business for instance  China requires senior executives to undertake written tests conducted only in Mandarin  said lawyers advising foreign fund managers   The issue is set to worsen in the years ahead because salaries in China cannot match what a Mandarin speaking finance professional can get in New York  Singapore or Hong Kong  headhunters and industry insiders told Reuters   We expect to see a new wave of hiring   by international firms due to the country easing restrictions on foreign ownership in these areas   said Simon Lance  managing director for Greater China at headhunting firm Hays    But  with less than attractive salary packages on offer  many firms are  and will find it  challenging to recruit senior candidates given their high expectations on the skills and capabilities these candidates must possess   So far  global firms have often based their top China roles in regional centers such as Hong Kong and Singapore   in part  because restrictions on ownership mean they have not had control of onshore operations   But any move to boost onshore operations will involve moving those jobs to China and hiring more workers there   putting more pressure on an already limited pool of trained professionals   There is indeed keen competition in senior leadership levels recruitment in China   Aberdeen Standard said in a statement  adding that it was gradually building a team on the ground  Vanguard  which launched a wholly foreign owned enterprise in Shanghai in May this year  said it was hiring more local talent and was confident of giving Chinese investors the  best chance for investment success with a highly experienced team   Invesco declined to comment  LOCAL HIRING  Several global firms including JPMorgan  N JPM    Morgan Stanley   N MS    Prudential   L PRU   and UBS  S UBSG  have said they would be keen to invest more in China to bolster their presence in the country  But in spite of China s 800 million strong workforce  the gap between demand and supply of experienced executives in China has been growing as financial regulators have steadily lifted standards for professionals in the industry   The shortage has been made more acute with the steady exodus of professionals leaving China in search of better air quality and lifestyles  said financial professionals in Hong Kong  who warn that standards  as well as wage inflation  are a concern   Even if you incentivize half of those people to get them to go back to the mainland  the problem will be far from resolved   said a senior banker at one of the Wall Street banks looking to bulk up its securities business in China   We need to hire from the local pool  and even if you are poaching from a local house by offering a 20 to 25 percent wage hike  you are not sure whether the person will meet your global compliance and risk management standards   All the senior executives at global financial services firms spoke to Reuters on the condition they not be named as they were not authorized to speak to the media on the subject  Because of the paucity of talent  financial sector wages in China are already growing at a rate of about 10 percent a year   almost double the annual salary hikes in the sector in Hong Kong and Singapore  according to two headhunting firms  But the remuneration is still low compared with Hong Kong and Singapore  a mid ranking vice president at a Wall Street bank in Hong Kong can earn about HK 2 million   255 970  a year in base salary compared to HK 1 5 million in Beijing   The hiring challenges have not  however  deterred the global financial groups  with several firming up plans to boost their China presence   Citigroup  Inc  N C  is considering setting up an onshore cash equities business in China and expanding research coverage of Chinese stocks to boost its share of the business in Asia  Prudential aims to have a bigger share of its life insurance business in China  where it has a 50 50 joint venture  while its Asia fund management business is working on setting up a wholly owned unit in China to manage non retail funds   As the ownership regulation eases  it does make sense for global firms to put more people on the ground  in China   to be closer to clients and key decision makers   said John Mullally  director of financial services at headhunter Robert Walters     But  it s definitely becoming a tougher market to get good quality talent compared to Hong Kong

private bank to a record high this year has been aided by a key plank of the bank s new strategy  lending money to the world s ultra wealthy   Switzerland s second biggest bank is trying to lure more rich customers by helping them fund their businesses and lifestyles  with shipping  aviation and real estate loans a central focus  The company has moved lending in those areas from its corporate bank to its wealth management unit  or private bank  over the past two years  the switch is one way in which Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam aims to deliver on his overarching strategy of driving group growth by expanding wealth management  It is also one reason why Credit Suisse s private bank is growing faster than that of its Swiss rival UBS  S UBSG   the world s largest wealth manager  in terms of revenue and attracting new money   Moving the financing from its corporate to private bank means that  in those sectors   Credit Suisse   SIX CSGN  will now be primarily lending to affluent individuals   clients whose personal wealth it helps manage  But there are risks with such exposure  Shipping finance in particular can be a perilous proposition due to doubts over the current profitability of many companies in the industry and whether lenders can make sufficient returns on investments   Credit Suisse   bucking a trend of banks retreating from shipping   believes it can reduce its vulnerability by lending to the high net worth individuals who control firms  often millionaire or billionaire tycoons  according to finance experts   The tactic nevertheless represents a calculated gamble  they said  because these people s personal wealth are often linked to the fortunes of the industry   From the bank s point of view  the deposits and private wealth product is the juice  the value to the bank has to be strong enough in order to consider making risky loans   said Basil Karatzas of New York based shipping finance advisory firm Karatzas Marine Advisors   Co   Credit Suisse declined to give details about its loan exposure in shipping  aviation and property  but finance sources estimated Credit Suisse s exposure in shipping alone was at least  12 billion  Credit Suisse s total net private banking loans totaled about 110 billion Swiss francs   110 billion  at the end of the third quarter   The bank declined to comment on the shipping loans figure   Asked about the financing switch to the private bank and the associated risks  a Credit Suisse spokeswoman said such lending was part of its overall wealth platform and that the bank considers  franchise value when engaging holistically with wealth management clients   A source familiar with the matter said Credit Suisse had not seen any significant losses on shipping loans and that such lending gave it a foot in the door to bank for wealthy families  which run major shipping companies   SHIPPING MAGNATES Many banks  facing capital pressure from regulators  are retreating from shipping because of the risks associated with a sector that has struggled with a near decade long slump caused by too many vessels ordered and weaker demand   Lloyds  L LLOY  became one of the first lenders to pull out of shipping finance  while fellow British bank Royal Bank of Scotland  L RBS  is in the process of exiting  Others such as Germany s Commerzbank  DE CBKG   and Bank of Ireland  I BIRG  are winding down their remaining exposures  Finance sources estimate the sector has a capital shortfall of  30 billion this year   Finance experts say Credit Suisse s new tack of lending via its private bank has helped it make significant in roads with Greek shipping magnates   among the richest in the industry   in the past year  capitalizing on RBS s exit from Greece   Leading Greek shipping tycoon John Angelicoussis is among those that Credit Suisse has helped finance  Thomson Reuters LPC data shows    Presently  Credit Suisse seems to be shedding off part of the smaller  ship  owner portfolio and those who are not top tier names with top tier deposits   said Karatzas   There is a focus away from the transactional aspect of business towards the relationship driven business that lowers costs and risks but also builds up on the bank s traditional core strengths   Credit Suisse has taken a similar approach towards aviation and real estate  Shipping and real estate lending are both bigger businesses than aviation for the bank  the source familiar with the matter said   RISK APPETITE Credit Suisse  whose assets under management have hit a record high of 751 billion francs this year  saw a 7 percent rise in net new money in the first nine months of 2017   By comparison UBS s flagship wealth management division  with 1 1 trillion francs  reported a 5 percent growth in net new money   Credit Suisse s earnings from lending in wealth management have risen 5 8 percent this year  while UBS s division is down 1 percent   Any gain that Credit Suisse can make in private banking is valuable as the lender comes off back to back multi billion dollar full year losses amid a major restructure under Thiam   It remains to be seen whether the potential benefits of its private bank s lending tactics will outweigh the risks  But its arch rival is not following its approach   The head of UBS s wealth management division  Juerg Zeltner  told Reuters in September the bank has no plans to increase risk appetite with regards to lending    We ve defined our risk appetite   he said   I know how much earnings I m willing to put at risk and that limits my exposure to how much lending I m going to do  ,2017-11-06,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/need-help-to-buy-a-ship-or-jet-credit-suisse-looks-to-lure-superrich-764305,764305

155257,376773,UBSG,Hong Kong  Singapore in talks to grab bigger share of derivatives business,news,"By Michelle Price HONG KONG  Reuters    Hong Kong and Singapore are seeking to snare a bigger share of the  540 trillion global derivatives business  taking advantage of tough new UK and European banking rules and uncertainty created by Britain s plans to leave the European Union  Over the past five months  regulators from the two Asian financial centers have been separately holding talks with the Asia Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association  ASIFMA   which represents global lenders in Asia  five people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters  At the center of the discussions is what kind of regulatory changes would be needed in Hong Kong and Singapore to get more banks to book their derivatives business in one of the two places  If the Hong Kong Monetary Authority  HKMA  and the Monetary Authority of Singapore  MAS  are successful  they could lure billions of dollars of banking business and eventually create what could amount to thousands of jobs in Asia  These derivatives would include products such as interest rate swaps or foreign exchange derivatives  which allow companies and investors to hedge their exposure to interest rate rises and currency swings  Asia has traditionally accounted for less than 10 percent of the global over the counter derivatives market  according to Bank for International Settlements data  Global banks have typically held the majority of Asia related trades on their European balance sheets  with London being a major booking center for such deals  This has allowed them to gain economies of scale by aggregating their capital and infrastructure in one or two locations  while London also has a deep talent pool of employees with expertise in managing and processing the trading book  During the past three years  though  many banks have begun to review their Asia trade booking arrangements because of new U K  and European rules that have made Britain less attractive as a global hub for Asian risk  Brexit has made the situation more urgent by prompting many banks to move some of their operations  including trading books  out of London  This has sparked broader internal discussions over whether more of the London book holding Asia trades should also be moved to Asian financial centers  the sources said  Banks looking to book more trades in Asia include HSBC  L HSBA    Standard Chartered   L STAN   UBS  S UBSG  and  Credit Suisse   S CSGN   one of the sources said  In a statement  HSBC said it would support clients as they pursued opportunities in Asia   Hong Kong is one of the world s leading financial centers and continues to be at the heart of HSBC s growth plans   UBS  Standard Chartered and Credit Suisse declined to comment  COSTLY DEALS Booking derivatives trades in Hong Kong and Singapore is currently expensive for global banks because they are not yet allowed by the HKMA and the MAS to use their own internal risk management models  which typically allow banks to hold less capital against such trades than standard models used by regulators  Now  though  regulators are considering approving these internal capital calculation models  For Hong Kong and Singapore  grabbing a much larger chunk of the global derivatives market would promote their status as global financial centers by helping them diversify away from asset management and offering them other benefits  according to one of the sources  These would include boosting demand for consultancy and IT services  and potentially boosting fees for local clearing houses that sit in between trades to guarantee payment  But it would also increase the overall level of financial risk  potentially leaving the authorities on the hook in the event a bank gets into trouble   The HKMA has been in discussion with ASIFMA and its member institutions to explain the HKMA s supervisory policies and processes with regard to the establishment of a derivatives hub in Hong Kong   a spokeswoman for the HKMA said in a statement  Adding   The HKMA welcomes banks to establish a derivatives hub in Hong Kong on the understanding that the risks associated with the activity will be properly managed   The MAS said in a statement that banks were looking to book more financial activity in Singapore due to the rapid growth of Asian markets and client preferences  among other reasons   In order to meet MAS  validation standards for the use of more advanced approaches in capital computation   financial institutions  must demonstrate that they have robust risk management systems and processes to measure and validate the accuracy and consistency of all relevant risk components   the statement added  A spokeswoman for ASIFMA declined to comment  The MAS and HKMA are not working together on their separate initiatives  The HKMA is increasing staff with the technical expertise necessary to handle the model approval process  and may also hire external professional advisors if necessary  It is also planning to issue some guidance to banks on the matter  according to two of the sources  The regulator is also reviewing section 87 of the Hong Kong Banking Ordinance  which currently limits banks  ability to hold large amounts of equity derivatives exposure in the city  
Banks will have to demonstrate that they will not only book the trades in Hong Kong  but also have risk management and back office staff on the ground in the city too  the people added ",2017-09-03,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/hong-kong-singapore-in-talks-to-grab-bigger-share-of-derivatives-business-525186,525186

155319,376835,UBSG,Swiss banks lobby for get out clause as end of bank secrecy nears,news,"By Joshua Franklin and John O Donnell ZURICH  Reuters    Switzerland s private banks  used for decades by the world s wealthy to hide money and avoid tax  are pushing for extra legal protection of client information that could halt a much heralded exchange of data with dozens of countries  The Alpine country is preparing to dismantle bank secrecy next year when it begins sending information about its customers  accounts to foreign tax agencies  But Switzerland s multi trillion dollar financial industry is seeking new safeguards to protect bank data against misuse that could expose clients to crimes such as kidnapping or blackmail    Data could be sold or used to put pressure on clients or their families   said Yves Mirabaud  chairman of the Association of Swiss Private Banks and senior managing partner at Mirabaud  a Geneva based private bank    I m referring to countries where we re not very sure that the democratic process is the same as ours  or where corruption is very high   Wealthy clients have pulled tens of billions of dollars out of Swiss bank accounts because of a worldwide crackdown on tax evasion following the global financial crisis last decade  That culminated in the Automatic Exchange of Information programme fostered by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development  OECD   which aims to ensure that offshore accounts are known to authorities   The participation of Switzerland  the world s largest center for overseas wealth  in the data exchange agreement was heralded at the time as a major breakthrough in ending tax avoidance  Banks in Switzerland are  fully committed  to implementing the Automatic Exchange of Information  said a spokeswoman for the Swiss Bankers Association  the main banking lobby   But they are lobbying to add an  activation  clause that means information would only be handed over to a country if two criteria are met    a level playing field with other financial centers  and an assurance the data will be used properly   They say giving information to countries in regions such as South America or Africa  where data protection standards can be weak and corruption rife  risks it falling into the wrong hands   In 2018 Switzerland is due to start swapping information with 38 foreign tax authorities  including all European Union countries  and with a further 41 from 2019   The proposed clause would apply to the 2019 batch of countries  among which are several emerging markets such as Brazil  Mexico and Russia   We want to be sure that when we provide information that it does not get misused or compromise a client s security   said Boris Collardi  chief executive at  Julius Baer   S BAER   Switzerland s third biggest private bank behind UBS  S UBSG  and  Credit Suisse   S CSGN   The Swiss government will send to parliament a dispatch  which contains its proposals on the exchange of information with these 41 countries  by July 5  Parliament will then be asked to decide on the implementation of these plans  DIAMONDS IN A TOOTHPASTE TUBE Mirabaud expressed confidence the government supports the clause  despite lobbyists for transparency saying it is a back door attempt to continue bank secrecy rather than a genuine move to prevent criminality or persecution  A spokeswoman for the State Secretariat for International Financial Matters  an arm of the finance ministry  signaled the government would consider halting transfers of information   If there are concerns about how the data will be used in a specific jurisdiction  Switzerland could look at taking any of the measures provided for in the multilateral framework governing the automatic exchange of information   she said  referring to steps that include suspending the data exchange with a country   Campaigners against secrecy are crying foul  however  and accuse the Swiss of trying to allow the wealthy to keep cash hidden    That information might fall into the hands of kidnappers    is the perfect excuse   said Nicholas Shaxson of Tax Justice Network  an organization that lobbies on tax havens   It s a justification for an ocean of fraud    Pressure on Switzerland built after a U S  led crackdown starting in 2008 publicized practices used by its bankers to keep money hidden from tax authorities  from smuggling diamonds in toothpaste tubes to hiding documents in the pages of Sports Illustrated  This U S  clampdown and the push by the OECD to bring in global rules on exchanging tax data between countries means that Switzerland handing over information to Europe and the United States is unavoidable   PERFECT EXCUSE  Data from the Swiss National Bank shows a sharp decline in U S  money in Swiss accounts  U S  customers accounted for 161 billion Swiss francs   165 3 billion  of bank deposits in 2006  but that had more than halved in 2015   In the meantime  the size of deposits from many emerging market countries has gradually increased   Mark Herkenrath of Alliance Sud  a group that campaigns for transparency  is skeptical about the true motivation    For a lot of Swiss banks  a big part of their business is breaking away because money from the U S  has dried up  The temptation now is to continue taking money from developing countries   he said    The suggestion that they are shielding their customers from abuse of their human rights is the perfect excuse to avoid transparency   The Paris based OECD  which will police whether the exchange of information is working  is optimistic that Switzerland will honor the deal  But it stands ready to act in case the Swiss banks drag their feet  
 It s not going to be used as an excuse   said Pascal Saint Amans  the OECD s tax policy director  acknowledging the banks  argument for preventing the misuse of information   But if it is  the country will be sanctioned  ",2017-06-15,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/swiss-banks-lobby-for-get-out-clause-as-end-of-bank-secrecy-nears-495883,495883

155354,376870,UBSG,Power shift in Swiss finance with insurers set to overtake banks,news,"By Joshua Franklin
ZURICH  Reuters    Switzerland s financial center is in the midst of a power shift 
The Alpine country s less fashionable insurers  long overshadowed by glamorous private banks around Zurich s posh Paradeplatz and Lake Geneva  are on course to surpass banks as a bigger contributor to the Swiss economy for the first time since 1993 
Insurance will overtake financial services as a proportion of Switzerland s 650 billion Swiss franc   649 billion  economy in 2018 based on the average growth rate of the past decade  according to Reuters calculations 
It underscores banks  waning power in the aftermath of the financial crisis as well as the damaging impact of a global crackdown on tax evasion  which has eroded the importance of Switzerland s bank secrecy laws 
The swing could be temporary  according to Martin Eling  an insurance management professor at the University of St  Gallen 
 In general the business models of banks are simply more volatile than insurers   said Eling   Depending on the development  it could be that banks catch up again in the next three to four years  
Switzerland is home to UBS  S UBSG  and  Credit Suisse   S CSGN  as well as Zurich Insurance  S ZURN  and  Swiss Re   S SRENH   respectively two of Europe s biggest banks and insurers 
The Swiss statistics office defines financial services as including areas like banking  trusts and financial leasing 
The number of banks and insurers in Switzerland shrank by around 20 percent between 2005 and 2015 but when it comes to staff sizes  banks remain clearly on top

155408,376924,UBSG,U S  judge throws out many metals price fixing claims,news,"By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK  Reuters    A U S  judge on Tuesday significantly narrowed private litigation accusing several big banks and German chemical giant BASF SE  DE BASFn  of conspiring to suppress platinum and palladium prices 
U S  District Judge Gregory Woods in Manhattan dismissed claims against BASF  Switzerland s UBS Group AG  S UBSG   South Africa s Standard Bank Group Ltd  J SBKJ  and the London Platinum and Palladium Fixing Co 
In a 104 page decision in the proposed class action case  Woods said dismissal was appropriate because of a lack of proof these defendants conspired to fix prices  had sufficient ties to the United States  or both 
The judge also dismissed claims that  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc  N GS  and  HSBC Holdings  Plc  L HSBA  violated the U S  antitrust law known as the Sherman Act  saying the plaintiffs were not  efficient enforcers  of that law 
Woods said the plaintiffs may pursue some price manipulation claims against Goldman and HSBC under the Commodities Exchange Act  citing their allegations that the defendants  engaged in conscious misbehavior or  at least  acted with recklessness  
Merrill Davidoff  a lawyer for the plaintiffs  in an email declined immediate comment  citing a need to review the decision 
Platinum and palladium are used in catalytic converters to curb vehicle emissions  and are also used in dentistry and jewelry 
The U S  lawsuit is one of many where private plaintiffs have sought to hold banks and other defendants liable for rigging interest rates  commodities and currencies  separate from any punishments that regulators might seek to impose 
Purchasers of platinum  palladium and futures contracts for the metals accused the defendants of having from Jan  1  2008 to Nov  30  2014 conspired to rig the twice daily platinum and palladium  fixings  and the prices of futures and options based on those fixings 
According to the complaint  the alleged misconduct included illegal sharing of customer data  using that data to engage in  front running  of expected price moves  and manufacturing phantom  spoof  orders 
While the London Metal Exchange launched a new electronic fixing process on Dec  1  2014  the plaintiffs said this did not excuse the defendants from owing unspecified millions of dollars for their earlier losses

 Reuters    WaveDivision Holdings LLC is exploring a sale that its private equity owners hope will value the regional U S  provider of cable TV  internet and telephone service at more than  2 billion  including debt  according to people familiar with the matter 
The move comes amid a wave of dealmaking in the U S  cable sector  as fierce price competition and significant capital expenditure requirements put pressure on what have traditionally been stable businesses with reliable cash flows 
Buyout firms Oak Hill Capital Management LLC and GI Partners  which together with Wave s management own the company  have hired investment bank UBS Group AG  S UBSG  to run an auction for Wave  the people said this week 
Wave has 12 month earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization of around  200 million  the people added 
The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential  Wave and UBS declined to comment  Oak Hill Capital and GI Partners did not immediately respond to requests for comment 
A sale of Wave would be the latest in a string of such deals in the sector  Earlier this week  U S  cable mogul John Malone s Liberty Interactive Corp  O QVCA  said it would acquire Alaska based cable provider General Communication Inc  O GNCMA  for  1 12 billion 
Last year  private equity firm TPG Global acquired regional broadband providers RCN Telecom Services LLC and Grande Communications Networks LLC for  2 25 billion from another buyout firm  ABRY Partners 
Headquartered in Kirkland  Washington  Wave has residential and commercial customers in the Seattle  Sacramento  San Francisco and Portland markets 
A portion of Wave s network  including in the San Francisco market  is considered an  overbuilder   meaning it competes with existing cable providers  This could present regulatory obstacles for another cable company seeking to acquire it 
Wave has also been heavily investing in its fiber network  The company said last fall it has 1 000 fiber construction projects underway 
Wave s fiber rich network could enable it to generate more cash from its high speed data services for homes and businesses  credit ratings agency Moody s Investors Service Inc said last August

around the world  use London as their base for operating across the European Union  making the British capital the biggest financial center in the region by far  But their EU  passports   which enable them to operate throughout Europe from a single office in London  are set to be lost once the UK pulls out of the bloc in two years  time  British hopes of securing a generous new deal are likely to be contested by politicians in many EU states who were jolted by the decision of British voters last year to leave  Recognizing the risk of future barriers  Carney said banks had to be ready for a  hard  Brexit and set a July 14 deadline for all cross border finance firms operating in Britain to tell the BoE how they would cope with an abrupt EU exit  It is not just banks that cluster their EU operations in Britain which face risks  European firms which operate in London via EU passports should be prepared to set up separately capitalized subsidiaries in Britain and submit to BoE regulation if Britain and the EU cannot reach a deal  the BoE s top banking regulator Sam Woods said on Friday  DON T RUSH TO LEAVE Banks are making contingency plans but Carney said they should not rush to leave London   In my view it would be extreme to take precipitate action   Lenders are concerned that Britain and the EU will not reach a deal in time for Brexit which is due in two years  time  and are preparing to move staff from London  Germany and France are trying to lure jobs to their financial capitals   HSBC  L HSBA   UBS  S UBSG  and  Morgan Stanley   N MS  have decided to move about 1 000 staff each from London in the next two years  sources familiar with their plans have told Reuters   Goldman Sachs  N GS  said last month it would begin moving hundreds of people as part of its contingency plans  Prime Minister Theresa May mentioned the importance of reaching a trade deal with the EU that includes financial services as a  crucial sector  when she triggered the two year process of Britain s exit from the EU last week  But many bankers have said they are not convinced the government will prioritize their industry  with May making controls on immigration a top aim  Carney said he expected financial services to be part of a  bigger deal  on trade between Britain and the EU  He warned of the potential hit to the economy in Europe from a hard Brexit for banking  saying it would be tough for other EU countries to match the scale and expertise of Britain   That s very difficult to replicate   he said  To reduce the risk of disruption  the Britain and the EU should take  the high road  of mutually recognizing their financial rules  allowing companies to operate smoothly across the English Channel as they have done until now   The EU and UK are therefore ideally positioned to create an effective system of deference to each other s comparable regulatory outcomes  supported by commitments to common minimum standards and open supervisory co operation   he said  Major global trade deals to date have largely excluded financial services due to their complexity  however  Recognition of financial rules has not been tried before on the scale envisaged by Carney  which could make negotiations tricky and protracted  The EU may also be reluctant to forgo the jurisdiction of the bloc s top court in policing rule breaches  Sean Tuffy  head of strategy for Europe at private bank Brown Brothers Harriman  said Brussels was unlikely to offer Britain more than sector specific deals on mutual recognition  such as in asset management   Barring a huge shift in the UK s negotiating position  it strikes me as very unlikely that we re going to see a broad mutual recognition deal for financial services   he said   Carney said the system could be bolstered by third party peer reviews and a new independent dispute resolution mechanism  adding that this could be a template for the wider world  He also said he would push to ensure some clearing of euro denominated transactions remains in London after Brexit  TRUMP REFORMS AFFECT U S   NOT WORLD  CARNEY  Against a backdrop of global concern that U S  President Donald Trump may undo some of the reforms implemented since the financial crisis  Carney said the global financial system was at a  fork in the road    Governments had to choose between maintaining high standards of regulation and respecting each others  rules  or looking inward with big costs to global trade  he said  Trump has said that banking rules are holding back U S  lending  and has ordered a review of regulation  raising concerns that the relatively unified global approach to financial regulation will splinter  Carney said the United States under Trump seemed focused on rules unique to the country  rather than a radical overhaul which would have global implications  
 I d be very wary of interpreting anything that the U S  administration does as a rollback of regulation  of a turning inwards  of a fragmentation   Carney said ",2017-04-07,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/bank-of-england's-carney-calls-for-uk-eu-bank-rules-pact-after-brexit-472419,472419

155445,376961,UBSG,Poland aims to be winner in Brexit battle for banking jobs,news,"By Marcin Goclowski WARSAW  Reuters    As Britain prepares to leave the European Union  the country hoping to win the most jobs from London s financial center is not Germany or France  but Poland  While the likes of Frankfurt and Paris are competing for top investment bankers after Brexit  Poland has set its sights on mid tier financial and technical work where salaries may not be astronomical but jobs are far more numerous  Since the country joined the EU in 2004  many Poles have gone to Britain to work  now the government wants to attract more jobs currently based in Britain for Poles to do at home  The Association of Business Service Leaders in Poland is working on projects with seven big financial firms about shifting jobs from London  said the Association s managing director Pawel Panczyj  The focus is on middle office functions such as risk management and information technology   We are talking with banks  insurance institutions and investment funds who want to move their middle office abroad  The main factor behind their decision  now  is Brexit   he told Reuters  Panczyj s efforts are likely to bear fruit  The regional head of one global investment bank told Reuters that he estimates as many as 20 percent of jobs at the lender s London base could eventually be done in Poland  Last year s referendum when Britons voted for Brexit has forced banks and other financial firms to seek new bases for some operations in a country that will remain in the EU  allowing them to continue serving clients in the bloc   They are also under pressure to cut costs as they look at how to reorganize their operations  In some cases  this includes work that could still be based in Britain from a regulatory point of view  but needs to be done more cheaply than is possible in Europe s dominant financial capital  Already  post communist Poland has established itself as a major offshoring site for banks  with estimates of financial services jobs moved from all Western countries ranging from 35 000 to 45 000   Credit Suisse   S CSGN  and UBS  S UBSG  are among those basing large IT and back office administrative operations in the country   Now financial firms are starting to move more sophisticated work there such as risk management and product development  taking advantage of a well educated workforce as well as office space and wages that are cheaper than in most of Europe   Goldman Sachs  N GS  has 500 people working at its office in Warsaw and is seeking dozens more in areas ranging from risk modeling to working on the technology for its fixed income trading systems  It wants candidates with degrees in computer science or chartered financial analyst  CFA  qualifications  according to job advertisements   UBS is looking to hire close to 300 people at its offices in Krakow and Wroclaw  according to its website  HUBS OF HIGH TECHNOLOGY   At the very beginning banks were hiring young people without  high  qualifications  but now they are becoming hubs of high technology   said Brunon Bartkiewicz  chief executive of Dutch controlled Polish lender ING Bank Slaski   The growth of high tech roles reflects the changing make up of the people who work at investment banks   The days of trading floors packed with hundreds of highly paid dealers are coming to an end  with more of their market operations being automated  Banks need fewer people in front office roles  and more in technology and as well in compliance and risk management to deal with tighter regulation since the global financial crisis  That means Frankfurt and Paris are battling over a shrinking pool of front line investment bankers  Officials from the cities  lobby groups estimate they could each win around 10 000 jobs after Brexit  By contrast  Poland s government expects to attract around 25 000 30 000 jobs from Britain in the business services sector just this year  with many of those in finance  The shift to Poland started well before Britain voted to leave the EU  but plans to move more jobs have accelerated since the referendum  recruiters and consultants say   TALENT BATTLE  In central Warsaw  BNP Paribas   PA BNPP  employs 700 people in the Spire office complex  supporting the French bank s fund management business  Ryszard Piskorz  who runs BNP Securities Services there  says the bank is still expanding but needs to make itself an attractive place to work to fend off competitors who are also recruiting    Poland is an emerging country and in our sector Poland is coming out as a role expert  maybe even challenging Luxembourg as a fund industry center   said Piskorz   Marta Aserigadu  a recruitment consultant at Experis  part of Manpower Group  said more well educated Poles are finding it appealing to stay in their home country as banks basing operations there pushes up wages    There is no need to leave Poland now  The difference in salaries concerns only  recent  graduates  But this difference vanishes very quickly when you take further steps in your career   she said    These people can reach high level  decisive jobs within global corporations  Staying at home  with low Polish costs of living  they can start their international careers  There is no need to leave to London and live an immigrant s life    The government is pushing to keep this trend going  The ruling Law and Justice party has a protectionist stance against foreign lenders in retail banking  but hosting investment banks  back and middle office operations brings in jobs and taxes without any loss of control over its financial system

155485,377001,UBSG,Struggling European banks see light at end of low rates tunnel,news,"By John O Donnell and Maya Nikolaeva
FRANKFURT PARIS  Reuters    Rock bottom interest rates hurt more big European banks in 2016 than in the previous year  but the worst could soon be over with the prospect of rising borrowing costs rippling from the United States to Europe 
Low rates  money printing and a penalty charge for hoarding cash have been at the heart of attempts to reinvigorate the 19 country euro zone economy in the wake of the 2008 09 debt crisis 
But the policy has been politically divisive  prompting fierce criticism from famously thrifty Germans as the returns on savings in Europe s biggest economy dwindled to nothing 
It also imposed a heavy cost on still fragile banks  turning deposits into a hot potato that many would rather avoid so as not to pay charges to their central bank for storing them 
Last year marked a low ebb  according to a survey by Reuters of 20 large European banks conducted in mid February 
While seven in that group saw net interest income fall during 2015  that number increased to 12 in 2016  with the average dip more than 7 percent  That was steeper than the roughly 5 percent slip on average in 2015 
Such income is the difference between interest charged on  say  a loan  and the cost of holding a deposit  It is a bellwether of earning power  closely watched by investors  and its decline bodes ill for the sector 
TRUMP S PROMISED STIMULUS BUOYS HOPES
Many executives are now pinning their hopes on a change in direction for central banks given that rate hikes appear to be on the cards in the United States this year   and ultimately a paring back of easy money policies in Europe 
 It s usually the U S  that leads the pack   said Charles Goodhart of the London School of Economics  a former member of the Bank of England s Monetary Policy Committee 
 If  U S  President Donald  Trump does manage to get an expansionary fiscal policy  there will be increases in interest rates   he said  adding that the effect would also be felt in Europe 
Trump has pledged to stimulate growth in the world s largest and most influential economy through a combination of heavy infrastructure investment and deep corporate tax cuts 
In December  the U S  Federal Reserve raised interest rates and signaled a faster pace of increases in 2017 
For European banks  the shift in rates cannot happen soon enough 
Lars Machenil  chief financial officer of France s  BNP Paribas   PA BNPP   one of Europe s biggest lenders  said the difference could be hundreds of millions of euros of extra income 
 The lowering of interest rates has had a negative effect on the top line  If that would be reversed  we would see something similar back     but it will take time   he said  Low rates cost BNP 1 billion euros of lost revenue between 2013 and 2016 
In 2016  Switzerland s  Credit Suisse   S CSGN  saw interest income dip by about 19 percent  while at Germany s Commerzbank  DE CBKG  and  Deutsche Bank   DE DBKGn   it fell by about 13 and 8 percent respectively  the Reuters survey found 
UniCredit s  MI CRDI  interest income dipped by about 6 percent  Spain s  Bankia   MC BKIA  saw a drop of about one fifth 
While successful in helping a brittle euro zone economy gradually revive from the debt crunch in the short term  zero or negative rates have  in the eyes of critics  struck at a central tenet of banking   lending on the back of deposits   and turned the principle of saving for retirement on its head 
There are signs that the struggle of frustrated lenders is being noticed in Frankfurt  seat of the European Central Bank 
Yves Mersch  a member of the ECB s executive board  the nucleus of euro zone policy setting  recently said it needed to take interest rate cuts off the table  which would mark a retreat from its policy of cheap money 
 How much longer can we continue to talk about  even lower rates  as being a monetary policy option   Mersch said 
PENALTY DEPOSITS
Penalising banks for storing money makes holding deposits  traditionally the bedrock of any lender  more expensive  and this prompts some to steer savers toward fund products for which a fee can be charged 
UBS  S UBSG  CEO Sergio Ermotti has warned that the world s biggest wealth manager could pass on the cost to depositors if sub zero rates persist  So far  only one Swiss bank  Alternative Bank Switzerland  has imposed such charges 
Another way around the problem is keeping deposits low and bolstering lending 
Sweden has generally done better in this respect than most  That is something that  Barclays   LON BARC  analyst Mike Harrison attributes to a lower average level of deposits  which cost a bank money if it cannot lend and must pay a penalty for storing them at the country s central bank 
The ECB imposes a so called negative rate equivalent to 4 euros annually on each 1 000 euros that lenders deposit with the central bank  Banks in Sweden and Switzerland  outside the neighboring euro zone  pay a similar charge 
 Swedish banks have managed best to avoid the impact of zero rates due to the fact that they held fewer deposits   said Harrison   That made it easier to earn a healthy margin on their loans  
 Swedbank    for instance  boosted its lending last year by 7 percent to about 1 5 trillion crowns  while its deposits from the public were roughly half that and rose more slowly 
The Netherlands  ING  AS INGA  and Sweden s Swedbank  ST SWEDa   where lending outpaced the inflow of deposits  posted a roughly 9 and 3 percent increase respectively in such interest income  the Reuters study found 
Germany s Commerzbank tried a broadly similar strategy  cutting deposits from corporate customers by about 22 billion euros  But the cost of penalty or negative rates still squeezed its income by more than 200 million euros in 2016   roughly a third less than its net profit for the full year 
Michael Heise  chief economist with giant German insurer Allianz  DE ALVG  and a long standing critic of cheap money policies  believes relief is at hand 
 There is finally hope of a change in interest rates   he said   The tone among policymakers has changed  The evidence is clear  I think we could see rates rise next year

155486,377002,UBSG,China securities regulator to focus on stability  reform,news,"By Elias Glenn
BEIJING  Reuters    China will focus on stable development of its capital markets this year  but will press ahead to further open its markets to foreign companies  the top securities regulator said on Sunday 
 We will not waver from reforms  to make China s capital markets  more market based  law based and international   Liu Shiyu  chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission  CSRC   told a news conference in Beijing 
Chinese regulators have turned their sights on controlling risks in financial markets as speculative activity and leverage in the economy rise  with the securities regulator vowing to clear out  abnormal phenomena  from capital markets 
The CSRC recently pledged to target  barbaric  leveraged buyouts and to restrict excessive fundraising by some listed companies  with a focus on private share placements 
Liu said earlier this month that CSRC would take down law breaking financial tycoons he called  giant crocodiles   saying they will not be allowed to take advantage of retail investors 
China s crackdown on illegal market activities has intensified since the mid 2015 stock market crash that wiped out almost  3 trillion of share value 
Liu  who was appointed CSRC chairman in early 2016  said that balancing the needs for stability and progress were crucial  especially in managing the primary market 
Limiting or halting initial share sales in order to stabilize the secondary market doesn t  solve the problems of long term healthy development of capital markets   Liu said 
CSRC deputy chief Fang Xinghai said at the same news conference that China is discussing measures that would allow foreign firms to take a larger stake in domestic joint venture securities and futures brokerages  without providing a timetable for any changes 
 Morgan Stanley   N MS  and UBS Group AG  S UBSG  are set to raise their stakes in their separate Chinese securities joint ventures to 49 percent  people with direct knowledge of the moves confirmed last month 
Fang also said there was no timetable for the launch of an international board that will allow foreign invested enterprises to list shares domestically in China  adding that issues such as accounting treatment and disclosure rules were still being studied

155514,377030,UBSG,Trade tensions  dollar danger cloud economic optimism in Davos,news,"By Noah Barkin  DAVOS  Switzerland  Reuters    A trade war between the United States and China and a strengthening dollar are among the biggest threats to a brightening global economic outlook  according to leading economists at the World Economic Forum in Davos  As political leaders  businessmen and bankers converge on the resort in the Swiss Alps this week  they can draw hope from a more benign economic picture and a rally in global stock markets on expectations of major stimulus under a new U S  administration led by Donald Trump  The backdrop is brighter than it was a year ago  when concerns about a rapid economic slowdown in China led to what  Credit Suisse   SIX CSGN  CEO Tidjane Thiam described at the time as  the worst start to any year on record in financial markets ever    I am more optimistic than last year  If no major political or geopolitical uncertainties materialize and derail the world economy  it might even surprise to the upside in 2017   Axel Weber  the chairman of Swiss bank UBS  S UBSG  and a former president of the German Bundesbank  told Reuters  Still  there are big storm clouds on the horizon   It is too early to give the all clear   Weber continued   This cyclical upswing hides but does not solve the world s underlying structural problems  which are excessive debt  over reliance on monetary policy  and adverse demographic developments   Among the biggest concerns for 2017 cited by the half dozen economists interviewed by Reuters was the threat of a U S  China trade war  and broader economic tensions  triggered by what they fear could be a more confrontational Trump administration  Trump is threatening to brand China a currency manipulator and impose heavy tariffs on imports of Chinese goods  Last month he named leading China critic Peter Navarro  author of the book  Death by China   as a top trade adviser    This is the key uncertainty because you don t know how much the rhetoric is a ploy to get better deals   said Raghuram Rajan  an economist at the University of Chicago who stepped down as governor of India s central bank last September   I m worried about the people he is surrounding himself with  If they have a more protectionist world view and believe the reason the U S  is not doing well is because others are cheating that creates a certain kind of rhetoric that could end up very badly for the world    CURRENCY RISKS Last month  the U S  Federal Reserve hiked interest rates for just the second time in a decade  a sign that the lengthy period of ultra loose monetary policy that followed the global financial crisis may be coming to an end  The World Bank said last week that it expects global growth to accelerate to 2 7 percent this year  up from a post crisis low of 2 3 percent in 2016  on the back of a pickup in U S  growth and a recovery in emerging markets fueled by a rise in commodity prices  A year ago in Davos  both Rajan and Weber warned about the limits of loose monetary policy  But now that the Fed is in tightening mode  a new set of risks has emerged  One is a further strengthening of the dollar  which is already hovering near 14 year highs against the euro  A further appreciation could widen the U S  trade deficit  increasing pressure on Trump to resort to protectionist policies  It could also expose weaknesses in the balance sheets of borrowers outside the United States who have borrowed in dollars but hold domestic currency assets  In Europe  by contrast  a stronger dollar could add fuel to a solid if unspectacular economic recovery  allowing the European Central Bank to plot an end to its own easy money policies including the bond buying  or quantitative easing  QE   program it recently extended through to the end of 2017  While welcome  this would also come with risks  particularly for the peripheral euro zone countries that have come to depend on QE to keep a lid on their borrowing costs   Just when you think the euro zone is stable it might turn out not to be   said Kenneth Rogoff of Harvard University  a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund  IMF    If U S  interest rates continue to rise and the dollar appreciates against the euro it s going to start getting very hard for  ECB President  Mario Draghi to tell the story that he s doing QE to prop up inflation  If he ever slows down on QE  the vulnerabilities of the periphery countries are huge    EUROPEAN BANKS Rajan and Richard Baldwin of the Graduate Institute in Geneva said they viewed European banks as another big risk for the global outlook  Italy agreed last month to inject about 6 6 billion euros into Monte dei Paschi di Siena  MI BMPS   but the weakness of other Italian banks and German institutions  including  Deutsche Bank   DE DBKGn   remain a concern  However the biggest threat may be political  Were French far right leader Marine Le Pen  who favors a Brexit style referendum on France s EU membership  to deliver a Trump like surprise in the two round French election in April and May  doubts about the future of the EU and euro zone will increase  The chances of that seem slim for now  A poll last week suggested conservative candidate Francois Fillon would beat Le Pen in a runoff by a 63 to 37 percent margin  But after two seismic political shocks in 2016   Trump and Brexit   no one is counting her out  
 Political surprises may fundamentally alter the currently favorable economic and financial outlook for 2017   said Weber ",2017-01-16,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/trade-tensions,-dollar-danger-cloud-economic-optimism-in-davos-453370",453370

155570,377086,UBSG,Swiss offer tough Brexit lessons for Britain s banks,news,By Joshua Franklin ZURICH  Reuters    As Britain s banks make their case for retaining unrestricted access to the single European market after Brexit  the efforts of their Swiss counterparts offer little cause for optimism  Non EU member Switzerland s banking sector has been battling for more than half a decade to win full access to the EU market  Yet squabbles over immigration at home and political obstacles in Brussels have hindered progress    This is not something that s going to happen in the next five years   said Jan Langlo  managing director of the Association of Swiss Private Banks  ASPB    The Swiss finance minister even suggested last month that a deal on financial services might be impossible  The travails of Switzerland exemplify the tough and frustrating battle that could be ahead for Britain to prolong banks  ability to serve the entire EU from London   commonly referred to as passporting rights   after Brexit  And  while there are fundamental differences between the two countries  financial sectors  the workarounds Swiss banks have used to mitigate their lack of pan European access offer a guide to the options Britain s lenders could explore  Instead of waiting for a political breakthrough  Swiss banks requiring single market access  including UBS  S UBSG    Credit Suisse   S CSGN  and  Julius Baer   S BAER   have set up subsidiaries in Frankfurt and Luxembourg in the EU  incurring extra costs and regulation   This has come at a cost to the Swiss financial center  with banks moving thousands of jobs out of Switzerland  The ASPB has warned an increasing number of positions will be filled abroad without simplified EU access  The current set up of having to set up subsidiaries is not ideal but banks recognize it is the best they can hope for right now  said Marc Raggenbass  a regulatory  compliance and legal partner at Deloitte in Switzerland   They are not 100 percent happy but they live with it    At the same time  officials are seeking to strike deals with individual European countries to allow Swiss banks to sell their services there  and negotiating  equivalence  for Swiss financial rules in the EU to allow lenders limited market access in some business areas  JOBS MOVE OUT Switzerland uses more than 100 bilateral agreements with Brussels to give various industries unrestricted access to the single market and in return it adheres to core EU principles including the free movement of people   But financial services are not among the web of Swiss EU accords as  for years  Switzerland s banks viewed deeper EU ties with suspicion  fearing they could jeopardize secrecy rules which helped the country become a global tax haven  The landscape changed markedly after the financial crisis  however  when a global clamp down on tax evasion eroded Swiss banks  revenue and led to them seeking better access to the EU single market and the business opportunities there  Lack of such access has contributed to banking jobs moving abroad with the number of employees at banks in Switzerland falling 22 percent since 2009  according to the Swiss Bankers  Association  SBA    In the first half of 2016  the number of employees in the sector in Switzerland fell by 3 454  an SBA survey found  By contrast Swiss banks hired a net total of over 6 700 people abroad   Britain could be hit harder than Switzerland by a lack of single market access  The UK is a global powerhouse of investment banking  for which passporting is more important than in private banking  in which Swiss banks traditionally specialize   IMMIGRATION DILEMMA But if the Swiss experience is anything to go by  British banks should focus less on talks between London and Brussels  and more on office space in Frankfurt and Luxembourg  Switzerland has been trying for years to reach a deal with the EU on financial services like those covering other sectors  but the premise has become deeply problematic since the country voted to limit immigration from the EU in a 2014 referendum  This would contravene the existing accords  which are contingent on Switzerland allowing free movement of people from the bloc   It is still unclear how the government will be able to respect the referendum result while preserving the pacts  Britain is likely to face a similar dilemma if it seeks single market access for its banks  given voters  decision to leave the European Union was driven in part by a desire to curb immigration   The British government has signaled that limiting immigration will take precedence over single market access in the Brexit negotiations to come  which has dismayed UK based banks  As Switzerland s talks with the EU on a financial services deal have stalled  its focus has turned to other options   It is looking to reach agreements with individual countries   it already has accords of varying scope with Germany  Britain and Austria   while negotiating with the Brussels for  equivalence   a recognition that certain Swiss financial rules are comparable in strength to the corresponding EU laws   Even in these areas  progress looks set to be slow   The ASPB s Langlo hopes for agreements with  a few select European countries  in the next two years  while the equivalence process is  a useful and valuable concept  but lacks transparency and reliability  according to Stefan Hoffmann  the SBA s head of European affairs   Our own experience is that it is always possible  for a country outside the EU  to find and arrange some useful solutions   Hoffmann told a British parliamentary committee on EU financial affairs last month   But he added   It is probably less easy than being a member of the EU

155595,377111,UBSG,UBS is dismissed in U S  silver lawsuit  other claims narrowed,news,"By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK  Reuters    A U S  judge has dismissed UBS Group AG  S UBSG  as a defendant in a lawsuit accusing big banks of conspiring to fix silver prices and exploit price distortions at investors  expense 
In a decision made public on Tuesday  U S  District Judge Valerie Caproni in Manhattan also said investors may pursue some but not all antitrust and manipulation claims against Bank of Nova Scotia   ScotiaBank    TO BNS  and  HSBC Holdings  Plc  L HSBA  
 Deutsche Bank  AG  DE DBKGn  settled related claims in April  and the investors plan soon to seek preliminary approval of a settlement  their lawyer Vincent Briganti said on Wednesday  Terms have not been disclosed 
UBS spokeswoman Erica Chase said the Swiss bank is pleased the court accepted its arguments  Deutsche Bank spokeswoman Amanda Williams declined to comment  HSBC and ScotiaBank did not immediately respond to requests for comment 
The lawsuit is one of many in the Manhattan court in which investors have accused banks of conspiring to rig rates and prices in financial and commodities markets 
Investors claimed that Deutsche Bank  HSBC and ScotiaBank rigged silver prices through a secret daily meeting called the Silver Fix  and accused UBS of exploiting that fix 
The alleged conspiracy started by 1999  suppressed prices on roughly  30 billion of silver and silver financial instruments traded each year  and enabled the banks to pocket returns that could top 100 percent annualized  the investors said 
Caproni said the investors sufficiently   albeit barely   alleged that Deutsche Bank  HSBC and ScotiaBank violated U S  antitrust law by conspiring opportunistically to depress the Silver Fix from January 2007 to December 2013 
But the judge also said dismissing UBS was appropriate because there was nothing showing it manipulated prices  even if it benefited from distortions 
 At best  plaintiffs allege that UBS engaged in parallel conduct by offering  along with the fixing members  below market quotes   Caproni said in her 61 page decision 
Caproni gave the investors 14 days to amend their complaint  including against UBS  Briganti said they plan to do so

NEW YORK  Reuters    A U S  judge said gold investors may pursue much of their lawsuit accusing four major banks of conspiring for a decade to fix prices and exploit distortions at the expense of investors in global markets for the precious metal 
Antitrust and manipulation claims can move forward against  Barclays  Plc  L BARC   Bank of Nova Scotia   ScotiaBank    TO BNS    HSBC Holdings  Plc  L HSBA  and  Societe Generale   PA SOGN   U S  District Judge Valerie Caproni in Manhattan said in a decision made public on Tuesday 
Investors allege that the banks conspired from 2004 to 2013 to fix prices  They did not estimate the size of the banks  gold portfolios  but said the gold derivatives market alone was as large as  650 billion during the class period 
 From the gold plaintiffs  standpoint  it s a very substantial victory   Dan Brockett  a partner at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart   Sullivan representing the investors  said in a phone interview on Wednesday 
 Deutsche Bank  AG  DE DBKGn  settled related claims in April  and the investors plan to seek preliminary approval of a settlement  Brockett said 
Terms have not been disclosed  but Deutsche Bank has put the expected payment in escrow  he said 
In a separate case involving the silver market  Caproni said another group of investors may pursue market rigging claims against ScotiaBank and HSBC 
Both decisions dismissed UBS Group AG  S UBSG  as a defendant  saying there was nothing showing it manipulated prices  even if it benefited from market distortions 
Barclays spokesman Andrew Smith  ScotiaBank spokesman Rick Roth  Societe Generale spokesman Jim Galvin and Deutsche Bank spokeswoman Amanda Williams declined to comment  UBS spokeswoman Erica Chase said the bank is pleased with the decisions  HSBC had no immediate comment 
Investors have several lawsuits before the Manhattan court accusing banks of conspiring to rig rates and prices in financial and commodities markets 
In the gold case  investors said Barclays  Deutsche Bank  HSBC  ScotiaBank and Societe Generale conspired to manipulate prices of gold  gold futures and options  and gold derivatives through twice a day meetings to set the London Gold Fixing 
The investors said this conspiracy let the banks suppress prices and reduce risk at other investors  expense 
In her 73 page decision  Caproni said the investors plausibly alleged that the five banks recklessly created  artificial price dynamics  for gold  and that their misconduct was the  proximate cause  of the distortions 
She let the investors pursue antitrust claims for alleged unlawful restraint of trade from January 2006 to December 2012  The judge dismissed a claim for unjust enrichment 
Caproni gave the investors 14 days to amend their complaint

155613,377129,UBSG,Ex Goldman recruit drives HSBC s investment banking ambitions,news,"By Lawrence White LONDON  Reuters    Using a rare hire from a Wall Street firm  HSBC  L HSBA  is pushing hard to become the top European based investment bank while its regional rivals struggle with regulatory fines and falling revenues  Former Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  banker Matthew Westerman  who took over as head of the Global Banking division in May  has made sweeping changes in the drive to steal market share in a business area where HSBC lags most of its major peers  The London based lender wants to capitalize on the waning fortunes of its German and Swiss competitors  Deutsche Bank   DE DBKGn    Credit Suisse   S CSGN  and UBS  S UBSG   HSBC  which traditionally promotes senior staff internally  hinted at these ambitions in announcing in February that it had recruited Westerman under a restructuring exercise   This is our opportunity  a real opportunity to gain significant market share   Samir Assaf  head of Global Banking and Markets  wrote in a memo to staff  In the five months since he joined  Westerman has cut dozens of senior bankers and restructured the entire division to bring teams closer together  according to 11 current and former HSBC staff interviewed by Reuters  British born Westerman has also cracked down on staff who don t spend enough time with clients in the push to bring more business  promoting an underused system for logging visits and deals  The Global Banking division caters to HSBC s biggest corporate clients  offering advice on mergers and finance  cash management  trade finance and other services  Seen by some HSBC bankers and headhunters as a possible successor to Chief Executive Stuart Gulliver  Westerman has moved fast to stamp his authority on the unit   and also ruffled a few feathers with the depth of his job cuts   Matthew s mandate is clear  and appears to come from the very top  but many of us feel the cuts have gone too far and impacted morale   a senior executive in the banking division that Westerman runs  told Reuters  TIME TO SHINE Westerman  51  was hired directly by Gulliver  according to three people with knowledge of the matter  to run the newly created global banking division that contributed  1 8 billion of the bank s  29 5 billion revenues in January June  HSBC shares are up 16 percent in the year to date  whereas those of Deutsche  Credit Suisse and UBS have fallen an average 37 percent  However  it is still too early to assess the impact of Westerman on HSBC s performance  Aside from the problems besetting its continental rivals  HSBC s strong historical presence in Asia is an advantage  The rising prominence of Chinese companies on the global stage plays to HSBC s strengths  as seen in the bank s lead role in Chemchina s  43 billion bid for Swiss seeds and pesticides group Syngenta  VX SYNN   But Westerman s remit is tough  to even out the bank s performance in investment banking products  and boost revenues from collaboration between its sprawling business units   Gulliver said in 2013 he wants HSBC to make an additional  2 billion in revenues from this kind of collaboration by 2016  Such joined up thinking has long been a problem at HSBC  which has 250 000 employees compared with 35 000 for Goldman Sachs  Assaf  who is Westerman s direct boss  said in a mid year update that  synergy revenues  in the Global Banking and Markets division had actually fallen year on year by 10 percent due to  market uncertainty   In the core financial advisory business  Westerman has taken over a lopsided operation  HSBC is relatively strong globally in debt underwriting but a laggard in managing share offerings  HSBC ranks seventh in Thomson Reuters data for the volume of the global debt deals it has handled for the year to date  the same position as the January September period last year  However  HSBC fell to 20th in January September 2016 from 9th a year earlier for underwriting initial public offerings globally   IMMEDIATE PURGE Westerman joined Goldman Sachs in 2000 and became its top investment banker in Asia from 2012 to 2015  before returning to Britain as chairman of investment banking for Europe  On joining HSBC  he immediately began a clear out  High profile departures included head of corporate finance John Crompton  global head of M A Florian Fautz and vice chairman of global banking and markets Spencer Lake  Robin Phillips  who is co head of the global banking division alongside Westerman  was involved in the reshuffle but has taken a more back seat role since  three senior HSBC sources said  Westerman already knew HSBC well as at Goldman Sachs he acted as its corporate broker  an advisory role common in Britain  and worked on its record  18 9 billion 2009 rights issue  Colleagues said the Oxford University history graduate has brought a rigorous  analytical approach to performance and work habits  Every inch the sharp suited Goldman Sachs alumnus  Westerman enjoys flashes of dry  self aware humour about his image   That is most notable when comparing his arrival with that of John Studzinski  a former  Morgan Stanley   NYSE MS  executive whose reign from 2003 2006 saw a turbulent and ill fated drive to build a star studded investment bank inside HSBC  Westerman laughs off the comparison  a fourth senior HSBC source said  saying his style is different from the Boston born socialite known as  Studs  to friends and colleagues  Rather than hiring star names  Westerman has reined in overly independent banking units by merging them and changing reward structures to promote collaboration  insiders said  Westerman has directed a drive for staff to make more use of HSBC s global system for tracking how much time they spend with customers and what products the clients have been sold  Such management systems are widely used at other investment banks  a fifth senior London based HSBC source said  but had been underused at HSBC until Westerman s arrival   He has ruffled some feathers by tracking very closely how bankers are spending their time in a way that some people weren t used to   said a London based recruiter familiar with HSBC  The June restructuring he oversaw after barely a month in the job brought the team covering financial sponsors on to the same floor as those doing leveraged finance  a different source familiar with the move said  as an example of Westerman s push for more direct collaboration   Westerman   whose wife Sian is a senior adviser to investment banking boutique Rothshchild   is an almost omnipresent figure at HSBC s Canary Wharf head office when not travelling the globe  although he plays the odd round of golf and is a trustee of the Imperial War Museum in London

155674,377190,UBSG,Indonesian tax amnesty could spark outflow from Singapore wealth industry,news,"By Saeed Azhar and Marius Zaharia SINGAPORE  Reuters    Singapore s wealth management industry is likely to suffer a bad dent as rich Indonesians move some money back home to take advantage of a tax amnesty  but the exodus of funds isn t going to be as big as Jakarta is predicting  Around  200 billion of Indonesian money that may not have been declared to the tax authorities in Jakarta has been squirreled away in Singapore  according to private banking sources  It is a huge portion of the approximately  470 billion of assets under management by private banks in the financial hub  Consultants  lawyers and bankers closely involved with the industry expect roughly  30 billion to go to Indonesia under the amnesty  which was launched last week and allows all past evasion sins to be forgiven upon the payment of up to 5 percent tax on the money  This is below the  76 billion projected by the Indonesian government and the  42 billion forecast by its central bank  At the Monetary Authority of Singapore s annual news conference on Monday  its managing director Ravi Menon said he doesn t expect big outflows of funds  and he stressed that the city won t be taking any particular action to stem any such transfers  Still  government revenue from taxing  30 billion could still be as much as three times higher than the money recouped during a previous Indonesian tax amnesty in 2008  which only pulled in about  500 million in tax  One of the key reasons for this is that Singapore is becoming a less hospitable place to avoid tax authorities and other arms of government around the world  and there is an increasing likelihood that the Indonesian government will learn more about funds parked in the city anyway  That is because of increasing pressure on Singapore s banks to crack down on laundering of money that is the result of corruption or other illegal acts  and to be more transparent about who they do business with  There is also a global push for more cooperation to avoid tax evasion  especially after the release of the Panama Papers showing the use of offshore shelters by government officials  businessmen and other prominent individuals around the world  The use of Singapore banks by key players in the alleged theft of billions of dollars from the Malaysian government fund 1MDB  highlighted by the U S  government s move last week to freeze assets bought with the money  has only added to the pressure   The difference between this and other tax amnesties is that     there s a big risk that all the information is shared with tax authorities   said Dustin Daugherty  an associate for ASEAN Business Intelligence at Dezan Shira   Associates  a consultancy firm for foreign investors   Because of the timing we might see a bigger impact than normal     We expect 10 15 percent  which should still be considered a success   A Singapore based private banker and a lawyer  both of whom declined to be named  also estimated around 15 percent of the money might move back home  based on feedback from their clients  CURRENCY GYRATIONS Still  while the prospect of paying a small amount to remove the possibility of being hit by big tax evasion charges is enticing  some of the amnesty rules make it unappealing for many  The main hurdle  private bankers say  is a requirement that the money be kept in Indonesia for at least three years once the amnesty is granted  This exposes those moving the money to Indonesia to the gyrations of the Indonesian rupiah  which has dropped more than 20 percent against the U S  dollar in the past three years  Also  the money can only be invested in a list of assets drafted by the government  This includes government bonds  bonds issues by state owned companies and real estate   Getting stuck there for three years is a big concern   said Chris Woo  tax leader at consultants PwC Singapore   Moving money back to Indonesia comes with some peace of mind  but can come at a tremendous cost as well   Furthermore  clients are hesitant because the amnesty rates apply only to historical tax liabilities  Any new income will be taxed at higher rates than in Singapore   for example  the top income rate for individuals in Singapore is 22 percent for income of S 320 000 while in Indonesia it is 30 percent for an income of 500 million rupiah    38 148   Moreover  the private banking advice and opportunities these clients will be able to find in Jakarta would not be as sophisticated as the ones offered in Singapore  and possibly  offer lower returns  bankers and analysts say  It is important to note that Indonesian money began flooding into Singapore s banking system after attacks against ethnic Chinese businesses there and the subsequent fall of the Suharto regime in 1998   so it isn t just about the taxes  
While any amnesty related outflows are not expected to be huge  the move by Indonesia is already taking its toll as Indonesian clients have in the past year put less new money in Singapore  private bankers said   If you show them a private equity idea that gives great returns  the clients will come back to you to say   I need to think about this amnesty first   said a Singapore based private banker at a European bank  For those who hesitate  though  the future may be even bleaker as Singapore is moving to embrace an accord championed by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development  OECD  that calls for the automatic exchange of tax information between countries that sign up to it  The agreement  expected to come into force in 2018  is likely to act as both as an incentive to take up the offer of the amnesty but for some with money in Singapore it could push them to move money to a third country that isn t part of the new transparency pact  according to Jake Robson  Singapore based partner at law firm Morrison   Foerster LLP  Rattled by the 1MDB scandal that has prompted the enforced shutdown of BSI bank in Singapore  and an investigation of a series of other banks  including DBS Group Holdings  SI DBSM    UBS AG  S UBSG  and  Standard Chartered   L STAN   the city state is voicing no tolerance for tax crime   For the long term sustainability of Singapore as a financial center we should really only bank what is widely declared     tax compliant and clean   said Tan Su Shan  co chair of the Singapore Private Banking Industry Group  an industry body  in Singapore  adding the industry was  ready  and supportive  of the bill ",2016-07-25,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/indonesian-tax-amnesty-could-spark-outflow-from-singapore-wealth-industry-416314,416314

155678,377194,UBSG,Europe s boutique firms stealing M A market share  dealmakers  data shows,news,"By Anjuli Davies and Pamela Barbaglia LONDON  Reuters    Boutique advisory firms now receive nearly half of all mergers and acquisition fees in Europe  stealing market share and top dealmakers from global investment banks hamstrung by a renewed focus on cost cutting and regulations on how much they can pay  Founded largely by veterans fleeing bureaucracy and shrinking paychecks at the large banks  these low profile small firms are proving popular among companies who value their niche expertise and independent advice as opposed to mega banks who tend to cross sell other services like financing  Advisory boutiques have captured 44 percent or  1 7 billion of total completed M A deals fees in Europe  Thomson Reuters data collected up to August 10 shows  Boutiques based in Europe captured 24 9 percent  or  964 million  and other boutiques took the other 19 percent  or  728 million  That compares with 42 8 percent for the whole of 2015  30 5 percent at the height of the last M A boom in 2007 and 20 1 percent in 2000  when Thomson Reuters began recording the data  The data excludes some of the massive deals of 2015 that have not yet been completed  including Anheuser Busch InBev s  BR ABI   100 billion plus merger with SABMiller  L SAB     We are not trying to sell multiple products  Our sole focus is on high value add advisory business  and as such we have no conflicts   Pieter Jan Bouten  managing director at Greenhill  one of the early U S  based boutiques to set up in Europe  told Reuters  Boutiques are defined as firms earning greater than 85 percent of their fees from M A and equity capital markets activity  ECM   with M A accounting for at least 70 percent of that wallet    With the number of boutique firms occupying M A league tables at its highest since the 1980s  we can expect the attractiveness of independent advisories  for job seekers  only to increase   said Alex Howard Keyes  Head of Wholesale Financial Services at Alderbrooke  the executive search firm  CROSSING THE ATLANTIC Boutiques have made more progress in stealing business from investment banks in Europe than in the United States  where they accounted for 27 5 percent or  2 billion of total completed M A deals fees so far this year  As a result  more American bankers are crossing the Atlantic to set up shops in Europe and poaching top dealmakers  In July  U S  boutique bank LionTree  founded by former UBS bankers Aryeh Bourkoff and Ehren Stenzler in 2012  hired Jake Donavan from JPMorgan in London  N JPM  to be president of LionTree Europe to grow its business in the region  In 2015  PJT Partners  an independent financial advisory firm led by Paul J  Taubman  the former senior  Morgan Stanley   N MS  dealmaker in New York  hired a raft of bankers to build out his European arm  Last year former senior Goldman Sachs investment banker Gordon Dyal launched his own boutique Dyal Co  which then emerged as the lead advisor to Switzerland s Syngenta  L SYNN  on its sale to ChemChina    Looking ahead  Donavan s move could be the tip of the iceberg when it comes to sell side switches if we see a further proliferation of M A boutiques   Howard Keyes said  Boutiques range from established firms like Lazard and Rothschild to  micro  outfits such as Zaoui   Co  an advisory firm set up by brothers Michael and Yoel  and Robey Warshaw  set up by Simon Robey and Simon Warshaw  former Morgan Stanley and UBS bankers  both based in London   Bankers who leave for these boutiques stand to earn potentially more money if they make a success of it  free from a cap imposed by the European Union after the financial crisis that stipulates that bank bonuses can no longer exceed 100 percent of fixed salaries  or twice that with shareholder approval   Robey Warshaw  which worked on the BG Group and Shell  LON RDSa  merger  has earned  42 million in fees on completed deals in the year to date  ranking it fifteenth in the league tables in Europe  above HSBC  L HSBA   Societe Generale  PA SOC  and  Mediobanca   MI MDBI   The figures do not include fees it expects to reap for its work advising SABMiller and most recently having advised Japan s SoftBank  T 9984  on its acquisition of ARM  L ARM     Boutique expansion is a direct consequence of bulge brackets paying less  adding layers of bureaucracy and admin work for senior people   said one New York based boutique banker  using a colloquial expression for the top banks   In a nutshell working for a bulge bracket is no longer fun    FINANCE MUSCLE Large banks tout their financing muscle as well as their prowess in areas ranging from currency hedging to treasury management to win big M A assignments  But for many M A bankers this just means having to fend off other departments and deal with more bureaucracy   A coverage banker at a bulge bracket is essentially a glorified salesman   said a second boutique banker   To be sure  some of Wall Street s biggest M A banks still maintain a dominant share of fees in Europe  with Goldman Sachs  N GS   JPMorgan  N JPM  and Morgan Stanley  N MS  in the top five in terms of fees earned so far this year  Advisory revenues across European investment banks  Credit Suisse   S CSGN    Deutsche Bank   DE DBKGn  and UBS  S UBSG  fell 21 percent in the second quarter versus a year ago  however  and none are in the top 10 for fees earned on deals completed so far this year   Amid reduced advisory revenue at our competitor group  the trend toward independent M A advisers remains intact   said Greenhill s Bouten    Year to date advisory revenue at Greenhill is up 16 percent  whereas advisory revenue at the big five U S  banks is down slightly and the big European banks are down more   Boutiques on both sides of the Atlantic may struggle to replicate 2015 s phenomenal growth in worldwide M A as activity slows  however   
Megadeals drove global volumes up 41 percent to  4 6 trillion in 2015  but European volumes were up a meager 6 percent to  880 billion from a year earlier and have sunk 20 percent to  409 billion so far this year  Thomson Reuters data showed ",2016-08-14,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/europe's-boutique-firms-stealing-m-amp;a-market-share,-dealmakers,-data-shows-420215",420215

expensive for the  Big Four  at a time when regulators want them to put aside more cash to weather any repeat of the global financial crisis   Raising capital will likely hit profits and make it more difficult for the banks to continue to distribute chunky dividends  which are a key source of revenue stream for shareholders such as the country s pension funds  As revenue growth slows and the risk of loan impairments rise  the downgrade  presents another downside risk for the sector and is likely to impede an improvement in sentiment    Deutsche Bank   DE DBKGn  analyst Andrew Triggs said  The

155717,377233,UBSG,UBS  DBS  Falcon face Singapore scrutiny over 1MDB transactions  sources,news,"By A  Ananthalakshmi and Saeed Azhar
SINGAPORE  Reuters    Singapore s central bank is scrutinizing several banks  including UBS  S UBSG  and DBS Group Holdings  SI DBSM   to see if they broke anti money laundering rules in handling transactions linked to scandal hit Malaysian state fund 1MDB  three people with knowledge of the matter said 
The Monetary Authority of Singapore  MAS  is looking at several aspects of the banks  operations including whether they were diligent enough in knowing who their customers were and what the source of their funds was  and whether they were particularly careful in screening politically exposed persons such as government officials  banking and legal sources aware of the review said 
The probe could lead to fines and other penalties if lapses are found  said the sources who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter  It is unclear which transactions by the banks are being examined 
Switzerland s Falcon Private Bank and Coutts International  which is owned by Geneva based Union Bancaire Privee  are also among the banks under review  they said 
UBS  Coutts  and DBS  which is Singapore s top lender  all declined to comment 
When asked about the MAS review  a Zurich based spokesman for Falcon said   We have transparently shared our view and have nothing to add  
Falcon  which is owned by one of the world s leading sovereign wealth funds   Abu Dhabi s International Petroleum Investment Company  IPIC    has previously said it is in contact with Singapore s central bank and cooperating with authorities 
The MAS is in talks with several banks and will make an announcement on any punitive action against them after the review is completed  sources said  The full details are not known at this stage 
Singapore faces pressure to show that banks in the city state are complying with increasingly tough anti money laundering rules around the world  While the United States has imposed hefty fines on banks for lapses related to money laundering  tax evasion and international sanctions  Asian regulators have been generally slow to act  some lawyers said 
 It is also important for Singapore to be seen to be taking action against any abuse of its private banking sector for money laundering   said Nizam Ismail  Singapore based partner at RHTLaw Taylor Wessing LLP  where he advises clients on financial services regulation and compliance 
An MAS spokeswoman referred Reuters to its statement in March when it had said that  as part of its investigations into possible money laundering and other offences in Singapore  it has been conducting a thorough review of various transactions as well as fund flows through our banking system  
1MDB referred Reuters to its earlier statements  In May  it had said it hadn t been contacted by any foreign lawful authority on matters relating to the company  and that it remains committed to fully cooperating with the authorities 
The latest probes follow MAS s decision in late May to close down the operations of Swiss private bank BSI AG in Singapore for serious breaches of anti money laundering rules  the first time in 32 years it has taken such action against a bank  MAS said then that there had been gross misconduct by some of BSI s staff and poor management oversight of the bank s operations 
Though the MAS did not specifically say this related to 1MDB related transactions  though the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority  FINMA  said at the time that BSI had committed serious breaches of money laundering regulations through business relationships and transactions linked to the corruption scandal surrounding 1MDB 
The MAS also imposed a S 13 3 million   9 9 million  fine on the bank  and on the same day in May  the Swiss authorities said they would seize 95 million Swiss francs   97 million  of BSI s profits 
In response  BSI announced that group CEO Stefano Coduri had stepped down and that it had undertaken steps to strengthen management  including introducing a new chief risk officer and appointing a new group legal counsel 
Malaysian companies and banks linked to 1MDB are at the center of corruption and money laundering probes that have led investigators to look at transactions and financial relationships across the globe   from Malaysia to Singapore and the Seychelles  from Abu Dhabi to offshore companies in the Caribbean  and from the United States to Switzerland 
Probes are being conducted by authorities in the United States  Switzerland  Luxembourg  Singapore  and the United Arab Emirates 
One of the sources said DBS had identified certain questionable financial activities and had voluntarily reported them to the relevant authorities  Reuters couldn t determine what those activities were 
A Malaysian parliamentary investigation made public earlier this year found that  4 2 billion of 1MDB s money was unaccounted for or went to overseas bank accounts whose owners could not be ascertained 
1MDB was founded by Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak in September 2009 to invest in strategic property and energy projects  Najib was the chairman of 1MDB s advisory board until recently 
Malaysia s Attorney General Mohamed Apandi Ali cleared Najib in January of any corruption or criminal offences  He said that  681 million  deposited into Najib s personal account in March 2013 before a Malaysian general election  was a gift from a member of Saudi Arabia s royal family and most of it was returned

155718,377234,UBSG,Singapore to further boost money laundering controls amid 1MDB linked probe,news,"By Saeed Azhar and Marius Zaharia
SINGAPORE  Reuters    Singapore s central bank said it will enhance controls against money laundering and take swift action against banks following damaging findings that financial institutions in the city state handled money flows linked to Malaysian state fund 1MDB 
 There is no doubt that the recent findings have made a dent in our reputation as a clean and trusted financial centre   Ravi Menon  managing director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore  said at its annual news conference on Monday 
 MAS is determined to fix the problem  working together with the industry  
Menon said the central bank will bolster its enforcement  conduct rigorous investigations and take swift action against errant financial institutions 
The comments came after authorities in Singapore announced last week that they had seized S 240 million   177 million  of assets in an investigation of 1MDB related fund flows for possible money laundering 
They also said they found problems at three major banks  top local lender DBS Group Holdings Ltd  SI DBSM   the world s largest private bank UBS AG  S UBSG   and UK based bank  Standard Chartered   L STAN  
An onsite inspection of another Swiss bank  Falcon PBS  owned by one of the world s leading sovereign wealth funds   Abu Dhabi s International Petroleum Investment Company  IPIC   in April 2016 found  substantial breaches  of anti money laundering regulations  the MAS said 
Last week s announcement came after Singapore s central bank said in May it was closing down the Singapore operations of Swiss private bank BSI AG for serious breaches of anti money laundering rules  the first such action in 32 years 
Menon said the central bank would not go into the details of its ongoing investigations into banks and other financial institutions  but it shows that the financial sector is particularly vulnerable to money laundering and illicit financing risks 
The MAS will also take a different tack when it comes to money laundering offences  potentially naming and shaming banks for larger breaches  Menon said  deviating from its past practice of conducting investigations on other offences in private 
Menon said the central bank is exploring the use of machine learning algorithms to identify manipulative trading behaviors in capital markets or to detect money laundering transactions 
 It is neither realistic nor desirable to expect the MAS to police every single transaction or activity in our financial markets   he said   The responsibility lies with every FI  financial institution  to instil high standards of risk management and proper conduct at all levels  
Between 2013 and 2016  the MAS conducted 608 inspections of financial institutions  he said  a six fold increase from 2010 to 2013 ",2016-07-25,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/singapore-to-further-boost-money-laundering-controls-amid-1mdb-linked-probe-416301,416301

155748,377264,UBSG,BSI Singapore shutdown a wake up call for private banks in Asia,news,"By Lisa Jucca and Saeed Azhar HONG KONG SINGAPORE  Reuters    Singapore s drastic move to shut Swiss bank BSI s operations in the city state over its dealings with scandal hit Malaysian fund 1MDB is a wake up call for wealth managers in Asia  which had been spared the large fines and sanctions seen in the West  The private bank is the first casualty of money laundering probes in at least six jurisdictions into state investor 1Malaysia Development Bhd  whose advisory board was chaired by Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak  The Monetary Authority of Singapore  MAS  did not name 1MDB in a statement on Tuesday announcing it was shutting down of BSI s business for  serious breaches of anti money laundering requirements  and  gross misconduct  by some staff  But details from a Swiss probe into 1MDB accuse BSI of routinely failing to carry out required background checks on large sums deposited  In one case  according to the Swiss banking watchdog  BSI was happy to take  20 million after being told by a client the sum was  a gift   In another  it accepted  98 million without any effort to clarify the origin of the funds  While Western countries  in particular the United States  have censured banks including UBS  S UBSG    Credit Suisse   S CSGN    BNP Paribas   PA BNPP  and  Standard Chartered   L STAN  for lapses on tax evasion or international sanctions  Asian regulators had been slow to bare their teeth  The MAS move against BSI  however  signals a willingness to act to protect the reputation of key financial centers in the region  lawyers and bankers said   Asian regulators cannot sit on the sidelines and deal with the issues quietly because of the increasing global nature of these probes   said James Comber  a partner with law firm Ashurst in Hong Kong   No one regulator wants to be seen as failing to take action on its turf   COST PRESSURE Besides ordering the closure of the bank  Singapore authorities said they were evaluating whether five former BSI executives committed criminal offences  Bankers and lawyers expect more regulatory action and believe smaller banks will come under massive cost pressure to ensure they implement adequate compliance   This will send a chilling effect to banks and financial institutions   said Nizam Ismail  partner at RHTLaw Taylor Wessing LLP in Singapore   Their license could be at risk  Worse  there is also the real threat of personal criminal liability   While the United States  and other jurisdictions  started to look closely at money flows in the aftermath of the Sept  11 attacks in 2001  Asia has at times lagged behind  In its last annual report  MAS said it issued nine warnings and reprimands to financial institutions in 2014 and imposed financial penalties on six ranging from S 1 000 to S 700 000   507 320   a far cry from the billions of dollars in fines the United States has imposed on global banks for misbehaving  Hong Kong strengthened its anti money laundering law in 2012  Before that date  the regulator did not have the power to impose fines  lawyers said  In Singapore  rules were toughened further in 2013 and then again last year  But the 1MDB investigation has shown some banks such as BSI were completely disregarding the rules  MAS inspected BSI three times since 2011 and said it found multiple breaches of anti money laundering regulations that reflected a  a pervasive pattern of non compliance   The Swiss probe showed BSI failed to adequately monitor relationships with a client

155774,377290,UBSG,Credit Suisse boss Thiam must show turnaround plan on track,news,By Sinead Cruise  Simon Jessop and Joshua Franklin LONDON ZURICH  Reuters     Credit Suisse   S CSGN  investors want answers from CEO Tidjane Thiam about his turnaround plan in the wake of  1 billion of unexpected trading writedowns at the bank  which has lost more than a third of its value since he joined 10 months ago  Thiam joined last July from  Prudential   L PRU   with investor hopes high that he could repeat the successful Asian expansion strategy he oversaw at the British insurer and that his modest banking experience would bring fresh perspective   But the 53 year old is expected to receive a lukewarm reception at the bank s annual investor meeting in Zurich on Friday  Confidence in his ability to revive the bank s fortunes was shaken when he said he only discovered the scale of the bank s risky credit trading positions days before its fourth quarter results in February  when writedowns were taken  That added to concerns about the bank s wider strategy  Major shareholders have backed it  but some smaller investors and analysts are worried about Credit Suisse s plans to expand in Asian wealth management just as Chinese growth is slowing  Some fear Thiam s targets are too optimistic  including one to more than double pre tax income from Asia Pacific in 2018    He is trying to achieve some tricky things and confidence in him is low  He needs to show a couple of good results to restore confidence  and we know the next quarter won t be great  they are already saying so   said Filippo Alloatti  senior analyst at Hermes Credit    A short period of time won t give him the results he is seeking  I think the thing Thiam needs right now is luck    Switzerland s second largest bank has seen its share price fall around 40 percent since Thiam started  lagging its bigger rival UBS  S UBSG  and underperforming the European banking sector index  SX7P   which has lost about 25 percent   The issue of executive pay   a hot topic following high profile protest votes at recent annual meetings of  BP   L BP   Smith   Nephew  L SN  and  Anglo American   L AAL    is also expected to feature on Friday  The pay votes will likely gain the necessary investor backing but support is expected to waver after some shareholder advisory groups questioned the size of Thiam s bonus  despite him having already asked the board to cut it by 40 percent   He received a bonus of 2 86 million francs   2 96 million  for his six months in the job last year  taking his total cash and share awards from the bank in 2015 to 18 9 million francs   the bulk of which replaced awards lost since his move from Prudential  Advisory groups Ethos  Glass Lewis and zRating recommended investors vote against the company in some or all of the four binding votes over proposed pay for top executives  Ethos recommended that no bonuses be paid to top management at all  while the others oppose parts of the bonus packages  Credit Suisse said it respected shareholder democracy   It is the right of every shareholder to form his personal opinion on every agenda item and to discuss it publicly   a spokeswoman added  ANNUAL LOSS Like its rivals  Credit Suisse has been hurt by tighter regulation  and volatile global markets that have reduced profitability of key investment banking business lines such as trading and advisory  Thiam s untimely grasp of trading liabilities  coupled with worries about execution of the business plan in this tougher environment  have re opened debate about his suitability for the turnaround role    That s one of the downsides in hiring someone who might be brilliant but doesn t have 15  20 years experience in this business   said one of the bank s institutional shareholders  who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue   People had concerns about that at the beginning and this  being caught out by the scale of the trades  certainly doesn t help   Despite presiding over the surprise writedowns and the bank s full year loss in eight years in 2015  some investors have given Thiam their backing   Now that he has made all the set up for the new strategy  he has to carry on and I don t think it would be right to make a judgment so early   said Vincent Kaufmann  CEO of Ethos  which holds Credit Suisse stock in an index fund   Thiam has said he and other senior bank officials were unaware of the size of the positions behind the writedowns but that no trading limits had been breached or trades concealed  On Feb  4  the markets division reported an adjusted pre tax loss of 658 million Swiss francs for the fourth quarter  in which it racked up  633 million in writedowns on illiquid trades  positions that are not easy to sell out of   A further  346 million in writedowns followed in the first quarter as of March 11  the bank disclosed on March 23   Some investors have pointed to the risk of possible legal action against the bank if any shareholders believe they were not adequately informed about the scale of the illiquid trading book before November s 4 7 billion Swiss franc capital raising    I don t think Credit Suisse will be able to move on from this as quickly as they might like  I think there s a real chance of litigation by shareholders   Guy de Blonay  fund manager at Jupiter Asset Management  L JUP   which manages Credit Suisse stock  Responding to request for comment on possible litigation  Credit Suisse said   We have nothing further to add than what we disclosed on 23 March  In connection with our capital increase in November 2015 we published a prospectus that contained all relevant information and relevant disclosures

155824,377340,UBSG,EUR USD continues hot streak  amid dovish hints of delayed Fed rate hike,news,"Investing com    EUR USD rose modestly on Tuesday to continue its recent hot streak  as investors continued to digest dovish comments from an influential Federal Reserve policymaker on the increased possibility of a delayed interest rate hike from the U S  central bank 
The currency pair traded in a broad range between 1 0815 and 1 094  before settling at 1 0918  up 0 0023 or 0 21  on the session  The euro has now closed higher against the dollar in each of the last two sessions and six of its last seven trading days  On the new year  however  the pair is still relatively flat  as the euro is up by roughly 0 50  against its American counterpart since January 1 
EUR USD likely gained support at 1 0538  the low from December 3 and was met with resistance at 1 1496  the high from Oct  15 
On Tuesday  investors continued to react to a closely watched speech by Fed vice chair Stanley Fischer on the possibility that the Federal Open Market Committee could delay its next interest rate hike beyond the first quarter  At an address before the Council of Foreign Relations in New York  Fischer noted that further declines in oil prices and a persistently strong dollar could suggest that inflation will remain lower than the Fed previously anticipated  Fischer eventually expects inflationary pressures to rise once temporary factors from the oil downturn and the appreciation of the dollar dissipate 
Inflation has remained under the Federal Open Market Committee s  FOMC  targeted objective of 2  for every month over the last three years 
The U S  Department of Commerce said on Monday that its Core Price Consumption Expenditures  PCE  index gained 1 4  on an annual basis in December  up from 1 3  a month earlier  The Core PCE index  which strips out volatile food and energy prices  is the Federal Reserve s preferred gauge on inflation 
Fischer declined to comment on the timing of the Fed s next rate hike  Shortly after the FOMC abandoned a seven year zero interest rate policy in December  the vice chair told CNBC that it could be appropriate to expect as many as four interest rate hikes in 2016  Last week  the FOMC left the target range of its benchmark Federal Funds Rate unchanged between 0 25 and 0 50   citing volatility in global financial markets and reduced inflation expectations 
 The world is an uncertain place  and all monetary policymakers can really be sure of is that what will happen is often different from what we currently expect   Fischer said   That is why the Committee has indicated that its policy decisions will be data dependent  
Esther George  Fischer s colleague on the FOMC  offered diverging viewpoints on Tuesday on the Fed s pace of tightening  George  the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City  said at a speech in Missouri that she expects that the economy will improve later this year warranting further rate hikes in 2016  While George noted that the recent volatility in global financial markets was not unexpected  she added that the developments are also  not worrisome   George  a noted hawk  also described the Fed s December lift off as a  late start  following the recovery of the U S  economy and labor market 
The U S  Dollar Index  which measures the strength of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies  fell mildly to an intraday low of 98 79 before rallying to close at 98 97  The index remains near 12 month highs from December  when it eclipsed 100 00

155835,377351,UBSG,Growing trust helps flurry of Sino German deals,news,By Arno Schuetze and Ludwig Burger FRANKFURT  Reuters    A flurry of sales of German and Swiss companies to Chinese buyers in the past month is testament to increasing Chinese expertise in European bidding processes and growing trust  German bankers and advisers say  Those involved in the deals  which include ChemChina s  43 billion agreement to buy Swiss seeds and pesticides group  Syngenta   VX SYNN  and the two biggest ever Chinese acquisitions of German companies  say the two sides are making strides in mutual understanding   China has for years sought to buy in key technology rather than develop it at home more slowly  but attempts to reach deals have often failed   The cultural dimension is very important   said Frank Christian Raffel  Munich based partner in boutique advisory firm MelchersRaffel  which specialises in M A deals between German speaking and Asian countries    One serious issue is a lack of trust on both sides  Whatever one side says is seen by the other as a tactic or a ruse  or is overinterpreted   One Chinese investor became so suspicious on learning that not all of the German target company s top and second tier managers had yet been informed of the talks that the would be investor walked out  seeing it as a sign that key personnel might not stay on after a takeover   For them  the transaction was dead  It took three or four meetings to get the investors back to the table   Raffel said   He added that when a Chinese firm was the target of a Western buyer  it was not unusual for as many as 10 top executives of the Chinese company to be present at M A negotiations   Negotiations in the  walkout  case got back on track  Raffel said  He declined to name the firms involved because the talks are still ongoing but said the target was a family owned automotive supplier with about 120 million euros   136 million  in sales  The traditional nervousness  however  seems to be ebbing  These days an auction process is barely considered complete without at least one Chinese bidder  German bankers say  That can help to keep bids high  as Chinese buyers are often well funded and have their own particular valuation criteria   In the last 24 48 months  the Chinese have become markedly more active and professional in foreign acquisitions  So investment banks now approach the Chinese in virtually every auction   said Jan Masek  co head of mergers and acquisitions at HSBC  l HSBA  in Frankfurt  who advised ChemChina on the Syngenta takeover  alongside China CITIC Bank  Syngenta s advisers were Dyalco   the one man business of former Goldman Sachs  N GS  M A head Gordon Dyal  alongside JP Morgan  N JPM   Goldman Sachs and UBS  VX UBSG   WAVE OF CAPITAL Outbound Chinese M A topped  100 billion for the first time last year  with Europe the biggest target region outside Asia  And Germany is seen as especially attractive for its technology  encouragement of foreign investment and business environment   There are several factors which tilt things towards Germany   said Mikko Huotari  head of the foreign relations program at MERICS  a Berlin based think tank focused on China   We are seeing a new wave of Chinese capital entering Europe  and in particular Germany    In the past month  ChemChina has agreed to buy German industrial machinery maker KraussMaffei for  1 billion  Beijing Enterprises Holdings  HK 0392  to buy Germany s Energy from Waste for 1 44 billion euros   1 62 billion  and Chengdu Techcent Environment Co  300362 SZ  to buy Bilfinger s  DE GBFG  water treatment unit for 200 million euros  Those deals will be dwarfed by ChemChina s planned acquisition of Syngenta  which will be its biggest buy so far in the German speaking world provided a U S  review finds no threat to national security    In the U S  it is getting increasingly difficult to obtain the necessary permissions   says Christian Kames  Citi s Germany investment banking head   The United States last month blocked Philips s  AS PHG  plan to offload a part of its lighting businesses to Asian buyers  Citi is advising private equity firm KKR  N KKR  on the sale of German tableware and coffee machine maker WMF   whose consumer tableware brand is increasingly popular with China s growing middle class  The sale may draw Asian bidders  All these takeovers have in common the acquisition of technology that China needs to shift its economy from lower to higher value production   something Germany has in plenty   With technology gaps in areas such as next generation lighting  automation robotics  environmental technologies and aerospace  we expect to see a continued move to acquire know how in these areas    Barclays   L BARC  analysts wrote in a recent note  Chinese appliances maker Midea Group  000333 SZ  has rapidly built a stake of above 10 percent in German industrial robot maker  Kuka   DE KU2G   while the auction for German lighting group Osram s  DE OSRn  Lamps unit is widely expected to be a contest between Chinese bidders   PITFALLS There are still pitfalls for Chinese companies buying German firms  with language and culture named as the biggest challenges in a survey of German companies and Chinese investors published by consultancy PwC last year   Germans favor a direct communication style with a steady flow of information  Chinese managers  on the other hand  expect large parts of the information to be understood from the context of the conversation   PwC wrote in a publication aimed at Chinese investors in Germany  Against that background  people like Yi Sun   who was born in Shanghai  studied German from the age of 12 and has lived in Germany for 18 years   are in high demand  She is now head of Ernst   Young s China Competence Center for Germany  Switzerland and Austria   The rising number of Chinese takeovers in Europe is also feeding through to the labor market   she said   All M A advisory firms are tearing their hair out to find well educated staff who speak Chinese  German and English   who unfortunately  given the high requirements  are still a rarity

155860,377376,UBSG,Credit Suisse to raise  6 billion as new CEO shows his hand,news,"By Joshua Franklin ZURICH  Reuters     Credit Suisse   VX CSGN  plans to raise 6 billion Swiss francs   6 3 billion  from investors  slim down its investment bank and cut jobs as new chief Tidjane Thiam embarks on the biggest overhaul of the Swiss bank in almost a decade   Credit Suisse is emphasizing wealth management and growing in Asia  echoing moves by rival UBS  VX UBSG   It joins rivals including  Barclays   L BARC  and  Deutsche Bank   DE DBKGn  as well as UBS in scaling back investment banking as tougher regulations squeeze profitability   Thiam  53  hired from insurer  Prudential   L PRU   also said he will float shares in Credit Suisse s domestic Swiss bank and cut 2 billion francs in annual costs  giving his vision for Switzerland s second biggest bank almost four months into the job  He is raising cash to bolster the bank s capital position  which is one of the weakest in the sector  Thiam said the decision had gone down well with regulators in a meeting   When I said I ll certainly recommend a capital raise I could hear the sigh of relief  The temperature went up two or three degrees in the room   Thiam told analysts  Thiam  a former Ivory Coast government minister who replaced American Brady Dougan  said weak quarterly results underscored the Zurich based bank s need for change  Third quarter pretax income fell 34 percent to 861 million francs after the investment bank fell to a 125 million franc loss from a 516 million franc profit a year ago  Analysts welcomed most aspects of Thiam s plans  but said sentiment was soured by the weak results   We see today s announcement to shrink the investment bank  attack the cost base in earnest and simplify group structure will  over time  drive value creation   said Huw van Steenis at  Morgan Stanley   N MS    But a weak Q3 in FICC  fixed income  currencies and commodities  and heavier costs will clearly drag before Credit Suisse puts flesh on the skeletal new plan   Credit Suisse shares fell as much as 5 2 percent and by 1110 ET were down 3 6 percent  The stock has dropped 3 percent this year against a rise of more than 11 percent for UBS   MORE FOCUS Thiam said Credit Suisse would put more focus on managing the fortunes of the world s wealthy  especially in emerging markets  Credit Suisse is the world s fourth biggest private bank and the third biggest in Asia  Thiam  who spearheaded strong growth in Asia in his previous job at Prudential  said he wants to more than double income from Asia to 2 1 billion francs by 2018   He also aims to increase the bank s international wealth management income by 62 percent to 2 1 billion by 2018  and grow income in Switzerland by 44 percent to 2 3 billion  He plans to cut gross costs by 3 5 billion francs by end  2018 and will invest 1 5 billion francs in growth initiatives  to reduce the cost base to between 18 5 billion and 19 billion   The new strategy of focusing on the Swiss market and wealth management is attractive   said Helmut Hipper  a fund manager with Credit Suisse shareholder Union Investment   To shrink the investment bank should create value  The goal of strengthening its Asian footprint is a good idea  but then  how can you do this without acquisitions and how would you pay for those   he added  The bank will reduce the number of its staff in Switzerland by a net 1 600 over the next three years  and will cut the number of its investment bank staff in London  Thiam estimated 1 800 of its London based staff did not need to be in such a costly location   L8N12L1O0  It aims to raise 1 35 billion francs from selling shares to a number of investors at 5 5 percent below their price on Tuesday  and to raise a further 4 7 billion via a rights issue to existing investors   Thiam said the bank s common equity capital adequacy ratio should rise to 12 2 percent of risk adjusted assets  and the bank aims to keep that ratio above 12 percent  By comparison  UBS is one of the strongest capitalized banks in the world  with a common equity ratio of 14 4 percent at the end of June  The average for Europe s 24 biggest banks was 13 2 percent  lifted by high levels at Nordic lenders   Thiam also aims to streamline the bank by creating three geographic divisions  a Swiss universal bank  Asia Pacific  and International wealth management  and two investment bank units  global markets  and investment banking and capital markets  Thiam intends to lower capital used by the investment bank  mainly in its  macro  businesses  which includes foreign exchange and rates trading products  and where the bank plans to reduce risk weighted assets by 72 percent by year end   He said Credit Suisse needed to maintain an investment bank to provide products for the rich individuals his private bank is targeting   This is why they come to us   Thiam said   If you don t have that all you have is people taking them out to lunch  That s not a business model  long term

155894,377410,UBSG,Strategies in the spotlight for trio of new European bank CEOs   ,news,"By Steve Slater and Sinead Cruise LONDON  Reuters    Thousands of jobs cuts  business closures and billions of euros of capital raising are all on the cards as the new bosses of three of Europe s biggest banks respond to pressure to devise new strategies to revive them   Credit Suisse   VX CSGN  Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam  Deutsche Bank s  DE DBKGn  John Cryan and Standard Chartered s  L STAN  Bill Winters are putting the final touches to their plans  which Thiam and Cryan will unveil next month and Winters is expected to deliver in early December  All have been in charge roughly 100 days   a period when new chief executives typically formulate strategy after meeting investors  regulators  politicians  customers and staff  Big job cuts loom in a bid to cut costs and improve profitability   their main target  Cryan is to cut 23 000 staff  or about a quarter of headcount  mostly from disposals  financial sources told Reuters earlier this month  Winters could axe several thousand  sources said  although they said no final decisions had been made and much will depend on disposals  Meanwhile Thiam has said he plans to use his engineering background to take a hard nosed look at efficiency  Senior management ranks are also being shaken up   Winters has named a new management team and is cutting layers of bureaucracy to simplify and speed up decision making while Thiam immediately brought in a long time confidant as his chief of staff and moved a couple more staff  Santander s chairwoman Ana Botin  MC SAN  said this week changes she had made in her first 12 months had  laid the foundations for the bank we want for the next 10 years   and said 21 of her top 31 management team are new or have new roles  Thiam  Cryan and Winters  all in their early 50s  each needs to undo mistakes made by predecessors and shrink their banks to reduce complexity and get out of business areas that no longer make money  Other banks  including CEO less  Barclays   L BARC  and Italy s UniCredit  MI CRDI   are also going through the process  but new CEOs are under pressure to come in with a fresh view to take bold action   All are high caliber  but they need to hurry up and make decisions about their business and markets while they are still learning a lot about them   one senior banker said  All three CEOs declined requests for interviews  But here is their thinking on key issues  according to public comments and interviews with sources at banks  investors and analysts  FIRST 100 DAYS    The three CEOs have all gathered with their boards and senior bankers this month   opting for hotel retreats in Bavaria  Switzerland and Singapore   to discuss plans  They have made some big changes in their first two to three months and given broad signals on where their priorities lie in messages to staff and at second quarter results  Winters halved his bank s dividend after a slump in second quarter profits laid bare the scale of the challenge he faces   Cryan said he planned to stick with  Strategy 2020   which includes reducing the size of the investment bank and selling its Postbank retail bank and cutting other parts of the retail chain  He also said there were plenty of businesses that could still be changed  quite significantly   And all three are expected to cut their investment bank operations  especially fixed income trading   THE PERSONAL TOUCH Thiam has impressed with a confident start  analysts said  The multi linguist has said he would be  ruthlessly selective  about what the bank does  driven by adding shareholder value  Thiam  a former Ivory Coast government minister who previously ran UK insurer  Prudential   L PRU  for six years  wants a capital light bank and is expected to put more focus on Asia   This is a CEO with a track record  a very successful track record at Prudential  He s seen as a remarkable asset allocator  particularly in terms of distributing capital towards regions where he sees growth  and reducing capital headed for areas in which he doesn t see the same growth   said Guy de Blonay  a manager of the Jupiter Global Financial Opportunities Fund  He owns shares in Credit Suisse and was previously an investor in  Deutsche Bank  and  Standard Chartered   Winters  a dual U S  and British citizen who ran JPMorgan s  N JPM  investment bank and was a member of a UK government commission that recommended how banks should be made safer  said Standard Chartered was  a special bank  but has its problems  It had been too focused on growth and not on returns for investors  Its risk assessment had been poor and it had been  too slow to take hard decisions  whether on costs  people  or strategy   he told analysts  Cryan  a former UBS  VX UBSG  finance director  also said complexity and costs were stifling his bank   This is the first time ever that you had the feeling that somebody is talking straight   said one person familiar with the bank   But the problem is he has to deliver soon   At his first supervisory board meeting as CEO in July in New York he kept quiet and took a lot of notes  but at this month s meeting in Bavaria he talked a lot and listed all the problems and weak points for the bank   but without giving his solutions  according to people at the meetings  CASHCALL  Meanwhile all three banks could do with more capital  analysts say  Each has a capital solvency ratio above its regulatory requirements  but are relatively weak compared with rivals  They could opt for a major rights issue  a less disruptive smaller fundraising of several billion dollars or try to build equity capital by retaining earnings and cutting assets   less painful but potentially holding back on any growth plans  However  depressed share prices at Deutsche Bank and Standard Chartered make a highly dilutive rights issue unlikely  analysts and investors said  Deutsche Bank already raised 8 5 billion euros last year  while Winters might prefer a quick fire share sale to raise  3 billion  they said  Thiam is more likely to raise cash swiftly  bankers reckon  and he told staff on his first day the bank needed a strong balance sheet to help it through rough times  
Credit Suisse s common equity capital ratio of 10 3 percent of risk adjusted assets is well below that of arch rival UBS and investors said raising  6 billion or more should be supported if it is accompanied by a positive growth story when he steps up on Oct  21   With additional reporting by Kathrin Jones in Frankfurt and Joshua Franklin in Zurich  Editing by Greg Mahlich ",2015-09-27,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/strategies-in-the-spotlight-for-trio-of-new-european-bank-ceos-363416,363416

155924,377440,UBSG,UK takes one billion pounds hit in RBS sell off,news,By Steve Slater LONDON  Reuters    Britain took a 1 1 billion pound   1 7 billion  loss on its first sale of shares in Royal Bank of Scotland  RBS   L RBS  on Tuesday  sparking accusations of poor timing from opposition politicians   The UK government sold a 5 4 percent stake in RBS at 330 pence per share  a third below the price paid when Britain rescued the bank with 45 8 billion pounds of taxpayer cash at the peak of the 2007 09 financial crisis  The move raised 2 1 billion pounds and is expected to be followed by several more sales  Overall  the government is sitting on a 15 billion pound loss on its holding  based on the current stock price and its average purchase price of 502 pence  But the sale was more about starting the process of returning RBS to the private sector and showing investors the government is reducing its interference in the bank  rather than avoiding a loss  people familiar with the decision told Reuters   While the easiest thing to do would be to duck the difficult decisions and leave RBS in state hands  the right thing to do for the economy and for taxpayers is to start selling off our stake   Finance Minister George Osborne said  But the opposition Labour Party slammed the sale    RBS had to be bailed out urgently  but it doesn t have to be sold off at the same speed   said Chris Leslie  its finance spokesman   The Chancellor  Osborne  needs to justify his haste in selling off a chunk of RBS while the bank is still awaiting a U S  settlement for the mis selling of sub prime mortgages   Leslie added  referring to a potentially massive fine from U S  authorities  related to RBS s past sales of U S  mortgages   RBS has set aside 2 1 billion pounds for a settlement but analysts estimate it could cost as much as 9 billion pounds  which has weighed on the stock   The share sale  which cuts taxpayers  holding to 72 9 percent from 78 3 percent  marks a milestone in Britain s recovery from the financial crisis  and is part of Osborne s strategy to improve the country s finances   MORE POWER  The move had been on the cards since Osborne in June accelerated the timetable for selling RBS  after his Conservative Party won May s national election with a surprise majority  giving his party more power in government  He has lost no time since then in pressing on with his plans for Britain s economy  including the sale of more shares in Lloyds Banking Group  L LLOY  and a budget that included a shift away from welfare spending to higher wages for workers   Osborne aims to sell at least three quarters of its RBS holding  currently worth about 25 billion pounds  in the next five years  UK Financial Investments  UKFI   the body that holds the stake  said it sold 630 million shares in a quick fire sale to institutional investors after the market closed on Monday  slightly more than it had planned to sell  The sources said other benefits of the sale are that it increases liquidity in the stock and shows there is investor appetite  particularly in Britain and the United States  which accounted for 85 percent of demand  one source said  More and bigger sales to institutions are likely  but UKFI could also opt for a trading plan that involves small frequent sales in the market  or a sale to retail investors  The 2 3 percent discount to RBS s closing price on Monday  at which the shares were sold  was narrower than the 3 1 percent discount on the government s first sale of Lloyds shares in September 2013  At 1215 GMT  RBS shares were down 0 9 percent at 334 7 pence  outperforming a weak European banking index  SX7P   Investors put in bids for 2 4 times more than the number of RBS shares sold by the government  a person familiar with the matter said  RBS CEO Ross McEwan said he was pleased the sell down had begun  adding it reflected the progress the bank had made  to become a stronger  simpler and fairer bank   RBS was briefly the world s biggest bank by assets  but has more than halved its assets and the size of its investment bank and sold businesses around the world  Britain has sold down its stake in Lloyds at a profit over the past two years and now holds less than 14 percent  The taxpayer could make at least 2 billion pounds on the Lloyds bailout  also at the height of the financial crisis  The RBS sale was handled by  Citigroup   N C   Goldman Sachs  N GS    Morgan Stanley   N MS  and UBS  VX UBSG  ,2015-08-04,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/uk-starts-rbs-sell-off-with-$3.3-billion-stake-sale-354312,354312
155925,377441,UBSG,Swiss banks step up battle for Asia s super rich ,news,"By Joshua Franklin and Lawrence White ZURICH HONG KONG  Reuters    UBS s giant banner on Hong Kong s One Peking Road skyscraper  so big it has drawn complaints for keeping solar panels in the shade  is a testament to the renewed push among Swiss banks to win business from Asia s burgeoning ranks of millionaires  Switzerland s wealth managers have long courted Asia s super rich amid slowing growth at home and an international crackdown on its bank secrecy rules that has made the country a less attractive place to keep cash  But the competition has recently shifted up a gear  with the new boss of  Credit Suisse   VX CSGN  signaling he wants to embark on a similar path to cross town rival UBS  VX UBSG   which in 2011 chose to shrink its investment bank and focus on the more stable wealth management business  especially in Asia   Everybody wants to be in Asia   said Andreas Brun  a banking analyst at Switzerland s Zuercher Kantonalbank  ZKB    It s not a sudden thing but they suddenly talk about it as the main strategy   The attractions are obvious  with a recent slowdown in growth still leaving many Asian economies far outpacing Western counterparts  Boston Consulting Group  BCG  forecasts private wealth in the Asia Pacific  excluding Japan  will grow on average by 9 7 percent a year through to 2019  more than double the rate in Western Europe   According to the latest Asia Pacific Wealth Report published in October by Capgemini and RBC Wealth Management  the region s population of high net worth individuals    defined as those with investable assets of  1 million or more  excluding primary residence  collectibles  consumables  and consumer durables    grew 17 percent to 4 3 million in 2013  while their wealth grew 18 percent to  14 2 trillion  That compared with growth rates of 13 percent and 12 percent respectively in the rest of the world  But turning Asian riches into profitable business is no easy task for wealth managers   Asia s growing ranks of self made millionaires and billionaires are proving more active in managing their wealth than Europeans living off inheritances  regularly playing banks against each other to get the best deal   It s their own money  not the money of the father or grandfather   noted ZKB s Brun   Asia s super rich also tend to spread their money out over six banks or so     Asia is a highly banked market   said Claude Haberer  head of Swiss bank Pictet s wealth management business in Asia   Asians are willing to try out a bank but you have to explain what you bring to the table   And wealth managers are increasingly having to offer inflated pay packets to poach bankers in a region where demand for talent exceeds supply   Those who make it in the Asian market are those who are willing to invest significantly   Haberer said   There is definitely an issue of minimum size  below which you just cannot pay the entry ticket   Private banks in the Asia Pacific typically need assets under management of more than  20 billion to be profitable  according to consultancy EY  To bulk up quickly  banks could look to acquisitions   In recent years  Julius Baer has bought Merrill Lynch s wealth management business outside of the United States  while Union Bancaire Privee has snapped up Coutts International  Both purchases helped the banks beef up their presence in Asia       COURTING CLIENTS Leading the pack in size at the moment is UBS  the biggest wealth manager by assets globally and in the Asia Pacific  which BCG estimates will overtake North America in 2016 as the world s wealthiest region  In 2014  UBS managed  272 billion in the Asia Pacific region  according to a study from magazine Asian Private Banker  Citi s  N C  private bank and Credit Suisse rounded out the top three with assets of  255 billion and  154 billion respectively  But competition is heating up  with Credit Suisse s Asia Pacific CEO Helman Sitohang saying the bank was targeting the region s growing population of entrepreneurs   Judging by its giant Hong Kong banner  unveiled earlier this year as part of the bank s largest outdoor advertisement in the world  UBS is determined to defend its lead   Edmund Koh  the head of UBS s wealth management business in southeast Asia and Asia Pacific hub  said Credit Suisse faced a challenge to catch up   They say Asia is an important market going forward   he said   For us  it has and will always be an important market   Koh hopes the Asia Pacific will contribute at least one third of UBS s private bank profits by 2017  compared with just under 30 percent now  With almost 1 200 relationship managers  according to Asian Private Banker  UBS has more than twice as many bankers in Asia than any other wealth manger  Credit Suisse s Sitohang told Reuters the bank would consider raising headcount in the region  though retaining bankers can be just as important as hiring new ones   In the past  poaching advisers in the hope clients would move with them has been one way for banks to grow in Asia  This is less the case after the financial crisis spooked investors from moving their money around too much  according to Andrew Hendry  asset manager M G Investments s Asia managing director  
 One CEO of a private bank said in his experience of losing bankers  only about 30 percent of clients go with them   he said   Pre 2008  you re looking at anything around 70 80 percent  ",2015-08-09,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/swiss-banks-step-up-battle-for-asia's-super-rich-355134,355134

155960,377476,UBSG, Brexit  fears haunt London s roaring trade in euros,news,"By Guy Faulconbridge
LONDON  Reuters    If there is a symbol of British ambivalence to Europe then it may be the euro itself 
The capital of euro trading prospers outside the euro zone  but London s dominance of the  5 3 trillion a day foreign exchange market could wane if Britain left the European Union 
    While British leaders have long resisted replacing pounds with euros  traders in the City of London financial center now buy and sell more than twice as many euros as the whole 19 member euro zone and more dollars than the United States 
    For four decades  London has been the undisputed king of foreign exchange  but some investors fear that if British voters decide to leave the EU  the City would eventually lose its top position  especially in euro trading 
     If  the UK left the European Union  London s dominance of foreign exchange including euro trading would gradually decline and then end as the flows moved to Asia and other European capitals   U S  investor Jim Rogers  who co founded the Quantum Fund in 1973 with George Soros  told Reuters 
     London s dominance of the foreign exchange market evolved  historically but evolution will continue in other places if the UK leaves  It would be foolish to leave the EU  but politicians have done foolish things since the beginning of  time  
    Twelve years after Rogers left Quantum in 1980  Soros used the fund to bet successfully that sterling was overvalued against the Deutsche Mark  culminating in Britain s biggest financial humiliation since the sterling crisis of 1976 
    On so called  Black Wednesday   Sept  16  1992  Prime Minister John Major was forced to pull sterling out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism  ERM   which had been intended to reduce exchange rate fluctuations ahead of monetary union 
    Fast forward two decades  European efforts to forge an enduring monetary union are at the center of a debate within the London elite about post imperial Britain s place in Europe and whether it might not be worth striking out alone 
    The shadow of the euro falls across Prime Minister David Cameron s attempt to renegotiate Britain s relationship with Europe  then hold a referendum on membership by the end of 2017 
 
 KING OF FOREX 
    Sold sedately for centuries at the Royal Exchange opposite the Bank of England  foreign exchange is now traded at high speed among mostly foreign banks such as Citi  N C    Deutsche Bank   DE DBKGn    Barclays   L BARC   JPMorgan  N JPM  and UBS  VX UBSG  
    London accounts for 41 percent of global foreign exchange turnover  more than double the nearest competitor  New York  according to the Bank for International Settlements  London s closest European competitors are Switzerland and Paris  which each take about 3 percent of global foreign exchange turnover 
Yet London wasn t always king of forex  The hegemony of the pound sterling in the British empire meant that before 1914  London played second fiddle in forex to Paris  Vienna  Berlin and New York 
    And London s rise was partly due to good fortune 
    As the center for global dollar trading  it benefited from the greenback s rise  The growth of international banking during the 1950s and 1960s put it in pole position to benefit from the foreign exchange trading boom when floating exchange rates were adopted in the early 1970s 
Since UK exchange controls were scrapped in 1979  London has thrived as a center for everything from foreign exchange and bonds to derivatives and fund management  making it the largest net exporter of financial services in the world 
    By the end of that decade Britain was top  and its dominance has strengthened ever since  Though the euro s introduction reduced the number of currencies traded  London emerged as the global center for the most traded currency pair  EUR USD 
     If Britain left the EU  that trade is gone   said one senior European diplomat  waving his hand   The first thing Berlin and Paris would do is to sit down and say   How do we bring that business back   
 TREASURE ISLAND 
London offers by far the deepest pool of capital in the time zone between Asia and the United States  but also a feast for the global merchant  property rights  a small army of lawyers and accountants  luxury property and shopping  quality private education and a wider cultural renaissance unmatched in Europe 
To be sure  London s trading cables and wider pull  combined with institutional inertia  mean that any shift to the continent after a so called  Brexit  would be gradual 
 The wires that make the trading of FX electronic are all in London and so a quick move from the UK to Europe would require infrastructure spending   said Robert Savage  the CEO of CC Track Solutions  a New York based hedge fund with  100 million under management 
But over the longer term  he sees foreign exchange trading moving away from London and Europe if Britain leaves the EU 
 The volume of business in FX is likely to shift from the EU and UK to the U S  and Asia   Savage said   Big picture  the flow of capital is the driver of FX markets and the Asian centers are on the rise  
Britain s allies say leaving the world s biggest trading bloc would be foolhardy  leaving London s financial powerhouse subject to rules it would no longer influence and turning it into an insignificant offshore  Treasure Island  
Opponents of the EU say London would thrive outside  They note that doomsters cried wolf in the 1990s  warning that London would wither as a financial center if Britain didn t dump sterling and join the euro  That did not come to pass 
For Eurosceptics  the five year euro zone debt crisis and Greece s near bankruptcy are evidence of a flawed monetary union that is doomed unless it integrates more deeply  a step that would consign Britain to the sidelines 
 REMORSELESS LOGIC 
    Cameron had a front row seat for Black Wednesday as a 25 year old adviser to Britain s then finance minister  Norman Lamont  He has promised to keep Britain out of the euro forever  and few British voters would countenance dropping sterling 
    That leaves Britain firmly outside the increasingly influential 19 nation euro zone core of the broader 28 member EU  Greece s fate was determined by Germany and France  not Britain  which has refused to contribute to any fresh bailout 
    Cameron is now set on defending the City from what his finance minister calls the  remorseless logic  of euro zone integration 
     We  almost alone among the non euro members  have no commitment to join the single currency   and no realistic prospect of wanting to do so   that most powerful minister  George Osborne  told London financiers last month 
    Osborne  who is Cameron s heir apparent  said Britain wants  fairness between the euro ins and the euro outs enshrined  and the integrity of the single market preserved  
    Euro zone rules must not hurt British interests  he said 
The government s worry is that Britain may eventually be one of the only EU members outside the euro  It can already be outvoted on regulatory issues by the euro zone if all 19 members vote together as a bloc  which they rarely do 
    The risk was underlined by an attempt by the European Central Bank to force clearing houses for major euro assets to relocate from London to the euro zone 
    Britain challenged the ECB  and the EU s Luxembourg based General Court ruled in March that the central bank did not have the  competence  to impose such a requirement  Things might look different if Britain were no longer an EU member 
 LEFT BEHIND  
   Since joining the European Economic Community in 1973  British leaders have repeatedly underestimated the political will for European monetary union that led to the birth of the euro on the stroke of midnight heralding 1999 
    When the Berlin Wall fell in 1989  Margaret Thatcher opposed the French idea that a common currency was the best way to tether a united Germany to Europe  though she eventually signed Britain up to the ERM in October 1990 
    She was deposed the following month  after her finance minister  Geoffrey Howe  resigned with a stark warning that Britain risked being  left behind  on monetary union 
    Thatcher s successor  Major  declared  game  set and match for Britain  after securing the right to opt out of a single currency at the 1991 Maastricht summit   less than a year before Black Wednesday 
    When Tony Blair won the 1997 election  his finance minister  Gordon Brown  effectively ruled out euro entry by setting out five economic tests that had been worked out with his top aide  Ed Balls  in a New York taxi 

How long Britain can sustain its balancing act of profiting from euro trading while staying out of the currency may depend on the outcome of Cameron s referendum ",2015-07-22,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/'brexit'-fears-haunt-london's-roaring-trade-in-euros-352363,352363

156042,377558,UBSG,Credit Suisse poaches Prudential s Thiam for Asian push,news,"By Joshua Franklin  Carolyn Cohn and Lisa Jucca ZURICH LONDON HONG KONG  Reuters     Credit Suisse  has swooped on  Prudential  boss Tidjane Thiam to lead the Swiss bank in a push to manage more of the wealth held by Asia s fast growing club of multi millionaires  Thiam  a 52 year old former Ivory Coast government minister  will replace American chief executive Brady Dougan  who has drawn fire for failing to reform the bank and scale back its risky investment banking business fast enough  In a sign of Thiam s standing with investors  news of his move added almost  3 billion to Credit Suisse s market value on Tuesday and cut Prudential s by nearly  2 billion   As Prudential  L PRU  boss   and the first black head of a FTSE 100 company   Thiam has built up a strong Asian track record  expanding the British based insurer s sales in the region since 2009 and trebling its share price in the process  While Thiam has never run a bank  shareholders and analysts regard his experience in dealing with financial regulators as a strength while lenders must implement a blitz of new rules imposed following the global financial crisis  Dougan  55  had been criticized for not paring back Credit Suisse s  VX CSGN  investment bank enough after the introduction of global regulations forcing banks to hold more capital so that they could survive another crisis  Chairman Urs Rohner said the bank would press on with its current strategy under Thiam  a multi linguist whose private interests range from soccer to Russian literature   As you know  we have a strategy of growing the wealth management business   Rohner said  adding that he wanted a more balanced allocation of the bank s capital between the wealth management and the investment banking businesses   It is not about a fundamental redirection   he told a news conference  Thiam was guarded on his plans   Credit Suisse has been successful but I don t know an organization that doesn t need change   he said   There are things that need to be improved  I m not in a position to go any further in the answer   Credit Suisse s shares closed up 7 76 percent  adding  2 93 billion to its market value  while Prudential s lost 3 1 percent  wiping  1 99 billion from its capitalization  He was hailed as a star by the Swiss media  with tabloid Blick dubbing him the  Obama of Credit Suisse  whose appointment was a sign of Switzerland s openness to the world  Tages Anzeiger said Thiam might be much better suited to lead Credit Suisse than Dougan  an outsider in Switzerland whose departure was  long overdue   Under Dougan  Credit Suisse survived the crisis without resorting to a taxpayer funded bailout  But he faced calls to quit last year when the bank reached a  2 5 billion settlement with U S  authorities for helping Americans to evade taxes via secret bank accounts  He will leave at the end of June after 25 years at the bank and eight as CEO  when he was one of the world s highest paid bankers with his salary topping 90 million Swiss francs   91 million  in one year  More recently  he had embarked on several rounds of cost cutting   Thiam has no banking experience but it could be that an outsider can make some of the decisions they were not able to make internally   said one investor in Credit Suisse  who asked not to be named   Thiam left Ivory Coast in his early 30s following a coup and joined consulting firm McKinsey   Co in Paris   making him now the third ex McKinsey member on Credit Suisse s 10 strong executive board  People who have worked with him said he has a sharp intellect and deals well with regulators and colleagues  While at Prudential  Thiam failed in an attempt to take over Asian focused insurer AIA  HK 1299  in 2010 after a shareholder rebellion  Nevertheless  he successfully concentrated on Asia to drive profits  His recruitment raises expectations that he will cut Credit Suisse s investment bank hard at last  Its European rivals such as UBS  VX UBSG  have been faster to shrink this business and focus on other areas of strength   Thiam s background in insurance and asset management suggests Credit Suisse s focus is moving increasingly away from investment banking   said a UK based fund manager  who was reviewing his position after selling the bank s shares on concerns about capital requirements   BUILDING BRIDGES Dougan s departure leaves JP Morgan s  N JPM  Jamie Dimon and Goldman Sachs s  N GS  Lloyd Blankfein as the only two global banking CEOs still in place since the 2008 09 crisis   The Credit Suisse board backed Dougan over the U S  settlement  under which the bank pleaded guilty to criminal charges but kept its New York license  However  he was criticized by some politicians and media in Switzerland  Thiam has the languages to help build bridges with Swiss politicians wary of bankers after having to bail out UBS  He addressed his first Credit Suisse news conference in German and French as well as English  A fan of English football club Arsenal  he lists  The Brothers Karamazov  by 19th century Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoyevsky as his favorite book and his top song is Tadieu Bone by Ismael Lo  a guitarist from Senegal  his father s country   Asked on a BBC radio show two years ago how he felt leading people  Thiam said   It s a bit like walking a tightrope because you feel all these expectations around you and it s rarely comfortable  If you really believe in what it is you are trying to achieve it helps you go through a journey and walk without looking down   Prudential  Britain s largest insurer by market value  confirmed Thiam s departure as it reported a 14 percent rise in operating profit in 2014  The firm said a successor has been identified and would be announced after the regulatory approval process  Thiam is expected to remain in place until after first quarter results are released in May  The insurance

156112,377628,UBSG,Bankers say big is beautiful  safe and economic,news,"By Alexander Smith DAVOS  Reuters    Europe s bankers defended the big bank model this week in Davos as the mounting cost of regulation puts a question mark over its future  Big complex banks must now hold far more capital than in the past because they are seen as posing higher economic risks and they have to be easier to dismantle if they hit trouble  That has hurt their profitability and held back share prices  JPMorgan  N JPM   the biggest U S  bank by assets  has faced growing pressure to consider a break up  and similar questions are being put to less profitable European rivals such as Deutsche Bank  DE DBKGn   Barclays  L BARC  and Credit Suisse  VX CSGN    JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon last week said splitting his bank would be bad for the financial prestige of the United States  and he won support from his peers at this week s World Economic Forum in Davos   Is there a better model  Those of us who are large have always faced questions   said Douglas Flint  chairman of HSBC  L HSBA   Europe s biggest bank by market value   If we were asked the same question  as JPMorgan on breaking up  we would give the same answer   Pressure has built on JPMorgan since it emerged in December that it could require more than  20 billion of extra capital to meet tougher U S  rules on big banks  Banks around the globe are having to consider radical ways to cut costs and change their size and shape as they come out of the worst year since 2008 for investment banking revenues and remain under what Dimon called an  assault  from regulators  In Europe  banks have still not returned to economic profit since the financial crisis  according to a study by Boston Consulting Group   Many so called universal banks are being valued by stock markets at much lower than their net worth on their balance sheets  or the  book value  of their assets  JPMorgan shares are trading at 0 9 times the bank s book value and Citigroup  N C  trades on 0 7 times  In contrast  Wells Fargo  N WFC   which is mostly reliant on U S  retail and commercial banking  trades on 1 6 times its book value  Barclays shares trade at 0 7 times book value and Deutsche Bank trades at barely half book  whereas Lloyds Banking Group  L LLOY   a UK focused retail bank  trades on 1 2 times   While banks went on the defensive in Davos  behind the scenes changes are afoot  Deutsche Bank is considering splitting off its retail division and Barclays boss Antony Jenkins has said the universal banking model is dead   TOO SMALL TO PROSPER   Universal banks benefit from selling asset management and capital markets products to wealthy clients and companies  but bankers admit there are far fewer benefits from cost savings or cross selling than in the past  Many corporate clients still wanted strong national or regional firms  however  bankers said   We have become a global  multi product bank because clients want it   Deutsche Bank co CEO Anshu Jain said during a panel discussion on the future of banking on Wednesday  Despite brickbats from some politicians  there remains strong support for large national banks in countries including the United States  Germany  France and Italy   Shouldn t we have concerns about banks that are too small to prosper   said Italian Economy Minister Pier Carlo Padoan in response to a question from Reuters on whether banks should be broken up  Urs Rohner  chairman of Credit Suisse  also saw little merit in splitting firms up   Breaking up banks will not do anything to make the system safer   he said  But it is investors who will ultimately call the shots if returns don t improve  
 The pressure to restructure is moving from the public sector to the private sector   said Bob Penn  partner at Allen   Overy in London   It s a cold  logical  analytical decision that at some point the incremental costs of regulation exceed the costs associated with breaking up  ",2015-01-22,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/bankers-say-big-is-beautiful,-safe-and-economic-324707",324707
