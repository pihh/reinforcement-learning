everyone  I hope you had a good start to the new year  Welcome to our fourth quarter 2019 earnings call  as we review our results  strategic new business activities  key accomplishments and our outlook for 2020  I will begin by expressing my gratitude to our entire Lockheed Martin team for a remarkable 2019 Over the course of the year  the corporation achieved extraordinary sales growth  earnings performance  strong cash generation and record backlog  And it was through their dedication and commitment that we were able to deliver these results Ken will discuss our financials in more detail and provide our outlook for 2020  but I d like to begin by discussing a few of the highlights from 2019 that drove our strong performance  Notably  for the second year in a row  all four of our business areas grew sales  earnings and backlog with each contributing to our record cash from operations Sales in the fourth quarter exceeded last year s fourth quarter by 10  and pushed 2019 growth to 11  over our 2018 results  Missiles and Fire Control had the highest overall growth in 2019  exceeding the prior year by 20   Deliveries of tactical and strike weapons  development work on new hypersonic and classified programs  and PAC 3 missile production were the strongest contributors to the increase  Aeronautics also saw strong sales growth in the quarter and year with 2019 annual sales finishing 12  above 2018  led by our F 35 program  which grew 14  in 2019 In space  the Next Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared or next gen OPIR contract  the GPS III satellite production program and recent hypersonic wins continue to provide increased sales volume as the business area exceeded their 2018 top line by 11   and Rotary and Mission Systems finished the year 6  over 2018  driven by increases in shipbuilding  radar and logistics programs  Our segment profit grew nearly  700 million year over year  resulting in a segment profit margin of 11  and earnings per share of  21 95  which was another high watermark for the corporation This quarter  our backlog increased  6 6 billion and is now approximately  144 billion  reaching a record level for the fifth consecutive year  And we had a strong quarter of cash flows  allowing us to use  1 billion to pre fund our required 2020 pension contribution and a portion of our 2021 payment and still generate over  7 3 billion of cash from operations for the entire year  Had we not made this discretionary payment to our pension trust  we would have delivered over  8 3 billion in operating cash  well in excess of our greater than  7 6 billion objective 2019 was an extraordinary year across the corporation  with our team achieving record results in sales  earnings  EPS  cash from operations and backlog  The strength of our portfolio has us well positioned to continue delivering mission success for our customers  and outstanding value to our stockholders Before reviewing significant accomplishments from each business area  I will start with an update on the F 35 program  which had an especially successful quarter and year During the fourth quarter  our F 35 team delivered 51 fighter jets  bringing the total deliveries in 2019 to 134 aircraft  exceeding our joint government and industry target of 131 aircraft  a nearly 50  improvement from last year and a 200  increase from 2016  Since the program s inception  we have delivered 491 production aircraft with 347 jets being provided to US forces and the balance of 144 planes being delivered to our partner nations and international foreign military sales customers Keeping with the F 35  we were pleased that we finalized our agreement for lots 12 and 13 this quarter  recognizing orders of approximately  5 billion and adding 112 aircraft to our backlog  bringing our backlog to 374 planes  We anticipate finalizing lot 14 in early 2020  Our joint industry and government team have established a long standing objective of offering the F 35 a model at a flyaway cost of  80 million in lot 14  and we were able to improve on that target one year ahead of schedule  The lot 14 unit price is now below  78 million  which allows us to offer this remarkable fifth generation fighter at a price equal to or lower than legacy fourth generation aircraft Internationally  we were very excited to see Norway declare initial operational capability with its fleet of F 35 conventional takeoff and landing aircraft  Since the first F 35 model arrived at Orland main air station in 2017  the Norwegian Air Force has conducted a rigorous operational testing program in unique winter and Northern environmental conditions and has deemed it ready for combat Norway is the third European country and the fifth international customer to declare  Technical Issues OperatorLadies and gentlemen  we apologize for the inconvenience  We will be restarting the call in just a moment Greg Gardner    Vice President of Investor RelationsThanks  John OperatorAnd you are reconnected  Please continue Greg Gardner    Vice President of Investor RelationsThis is Greg Gardner  apologies for the technical difficulties  Thank you for your patience  We re going to commence again with the call  pick it up with Marillyn talking about the F 35  Thank you  Marillyn Marillyn A  Hewson    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Craig  So I ll just pick up again  some of this  I ll just repeat  It s very short  But I just want to cover F 35 update before I move into the operate    other operational highlights So I ll start with an update on the F 35  which had an especially successful quarter and year  During the fourth quarter  our F 35 team delivered 51 fighter jets  bringing the total deliveries in 2019 to 134 aircraft  exceeding our joint government and industry target of 131 aircraft  a nearly 50  improvement from last year and a 200  increase from 2016  Since the program s inception  we have delivered 491 production aircraft  with 347 jets

finalized our agreement for lots 12 and 13 this quarter  recognizing orders of approximately  5 billion and adding 112 aircraft to our backlog  bringing our backlog to 374 planes  We anticipate finalizing lot 14 in early 2020  Our joint industry and government team have established a long standing objective of offering the F 35A model at a flyaway cost of  80 million in lot 14  and we were able to improve on that target one year ahead of schedule  The lot 14 unit price is now below  78 million  which allows us to offer this remarkable fifth generation fighter at a price equal to or lower than legacy fourth generation aircraft Internationally  we were very excited to see Norway declare initial operational capability with its fleet of F 35 conventional takeoff and landing aircraft  Since the first F 35A model arrived in Orland main air station in 2017  the Norwegian Air Force has conducted a rigorous operational testing program in unique water and Northern environmental conditions and has deemed it ready for combat  Norway is the third European country and the fifth international customer to declare IOC  a critical milestone for Norway and the entire F 35 team Also this quarter  the Dutch armed forces welcomed the arrival of their first F 35 to sovereign soil in a celebration attended by more than 4 000 people at Leeuwarden    sorry Airbase  Leeuwarden Airbase  The Netherlands has been a key partner in the F 35 program and including the eight aircraft still stationed in the US for training and testing purposes has now taken delivery of nine CTOL jets in total  The Netherlands program of record is currently to procure 37 F 35s with the opportunity for an increased order as last October the Dutch government announced plans to purchase nine additional jets  bringing the total to potentially 46 aircraft Turning back to our business areas  I d like to highlight a few of the notable new business wins and follow on awards that have helped position us for long term growth  Rotary and Mission Systems received an award of nearly  2 billion for the detailed design and construction of four Multi Mission Surface Combatant ships for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  This ship is a version of the Freedom variant Littoral Combat Ship we have been delivering to the US Navy  and will provide the Kingdom with the capabilities needed for both shallow water and open ocean naval operations  We are honored to support the Kingdom in their Saudi Vision 2030 objectives In Missiles and Fire Control  the US Air Force announced the finalization of the  1 billion contract for the Air Launched Rapid Response Weapon effort we were previously awarded  Our hypersonics portfolio experienced tremendous growth during 2019  with a total potential value of the corporation has received now exceeding  4 billion  Missiles and Fire Control also booked  770 million order for PAC 3 missiles to provide additional Interceptors and ground support equipment to the US Army and the United Arab Emirates  continuing the growth in our air missile defense line of business Moving onto Aeronautics  Our air mobility team was awarded their third multi year contract for the C 130J transport aircraft  approving the delivery of 50 new planes over the next few years  The finalization of this contract added an incremental 35 aircraft and over  2 billion to our backlog in the fourth quarter  with the overall value for all 50 planes expected to exceed  3 4 billion This award comes as the aero team celebrated the delivery of the 2 600 C 130 airlifter since the program began over 60 years ago  With over 450 planes being the current J model  we are proud to be able to continue producing this venerable aircraft for our war fighters and those are the 70 nations currently operating at around the world  And in space  we were awarded a  3 3 billion 10 year IDIQ contract for the Combined Orbital Operations  Logistics and Resiliency or COOLR program to provide support services on several military communications satellite constellations  including our Advanced Extremely High Frequency spacecraft These satellites provide nuclear hardened anti jam Global Communications to the White House  the State Department and military users  supporting the nation s nuclear command and control system  And we are proud to be able to support the ongoing mission of this critical element of our national security  These announcements reflect the strength of our legacy programs  both domestically and internationally as well as the impact our continued investments and forward looking technologies to drive long term growth Turning briefly to budgets  The fiscal year 2020 Department of Defense Appropriations Act was signed into law last month and finalized defense spending for the current fiscal year  Total defense budgets have been approved for approximately  738 billion  consistent with the levels passed earlier in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 and over  20 billion above FY 2019 enacted amounts Our programs garnered strong support across all business areas  with the legislation  including nearly  3 5 billion of increased funding beyond the Presidential budget request  Including  2 billion for 20 additional F 35 fighter jets for a total of 98 aircraft  over  800 million for nine additional C 130J transport aircraft for a total of 20 planes and increased funding for our long range hypersonic weapon Orion and OPIR contracts as well as increases for several rotary aircraft programs and other initiatives across the corporation  We believe our portfolio is well positioned to address important security needs for our nation with the increasing defense budgets and these additional appropriations actions  supporting continued growth opportunities into the future Moving on  I would like to highlight several key accomplishments from across the corporation that demonstrate our commitment to developing new technologies as well as expanding the reach of our heritage solutions  I will start with Missiles and Fire Control who passed an important milestone on a prospective new business opportunity  Our tactical missiles team successfully tested its next generation long range precision missile for the US Army s Precision Strike Missile or PrSM competition The Missiles and Fire Control team launched PrSM from the Lockheed Martin High Mobility Artillery Rocket or HIMARS system successfully demonstrating accuracy and range of flight  validating HIMARS interfaces and testing system software performance  We are excited by the prospects of this enhanced surface to surface system and look forward to building on our long running Army Tactical Missile System legacy as we progress through the upcoming procurement decision Moving to RMS  our integrated warfare systems and sensors line of business was selected by the Japanese Ministry of Defense to produce two solid state radar antenna sets for their Aegis Ashore system  Our SPY 7 radar offers enhanced detection range and sensitivity from previous legacy radar systems and will provide continuous protection of Japan from ballistic missile threats Our RMS team has continued to invest in new technologies  while leveraging current solutions  And this new radar is a direct derivative of our Long Range Discrimination Radar solution and Missile Defense Agency program of record  Variants of the SPY 7 radar will also be incorporated into other US and international solutions  And to date  this technology has been selected for 24 systems  ushering in the next generation of maritime and ground based advanced radar technology Moving to Aero  this past November marks the official start of F 16 production at our Greenville  South Carolina location  Fabrication activities began for components of the center fuselage  one of the first steps in building new F 16 aircraft for the growing demand from new international customers  The first delivery for our Bahraini customer will roll off this line in late 2021 and we look forward to increasing production as new orders are added to the backlog I will close with our space business area  which delivered the Mars 2020 Rover Aeroshell to Kennedy Space Center in December  The aeroshell will encapsulate the Mars 2020 Rover during its deep space mission to Mars and protect it from the intense heat as the entry system descends through the Martian atmosphere  This aeroshell marks the latest heat sheet ever used and will protect the vehicle from temperatures up to 3 800 degrees Fahrenheit Lockheed Martin has built every aeroshell entry system for all of NASA s 40 years of Mars explorations and we are proud to continue this legacy as we work toward a July 2020 launch Before I turn the call over to Ken  I d like to reiterate my appreciation to the entire Lockheed Martin team for their contributions to an outstanding year and for helping to build a differentiating portfolio  Ken Kenneth R  Possenriede    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Marillyn  and good morning everyone  As I highlight our key financial accomplishments  please follow along with the web charts that we included with our earnings release today  So let s begin with Chart 3 and an overview of our results for the year Sales  segment operating profit  cash from operations and earnings per share closed ahead of our expectations with record highs  We generated  7 3 billion of cash from operations after a  1 billion discretionary contribution to our pension trust this quarter  and we continued our cash deployment actions  returning  3 8 billion of cash to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases  We again grew our backlog to  144 billion  a new record high watermark  In summary  it was an outstanding year for the business Turning to Chart 4  we compare our sales and segment operating profit this year with last year s results  Sales grew 11  or  6 billion compared with last year to  59 8 billion continuing the strong performance over the first three quarters  while segment operating profit increased 12  or  700 million over last year to nearly  6 6 billion On Chart 5  we compare sales by business area with last year s results  And as Marillyn mentioned all four of our business areas experienced strong sales growth in 2019  led by Missiles and Fire Control at 20   which was driven by production volume and tactical and strike missiles and air and missile defense  And for the first time  all four business areas delivered sales above  10 billion On chart 6 we ll discuss our segment operating profit by business area  Following sales  all four of our business areas also increased profit in 2019 and the corporation ended the year with total segment operating profit 12  above 2018 levels  Chart 7 shows our earnings per share for 2019  Our EPS of  21 95 was up  4 36 or 25  higher than our results last year  driven primarily by operational performance Moving on to Chart 8 and as previously noted by Marillyn  backlog has increased again to a record high for the fifth consecutive year  All four business areas increased backlog in 2019  with the largest increases coming from space  driven by strategic missiles  and at Missiles and Fire Control  driven by air and missile defense  We had a strong book to bill ratio of 1 4 for the quarter and 1 2 for the year On Chart 9  we will discuss the cash returned to our shareholders in 2019  Subtracting our capital expenditures from approximately  7 3 billion of cash from operations  our free cash flow was greater than  5 8 billion  We increased our dividend by 9  and exceeded our share repurchase objective by  200 million in the fourth quarter  This brought our total cash returned to shareholders to  3 8 billion for the year or 64  of free cash flow  providing strong returns consistent with our historical cash deployment actions Moving onto Chart 10  we provide an update to our 2020 trending data with our revised outlook for the year ahead  Our outlook for sales ranges from  62 75 billion to  64 25 billion  which is an increase from the  62 billion we first indicated last quarter  The midpoint of this range represents a 6  increase over 2019 results The range of segment operating profit is estimated to be between  6 8 billion and  6 95 billion  Our estimated FAS CAS pension adjustment is just above  2 billion  Our estimated range for 2020 earnings per share growth to between  23 65 to  23 95 per share  The midpoint of this range represents a 7 7  increase over 2019 results Cash from operations is now projected to meet or exceed  7 6 billion and I ll discuss this in greater detail on the following chart  On Chart 11  we will walk through our future cash expectations  folding in the  1 billion discretionary pension payment we made last quarter  Strong operational cash performance and a continued focus on working capital management allowed us to increase our cash outlook for 2020 to greater than or equal to  7 6 billion  a  100 million increase to the combined 2019 and 2020 outlooks we provided in October  And we now see approximately  7 7 billion of cash flow from operations in 2021  a  700 million increase  bringing our three year expectation to  800 million greater than our prior assessment On Chart 12  we breakdown our sales and segment operating profit outlook by business area  All four business areas are positioned for continued sales growth in 2020  led by Missiles and Fire Control at 10   Segment operating profit growth is projected to grow at approximately 5  in the aggregate  with our largest growth in aeronautics at 8   And finally  on Chart 13  we have our summary We believe 2019 was an exceptional year for Lockheed Martin  Our key results exceeded previous highs and have positioned us well for continued growth and value creation in 2020  And as we discussed earlier  our focus on innovation and investment has resulted in strategic new business opportunities in a robust legacy of programs And with that  we re ready for your questions  John Questions and Answers OperatorThank you   Operator Instructions  And we ll go to Rob Stallard with Vertical Research  Please go ahead Robert Stallard    Vertical Research Partners    AnalystThanks so much  Good morning Marillyn A  Hewson    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning Kenneth R  Possenriede    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerGood morning  Rob Robert Stallard    Vertical Research Partners    AnalystQuick question from Marillyn on the F 35  You mentioned in the release that your guidance had a bit of a caveat regarding Turkey  I was wondering if you give us an update on the progress in allocating those Turkish delivery slots and also realigning the supply chain Marillyn A  Hewson    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerSure  Thanks for the question  Rob  I would just say we ve been working with the US government for several months on addressing how we are going to manage the eight aircraft that were slotted for Turkey that have been delivered for Turkey as well as looking at alternate suppliers  for the Turkish suppliers  And so in terms of lot    the upcoming lots we    we have a lot of demand for the aircraft as you are well aware and we ve had the Congressional ads that will offset those needs from Turkish    the Turkish aircraft deliveries  So I think we re    we ve got it well solutioned  Anything you want to add to that  Ken Kenneth R  Possenriede    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerJust on it  Rob  just from the revenue side  Marilyn s got it right  So the United States government for the ones we ve delivered is up to date  which would be the lot 10  lot 11 aircraft  They are earmarked for the United States government  In lot 12 through 14  the Block Buy  each of those lots  eight aircraft were earmarked for Turkey for a total of 24  The Congressional ads  for the most part  we ll take care of that  So we re in good shape with the Block Buy  We ll now work lot 15  We just got the RFP from US government  So I think from a revenue standpoint  we re in great shape You have other customers that are coming in  Japan  as you recall  wants to order an additional 105  We have Belgium  We re in a competition for Finland  Switzerland and Canada  We feel good about those  especially as Marillyn mentioned  the  80 million aircraft  We got there a year ahead of time  And you probably saw in the press  the Pols want to buy 32 aircraft  So I think from a revenue side  it s well in hand From a supply standpoint  almost all supply out of Poland will    excuse me  out of Turkey will be removed by March of 2020  There ll be a handful of suppliers that will continue to work with through December 20th  And as I mentioned  we got the lot 15 RP  so we ll sort all that out post 2020 as we go on  But I think we re in a much better spot now than we were with the Turkey situation Robert Stallard    Vertical Research Partners    AnalystThat s great  thank you very much Operator Operator Instructions  And we will move to Myles Walton with UBS  Please go ahead Myles Walton    UBS Investment Bank    AnalystThanks  and good morning  Can you reupdate the three year class  indecipherable  with  800 million of incremental  I m just curious  could you give us the background on the net pension recovery in there  And how much change  I imagine contributions came down  but it also looks like your CAS recovery came down  So just trying to piece out of that  800 million  how much is from your operations  Thanks Kenneth R  Possenriede    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYou bet  You bet  Myles  So yeah  I think    I think we should start with how we ended the year with cash that got us to making the voluntary pension contribution  So we ended    you guys recall  we ended the third quarter up in working capital by  1 2 billion  Fourth quarter from third quarter  we actually reduced our working capital by  500 million  So for the year  we were just south of growing our working capital by  700 million So with that strong cash generation in the fourth quarter  we thought it was prudent to make the pension contribution of  1 billion  And so if you go forward and look at 2020 and beyond  Myles  and also recall our Lockheed Martin investment company  we    our returns were superior to what we assumed back in October or frankly what we assumed in the beginning of the year  They ended the year at 20  returns on their assets So with all that  our CAS contributions came down in 2020 to just south of  2 billion  We do not  we re not required to make a pension contribution this year  So going forward our CAS recoveries look like they will be about  2 billion in 2021  Our pension contribution recall the last time we spoke regarding 2021  we thought our pension contribution would be  2 billion by making the  1 billion pension contribution not only eliminated the 2020 pension contribution  it reduced the  2 billion pension contribution by  0 5 billion  but also because of the great returns we made in last year  it looks like our pension contribution now in 2021 as we see it is below  1 billion Just going out to 2022 and then will stop  It looks like our CAS recoveries will be roughly  2 2 billion and that  2 billion pension contribution in 2022 that we discussed in October looks like it s about  1 7 billion   1 75 billion  So a lot of it is improvement    volume improvement  margin improvement throughout the business  But some of it also is due to the returns we made on our pension in the past OperatorOur next question is from Rob Spingarn of Credit Suisse  Please go ahead Robert Spingarn    Credit Suisse    AnalystHi  good morning Kenneth R  Possenriede    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerGood morning Robert Spingarn    Credit Suisse    AnalystMarillyn and Ken  you both went through a lot of detail on the international successes on aircraft and ship platforms  And Marillyn you sort of previewed the question I want to ask  when you talked about Japanese Aegis  But I wanted to talk about your recent modernization wins at DoD  they re sizable  you ve had things like hypersonics and AIM 260 at MFC  Central Radar at RMS  So I wanted to see how these might translate to even greater  longer term market share internationally  Or are they too strategic to export Marillyn A  Hewson    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerWell  that s a great question  Rob  I mean we re always working with the US government as we look at these systems  We re always looking at what systems could potentially be provided to our allies and to increase their defense capability and capacity  So without hitting each one of these specifically that you outlined  I mean just I think the Aegis system is a good example  when you look at some of our increases and things like PAC 3  and THAAD and now with the radar capabilities  I mentioned the opportunities that we have on long range discriminating radar  it s all in our planning that when we work with the US government that we make sure that we have an opportunity to consider not only the needs of the US government  but on many of these systems what they can provide to the international community And as you can see with our very robust backlogs  about  144 billion  it gives us an opportunity to not only perform on that work that we have  but to continue to invest in new technologies and new capabilities and that s what we ve been doing for a number of years  We have highlighted areas in the radar arena and hypersonics and directed energy and a whole range of systems and capabilities that we recognize we got to constantly provide our customers with the advantages that they need over our adversaries  And so we re always looking well ahead of now to invest in it  And we think that  with that it is with an eye toward being able to support our international customers as well OperatorNext question is from Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch  please go ahead Ronald Epstein    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystYeah  good morning Kenneth R  Possenriede    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerGood morning Marillyn A  Hewson    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning Kenneth R  Possenriede    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerHi Ron Ronald Epstein    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystI was wondering if you could just walk through a little bit when we think about the F 35 program as we go into 2020 and maybe even beyond  how you think about the mix between OE and sustainment  I mean there s been a lot of I guess press about the sustainment going from something like the total flight hour cost at  35 000 per hour going down to  25 000 per hour  I mean  how does that impact the program and how should we think about as we model F 35 in to 2020 and beyond  the mix between OE and sustainment Kenneth R  Possenriede    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSure  Hey  Ron  it s Ken  I ll take that  So  yeah  in 2020  if you look just macro at F 35  we see    we actually see pretty strong growth year over year  Sales are going to be up about 8   Think of that as the lion s share is still production  So production year over year will be about 8   but we still see development work even with SDD winding down with follow on modernization and other development activities  We ll see development this year grow from  19 about 10  From a sustainment standpoint  we re still on these annualized buys and we re still standing up basis  And we ve talked about the performance based logistics proposal that white paper that we put in  So we ll see high single digit growth in sustainment and if we continue on these annualized buys  it will still continue to grow  you ll see sustainment over time become the fastest piece of our    of the F 35 program  It will likely double in size from a sales perspective in the next five years  It potentially throughout the next decade could double from    or triple from where it is today  But I think that PBL is an interesting concept  and we re starting to have that conversation with the customer and it basically is to talk about what you just described  is to accelerate to get the cost per flight hour of maintaining the aircraft down to what the customer would see as an affordable level  but also the availability of the aircraft to get that up to levels that are more like fourth generation aircraft And the onus then would be on industry  the risk would be on industry  we would do the investing for our customer set  We would have the infrastructure in place and assuming we performed  we would sign up to these service levels  we would expect a return that s more in line with that type of contract  We re hopeful we ll be able to get to the table with the customer in 2020 and shape this thing and hopefully be able to get a deal that s acceptable to both parties  But you re right  in the future  you ll see sustainment grow faster than the rest of F 35 at least in the short term  it will still be production until we get to a capacity  which should be peak capacity  which should be 2023 2024 Marillyn A  Hewson    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerWhat I would add  there s continued demand around the world  And as we continue to    we are now at a very affordable unit price on the aircraft and as long as we can offset the development costs that will come as we continue to upgrade the aircraft and then drive the sustainment costs down  I think we see an outlook of great opportunities for the aircraft around the world Kenneth R  Possenriede    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThat s right Operator Operator Instructions  And next we ll go to Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs  Please go ahead Noah Poponak    Goldman Sachs Group    AnalystHello  everyone Kenneth R  Possenriede    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerHey  how are you doing  Noah Noah Poponak    Goldman Sachs Group    AnalystGood well  how are you  Ken Kenneth R  Possenriede    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerOkay  thanks Noah Poponak    Goldman Sachs Group    AnalystSo wanted to stay on the multi year cash flow discussion  You could    I could sort of see the investor question that was previously    does it grow in 2021 because of the contribution step up moving to  22 with the contribution step up now there year over year  So one  do you grow cash from ops year over year in 2022  And I think you have five year internal planning  So maybe you could speak to  can you grow cash flow every year in the five year period  because that just remains a big investor question  And then  having given the pension pieces  I wondered if you could also speak to capital because that came in a little light for the year  That d be very helpful  Thank you Kenneth R  Possenriede    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYou bet  Thanks  Noah  So just a clarifying point from a long range plan standpoint  we do current year plus three years out  but I will give you a little    I ll try to give you a little color  23 and beyond  but I don t have    I don t have an absolute number for you  So I think you wanted to start with 2022  since I gave you color up to 2021  And that s actually a timely point right now  not just because of pension funding  capex  but just from a cash generation dynamics  including the pre funding  looking at our growth  our focus on working capital  it basically would all point to cash from operations out in 2022 frankly being north of our 2021 number  We see a path to greater than or equal to  7 7 billion There is one issue that it s worth talking about now  and it s the remnant from the Tax Reform Act of 2017  The law has a provision that kicks in and it kicks in 2022  which requires research and development expenses to be capitalized  rather than being expensed  Right now though the law is    it s still a little bit vague what the exact definition of R D is  and believe it or not  I ve actually read the legislation myself  and I do see some vagueness in there  but in the interest of transparency  it s probably good we talk about that now  So if the IRS made the determination that the law applies to all R D expenses  it probably would take our cash number down So this would be things are expensing now that we would have to amortize over five years  It would take our cash from ops in 2022 probably down to about  6 5 billion  but I ll say this  It doesn t seem logical to us that that was their intent  and if it was just a subset of the R D  we still see a path to get getting north of  7 billion  So we re still working through this So just to summarize north of  7 7 billion  if it s the way things have been operating in the past  if this R D tax bill kicks in  it will be probably in the mid range of  6 5 billion and if it s a subset of that  we still see north of  7 billion  but operationally  we re still going to generate a lot of cash  we still have a focus on working capital  You talked about capex  you re right  it was a little light this year  So we ended the year at roughly  1 5 billion because of the things we ve discussed in the past  the buildings that we re building in the business areas  We d see capex in 2020 at about  1 7 billion Next year  probably comparable about  1 7 billion and then what we know today  it would start tapering down  it will be below  1 7 billion  Last point you asked about was  23 and beyond  just talking about Sikorsky  you ll start seeing a lot of those programs going into production  You ll start seeing F 35 will continue to reduce contract assets  So we d see  though I don t have an absolute number for you  we see strong cash flow generation out in that time period as well OperatorOur next question is from Jon Raviv with Citi  Please go ahead Jonathan Raviv    Citigroup    AnalystHey  thanks everyone  I won t ask you about 2025 and beyond if it s    if that s OK  I will stay away from that for now  But in the context of some of that cash coming in  what about cash going out  leverage is noticeably low  you highlighted returning 54  of free cash flow to shareholders  it s been higher in years past  but I know your stock s been lower in years past  So just how do you think about capital allocation going forward given all these dynamics Kenneth R  Possenriede    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSure  So let s start it Jon  let s start with 2020  For a planning purposes  we re assuming share repos of about  1 billion  We re assuming we do increase the dividend  for planning purposes that would be  0 20 a quarter or  0 80 similar to what we per share  what we did in 2019  So round numbers and 8  plus increase in the dividend  We do have another tranche of debt that matures in 2020  It s  1 250 billion  I believe  that s the second tranche to Sikorsky  For planning purposes  we re assuming we let that mature and pay it back Our treasury organization is constantly looking at whether it makes sense to refi or look at our entire debt on the balance sheet  whether a debt exchange makes sense  we ll go through that through the year  We will be opportunistic like we were in the fourth quarter of last year where it makes sense from a share repo standpoint  In fact we did our first accelerated share repurchase program that went very well in the fourth quarter last year and as you recall 2018 with our stock prices down nothing to do with our fundamentals  but with what was going on with the market  we were very opportunistic in terms of that And so we ll see going forward  where it makes sense to do that  What we didn t talk about is inorganic growth  Marillyn has    we meet at least eight times a year with the senior leadership team to look at a pipeline in terms of things that make sense for us to invest in  or frankly to divest in  And as you said  we do have the firepower on our balance sheet to go do that  I ll remind you that we got a credit rating increase by all three agencies  So with debt being cheap  if there is something out there from an inorganic standpoint that fits within where we think we need to go with our portfolio  we would be inclined to do that Marillyn A  Hewson    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerBut I would just remind you that we really are happy with our current portfolio  We don t really see any gaps right now  But we ll  as Ken said  constantly keep a screen on it  as we always do OperatorNext we ll go to George Shapiro with Shapiro Research  Please go ahead George Shapiro    Shapiro Research    AnalystYes  good morning Marillyn A  Hewson    Chairman  President and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning Kenneth R  Possenriede    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerGood morning  George George Shapiro    Shapiro Research    AnalystA couple of questions  MFC and space backlog were up well north of 20   Why isn t the growth rate greater in 2020  And then also  if you can just go through the balance sheet a little bit  there was a big increase in inventories  maybe partly offset by contract assets  And likewise  accounts payable were way down  maybe offset a little bit from liabilities  Maybe just walk through what s actually going on in the balance sheet as well  Thanks Kenneth R  Possenriede    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYou bet  George  It s Ken  I ll handle that  So you asked about space and Missiles and Fire Control  and you re right  So our    we overachieved our orders planned this year by north of  20 billion  And two of the big drivers were exactly that  space and Missiles and Fire Control  But I think what you need to do is look at the detail of what some of those programs are  So at Missiles and Fire Control  a big driver of what went into backlog would be THAAD  KSA and PAC 3  Poland  And those will be multi year programs going forward  So you will not see a burn down like some of the tactical strike weapons programs  Integrated air and missile defense backlog will take longer to convert to sales Same with space  Space is a platform business  And you have    recall  I talked about in the past the multi year    the three years of AWE we got  So we will not get an order this year on AWE  We also got some big orders on Orion and OPIR which would take longer to convert to sales  Regarding the balance sheet  you re right  George  We did have some inventory growth in 2019  But the way we look at it  I kind of look at contract assets and inventory  and frankly  put them together  So we actually had contract assets decrease in 2019 by roughly  400 million  Inventory for the year roughly grew  600 million  So I would say from an asset standpoint  we had 11  sales growth  Think of that as roughly  6 billion of sales growth from  19 to  20  We grew contracted assets and inventory by only  200 million Going forward  we do see contracted assets increasing in 2021  We see working capital in 2020 growing by rough numbers  it will be comparable a little bit more than this year  But remind you  we re growing sales by roughly  3 5 billion  So that s in line with what we ve had in the past  And then 2021  we see a marked improvement from a working capital standpoint  We will only grow working capital by say  200 million  This is our plan today  we will continue to try to perform on that  And with our focus on working capital  one of the main places that we will work is in contract assets in 2020 and 2021 OperatorNext we ll go to Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company  Please go ahead Cai von Rumohr    Cowen and Company    AnalystYes  Thanks so much  Everybody has talked about cash flow  I m more interested in kind of what you do with it  Because your net debt to cap is now 1 4  If you increase your dividend 10   if you buy  1 5 billion  Phonetic  in stock every year  you re basically going to burn through like  4 billion in debt  So where are we going here over the next couple of years  Do you want this net debt to cap ratio to go below 1  Or are you going to deploy the cash  and if so  what are your relative priorities  Thanks Kenneth R  Possenriede    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSo Cai  as I mentioned earlier  I think our priority is    or from a plan standpoint  the debt on the balance sheet as it matures  our plan would be to pay it off  We will certainly look at whether it makes sense to refi in this low interest rate environment  We certainly will look at  talking to the owners of our stock as we go around this year  to talk to our shareholders what type of dividend increase is acceptable to them for them to continue to be interested in our stock The last couple of years though  we planned for  1 billion of share repos  we have overachieved  We ve opportunistically  in the last two years have bought back more stock than we planned  There is some likelihood we would do that as well  And that    we ll decide on that  We talked about in the past about our portfolio  as Marillyn mentioned  We re very pleased with our portfolio  But if something out there makes sense for us to acquire  we have the firepower to do that  If you look at the composition of who owns our stock  it s almost 50  are yield investors  So we will certainly pay attention to our yield  Even with the high appreciation of    even with the high appreciation of our stock  we still have a very strong dividend yield relative to our share price  But I think the net is  we re not going to let cash    we ve demonstrated this over the last couple years  We re not going to let cash sit on our balance sheet  we will use  We will use it OperatorYour next question is from Doug Harned with Bernstein  Please go ahead Douglas Harned    Sanford C  Bernstein   Co     AnalystThank you  Good morning Kenneth R  Possenriede    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerGood morning  Doug Douglas Harned    Sanford C  Bernstein   Co     AnalystI wanted to go back to the F 35 sustainment because I wanted to make sure I understood how the math works out here  Because if I think of    in a broad sense  and I ll put PBL aside for the moment  But if I think in a broad sense about sustainment activity being somewhat proportional to the fleet size  and if right now  you re still building out depots  so there s  I would think  a surge in sustainment work at the current time for that  And then if you have to bring down dollars per flight hour over the next few years  how does this    how do you get to a doubling or tripling of sustainment revenues in the next five years  I m just trying to figure out how this all flows Kenneth R  Possenriede    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerOkay  You bet  Doug  So yeah  lot going on  So just for completeness  this year we see sustainment growing not quite double digits  but close to double digits  So there are roughly 21 bases that are stood up  We still have quite a few to stand up  We have a large number of    491 aircraft out in the fleet through year end  We re going to deliver 140 aircraft this year  Rough numbers  160 next year   22  165  And then we ll start getting up to the 170  175  180 aircraft delivered We ll continue  as you said  drive down the price per flight hour from roughly  35 000 to  25 000  What I d like to remind you  though  is half of that is the united    the government costs  half of that is our costs  But you will still continue to need sparing  Marillyn mentioned the modernization work that is continuing  You will start to see  from a sales or revenue standpoint  more modernization sales and sustainment once we have these depots up and sparing rather than the cost of standing up the depot  So going forward  you will see a sizable ramp in modernization cost  where the customer working with us deems which aircraft it makes sense to modernize  and then the spare of the fleet OperatorNext we ll go to Seth Seifman with JPMorgan  Please go ahead Seth Seifman    JPMorgan Chase   Co     AnalystGreat  thanks very much and good morning Kenneth R  Possenriede    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerHi Seth  good morning Seth Seifman    JPMorgan Chase   Co     AnalystKen  you mentioned the outperformance on the orders this year  I guess  first of all  where do you expect to exit the year in terms of backlog relative to last December 31  And then in Missiles and Fire Control  when do you anticipate that the margin rate there would stabilize and then maybe start to move in the other direction Kenneth R  Possenriede    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerGot you  Okay  So we actually see  what we know today  we see our backlog this year growing roughly  3 billion   4 billion  If you think about our orders  orders this year will not    probably not be as strong as they were in  19  but you do have some notable orders this year  So this year  we have three F 16 production orders in 2020  Bulgaria  Taiwan and Morocco  We ll definitize F 35 lot 14 this year  In the fourth quarter  we have F 35 lot 15  There is a variety of hypersonics awards that will come out this year  We have the Indian Navy MH 60R that will occur  the Seahawk PBL  So our book to bill  the way we see it this year  is a little bit over 1  It s 1 06  So we will grow backlog this year to roughly 1 47  1 48 Regarding Missiles and Fire Control  we ve talked about this in the past  you do have the development program  the classified development program  that is kicking in  It ll continue to grow for the next couple of years  We ve talked about some of the risk retirements that we ve had in the past  Some of those will not occur this year  but it s probably next year or the year after  that we would see the    our margins start to stabilize on Missiles and Fire Control  There will be other new prototype programs  So if you think about hypersonics  especially in Missiles and Fire Control  it is strike hypersonics We really were investing in the counter hypersonics  but we really haven t seen any orders there yet  It would not surprise us if we re put under contract this year and going forward for counter  and those will be dilutive to margins as well Greg Gardner    Vice President of Investor RelationsHey  John  this is Greg  We re at the top of the hour  So I think I ll turn it back over to Marillyn for some final

132960,354475,LMT,Little U S  Turkish progress solving defenses row  Erdogan says  NTV,news,"ANKARA  Reuters    Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Wednesday Washington and Ankara had done little to solve a row over Turkey s purchase of Russian defenses and its procurement of U S  fighter jets despite a November agreement  according to broadcaster NTV 
Ties between the NATO allies were badly strained last year when Turkey bought Russian S 400 defense systems  prompting Washington to threaten sanctions and to suspend Turkish involvement in its F 35 jet program  where Ankara was a buyer and manufacturer 
Washington says the S 400s are not compatible with NATO systems and threaten the stealth capabilities of its  Lockheed Martin   NYSE LMT  F 35 jets  Ankara rejects this and says S 400s will not be integrated into the alliance s defenses 
Turkey has accused the United States of stalling and ignoring its proposal to form a joint working group on the issue involving NATO  even though Erdogan and U S  President Donald Trump agreed in November to start work on it 
 We made the appointments there  in Washington   but there are no serious efforts on this yet   Erdogan was quoted by NTV as saying   The S 400 issue is over  It is out of the question for us to turn back from this deal   he told reporters on a return flight from Senegal 
Days after Erdogan s Washington visit in mid November  his spokesman said Turkish and U S  officials had started working as part of the joint mechanism to evaluate the S 400s and F 35s 
Erdogan also again warned that Ankara could look elsewhere for fighter jets   Either the United States will give us the money for these or give us the jets   Erdogan said   If they won t give us back the money    we can also find and buy them elsewhere or make them ourselves  
Last month  a  738 billion defense spending bill passed by the U S  Senate called on Trump to sanction Turkey and prohibit the delivery of F 35s to the NATO ally over the S 400s ",2020-01-29,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/little-usturkish-progress-solving-defenses-row-erdogan-says-ntv-2070332,2070332
132962,354477,LMT,Lockheed Martin Can Keep Flying Higher in 2020,news,"Lockheed Martin  NYSE LMT   the world s largest defense contractor  has been on an impressive run over the last five years  as it has capitalized on an uptick in Pentagon spending  Its shares are up more than 130  since early 2015  more than doubling the S P 500 s 63  gain 
Defense is traditionally a cyclical business  and with election year budget and deficit talk on the rise there have been some concerns that defense stocks have run about as far as they can  But Lockheed Martin in its year end earnings discussion made a strong case the momentum can continue through 2020 and beyond  and gave no reason to change my view it is among the best defense stocks to buy right now 

LMT vs  S P 500 data by YCharts 
Here s a look at how 2019 ended for Lockheed Martin  and what to expect in the years to come 
Growth all over the portfolio
Lockheed Martin generated fourth quarter earnings of  5 29 per share  beating the consensus estimate by  0 27  on strong sales growth throughout the portfolio  Revenue growth was driven by increased F 35 sales volume  coupled with continued interest in precision weapons  missile defense  and hypersonics  The company s mission systems  Lockheed s intelligence work  fueled the boost in profits 

Data source  Lockheed Martin 
For the year  Lockheed Martin generated nearly  60 billion in revenue  and the company said it expects net sales of  62 75 billion to  64 25 billion in 2020  Lockheed Martin ended the year with a book to bill    a ratio of orders received to amount billed    of 1 42  and a backlog of  144 billion  up 10  from year end 2018 
Lockheed Martin is winning because its businesses cater to some of the Pentagon s top priorities as the military shifts its focus away from battling militias in the Middle East and toward the threat of great power conflict with Russia or China  The company s F 35  a potential trillion dollar program for Lockheed and its subcontractors  is the Air Force s go to fighter  and its work on hypersonics  missiles capable of traveling five times the speed of sound  are thought to be well ahead of those of other contractors 
If there was any disappointment in the results  it was that Lockheed s full year 2020 earnings guidance of  23 65 to  23 95 per share slightly lagged what analysts had expected  The culprit appears to be tax rate  with Lockheed Martin forecasting a 17  rate compared to analysts  15 5   But Lockheed Martin s 10 8  segment margin estimate  compared to 11  in 2019  appears conservative 
A stockpile of cash
Lockheed Martin generated  847 million in free cash flow during the fourth quarter  beating expectations  and the company generated more than  7 3 billion in cash from operations during the year despite making a  1 billion voluntary pension contribution during the year to prefund its 2020 payment and part of its 2021 payment 
The company expects at least  7 6 billion in cash from operations in 2020  and is assuming both  1 billion in share repurchases and a dividend hike during the year  There is also about  1 25 billion in debt that is scheduled to mature  but Lockheed Martin estimates it will have excess cash and a relatively unlevered balance sheet at its disposal during the year 

We ve seen a fair amount of defense industry consolidation in recent quarters  and Lockheed Martin definitely has the firepower to do a deal  But management seemed lukewarm to the idea on a post earnings call with investors  with CEO Marillyn A  Hewson saying she is  happy  with the current portfolio 
 We don t really see any gaps right now   Hewson said 
If there isn t a deal  expect more cash to be returned to shareholders  Chief Financial Officer Kenneth Possenriede noted on the call that in recent years Lockheed Martin has  overachieved  in terms of share repurchases  and is very mindful of its dividend 

If you look at the composition of who owns our stock  it s almost 50  are yield investors  So we will certainly pay attention to our yield  Even with the high appreciation of our stock  we still have a very strong dividend yield relative to our share price  But I think the net is  we re not going to let cash    we ve demonstrated this over the last couple years  We re not going to let cash sit on our balance sheet  we will use  We will use it  

It s not too late to jump in
One benefit of investing in defense stocks is the government is a pretty transparent customer that telegraphs its purchase intentions well in advance  Lockheed Martin has had a great run of growth over the past few years  but the company s massive order book suggests steady gains not only in 2020 but into 2021 and beyond as well 
Lockheed Martin is also among the favorites for considerable new business  including a number of new helicopter competitions and continued development of hypersonic weapons and defense systems  And even if the stock doesn t double again over the next five years  which seems unlikely  as Possenriede notes  there is a steady and growing dividend to help boost returns  Lockheed Martin s current dividend yield is 2 06   second only to General Dynamics among defense primes 
An election year brings added risk because of the potential for new priorities and policies  Still  the world is not getting any safer  and Lockheed Martin s portfolio is well positioned to weather any Pentagon spending slowdown  Even after the gains  it is not too late to add Lockheed Martin shares to your portfolio ",2020-01-31,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/ppe8q,2072791
132963,354478,LMT,Some exhibitors pull out of Singapore Airshow due to coronavirus,news,"By Jamie Freed and Allison Lampert
SYDNEY MONTREAL  Reuters    Some aerospace companies including business jet manufacturers  Textron Inc   N TXT  and General Dynamics Corp s  N GD  Gulfstream division said they no longer planned to attend the Singapore Airshow due to the new coronavirus epidemic 
The trade portion of Asia s biggest airshow  held every two years  is set to begin on Feb  11 under the shadow of the fast spreading virus that has prompted Singapore to deny entry to all Chinese visitors and foreigners with a recent history of travel to China  where the virus originated 
The death toll from the coronavirus has risen to 361 in China  bringing the number of confirmed infections to 17 205  The flu like virus  which can be transmitted from person to person  has spread to more than two dozen other nations and regions 
Experia Events  the organizer of the Singapore Airshow  said last week the show would continue as planned  but the government measures meant it would  undoubtedly see a reduction in terms of the number of expected exhibitors and visitors this year  
The organizer said there would be doctors and medics on standby to attend to visitors who were feeling unwell 
In 2018  there were 54 000 trade attendees from 147 countries and 1 062 participating companies who come to network  examine products and sign deals covering commercial aviation  defense  maintenance and repair operations and business jets 
Typically  it is not a major show for commercial plane orders but talks during the show can set the stage for deals that are completed later in the year 
Boeing  N BA   Airbus  PA AIR  and  Lockheed Martin  Corp  N LMT   among the biggest exhibitors  said they still planned to attend the show 
Textron and Gulfstream said their decision to not attend was a precautionary measure to protect the health of employees 
South Korea s air force said on Monday it had decided not to participate as part of broader precautions against the coronavirus  Its Black Eagles aerobatic team has taken part in the flying display at Singapore airshows in recent years 
Russian aerospace group Rostec plans to send a reduced delegation to the show  Russian media reported  Rostec did not respond immediately to a request for comment 
The deputy administrator of the Civil Aviation Administration of China  Li Jian  is no longer listed as a speaker at a pre show leadership conference on Feb  10 
Commercial Aircraft Corp of China  COMAC   which is developing the C919 narrowbody jet  had been due to attend the airshow before the travel ban was announced  COMAC did not respond immediately to a request for comment

132966,354481,LMT,Want To Retire Early  Learn The Intelligent Investing Secret   January 31  2020,opinion,"Building sufficient financial resources to retire early may sound like a dream  but making that dream come true is not as hard as it may sound  The main thing is simply to save more money each month  No big deal  right  Well   
Typically  advisors peg 15  to 20  of total income saved each month as a goal   but if you want to retire earlier  you probably have to ratchet that number up to 40  or 50  of your income  Not a feat easily accomplished when you review your take into account that a good portion of your paycheck goes to essential  non negotiable lifestyle items  However  if you are willing to make some serious lifestyle changes and sacrifices  it s possible 
A relatively new movement called Financial Independence  Retire Early  FIRE  has been developed around this  sacrifice and over save now to retire early  concept  FIRE followers develop strict savings programs  up to 75  of income  and make associated sacrifices like living in small apartments  walking to work every day  restrictive diets  and so on  This path may be too restrictive for many  but the mindset offers some takeaways that might be worth considering 
To start  stick with the essentials of long term growth investing  Build a diversified portfolio of stocks with exposure to various styles  sizes  sectors  and regions 
To accelerate the retirement investment cycle  you can construct a portfolio designed with more risk   and the potential for higher returns   but it should still be appropriately diversified to protect against larger than average market drawdowns that can be difficult to recover from and ruin any chance to accomplish your early retirement goal  There are numerous ways to diversify a portfolio  and how you do so should depend on your age  your risk tolerance  your growth and income needs  and your long term goals 
Once you have accelerated your savings and put an ongoing plan in place  invest your savings into your portfolio as soon as possible  Don t try to time the market  Leave your portfolio alone  and let the compounding nature of the markets do its magic to help grow your retirement nest egg exponentially over time 
You may want to look at growth stocks with attributes acceptable for retirement investing like low beta  strong earnings estimates  positive sales growth  and expected future growth 
The Zacks Rank routinely recognizes lower risk growth retirement portfolio picks  and here are a few that may be worth considering  CyrusOne  CONE   Lockheed Martin  LMT  and Merck  MRK   These growth stocks have strong Zacks Ranks and a beta of 1 or lower  with earnings and sales growth of at least 5  over the past 5 years

132968,354483,LMT,Singapore Airshow to go ahead with reduced attendance  cancellations over virus,news,"By Anshuman Daga
SINGAPORE  Reuters    The Singapore Airshow  Asia s biggest aerospace gathering  will go ahead as planned next week despite China s virus epidemic prompting some firms to pull out  but a key meeting of aviation officials has been canceled  organizers said on Tuesday 
The trade portion of the airshow  held every two years  is set to begin on Feb  11 under the shadow of the virus outbreak that has prompted measures by several nations  including the wealthy city state  to contain the spread of infections 
Singapore banned entry to all Chinese visitors and foreigners with a recent history of travel to China  which had raised concerns over the staging of the event 
The move comes as the death toll in mainland China from the flu like virus rose to 425  with two other fatalities reported in Hong Kong and the Philippines 
The World Health Organization last week declared the virus  which has spread to almost two dozen countries  a global emergency 
 In view of the evolving 2019 novel coronavirus situation  the organizer will introduce enhanced precautionary measures to safeguard the well being and safety of all attendees   Experia Events Pte Ltd said in a statement on Tuesday 
Additional temperature screenings will be conducted at the show s access points 
However  Experia said an aviation leadership summit scheduled on the eve of the event will be canceled as this will allow aviation executives to work out responses to the virus outbreak 
Aviation data firm OAG said there will be over 25 000 fewer flights operated to  from and within China this week compared to two weeks ago  with 30 airlines halting services 
Citing industry sources  Reuters reported earlier that the summit  which was to involve 300 aviation executives  comprising government officials  civil aviation authorities and airline executives  had been canceled 
International Air Transport Association Director General Alexandre de Juniac will no longer travel to Singapore  said a spokesman representing the airline body 
Ten companies from China  including Commercial Aircraft Corp of China  which is developing the C919 narrowbody jet  and another six exhibitors from four other countries  will not attend the airshow  Experia said 
Business jet manufacturers  Bombardier Inc    TO BBDb    Textron Inc   N TXT  and General Dynamics Corp s  N GD  Gulfstream division are among those that have pulled out 
However  Boeing  N BA   Airbus  PA AIR  and  Lockheed Martin  Corp  N LMT   among the biggest exhibitors  said on Tuesday that they still plan to attend the show 
The lower attendance at the airshow  which is used as a barometer of the industry s health  is a poor omen for a sector grappling with a sharp fall in travel demand due to the virus 
At the last show in 2018  there were 54 000 trade attendees from 147 countries and 1 062 participating companies  some of whom end up signing deals covering commercial aviation  defense  maintenance and repair operations and business jets ",2020-02-04,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy/singapore-airshow-to-go-ahead-despite-virus-worries-2075087,2075087

132970,354485,LMT,The Extreme Risks Of Trading Your Own Retirement Assets   February 03  2020,opinion,"You have a significant retirement portfolio  You re an experienced investor  You ve done pretty well at picking stocks  You probably even own a few of Zacks Top Retirement stock picks like 
American Eagle Outfitters  NYSE AEO   Merck  MRK  and Lockheed Martin  LMT  
If you did something similar  would it be advisable for you to trade your own retirement nest egg 
It could be a good idea   that is  if you are one of the very few investors who understands your own risk tolerance and can keep your emotions in check during chaotic market swings  However  if you re like the rest of us  there are likely more prudent ways to reach your retirement investing goals 
That s because the risk   reward scenario and investing approach is completely different for long term wealth building and active stock trading 
Managing Retirement Investments  Stock Picking vs  Diversification
Picking individual stocks has the potential for huge returns   but also carries a lot of risk  which is particularly hazardous when investing for retirement 
A study done by Hendrik Bessembinder of equity markets over nine decades found that just 4  of the best performing U S stocks generated all the market s gains  The rest were flat   the gains of the next 38  were wiped out by the bottom 58   which lost money 
Those numbers reinforce that  even if you are an experienced and talented stock picker  your chances of success over a long period are very slim 
Is it Possible to Invest  Rationally  
Investors think they can make rational decisions  but research shows that the opposite is often true  A recent DALBAR study tracked investors from 1986 to 2015 and found that the average investor substantially underperformed compared to the S P 500  Over 30 years  the S P 500 returned 10 35   but the average investor return was just 3 66  
It is worth noting that this period included the 1987 crash and enormous bear markets in 2000 and 2008  and the positively trending market of the 1990s as well 
This study indicates that one key explanation behind investor underperformance is attempting to time volatile markets   and that irrational emotional biases are likely to compound investor botches 
Curiously  even experienced traders tend to underperform since they can t resist the emotional urge to make impulsive investment choices  They might be overly self assured and miscalculate risk  get attached to a price target  or perceive a pattern that does not exist  This behavioral fallacy  over the long term  can be disastrous with potential underperformance of a huge number of dollars disrupting your retirement 
What It All Means for Retirement Investors
Your retirement portfolio ought to be dealt with a technique of performance over decades   not days  weeks or quarters  Most self coordinated investors will in general miss the mark with regards to long term outcomes 
Does that mean you should quit trading  Not really  One plan is to take 10  of your investable resources and trade to create alpha and look for outsized returns 
However  the major part of your wealth   those assets reserved for retirement   ought to be invested utilizing a more careful  conservative  risk management strategy to produce steady  compounded returns so you can securely achieve your retirement objectives

133021,354536,LMT,Lockheed Martin to migrate F 35 logistics system to cloud by 2022 end,news," Reuters     Lockheed Martin   NYSE LMT  said on Tuesday that a cloud based network will replace the computer based logistics system in all its F 35 fighter jets by 2022 end 
The weapons maker said the Operational Data Integrated Network  ODIN  will reduce administrator workload on the jet and is designed to deliver data in near real time on aircraft 
The ODIN will replace the Autonomic Logistics Information System  ALIS   which was blamed for delaying aircraft maintenance  one of the very things it was meant to facilitate 
The system was made to underpin the F 35 fleet s daily operations  ranging from mission planning and flight scheduling to repairs and scheduled maintenance 
The Government Accountability Office  GAO  had estimated that ALIS would have cost more than  16 7 billion over its multi decade life cycle 
The F 35 Lightning II Joint Program Office will design the ODIN  which will be delivered to the fleet later this year  Lockheed said ",2020-01-21,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/lockheed-martin-to-migrate-f35-logistics-system-to-cloud-by-2022-end-2064161,2064161

133026,354541,LMT,Why Lockheed  LMT  Is Poised To Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider Lockheed Martin  LMT   This company  which is in the Zacks Aerospace   Defense industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
This aerospace and defense company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 9 01  
For the last reported quarter  Lockheed came out with earnings of  5 66 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  5 03 per share  representing a surprise of 12 52   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  4 74 per share and it actually produced earnings of  5 per share  delivering a surprise of 5 49  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Lockheed lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Lockheed currently has an Earnings ESP of  2 83   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on January 28  2020 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2020-01-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-lockheed-lmt-is-poised-to-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200501513,200501513
133027,354542,LMT,Lockheed Martin  LMT  Q4 Earnings And Revenues Beat Estimates,opinion,"Lockheed Martin  LMT  came out with quarterly earnings of  5 29 per share  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  4 99 per share  This compares to earnings of  4 39 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 6 01   A quarter ago  it was expected that this aerospace and defense company would post earnings of  5 03 per share when it actually produced earnings of  5 66  delivering a surprise of 12 52  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
Lockheed  which belongs to the Zacks Aerospace   Defense industry  posted revenues of  15 88 billion for the quarter ended December 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 94   This compares to year ago revenues of  14 41 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Lockheed shares have added about 11  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 0 4  
What s Next for Lockheed 
While Lockheed has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Lockheed was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead  The current consensus EPS estimate is  6 06 on  15 07 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and  24 26 on  62 33 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year 
Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well  In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank  Aerospace   Defense is currently in the top 43  of the 250 plus Zacks industries  Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1 ",2020-01-27,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/lockheed-martin-lmt-q4-earnings-and-revenues-beat-estimates-200502266,200502266

133049,354564,LMT,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  AES  The Southern Company  Lockheed Martin  Callon Petroleum And New Gold,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   January 9  2020   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  The AES Corporation   NYSE AES    The Southern Company   NYSE SO    Lockheed Martin Corp    NYSE LMT    Callon Petroleum Company   NYSE CPE   and New Gold Inc    NYSE NGD   Here are highlights from Wednesday s Analyst Blog  5 Big Winners from Simmering Tension in the Middle EastIran recently struck back at the United States after its top general was killed in a U S  airstrike at Baghdad s airport  Iran fired a series of ballistic missiles at two military camps in Iraq housing American troops The strikes raised concerns of a flare up in tensions between the long term foes   Iran and Iraq  Previously  President Trump had threatened  disproportionate  attacks in case of any retaliatory move by Iran  Trump also threatened sanctions against Iran if it expels U S  troops Tensions had been increasing steadily across the Middle East following Trump s decision to unilaterally withdraw from Tehran s nuclear agreement with world powers  What s more  the recent attacks between Washington and Tehran have been direct and the war is no longer a proxy one  This  undoubtedly  has raised chances of an open conflict between the countries  which have been at loggerheads since Iran s 1979 Islamic Revolution and the subsequent takeover of the U S  Embassy Nonetheless  investors might see a lot of gyrations in the broader stock market  After all  geopolitical tensions affect economic growth  All the major U S  benchmarks are widely expected to remain in the red as investors apprehend that the United States will retaliate following Iran s missile attacks How to Play the Middle East Crisis In such times  investors might want to consider traditional safe havens like utilities  Such stocks are generally non cyclical or companies whose performance and sales are not highly correlated with activities in the broader market  Their products are in constant demand  irrespective of market conditions Investors can also look out for defense stocks  After all  such stocks tend to rally when geopolitical tensions rise  banking on a possible uptick in defense contracts  Most importantly  defense stocks tend to outperform the broader market for the six months following a major conflict From the Gulf War  9 11 attacks to 2003 U S  invasion of Iraq  defense stocks have outperformed the broader S P 500 in the six months following such turmoil By the way  unrest in the Middle East could affect supplies of crude oil through the Strait of Hormuz  Nearly 22 5 million barrels of oil pass through the Strait of Hormuz each day since the beginning of 2018  which is roughly 24  of the world s daily oil production  So  any disruption can lead to supply demand disparity  eventually leading to elevated oil prices West Texas Intermediate crude was up 4  in electronic trading on Jan 7  while the global benchmark  Brent crude rose more than 4   And with oil prices going up  shares of energy players  including bigwig oil producers  rig operators and pipeline owners  have followed suit  Hence  adding a solid energy player to your portfolio that can make the most of this bullish oil market seems judicious And as crude oil prices move north  prices of essential goods and commodities increase  And value of gold rises when inflation picks up  After all  it acts as a hedge against inflation  In fact  theoretically  more than 60  of the time  gold and crude oil have a direct relationship  Thus  with oil prices moving north  shares of gold mining companies are poised to gain traction 5 Big GainersWe have  thus  selected five solid

133067,354582,LMT,5 Big Winners From Simmering Tension In The Middle East,opinion,Iran recently struck back at the United States after its top general was killed in a U S  airstrike at Baghdad s airport  Iran fired a series of ballistic missiles at two military camps in Iraq housing American troops The strikes raised concerns of a flare up in tensions between the long term foes   Iran and Iraq  Previously  President Trump had threatened  disproportionate  attacks in case of any retaliatory move by Iran  Trump also threatened sanctions against Iran if it expels U S  troops Tensions had been increasing steadily across the Middle East following Trump s decision to unilaterally withdraw from Tehran s nuclear agreement with world powers  What s more  the recent attacks between Washington and Tehran have been direct and the war is no longer a proxy one  This  undoubtedly  has raised chances of an open conflict between the countries  which have been at loggerheads since Iran s 1979 Islamic Revolution and the subsequent takeover of the U S  Embassy Nonetheless  investors might see a lot of gyrations in the broader stock market  After all  geopolitical tensions affect economic growth  All the major U S  benchmarks are widely expected to remain in the red as investors apprehend that the United States will retaliate following Iran s missile attacks How to Play the Middle East Crisis In such times  investors might want to consider traditional safe havens like utilities  Such stocks are generally non cyclical or companies whose performance and sales are not highly correlated with activities in the broader market  Their products are in constant demand  irrespective of market conditions Investors can also look out for defense stocks  After all  such stocks tend to rally when geopolitical tensions rise  banking on a possible uptick in defense contracts  Most importantly  defense stocks tend to outperform the broader market for the six months following a major conflict From the Gulf War  9 11 attacks to 2003 U S  invasion of Iraq  defense stocks have outperformed the broader S P 500 in the six months following such turmoil    Source  Bloomberg  By the way  unrest in the Middle East could affect supplies of crude oil through the Strait of Hormuz  Nearly 22 5 million barrels of oil pass through the Strait of Hormuz each day since the beginning of 2018  which is roughly 24  of the world s daily oil production  So  any disruption can lead to supply demand disparity  eventually leading to elevated oil prices West Texas Intermediate crude was up 4  in electronic trading on Jan 7  while the global benchmark  Brent crude rose more than 4   And with oil prices going up  shares of energy players  including bigwig oil producers  rig operators and pipeline owners  have followed suit  Hence  adding a solid energy player to your portfolio that can make the most of this bullish oil market seems judicious And as crude oil prices move north  prices of essential goods and commodities increase  And value of gold rises when inflation picks up  After all  it acts as a hedge against inflation  In fact  theoretically  more than 60  of the time  gold and crude oil have a direct relationship  Thus  with oil prices moving north  shares of gold mining companies are poised to gain traction 5 Big GainersWe have  thus  selected five solid stocks from

133085,354600,LMT,Why Lockheed Martin Stock Climbed 49  in 2019,news,"What happened
Shares of Lockheed Martin  NYSE LMT  gained 48 7  last year  according to data provided by S P Global Market Intelligence  That well outperformed the broader market  as represented by the S P 500 index s 30 4  rise in 2019 
The stock rebounded strongly at the beginning of the year after a sharp decline in the fourth quarter of 2018  The company s operating results certainly gave investors much to cheer about  as Lockheed reported better than expected earnings in recent quarters  

So what
Lockheed is one of the largest contractors in the defense industry  It generates about 70  of its annual revenue from contracts awarded by the U S  government  so the varying policies toward military spending of different administrations can have a big impact on growth  In that light  the Trump administration s position on military spending has been beneficial for Lockheed Martin  
Through the first three quarters of 2019  its revenue increased by 11 6  year over year  driven by growth across every segment  aeronautics  missiles and fire control  rotary and mission systems  and space  Several projects underway are driving growth across these segments  but one of the highlights has been the F 35 program  
Nations around the world have placed orders for this advanced aircraft  Lockheed was awarded two contracts worth over  30 billion combined from the U S  Department of Defense in 2019  The anticipated economies of scale from those large orders are expected to help the company manufacture the F 35s at a reduced cost 
Now what
If you re going to buy shares of a defense contractor  it pays to keep track of what s happening on Capitol Hill    Congress has a fair say about military spending too  When the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 was passed  it established increased spending levels for defense and national security for fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021  That has provided some clarity about what kind of revenue growth Lockheed can anticipate  but it also has several initiatives coming into play for the long term 
One of its more interesting opportunities is the Artemis lunar exploration program  which NASA hopes will land the first woman and the next man on the moon by 2024  Beyond that  the Artemis program is intended to provide the capabilities to send astronauts to Mars in the 2030s  
Given its opportunities in areas ranging from aeronautics to space exploration  Lockheed shares could still have upside from their current levels  The stock trades at a modest forward price to earnings ratio of 16 9 and pays a dividend that currently yields 2 13   Analysts expect earnings to grow at an annualized rate of 13 5  over the next five years ",2020-01-07,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pf36g,2054455

133098,354613,LMT,U S  lawmakers reach deal on massive defense bill  eye Russia  Turkey  China,news,"By Patricia Zengerle
WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  lawmakers announced an agreement on Monday on a  738 billion bill setting policy for the Department of Defense  including new measures for competing with Russia and China  family leave for federal workers and the creation of President Donald Trump s long desired Space Force 
It also calls for sanctions on Turkey over its purchase of a Russian missile defense system  and a tough response to North Korea s efforts to develop nuclear weapons 
The U S  House of Representatives and Senate Armed Services Committees agreed on a compromise version of the National Defense Authorization Act  or NDAA  after months of negotiations  It is expected to pass before Congress leaves Washington later this month for the year end holiday break 
The legislation includes  658 4 billion for the Department of Defense and Department of Energy national security programs   71 5 billion to pay for ongoing foreign wars  known as  Overseas Contingency Operations  funding  and  5 3 billion in emergency funding for repairs of damage from extreme weather and natural disasters 
There were concerns earlier this year that the NDAA might fail for the first time in 58 years over steep divides between the Democratic controlled House of Representatives and Republican controlled Senate over Trump s policies 
Because it is one of the few pieces of major legislation Congress passes every year  the NDAA becomes a vehicle for a range of policy measures as well as setting everything from military pay levels to which ships or aircraft will be modernized  purchased or discontinued 
It includes a 3 1  pay hike for the troops  the largest in a decade and  for the first time  12 weeks of paid parental leave for federal workers  something Democrats strongly sought 
Among other things  the proposed fiscal 2020 NDAA imposes sanctions related to Russia s Nord Stream 2 and TurkStream pipelines and bars military to military cooperation with Russia 
Russia is building the pipelines to bolster supply to Europe while bypassing Ukraine  and members of Congress have been pushing the Trump administration to do more to stop the projects as they near completion 
PUNISHING TURKEY
The NDAA also prohibits the transfer of F 35 stealth fighter jets  which  Lockheed Martin  Corp  N LMT  is developing  to Turkey  It expresses a Sense of Congress that Turkey s acquisition of Russia s S 400 missile defense system  which Washington says it not compatible with NATO defenses and threatens the F 35  constitutes a significant transaction under U S  sanctions law 
The bill says Trump should implement sanctions on Turkey over the S 400 purchase  something lawmakers have been demanding 
The NDAA also reauthorizes  300 million of funding for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative  to include lethal defensive items as well as new authorities for coastal defense cruise missiles and anti ship missiles 
Military aid to Ukraine has been at the center of the impeachment inquiry into Trump  after his administration held up security assistance for Kiev last summer even as the country dealt with challenges from Russia 
Fulfilling one of Trump s most high profile requests  the bill establishes the U S  Space Force as the sixth Armed Service of the United States  under the Air Force 
The legislation also contains a series of provisions intended to address potential threats from China  including requiring reports on China s overseas investments and its military relations with Russia 
It bars the use of federal funds to buy rail cars and buses from China  and it says Congress  unequivocally supports  residents of Hong Kong as they defend their rights and seek to preserve their autonomy with China  It also supports improving Taiwan s defense capabilities 
The NDAA calls for a sweeping approach to North Korea s nuclear weapons development  as well as the threat it poses to U S  forces on the Korean peninsula and allies in the region 
It puts mandatory sanctions on North Korean imports and exports of coal and other minerals and textiles  as well as some petroleum products and crude oil  and it puts additional sanctions on banks that deal with North Korea 
The bill also bars the Pentagon from reducing the number of troops deployed to South Korea below 28 500 unless the Secretary of Defense certifies that it is in the U S  national security interest to do so ",2019-12-10,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics/us-lawmakers-reach-deal-on-massive-mustpass-annual-defense-policy-bill-2037501,2037501

SAN FRANCISCO TOKYO  Reuters    D Wave Systems  a Canadian quantum computer firm backed by billionaire Jeff Bezos  Wall Street titan Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  and others  said Japan s NEC Corp will invest in it as part of a fundraising round and will also help it develop software 
Dan Cohrs  chief financial officer at D Wave  told Reuters on Tuesday NEC has committed to investing  10 million in the fundraising round which could close in January  He declined to say how much D Wave was raising and the valuation it aimed for but said some existing investors have committed to participate 
Bezos Expeditions  Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  CEO Jeff Bezos  personal investment fund  In Q Tel  the Central Intelligence Agency s venture capital firm  Fidelity Investments  and Goldman are among D Wave s investors 
Once the funding is finalized  Cohrs said NEC and D Wave will work together to develop software and applications that can work on NEC s supercomputers and D Wave s quantum computers

133126,354641,LMT,Turkey should scrap Russian missile system or face U S  sanctions  White House official,news,"By Humeyra Pamuk
WASHINGTON  Reuters    The United States is very upset about Turkey s purchase of Russian missile defense systems and could impose sanctions on Ankara if it does not  get rid  of them  White House National Security Adviser Robert O Brien said on Sunday 
 Turkey will feel the impact of those sanctions   O Brien told CBS s  Face the Nation  in an interview  referring to penalties under the U S  law known as the Countering America s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act  which he said would pass Congress with  overwhelming  bipartisan support 
His comments came ahead of a visit by Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan to Washington on Nov  13 to meet U S  President Donald Trump for likely crucial talks as the two NATO allies have been at loggerheads over a range of issues 
One key disagreement is Ankara s purchase of the Russian S 400 anti aircraft missile system  which Washington says is incompatible with NATO defenses and threatens its  Lockheed Martin   N LMT  F 35 fighter jets 
Despite threats of U S  sanctions  Turkey started receiving its first S 400 deliveries in July 
In response  Washington removed Turkey from the F 35 program  in which Ankara was a manufacturer and buyer  But so far  it has not slapped any sanctions on Ankara 
Turkey has not yet activated the S 400 batteries it received  and Washington still hopes to persuade its ally to  walk away  from the Russian systems 
 There s no place in NATO for the S 400  There s no place in NATO for significant Russian military purchases  That s a message that the president will deliver to him  Erdogan  very clearly when he s here   O Brien said 
Earlier this month  the head of Turkey s Defense Industry Directorate said a second S 400 delivery to Turkey may be delayed beyond a planned 2020 timeline by talks on technology sharing and joint production 
The S 400 issue is part of a wider range of disagreements between Turkey and the United States

133127,354642,LMT,Japan hosts first fully fledged arms show looking for an edge in tech,news,"By Tim Kelly
TOKYO  Reuters    Japan s first ever fully fledged arms show opened on Monday  creating a forum that Japan s government hopes will help it tap technology it needs to counter threats posed by China and North Korean 
Some 200 protesters gathered near the entrance of the convention centre near Tokyo  calling for the government backed DSEI Japan exhibition to be shut down as they regarded it as an affront to the nation s pacifist constitution 
Worried by increased Chinese military activity in the East China Sea and North Korea s ballistic missile advances  Japan has increased defence spending over the past seven years to around  50 billion annually  purchasing advanced U S  stealth fighters  missile defence interceptors and radar systems 
 Technology is advancing quickly and our equipment can t cope against things such as hypersonic warheads and drones   Gen Nakatani  a former defense minister and senior ruling Liberal Democratic Party lawmaker told Reuters at the arms show 
 Innovation is happening around the world and through an exchange of that Japan will be able to keep up   he added 
China spends more than three times as much as Japan on defence  while recent North Korean advances threaten to make Japan s new missile defences obsolete before they are deployed 
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe s government in 2014 abolished a decades long ban on foreign military exports in a bid to cut procurement costs by allowing Japanese companies such as Mitsubishi Heavy Industries  T 7011  to widen their production base 
Yet in the more than five years since that ban ended Japan has largely failed to make inroads overseas  hobbled both by a lack of experience and concern that the reputational risk of selling arms could hurt other more profitable businesses 
There is still abiding foreign interest in tapping Japanese technology for military use  with companies such as  Lockheed Martin  Corp  N LMT     Raytheon Co   N RTN  and BAE Systems PLC  L BAES  all looking for new partnerships in Japan 
 There is a great deal of interest internationally in seeing what Japan has to offer the world   said Alex Soar  International Development Director at Clarion Events which organized the show covering land  air and naval equipment 
Abe s government faces opposition at home to policies that some Japanese people fear could erode the pacifist constitution and herald a return to the militarism that devastated the country in World War Two 
 Producing more weapons is not going to make us safer  Japan has to rely on diplomacy   said one of the protesters  who only gave her first name Takako ",2019-11-18,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/japan-hosts-first-fullyfledged-arms-show-looking-for-an-edge-in-tech-2022515,2022515

133129,354644,LMT,Exclusive  U S  defense chief calls on Turkey to stop holding up NATO readiness plan,news,"By Phil Stewart
LONDON  Reuters    U S  Defense Secretary Mark Esper urged Turkey on Monday to stop holding up support for a NATO defense plan for the Baltics and Poland  as Ankara presses the alliance to support its fight against U S  backed Kurdish YPG militia in Syria 
In an interview with Reuters ahead of the NATO summit  Esper warned Ankara that  not everybody sees the threats that they see  and added he would not support labeling the YPG as terrorists to break the impasse 
He called on Ankara to focus on the larger challenges facing the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
 The message to Turkey     is we need to move forward on these response plans and it can t be held up by their own particular concerns   Esper said as he flew to London 
 Alliance unity  alliance readiness  means that you focus on the bigger issues   the bigger issue being the readiness of the  NATO  alliance  And not everybody s willing to sign up to their agenda  Not everybody sees the threats that they see  
NATO envoys need formal approval by all 29 members for the plan to improve the defense of Poland  Lithuania  Latvia and Estonia against any threat from neighboring Russia 
The dispute  as NATO prepares to hold its 70th anniversary summit  is a sign of deep divisions between Ankara and Washington over everything from the war in Syria to Turkey s growing defense relationship with Russia 
Turkey wants NATO to formally recognize the YPG militia  the main component of the U S  backed Syrian Democratic Forces  SDF   as terrorists and is infuriated that its allies have given the militia support 
Ankara has blamed Washington for the current impasse  saying it was caused by the U S  withdrawal of support from a separate defense plan for Turkey  covering any possible attack from the south where it borders Syria 
Asked whether Washington might agree to branding the YPG as terrorists in order to break the deadlock  Esper said   I wouldn t support that  
 We re going to stick to our positions  and I think NATO will as well   Esper said 
The issue is the latest source of friction between the NATO allies  which have also been at loggerheads over Turkey s purchase of advanced Russian air defenses  which Washington says are incompatible with NATO defenses and pose a threat to  Lockheed Martin  Corp s  N LMT  F 35 stealth fighter jets 
Washington said in July it was removing Turkey from the F 35 program and has warned of possible U S  sanctions

133132,354647,LMT,Exclusive  U S  military completes pullback from northeast Syria  Esper says,news,"By Phil Stewart
WASHINGTON  Reuters    The United States has completed its military pullback in northeastern Syria  settling into a more stable posture of about 600 troops in the rest of the country after repositioning and reducing forces  Defense Secretary Mark Esper said 
Esper s remarks in an interview with Reuters could signal the end of a period of turbulence and uncertainty surrounding the U S  military presence in Syria after President Donald Trump s initial withdrawal order in October 
Since then  troop levels in Syria have fallen about 40 percent from around 1 000 
Esper stressed he retained the ability to move in and out smaller numbers of forces as needed into Syria  But he suggested the number of troops will fluctuate around the 600 level for the foreseeable future 
 It will be relatively static around that number  But if we see things happen     I can dial up a little bit   Esper said late on Wednesday during a flight back from the NATO summit on the outskirts of London 
Esper also didn t rule out being able to reduce U S  troop levels in Syria further if European allies contributed to the Syria mission 
 The coalition is talking a lot again  We could see some allies want to volunteer troops   Esper said  without suggesting any new contribution was imminent 
 If an allied country  a NATO country  decided to give us 50 people  I might be able to turn off 50 people  
The U S  military says it is focused on preventing a resurgence of Islamic State in Syria and carried out a raid last month that led to the death of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi 
Trump  in London  said he wanted remaining U S  forces to ensure Syria s oil reserves don t fall back into the militant group s hands 
 We kept the oil  And the oil is what fueled ISIS   Trump said  using an acronym for Islamic State 
NO MOVEMENT ON TURKEY S 400S
Trump softened his pullout plans for Syria after backlash from Congress  including among key Republicans  who say he cleared the way for a long threatened Turkish incursion against Kurdish forces in Syria who had been America s top allies in the battle against Islamic State 
NATO diplomats worry that Turkey  a NATO member since 1952 and a critical ally in the Middle East  has increasingly acted unilaterally  launching its incursion in Syria against U S  backed forces and buying advanced Russian S 400 air defenses 
Washington says the S 400 system is incompatible with NATO air defenses  poses a threat to  Lockheed Martin   NYSE LMT  Corp s F 35 stealth fighter jets and announced in July it was removing Turkey from the F 35 program  It has also warned of possible U S  sanctions 
After summit talks between Trump and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan  Esper suggested Ankara had not budged yet on the S 400 issue 
 There s no movement at this point   Esper said 
Still  after lobbying by NATO allies  including the United States  Erdogan backed off from a threat to block defense plans for the Baltic states and Poland unless allies declared Kurdish fighters in Syria terrorists 
 I think it was a positive move forward   Esper said  of the change in position by Turkey 
 They ve been a valuable part of NATO for decades  from the earliest days  So we got to keep them in the fold  ",2019-12-05,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/exclusive-us-military-completes-pullback-from-northeast-syria-esper-says-2034240,2034240

Most people think they can make rational investment decisions  but research indicates the opposite is often true  Investors followed in a DALBAR study performed significantly worse than the S P 500  For the 30 years between 1986 to 2015  the average investor earned just 3 66   whereas the S P 500 produced a 10 35  return 
Importantly  this period included the 1987 crash and big bear markets in 2000 and 2008  but also the bull market of the 1990s 
An important takeaway of this study is that investors seem to underperform because they try to time volatile markets   and irrational  emotional responses tend to these investing mistakes 
Interestingly  even savvy traders tend to underperform because they can t help but allow emotions to drive investment decisions  They may be overconfident and misjudge risk  latch onto a price target  or perceive a pattern that isn t there  This  behavior gap   over the long term  can be catastrophic with potential underperformance of hundreds of thousands of dollars sabotaging your retirement 
What It All Means for Retirement Investors
When it comes to managing your assets for retirement  you must look at performance over the course of years and decades   not weeks or months  Because most traders generally tend to focus on the short term  they may not have the right mindset to achieve successful long term outcomes 
Does that mean you should give up trading  Not necessarily  One solution is to take 10  of your investable assets and trade to generate alpha and seek outsized returns 
However  the major part of your wealth   those assets reserved for retirement   ought to be invested utilizing a more careful  conservative  risk management strategy to produce steady  compounded returns so you can securely achieve your retirement objectives

133163,354678,LMT,Two U S  officials will give depositions in House impeachment probe,news,"By Patricia Zengerle and Lisa Lambert WASHINGTON  Reuters    Two officials who had been asked to testify in the impeachment investigation of U S  President Donald Trump have agreed to provide depositions  an official with a Democratic led House of Representatives committee said on Tuesday  Former U S  Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch will give a deposition on Oct  11  according to the committee official who spoke on condition of anonymity  Trump s former special representative for Ukraine  Kurt Volker  will appear before the panel on Thursday  the official said  Following a whistleblower complaint last week  Democrats are looking into Trump s request to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy during a July 25 phone call to investigate a domestic political rival  former Vice President Joe Biden  Biden is a leading Democratic contender in the contest to run against Republican Trump in the 2020 election  The unidentified whistleblower is said to be an intelligence agent who accused Trump of soliciting foreign interference for his personal political benefit  Earlier on Tuesday  U S  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo pushed back on House Democrats  efforts to get the depositions from State Department officials  accusing the lawmakers of bullying and intimidation  The officials  may not attend any interview or deposition  without executive branch counsel present to control disclosure of confidential information  Pompeo wrote in a letter to House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel  Engel and two other Democratic committee chairmen issued a statement accusing Pompeo of  stonewalling  the impeachment inquiry  and called him a  fact witness  in the investigation  based on media reports that he had listened in on Trump s call with Zelenskiy   He should immediately cease intimidating department witnesses in order to protect himself and the president   Engel and Representatives Adam Schiff and Elijah Cummings said  There was no immediate word on whether three other officials had agreed to requests to appear before the committees  They are Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent  State Department Counselor T  Ulrich Brechbuhl and U S  Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland  The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment  The State Department s inspector general  Steve Linick  will give an urgent briefing on Wednesday to staff members from several House and Senate committees about documents obtained from the department s Office of the Legal Adviser related to the State Department and Ukraine  a source familiar with the briefing said  The briefing was requested by Linick  RESIGNATION Volker resigned last week after the whistleblower named him as one of two U S  diplomats who followed up with Ukrainian officials a day after the Trump Zelenskiy call  The call occurred after Trump froze nearly  400 million in aid intended to help Ukraine deal with an insurgency by Russian backed separatists  Zelenskiy agreed during the call to investigate Biden and his son Hunter and expressed interest in buying more U S  arms in the form of Javelin anti tank missiles  Hunter Biden had served as a director of a Ukrainian gas company   The funds were later provided and a U S  congressional aide said on Tuesday that Ukraine had agreed to buy 150 Javelin missiles  made by Raytheon  NYSE RTN  Co and  Lockheed Martin  Corp  NYSE LMT   in a deal worth  39 million  Leaders of congressional committees signed off on the sale in the past week under an informal review process for major international military sales  The impeachment inquiry could lead to approval of articles of impeachment   or formal charges   against Trump in the House  That would lead to a trial in the Senate on whether to remove him from office  But the president s fellow Republicans control that chamber and have shown little appetite for removing him  Pompeo  who is in Italy for a three day trip  objected to Engel s request for the officials to be made available for depositions  In a letter posted on Twitter  Pompeo told Engel   I am concerned with aspects of your request that can be understood only as an attempt to intimidate  bully and treat improperly the distinguished professionals of the Department of State  including several career Foreign Service Officers  whom the committee is now targeting   Pompeo expressed  significant legal and procedural concerns  and said he viewed a committee letter to the officials as a  request for a voluntary appearance   Pompeo said the announced dates for the depositions did not provide enough time for preparation  He also said his department would respond to a Foreign Affairs Committee subpoena by Friday   He said records that have been requested are subject to restrictions relating to classified information and other executive branch privileges  Pompeo added that there was no legal basis for the committee s assertion that a failure to appear would constitute evidence of obstruction  Pompeo said he would use  all means at my disposal to prevent and expose any attempts to intimidate the dedicated professionals  at the State Department   EVIDENCE OF OBSTRUCTION  Pompeo s letter marked the latest bid by Trump s administration to avoid providing House Democrats testimony and documents relating to numerous investigations of the president  Democrats have accused Trump of a policy of stonewalling legitimate congressional inquiries   Any effort to intimidate witnesses or prevent them from talking with Congress   including State Department employees   is illegal and will constitute evidence of obstruction of the impeachment inquiry   the three Democratic chairmen said  Trump asked Zelenskiy to investigate Biden and his son in coordination with U S  Attorney General William Barr and Trump s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani  Trump continued on Tuesday to assail the impeachment inquiry and defend his call with Zelenskiy  The president asked on Twitter   Why aren t we entitled to interview   learn everything about the Whistleblower  and also the person who gave all of the false information to him   Trump also wrote that Schiff should be  brought up on charges   A senior Republican senator  Chuck Grassley  came to the defense of the whistleblower   This person appears to have followed the whistleblower protection laws and ought to be heard out and protected   Grassley said in a statement

WASHINGTON  Reuters    The Pentagon s decision to move into a full rate production contract for the F 35 jet  made by  Lockheed Martin   N LMT   could be delayed until 2021 because of issues integrating the jet with its testing and training simulators  an official said on Friday 
Full rate production contracts are more lucrative for defense companies than low rate production contracts  suggesting larger payments for F 35 deliveries to Lockheed from the U S  government and its allies could be delayed by as much as a year 
Pentagon acquisition chief Ellen Lord told reporters she had signed off on a report that indicated the final decision on full rate production could be delayed up to 13 months 
A decision on full rate production had been expected this December 
 We are not making as quick progress on the joint simulation environment  integrating the F 35 into it   Lord said 
The Joint Simulation Environment is a government owned modeling and simulation facility that can be used for testing aircraft and flight systems as a supplement to open air testing 
A Lockheed Martin representative said the company was  confident the full F 35 enterprise is prepared for full rate production and ready to meet growing customer demand

How Diversification Differs from Stock Picking
While stock picking can potentially generate outsized returns  its excessive concentrated risk can present huge perils for retirement investors 
A study done by Hendrik Bessembinder of equity markets over nine decades found that just 4  of the best performing U S stocks generated all the market s gains  The rest were flat   the gains of the next 38  were wiped out by the bottom 58   which lost money

Is it Possible to Invest  Rationally  
Investors feel they can make sensible choices  however research demonstrates that the opposite is what often happens  A DALBAR study analyzed investors from 1986 to 2015 and found that the average investor significantly underperformed compared to the S P 500  Over 30 years  the S P 500 produced a return of 10 35   while the average investor return was only 3 66  
Importantly  this period included the 1987 crash and big bear markets in 2000 and 2008  but also the bull market of the 1990s 
An important takeaway of this study is that investors seem to underperform because they try to time volatile markets   and irrational  emotional responses tend to these investing mistakes 
Curiously  even experienced traders tend to underperform since they can t resist the emotional urge to make impulsive investment choices  They might be overly self assured and miscalculate risk  get attached to a price target  or perceive a pattern that does not exist  This behavioral fallacy  over the long term  can be disastrous with potential underperformance of a huge number of dollars disrupting your retirement

133193,354708,LMT,U S  Senator Graham says he is trying to get Turkey back in F 35 fold,news," Reuters    U S  Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said on Sunday after meeting Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan that he would like to get NATO ally Turkey back in a joint manufacturing program for F 35 fighter jets  from which it was expelled in July 
 We re trying to get them back in the F 35 program   Graham  a close ally of U S  President Donald Trump  said in New York  according to a video posted on Twitter and reports in Turkish media 
Ankara and Washington have clashed over Turkey s purchase of Russian S 400 missile defenses  which the United States says are not compatible with NATO defenses and pose a threat to  Lockheed Martin   NYSE LMT  Corp s F 35 stealth jets 
Washington removed Turkey from the joint F 35 program after Turkey accepted delivery of S 400 equipment in July  Ankara also aimed to purchase some of the jets but now says it could look elsewhere 
Turkish media outlets said Graham met Erdogan in New York ahead of the United Nations General Assembly 
In the video  Graham said he and Erdogan discussed a possible free trade agreement   Turkey is a very important ally  not just when it comes to Syria but for the whole region   he told reporters 
Erdogan is scheduled to meet Trump in New York this week 
In an interview earlier this month  Erdogan told Reuters he would discuss with Trump buying U S  Patriot missile defenses  adding his personal bond with the U S  leader could overcome a crisis caused by the S 400 purchase   nL5N2644E4 
State owned Anadolu agency reported that Trump and Erdogan held a phone call on Sunday in which they discussed bilateral relations and regional issues ",2019-09-22,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/us-senator-graham-says-he-is-trying-to-get-turkey-back-in-f35-fold-1983421,1983421

133195,354710,LMT,Factbox  Six new pieces of information in memo on Trump s Ukraine call,news,"By Heather Timmons
WASHINGTON  Reuters    The White House released a memo on Wednesday summarizing President Donald Trump s phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in July that prompted Democrats in the U S  House of Representatives to start an impeachment inquiry 
In the memo  Trump asks Zelenskiy directly to investigate his political rival  Democratic challenger Joe Biden  Biden s son s business dealings  and a Ukraine prosecutor 
The memo is more damning than anticipated  said Adam Schiff  the Democrat who heads the House Intelligence Committee  He called it a  mafia like shakedown  of a foreign leader 
Republicans said it showed Democrats were wrong to move forward with impeachment   There was no quid pro quo and nothing to justify the clamor House Democrats caused   said Doug Collins of Georgia  the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee 
The memo shows Trump pressured Zelenskiy to look into other issues beyond Biden  while criticizing U S  allies and a former ambassador  Here are six new pieces of information it contains  in order of appearance 
TRUMP SAYS MERKEL DOES NOTHING FOR UKRAINE
Trump says that the United States is doing much more for Ukraine than European countries  and singles out German Chancellor Angela Merkel  The European Union has given 3 3 billion euros   3 6 billion  financial assistance to Ukraine  since 2014  the largest to any non EU country  Reuters reported in July 
 I will say that we do a lot for Ukraine  We spend a lot of effort and a lot of time  Much more than the European countries are doing and they should be helping you more than they are Germany does almost nothing for you  All they do is talk and I think it s something that you should  really ask them about  When I was speaking to Angela Merkel she talks Ukraine  but she doesn t do anything  
ZELENSKIY COMMITS TO BUY RAYTHEON LOCKHEED EQUIPMENT
Zelenskiy says he plans to buy more Javelins  anti tank missiles developed by the United States military that are now produced by  Raytheon Co   N RTN  and  Lockheed Martin  Corp  N LMT  
 I would also like to thank you for your great support in the area of defense  We are ready to continue to cooperate for the next steps specifically we are almost ready to buy more Javelins from the United States for defense purposes  
TRUMP ASKS FOR INVESTIGATION OF TECH COMPANY THAT FINGERED RUSSIA
The president asks Zelenskiy to  do us a favor  and investigate CrowdStrike  the American cybersecurity company that investigated the hacking of the Democratic National Committee  CrowdStrike was one of three firms that led U S  intelligence officials to conclude Russian intelligence had hacked the DNC  former FBI Director James Comey told Congress in January 2017 
Trump says   I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it  I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine  they say Crowdstrike     I guess you have one of your wealthy people    The server  they say Ukraine has it  
In his response  Zelenskiy agrees to the request  saying   I also plan to surround myself with great people and in addition to that investigation  I guarantee as the president of Ukraine that all the investigations will be done openly and candidly  
TRUMP PRESENTS GIULIANI AS A KEY U S  CONTACT
Rudy Giuliani  the president s personal lawyer  holds no official government position  That means he has not been subject to the U S  Senate confirmation process like other top presidential advisers  Still  he is mentioned multiple times as a go to figure in the U S  Ukraine relationship 
Zelenskiy indicates his office is in touch with Giuliani early in the call   I will personally tell you that one of my assistants spoke with Mr  Giuliani just recently and we are hoping very much that Mr  Giuliani will be able to travel to Ukraine and we will meet once he comes to Ukraine  I just wanted to assure you once again that you have nobody but friends around us  
Later  Trump says of Giuliani   He was the mayor of New York City  a great mayor  and I would like him to call you  I will ask him to call you along with the attorney general  Rudy very much knows what s happening and he is a very capable guy  
Then  Trump says twice more he will ask Giuliani and Barr to call  pairing the U S  attorney general together with his personal lawyer 
ZELENSKIY SAYS HE STAYS AT A TRUMP PROPERTY
Zelenskiy said he stayed at Trump Tower  Trump s New York apartment building  The building is not a Trump hotel  It is a condominium residence  He indicates that Ukrainian citizens are buying property there 
 I would like to tell you that I also have quite a few Ukrainian friends that live in the United States   he says   Actually last time I traveled to the United States  I stayed in New York near Central Park and I stayed at the Trump Tower  I will talk to them and I hope to see them again in the future  
THE TWO DISCUSS INVESTIGATING A U S  AMBASSADOR Speaking of Marie Yovanovitch  the former ambassador to Ukraine who was abruptly removed from her post in May  Trump says   The former ambassador from the United States  the woman  was bad news and the people she was dealing with in the Ukraine were bad news so I just wanted to let you know that  
Later  Zelenskiy says   I would kindly ask you if you have any additional information that you can provide to us  it would be very helpful for the investigation to make sure that we administer justice in our country with regard to the Ambassador to the United States from Ukraine as far as I recall her name was Ivanovich sic    It was great that you were the first one who told me that she was a bad ambassador because I agree with you 100   
Trump responds  Well  she s going to go through some things   then says he will have Giuliani  give you a call  with Attorney General Barr to  get to the bottom of it  ",2019-09-25,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics/factbox-six-new-pieces-of-information-in-memo-on-trumps-ukraine-call-1986213,1986213
133196,354711,LMT,Seeking deals not sanctions  Turkey s Erdogan attends Trump reception,news,"ISTANBUL  Reuters    Turkey s President Tayyip Erdogan met President Donald Trump at a reception in New York on Wednesday  the last day of a trip to attend the U N  General Assembly that Erdogan had said would include meeting Trump to discuss buying U S  Patriot missiles 
Turkey s presidency said on Twitter that Erdogan had attended the reception and provided a picture showing the Turkish leader and his wife Emine with Trump and first lady Melania  It gave no other details and did not say whether the two leaders only met or also had talks 
Turkish markets have been watching Erdogan s trip closely for any signs that a meeting between the NATO allies might be able to dispel the threat of U S  sanctions over Ankara s purchase of Russia s S 400 missile defense system 
Washington says the S 400 is incompatible with NATO defenses and poses a threat to  Lockheed Martin   NYSE LMT  Corp s F 35 stealth jet program  which Turkey was also planning to buy 
In an interview with Reuters earlier this month  Erdogan said he would discuss buying Patriot missiles with Trump when they met at the U N  General Assembly 
Broadcaster CNN Turk reported on Tuesday that U S  ambassador to Ankara David Satterfield recently gave a presentation at the presidential palace about a possible free trade accord that would include Turkey s participation in the F 35 program as well as the Patriot purchase 
Media reports also referred to steps to lower customs duties on steel and aluminum  and to an existing target of quadrupling bilateral trade between the two countries to  100 billion a year 
Before departing for New York on Saturday  Erdogan told reporters that he would also speak to Trump about the joint efforts between Ankara and Washington to establish a safe zone in northern Syria along the Turkish border 
In his speech to the General Assembly on Tuesday  Erdogan said establishing a  safe zone  in northern Syria will save millions of lives 
Turkey hosts 3 6 million Syrian refugees and controls parts of northern Syria where it says 350 000 Syrians have already returned ",2019-09-25,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/seeking-deals-not-sanctions-turkeys-erdogan-attends-trump-reception-1986242,1986242
133197,354712,LMT,Seeking favors  Trump asked Ukraine president to investigate Biden,news,"By Andy Sullivan and Patricia Zengerle WASHINGTON  Reuters    President Donald Trump pressed Ukraine s president to investigate a political rival  former Vice President Joe Biden  in coordination with the U S  attorney general and Trump s personal lawyer  according to a summary of a telephone call released by the Trump administration on Wednesday  The official account of the half hour July call with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy laid bare an astonishing exchange of requests  pledges and ingratiation  including some unrelated to Biden  The summary was released a day after U S  House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the Democratic led chamber was launching an official impeachment inquiry  setting up a political showdown that threatens Trump s presidency as he campaigns for re election in 2020  The details of the July 25 call drew furious reactions from Democrats  who accused Trump of soliciting Ukraine s help to smear Biden  the front runner among Democratic candidates seeking to challenge the Republican president in the November 2020 election  The call occurred after Trump had ordered a freeze of nearly  400 million in American aid to Ukraine  which the administration only later released   What those notes reflect is a classic Mafia like shakedown of a foreign leader   said Democrat Adam Schiff  chairman of the House Intelligence Committee  Republicans said it showed Democrats were wrong to move forward with impeachment   There was no quid pro quo and nothing to justify the clamor House Democrats caused   said Doug Collins of Georgia  the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee  Trump and Zelenskiy appeared side by side in New York on the sidelines of the U N  General Assembly and denied impropriety in their call  with Ukraine s president telling reporters   Nobody pushed me   At a news conference closing out three days of meetings in New York around the United Nations General Assembly  Trump accused Democrats of launching the impeachment inquiry  because they can t beat us at the ballot   In a statement  Biden said Trump put personal politics above his oath of office and that Congress must hold him to account for  his abuse of power   The controversy arose after a whistleblower from within the U S  intelligence community brought a complaint relating to Trump s conversation with Zelenskiy   Members of the House and Senate Intelligence committees were allowed to see the complaint on Wednesday  the day before acting U S  director of national intelligence  Joseph Maguire  testifies at a House intelligence panel hearing   Democratic lawmakers said the allegations were credible and deeply disturbing  while Republicans largely downplayed the complaint  Chuck Schumer  the U S  Senate s top Democrat  called for the complaint to be released   The public has a right to read the whistleblower s complaint for themselves  The contents of the complaint should be made public immediately   he said in a statement   A LOT OF TALK  According to the summary  Trump told Zelenskiy that Attorney General William Barr  the top U S  law enforcement official  and Trump personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani would speak to him about reopening a Ukrainian investigation into a Ukrainian gas company for which Biden s son Hunter had served as director   The other thing  there s a lot of talk about Biden s son  that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that  so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great   Trump said  referring to Barr  Trump has repeatedly suggested wrongdoing by Biden and his son but has offered no evidence to back up the assertion  In the summary  Trump never explicitly told Zelenskiy that U S  aid was contingent on him investigating Biden  but Trump emphasized the importance of American support before pressing him for action on Biden   I will say that we do a lot for Ukraine   Trump said  Trump then said German Chancellor Angela Merkel  doesn t do anything  for Ukraine but that  the United States has been very  very good to Ukraine   According to the summary  Zelenskiy responds that Trump is  1 000   right  thanks Trump for  your great support in the area of defense  and said he planned to buy more Javelins  anti tank missiles developed by the U S  military that are now produced by  Raytheon Co   N RTN  and  Lockheed Martin  Corp  N LMT   In raising the Biden issue  Trump told Zelenskiy   I heard you had a prosecutor who was very good and he was shut down and that s really unfair   Trump said he would have Giuliani   a political ally with no formal role in the U S  government   and Barr call him   Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it  It sounds horrible to me   Trump said  There has been no evidence that Biden  who served as U S  vice president from 2009 to 2017  used his position to help his son in the Ukraine matter  Zelenskiy assured Trump that his next prosecutor general  will be 100  my person  and  will look into the situation   Zelenskiy  a former comedian  then volunteered that the last time he visited New York  he stayed at Trump Tower  He told Ukrainian media later that he thought only Trump s side of their phone call would be published   I also want to ensure you that we will be very serious about the case and will work on the investigation   Zelenskiy added  After Zelenskiy s promise  Trump invites him to visit the White House  BARR S ROLE Trump never actually asked Barr to contact Ukraine  Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said  and Barr has not communicated with Ukraine about a possible investigation or any other subject  Barr  a Trump appointee  first found out about the conversation several weeks after it took place  Kupec said  The House inquiry could lead to articles of impeachment in the House that could trigger a trial in the Senate on whether to remove Trump from office   Pelosi said the notes on the call confirmed that Trump engaged in behavior that undermined the integrity of U S  elections  the dignity of the presidency and national security   The president has tried to make lawlessness a virtue in America and now is exporting it abroad   Pelosi said  The summary  not a verbatim transcript  was developed with assistance from voice recognition software along with note takers and experts listening  a White House official said  REPEATED SCANDALS Trump has withstood repeated scandals since taking office in 2017  House Democrats had considered  but never moved ahead with  pursuing articles of impeachment over Trump s actions relating to Russian interference in the 2016 U S  election aimed at boosting his candidacy  Under the U S  Constitution  the House has the power to impeach a president for  high crimes and misdemeanors   No president has ever been removed from office through impeachment  Democrats control the House and Trump s fellow Republicans control the Senate  Justice Department officials concluded last week that Trump s conduct on the call did not amount to a criminal violation of campaign finance law because what he was asking for   an investigation of a political rival   was not a quantifiable  thing of value   said a senior Justice Department official  speaking on condition of anonymity  Trump has defended his actions in the Ukraine matter as appropriate  Trump denounced the impeachment move on Wednesday as  the single greatest witch hunt in American history   The United States  European countries and others had pushed for the ouster of the Ukrainian prosecutor investigating the energy company because he was not pursuing it aggressively enough  The prosecutor who replaced him  Yuriy Lutsenko  told Reuters on Friday that no wrongdoing was found on the part of Biden s son in his relationship with the energy firm  Ukrainian officials have not said publicly that they would open any investigation of Biden or his son  Many Republicans came to Trump s defense and said the absence of a quid pro quo   a Latin phrase meaning a favor for a favor   in the call showed that the concerns of Democrats were overblown  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell denounced what he called the Democratic  impeachment obsession   Senator Pat Toomey said Trump s conversation about Biden was inappropriate but not an impeachable offense  But fellow Republican Senator Mitt Romney said he had read the memo and  it remains troubling in the extreme   AID TO UKRAINE The United States has been giving military aid to Ukraine since Russia s annexation of Crimea in 2014  The  391 5 million in aid at issue in the current controversy was approved by Congress to help Ukraine deal with an insurgency by Russian backed separatists in the eastern part of the country  The whistleblower was concerned that Trump was pressuring a foreign leader to take an official action that would help his 2020 re election  according to a legal memo released by the Justice Department s Office of Legal Counsel  The Inspector General s office found  some indication of an arguable political bias  by the whistleblower in favor of a rival political candidate   but determined that the allegation appeared credible  according to the office  The Justice Department concluded that the whistleblower complaint did not need to be shared with Congress because the relevant law only covers conduct by intelligence officials  not the president  according to a legal analysis released by the department s Office of Legal Counsel  
The Justice Department said Barr would not recuse himself from Ukraine related investigations despite Democratic demands ",2019-09-25,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/house-democrats-plunge-into-trump-impeachment-inquiry-1985527,1985527

133199,354714,LMT,Japan promotes China as bigger threat than nuclear armed North Korea,news,"By Tim Kelly TOKYO  Reuters    China s growing military might has replaced North Korean belligerence as the main security threat to Japan  Tokyo s annual defense review indicated on Thursday  despite signs that Pyongyang could have nuclear tipped ballistic missiles   The document s security assessment on China comes after a section on Japan s ally  the United States  the first time Beijing has achieved second place in the Defense White Paper and pushing North Korea into third position  Russia  deemed by Japan as its primary threat during the Cold War  was in fourth place   The reality is that China is rapidly increasing military spending  and so people can grasp that we need more pages   Minister of Defense Taro Kono said at a media briefing   China is deploying air and sea assets in the Western Pacific and through the Tsushima Strait into the Sea of Japan with greater frequency    Japan has raised defense spending by a tenth over the past seven years to counter military advances by Beijing and Pyongyang  including defenses against North Korean missiles which may carry nuclear warheads  the paper said   North Korea has conducted short range missile launches this year that Tokyo believes show Pyongyang is developing projectiles to evade its Aegis ballistic missile defenses  To stay ahead of China s modernizing military  Japan is buying U S  made stealth fighters and other advanced weapons  In its latest budget request  Japan s military asked for 115 6 billion yen   1 1 billion  to buy nine  Lockheed Martin   NYSE LMT  F 35 stealth fighters  including six short take off and vertical landing  STOVL  variants to operate from converted helicopter carriers   The stealth jets  U S  made interceptor missiles and other equipment are part of a proposed 1 2  increase in defense spending to a record 5 32 trillion yen in the year starting April 1  By comparison  Chinese military spending is set to rise this year by 7 5  to about  177 billion from 2018  more than three times that of Japan  Beijing is developing weapons such as stealth fighters and aircraft carriers that are helping it expand the range and scope of military operations  Once largely confined to operating close to the Chinese coast  Beijing now routinely sends its air and sea patrols near Japan s western Okinawa islands and into the Western Pacific  China has frequently rebuffed concerns about its military spending and intentions  including a ramped up presence in the disputed South China Sea  and says it only desires peaceful development  The Defense White Paper said Chinese patrols in waters and skies near Japanese territory are  a national security concern    The paper downgraded fellow U S  ally  South Korea  which recently pulled out of an intelligence sharing pact with Japan amid a spat over their shared wartime history  That could weaken efforts to contain North Korean threats  analysts said   Other partners  including Australia  the Association of Southeast Asian Nations  ASEAN  and India  feature more prominently in the defense paper   It s a reflection of the level of cooperation we undertake with each partner   a defense ministry official said at an earlier briefing   South Korean government officials took issue with the White Paper s reference to ownership of an island in the Sea of Japan that is also claimed and controlled by South Korea  The outcrop is known as Dokdo in Seoul and Takeshima in Tokyo

133200,354715,LMT,Exclusive  As North Korea expands arsenal  Japan s missile defense shield faces unforeseen costs   sources,news,"By Tim Kelly TOKYO  Reuters    Additional tests may add at least  500 million to Japan s price tag for two U S  built ballistic missile interceptor stations that could struggle to shoot down the latest North Korean missile types  four government and defense sources said  The tests are required to show the system is working properly  according to  Lockheed Martin   the manufacturer  Held in Hawaii rather than Japan  they would cost about  100 million per launch    Japan is waiting to hear back from the U S  Missile Defense Agency about what tests will be required   said one of the sources   Those tests haven t been budgeted for    As part of a major defense upgrade  Japan in 2018 agreed to buy the land based Aegis Ashore sites offered by Washington  rejecting a new U S  Navy radar offered by  Raytheon Co   N RTN  in favor of one designed by rival Lockheed Martin Corp  N LMT    The Japanese defense minister at the time  Itsunori Onodera  did not know Japan would also have to pay for missile launches to test the Lockheed radar  the sources said  One of the defense sources said the Japanese government had thought computer simulated tests would be sufficient  All four asked not to be identified because they are not authorized to talk to the media  An official at Onodera s parliamentary office declined a request to interview the senior ruling party lawmaker about the issue  It is unclear whether other Japanese officials knew about the tests   That topic would have been addressed in government to government discussions   said Lockheed Martin spokeswoman Mona Neuhass   Regardless of the radar selected  a live fire test will be required to verify the fire control loop    Japan s Ministry of Defense said it had no immediate comment  The Japanese government  among the top three foreign buyers of U S  military hardware for the past three years  must now explain additional spending on a multibillion dollar project  The contract for the Aegis Ashore systems has not yet been signed  The systems are scheduled to be operational by 2024    It may be an opportunity for Japan to rethink Aegis Ashore in favor of integrated air missile defense   said one of the sources  who is familiar with Japan s military planning  Integrated air missile defense  IAMD  is a broader approach to defense  with multiple components to counter threats ranging from warheads plunging from space to lower altitude attacks such as cruise missiles  This year  North Korea tested ballistic missiles whose warheads appeared to maneuver in flight  making them harder to shoot down  Lockheed Martin referred requests to comment on new North Korean missiles to Japan s Ministry of Defense and the Missile Defense Agency  So far Japan has budgeted  1 2 billion for Aegis Ashore hardware but expects other costs  including construction  maintenance and operational expenses over three decades to put the final tally for two sites at  4 31 billion   Hiranao Honda  a lawmaker with the opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan and director of its security division  said the additional costs showed the program should be shut down   There are a series of costs that have yet to be budgeted for  such as construction  and we still have to pay for the missiles  There has not been an adequate explanation from the government   said Honda  who has requested more details from the defense ministry on Aegis Ashore costs    He noted that Japan already had eight warships with a similar but less capable Aegis system that can attack incoming missiles  ALARM A recent series of short range missile tests by Pyongyang  which U S  President Donald Trump dismissed as unimportant  have prompted alarm in Japan   Former defense chief Takeshi Iwaya said last month that those launches appeared to test new missiles with irregular trajectories designed to penetrate ballistic missile defenses  including the Aegis Ashore stations  Typically  such defense systems are designed to counter projectiles on predictable flight paths  Both Lockheed Martin s Solid State Radar and Raytheon s SPY 6  which the U S  Navy is putting in its latest Aegis equipped ships  promise a major boost to Aegis s ability to detect and hit incoming targets  Japan will also have to buy interceptor missiles along with the radar  The latest missile for the Aegis system  the SM 3 Block IIA  jointly developed by Japan s Mitsubishi Heavy Industries  T 7011  and Raytheon  cost about  30 million each   Using some of those missiles for tests would add to the cost of setting up the system  as would paying for targets that mimic incoming warheads  TESTS OVERSEAS Holding those tests in Japan could crank up tensions in East Asia  so Tokyo would conduct them at a more isolated test site in Hawaii  according to three of the sources  Japan would have to pay for a temporary Aegis Ashore site there as well as interceptors  including the pricey Block IIA  which would be destroyed in any test  Aside from personnel and target missiles  Japan would also pay for an exclusion zone to keep commercial shipping and aircraft away from the tests  One test could cost about  100 million  according to one of the sources  who has knowledge of past tests conducted by the United States in Hawaii  
Configuring Aegis Ashore to fire other interceptors that could target newer North Korean would require additional tests  he added ",2019-09-27,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusive-as-north-korea-expands-arsenal-japans-missile-defense-shield-faces-unforeseen-costs--sources-1987554,1987554

133224,354739,LMT,The Extreme Risks Of Trading Your Own Retirement Assets   November 13  2019,opinion,"You have a significant retirement portfolio  You re an experienced investor  You ve done pretty well at picking stocks  You probably even own a few of Zacks Top Retirement stock picks like 
Jernigan Capital  JCAP   PennyMac Mortgage  PMT  and Lockheed Martin  LMT  
If that sounds like you  should you actively trade your own retirement assets 
Maybe   if you re an exceptional investor who can expertly manage risk and keep up perfectly resolute emotional control in the face of market volatility  Be that as it may  for most investors  there might be better ways to accomplish long term retirement investing objectives 
Active stock trading requires a very different investing approach and risk   reward mindset than investing for retirement 
How Diversification Differs from Stock Picking
Picking individual stocks has the potential for huge returns   but also carries a lot of risk  which is particularly hazardous when investing for retirement 
In fact  a study done by Hendrik Bessembinder revealed that only 4  of equities produced all of the stock market s gains over the last 90 years  All other stocks  broke even  with the increases of 38  canceled out by the losses of the bottom 58  
For even the most talented stock pickers  the odds for long term success are slim 
Is Investing Success All In Your Mind 
Investors think they can make rational decisions  but research shows that the opposite is often true  A recent DALBAR study tracked investors from 1986 to 2015 and found that the average investor substantially underperformed compared to the S P 500  Over 30 years  the S P 500 returned 10 35   but the average investor return was just 3 66  
It is worth noting that this period included the 1987 crash and enormous bear markets in 2000 and 2008  and the positively trending market of the 1990s as well 
This study suggests that one key reason for investor underperformance is trying to time volatile markets   and that irrational behavior biases tend to compound investor mistakes 
Interestingly  even savvy traders tend to underperform because they can t help but allow emotions to drive investment decisions  They may be overconfident and misjudge risk  latch onto a price target  or perceive a pattern that isn t there  This  behavior gap   over the long term  can be catastrophic with potential underperformance of hundreds of thousands of dollars sabotaging your retirement 
What It All Means for Retirement Investors
Your retirement portfolio should be managed with a strategy of performance over decades   not days  weeks or quarters  Most self directed investors tend to fall short when it comes to long term results 
We re not saying you should not trade at all   far from it  If you enjoy trading  perhaps you should put 10  of your investable assets to work in short term investments to seek alpha and outsized returns 
But the bulk of your wealth   those assets earmarked for retirement   should be invested using a more measured  conservative  risk management approach to generate steady  compounded returns so you can safely reach your retirement goals

133226,354741,LMT,Trump   I am the chosen one  to take on China over trade,news,"By Jeff Mason
WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  President Donald Trump on Wednesday said he was  the chosen one  to address trade imbalances with China  even as congressional researchers warned that his tariffs would reduce U S  economic output by 0 3  in 2020 
Trump told reporters his life would be easier if he had not mounted a trade war with China  But he defended his actions and said he believed a trade deal between the world s largest economies was still possible 
 I am the chosen one     so I am taking on China  I m taking on China on trade  And you know what  We re winning   Trump said  claiming a title often used to refer to religious figures such Jesus and Mohammed 
Trump acknowledged for a second consecutive day that the trade war with China could harm the U S  economy  although he insists a recession is not on the horizon 
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office on Wednesday became the latest independent institution to warn about the consequences of tariffs Trump has ordered imposed against China and a host of other countries 
The CBO said changes in U S  and foreign trade policies since January 2018 will reduce inflation adjusted U S  gross domestic product by 0 3 percent from what it would be otherwise in 2020 
The International Monetary Fund has said that global economic output could be reduced by as much as 0 5  in 2020 as a result of tariffs 
CBO said the tariffs were boosting domestic prices  reducing consumers  purchasing power and boosting the cost of business investment  Real income for the average U S  household was also expected to drop by 0 4 percent  it said 
Trump on Tuesday told reporters he had to confront China over trade even if it caused short term harm to the U S  economy because Beijing had been cheating Washington for decades 
China s Foreign Ministry appeared to downplay the comments  emphasizing the need for dialogue to resolve differences on trade issues but threatened to retaliate if Washington proceeded with an  8 billion arms sale to Taiwan 
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang reiterated a threat to put sanctions on U S  companies which sell weapons to Taiwan  saying such sales are a serious interference in China s internal affairs and violation of Chinese sovereignty 
Washington on Tuesday formally announced approval of a possible sale of 66  Lockheed Martin   N LMT  F 16 fighter jets to Taiwan 
Trump s tariff plans have roiled global markets and unnerved investors as the trade dispute between the world s two largest economies stretches into its second year with no end in sight

133228,354743,LMT,Japan s military seek eighth straight annual hike in defense spending,news,"By Tim Kelly
TOKYO  Reuters    Japan s military has asked for an eighth straight annual increase in defense spending to help pay for U S  made interceptor missiles  stealth fighters  and other equipment it wants to counter threats from North Korea and China 
The Ministry of Defence budget proposal released Friday calls for spending to increase 1 2 percent to a record 5 32 trillion yen   50 48 billion  in the year starting April 1  Finance ministry officials will scrutinize the request before it is approved by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe s cabinet 
Already one of the world s biggest military spenders despite a constitution that forbids the possession of weapons to attack other countries  Japan has increased military outlays by a tenth over the past seven years  That growth is being driven by alarm over military build ups by its neighbors 
Japan s spending  much of it on advanced weapons from the United States  has benefited the likes of  Lockheed Martin  Corp  NYSE LMT  and Raytheon  NYSE RTN  Co  and worried local contractors such as Mitsubishi Heavy Industries who have seen their share of defense spending shrink 
U S  President Donald Trump has thanked Japan for buying the expensive U S  equipment  helping curtail criticism of Japan amid trade tensions between Tokyo and Washington 
For the next fiscal year  Japan s defense officials have asked for 115 6 billion yen to buy nine Lockheed Martin F 35 stealth fighters  including for the first time six short take off and vertical landing  STOVL  B variants that it wants to operate from aircraft carriers  That purchase will help Japan project military power by extending the range at which the country s Self Defense Forces can operate 
The defense ministry also wants 116 3 billion yen to bolster ballistic missile defenses  BMD   including money for a new generation of interceptor missiles designed by Raytheon to shoot down incoming warheads in space  It also wants funds for vertical launch systems for ships and two planned ground based Aegis Ashore radar missile tracking stations ",2019-08-30,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/japans-military-seek-eighth-straight-annual-hike-in-defense-spending-1967033,1967033

133232,354747,LMT,U S  unlikely to impose sanctions on Turkey over Russian buy  Turkish official,news,"By Humeyra Pamuk
WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  President Donald Trump has become more understanding about why Turkey has purchased a Russian missile defense system and he is not expected to impose U S  sanctions on Ankara over the issue  a senior Turkish official said on Wednesday 
 My expectation is it  sanctions  would not be implemented   the senior official told reporters in Washington  adding that Trump had grown to empathize more with Ankara s position   He understood the whole history behind how we got to purchasing the S 400s   she said 
Ankara and Washington have been at loggerheads over Turkey s purchase of the S 400 system  which the United States says is incompatible with NATO defenses and poses a threat to  Lockheed Martin   NYSE LMT  Corp s F 35  stealth  fighter jet that Turkey was also planning to purchase and in which it had been a production partner 
Turkey says it is facing multiple threats from Syria and is in urgent need of a comprehensive defense system 
The United States has expelled Ankara from the F 35 program over its purchase of the Russian air defense system  whose parts began arriving in Turkey in July  but it has so far fallen short of imposing sanctions on Ankara  even though it had threatened to do so for months 
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment 
At a bilateral meeting in June in Osaka with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan  Trump said Turkey had been treated unfairly over its decision to buy the S 400s and blamed the  mess  on the administration of former President Barack Obama 
But he had not ruled out sanctions 
Last week  U S  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the Trump administration was considering imposing sanctions related to Turkey s purchase of the S 400s but that no decisions had been made 
Erdogan told Reuters in an interview last week that he would discuss buying U S  Patriot missiles with Trump at next week s United Nations General Assembly meeting  saying his personal bond with the U S  leader could overcome the months long crisis between two NATO allies 
The senior Turkish official said any imposition of sanctions would also contradict a recent agreement between Ankara and Washington to boost trade to  100 billion after the visit of U S  Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to Turkey earlier this month 
 You make a commitment like that and then you talk about implementing sanctions  that s a big contradiction in itself   she said ",2019-09-18,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/us-unlikely-to-impose-sanctions-on-turkey-over-russian-buy-turkish-official-1981317,1981317

Hours after the GDP report s release  the Federal Reserve cut the benchmark federal funds rate by a quarter percentage point  to a range between 1 50  and 1 75   and began to play down expectations for further cuts  Let s take a look at a few stocks that investors can consider as the domestic economic expansion continues its record run 
Lockheed Martin   NYSE LMT   has continued to secure big defense contracts from the Pentagon that helped bolster its third quarter report  the company saw its bottom line grow 10  and its top line pop 6   Some of those notable contracts include a  2 4 billion contract to procure initial spares for the F 35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter jets and a  492 1 million contract for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems  HIMARS  M142 launchers 
Lockheed Martin also secured a  2 7 billion contract from NASA to build at least three Orion spacecraft for use in its Artemis program to return astronauts to the moon by 2024  The big contracts the aerospace giant has lined up  paired with the way the government has ramped up its defense spending  should keep revenue coming in for years to come

133247,354762,LMT,The Extreme Risks Of Trading Your Own Retirement Assets   November 01  2019,opinion,"Maybe you re a seasoned investor and have a good track record with stock picking  And you may have a robust retirement portfolio   perhaps including some Zacks Top Retirement stock selections such as 
Lockheed Martin  LMT   Preferred Apartment Communities  APTS  and American Eagle Outfitters  NYSE AEO  
If that sounds like you  should you actively trade your own retirement assets 
Maybe   if you re an exceptional investor who can expertly manage risk and keep up perfectly resolute emotional control in the face of market volatility  Be that as it may  for most investors  there might be better ways to accomplish long term retirement investing objectives 
That s because the risk   reward scenario and investing approach is completely different for long term wealth building and active stock trading 
Managing Retirement Investments  Stock Picking vs  Diversification
While stock picking can potentially result in outsized returns  its outsized concentrated risk can pose significant hazards for retirement investors 
A study done by Hendrik Bessembinder of equity markets spanning nine decades revealed that only 4  of the best performing U S stocks produced all the market s increases  The rest were flat   the gains of the following 38  were offset by the losses of the bottom 58  
For even the most talented stock pickers  the odds for long term success are slim 
Is it Possible to Invest  Rationally  
Most people think they can make rational investment decisions  but research indicates the opposite is often true  Investors followed in a DALBAR study performed significantly worse than the S P 500  For the 30 years between 1986 to 2015  the average investor earned just 3 66   whereas the S P 500 produced a 10 35  return 
Importantly  this period included the 1987 crash and big bear markets in 2000 and 2008  but also the bull market of the 1990s 
An important takeaway of this study is that investors seem to underperform because they try to time volatile markets   and irrational  emotional responses tend to these investing mistakes 
Interestingly  even savvy traders tend to underperform because they can t help but allow emotions to drive investment decisions  They may be overconfident and misjudge risk  latch onto a price target  or perceive a pattern that isn t there  This  behavior gap   over the long term  can be catastrophic with potential underperformance of hundreds of thousands of dollars sabotaging your retirement 
The Bottom Line for Retirement Investors
Your retirement portfolio ought to be dealt with a technique of performance over decades   not days  weeks or quarters  Most self coordinated investors will in general miss the mark with regards to long term outcomes 
We re not saying you should not trade at all   far from it  If you enjoy trading  perhaps you should put 10  of your investable assets to work in short term investments to seek alpha and outsized returns 
But the bulk of your wealth   those assets earmarked for retirement   should be invested using a more measured  conservative  risk management approach to generate steady  compounded returns so you can safely reach your retirement goals

133248,354763,LMT,NASA picks Alabama site as HQ for human moon lander program  sources,news,"By Joey Roulette
WASHINGTON  Reuters    The head of NASA is set to announce plans on Friday to name the U S  space agency s Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama as headquarters for its human lunar lander program  signaling progress in its drive to put astronauts back on the moon by 2024  three people familiar with the plan said 
NASA also will designate its Johnson Space Center in Houston to oversee development of a spacecraft to launch astronauts off the moon s surface to a platform in lunar orbit dubbed Gateway  the sources said  speaking on condition of anonymity 
Jim Bridenstine  NASA s administrator  is scheduled to make the announcement at the Marshall facility in Huntsville  the facility from which the lander system  composed of three different parts to be built by a handful of space contractors  will be managed  the sources said 
The two U S  senators from Texas  Republicans Ted Cruz and John Cornyn  and a Republican U S  congressman from the state  Brian Babin  urged Bridenstine in a letter on Thursday to reconsider the decision and hold off on making an announcement  The three lawmakers argued that Johnson Space Center should anchor the lunar landing program instead of the Alabama site 
Marshall Space Flight Center is where the family of rockets used in the Apollo program that first sent astronauts to the moon a half century ago were built 
Companies including billionaire entrepreneur Jeff Bezos  Blue Origin  Elon Musk s SpaceX and  Lockheed Martin  Corp  NYSE LMT  are developing different potential components of the lunar lander and will compete for NASA funds under competitive bids scheduled to be solicited later this year 
Bridenstine in May named the program Artemis and asked Congress to increase NASA s proposed budget for fiscal 2020  which begins Oct  1  by  1 6 billion  the bulk of which would be earmarked to seed commercial development of the human lunar landing system 
 Standing up program offices is a really  really big deal   one industry source involved with the plans said   Things start to move quickly  requirements get firmed up  and you get that authority and accountability  
The new lunar mission   an endeavor likely to cost  20 billion to  30 billion dollars over five years   comes as NASA seeks with the help of private partners to resume human space missions from American soil for the first time since its space shuttle program ended in 2011 NASA announced Bridenstine s scheduled appearance at the Marshall facility without giving details of the announcement  It said Alabama Republican U S  Representatives Mo Brooks and Robert Aderholt and other lawmakers are due to join Bridenstine  himself a former Republican congressman  on Friday 
Vice President Mike Pence in March announced an accelerated timeline for NASA to put astronauts back the lunar surface by 2024  cutting in half a previous goal to get there by 2028 
President Donald Trump s own support for the mission has been unclear  In June  the Republican president criticized NASA for aiming to put astronauts back on the moon by 2024 and urged the agency to focus instead on  much bigger  initiatives like going to Mars  undercutting his previous support for the lunar initiative ",2019-08-15,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/general/nasa-picks-alabama-site-as-hq-for-human-moon-lander-program-sources-1956637,1956637

133265,354780,LMT,Bulgaria president vetoes  1 26 billion deal for F 16 fighter jets,news,"SOFIA  Reuters    Bulgarian President Rumen Radev on Tuesday vetoed a deal to buy eight new  Lockheed Martin   NYSE LMT  F 16 fighter jets  describing a lack of consensus over the purchase as  extremely worrying  
The  1 26 billion deal would be the country s biggest military purchase since the fall of Communism three decades ago 
But Radev  a former air force commander  said the sharp disputes in parliament during the debate on its ratification showed that public consensus on the contracts had been neither sought nor achieved 
 Because of the shortened legislative procedure  a number of important issues such as prices  warranties  delivery times  penalties  indemnities  and so on  have remained unclear   he said 
 The commitment of the Republic of Bulgaria to obligations  for years to come  without a national consensus and conviction in the mutually acceptable conditions of the treaty  is extremely worrying   Radev said in a statement 
In 2017  an interim government selected the Gripen built by Sweden s Saab but the deal was later canceled and a new procedure was launched a year later 
Radev said it was important that Bulgaria receive  a full package of equipment  accompanying equipment and personnel training  
 The public needs a definite answer as to whether this is actually achieved by the contracts  
The ruling center right GERB party defended the contracts and expressed its readiness for another vote at a parliamentary session on Friday  Parliament could overrule Radev s veto with a vote of at least 121 votes in the 240 seat assembly 
 We have a consensus that we need to modernize  Bulgaria s  armed forces   Konstantin Popov  chair of parliamentary defense committee  said   The F 16 is a wonderful airplane

133296,354811,LMT,Turkey s economy to contract in 2019  limited growth ahead  Reuters Poll,news,"By Ezgi Erkoyun
ISTANBUL  Reuters    Turkey s economy is expected to contract in 2019 for the first time in a decade and to see only modest growth in the following two years  a Reuters poll showed on Wednesday 
The poll of more than 40 economists showed the Turkish economy shrinking 1 5  this year  according to the median forecast  The government s own sharply lowered forecast for this year envisages an expansion of 2 3  
There was a wide range of estimates in the July 4 16 Reuters poll  from growth of 1  to a contraction of 5   The poll sees growth of 2 4  in 2020 and 3 4  in 2021 
 Early indicators for Q2 point to a renewed slowdown because of financial market volatility and elevated political uncertainty  which raise the risk of a double dip recession   economists at Nomura said 
In the second and third quarters of 2019 the economy is forecast to contract by 2 5  and 1 1   respectively  before returning to growth of just 1 0  in the final three months of the year  the poll medians showed 
Second quarter GDP growth is due to be announced on Sept  2 
Turkey s economy last contracted on an annual basis in 2009  by 4 7   From 2010 to 2017  its compound growth rate was 6 6  thanks to a construction boom driven by cheap capital following the global financial crisis 
But hit by a currency crisis that triggered a near 30  lira slide against the dollar  the Turkish economy contracted 2 6  in the first three months of the year after shrinking 3 0  in the fourth quarter of last year 
That lira slide pushed inflation to a 15 year high  severely limited companies  ability to service foreign debt and multiplied bad loans in the banking sector 
Meanwhile  investors have voiced concern over possible U S  sanctions after Russia delivered S 400 air defense missile system parts to Turkey  Ankara and Washington have been at odds over the deployment of the system as it could compromise F 35 fighter jets  made by  Lockheed Martin   N LMT  
RATE CUTS 
The central bank hiked its policy rate to 24  in September in the face of the currency crisis and has left it unchanged since  though the recent dismissal of the central bank governor has unnerved investors over the institution s independence 
President Tayyip Erdogan  a self described  enemy of interest rates   dismissed Murat Cetinkaya on July 6 for not following instructions  His successor  Murat Uysal  hinted at rate cuts on Monday 
Ratings agency Fitch downgraded Turkey s sovereign rating deeper into junk territory  saying Cetinkaya s dismissal heightened doubt over authorities  tolerance for a period of sustained below trend growth 
Economists predicted the central bank would lower its key rate to 22 00  by the end of the third quarter and to 20  by year end  according to the poll median 
 We now expect the CBRT to cut rates by 200 basis points on July 25 and see a cumulative 500 basis points fall by the end of this year   JP Morgan said in a recent note 
Further cuts in the central bank s main policy rate would be possible if geopolitical risks are avoided and Ankara introduces credible policies  JP Morgan added 




The current account deficit   which ballooned last year but has since receded as the economy slowed   is expected to stand at 1 0  of GDP this year  lower than a government forecast and down from last year

133344,354859,LMT,The Fed Cuts Interest Rates,opinion,"The market was on edge this week as the FOMC met on Tuesday and Wednesday and issued their announcement of a quarter point rate cut  This created some price volatility on Wednesday  but it appeared the net market assessment of the move was moderately positive  Then the other market hobgoblin  China trade negotiations  hit the markets on Friday  The S P 500 opened higher on Friday  traded up to 3016 and held a positive gain until about 1 00 pm ET  when news hit the wires of the Chinese trade delegation cancelling a trip to Montana  SPX fell off rapidly and closed at 2992 for a 15 point loss on the day 
Trading volume continues to tell a bearish story in these markets  Even in the earlier part of this week  when price action was moderately positive  SPX trading volume was below the 50 day moving average  dma  and declined all week  Friday s spike higher was an anomaly based on options and futures contract expiration  As the bulls drive this market higher  they do so carefully  They are not  all in  
The volatility index for the S P 500 options  VIX  opened this week at 14 9  and closed Thursday at 14 0   But Friday s China trade panic pushed volatility up  closing up 1 3 points at 15 3  
The Russell 2000 Index  RUT  has traded far more weakly than its big brother indices all year  Russell surprised us with a strong 7 4  run higher from September 4th through this past Monday when it closed at 1585  The rest of this week has been a series of red candlesticks on my chart  maybe they are black on yours   Russell closed Friday at 1560  down 2 points  It was a tough week for small to mid cap stocks and those are the stocks that lead bull markets 
The NASDAQ Composite index was almost perfectly flat this week  opening at 8122 and closing Friday at 8118  NASDAQ s intraday lows came close to the 50 dma on Wednesday and Friday  but recovered to close higher  The 50 dma is the line in the sand to watch for NASDAQ  NASDAQ s trading volume was below average all week  but it spiked significantly on Friday  due to options and futures contracts expiring 
The financial news has been filled with discussions of impending recession for the past several weeks  Journalists of all stripes  including financial journalists  now regularly show their political bias in their writing  Econ 101 will define a recession as two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth  Given our GDP growth of 2  to 3  over the past two years  talk of a recession is puzzling  This week s Fed meeting provided additional support for a positive economic outlook 
Chairman Powell went out of his way during the news conference to deny that this latest rate cut was a reaction to prevent a recession  His comments were in reaction to several media questions asserting the danger of an imminent recession  Powell said the rate cuts were designed to  insure against downside risks to the outlook from weak global growth and trade tensions   He clearly stated that the current economic data do not support any talk of a recession or a forecast of a recession 
Friday s markets illustrated the price volatility I have repeatedly discussed over the past several weeks  This week s markets were relatively calm and the price moves were modest  even surrounding the Fed announcement  That changed in a flash around 1 00 pm ET Friday  based on a change in the China trade delegation s travel plans while here in the states  There could be good reasons for that change of plans  but no one seems to know  Traders assume the worst and sell 
As I have written in earlier newsletters  Traders exit the market in volume on the least provocation  This market remains nervous and therefore dangerous  It pays to be cautious  I am focusing on solid blue chip stocks whose prices have held up reasonably well as we hit these down drafts  e g   DR Horton Inc  NYSE DHI   JPMorgan Chase   Co  NYSE JPM   KLAC   Lockheed Martin  Corporation  NYSE LMT   MLM  SYK  TGT  TWTR   and VMC ",2019-09-22,Dr. Duke,https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-fed-cuts-interest-rates-200466795,200466795

133374,354889,LMT,Pentagon Chief Warns Turkey F 35 Cooperation Will End by July 31,news," Bloomberg     Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan told his Turkish counterpart that the U S  will end Turkey s participation in the F 35 jet program by July 31 over the NATO ally s decision to go forward with the purchase of a Russian missile defense system 
In a June 6 letter to Defense Minister Hulusi Akar  Shanahan said there is still time for Turkey  to change course on the S 400  missile system  but he also laid out a timeline of how cooperation on the next generation fighter will wind down  The U S  has long said Turkey s decision to buy the Russian equipment is incompatible with its role in both NATO and the F 35 program 
 In addition to threatening the security of platforms like the F 35  Turkey s procurement of the S 400 will hinder your nation s ability to enhance or maintain cooperation with the United States and within NATO  lead to Turkish strategic and economic over dependence on Russia  and undermine Turkey s very capable defense industry and ambitious economic development goals   Shanahan wrote in the letter 
The dispute over the S 400 has become the most visible sign of how U S  Turkey ties have deteriorated in recent years  Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has so far rebuffed U S  threats  saying the purchase is essential to meeting his country s air defense needs  But the move comes as Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin have sought to bolster ties and Turkey remains frustrated over U S  support for Kurdish militias in neighboring Syria

Turkey has been a key international partner in building the F 35  a  Lockheed Martin  Corp  NYSE LMT   jet that is the Pentagon s most expensive weapons program  at a projected cost of more than  428 billion  In addition to manufacturing key portions of the fighter  the country had plans to buy about 100 of the jets 
In a sign that the standoff won t end  Turkey is considering deploying the S 400 along the the country s southern coast  near where its warships are accompanying vessels exploring for energy  according to four people with knowledge of the deliberations  That would enhance the country s capabilities in the Eastern Mediterranean  where it s embroiled in a spat with European Union member Cyprus over offshore gas exploration 
As the U S  moves closer to winding down cooperation with Turkey on the F 35  Shanahan said Turkish personnel training on the jet in the U S  must leave by July 31  According to the letter  34 pilots scheduled to train from June to November will be barred from participating  In addition  the U S  will continue to  suspend indefinitely F 35 material deliveries and activities  and the Pentagon will look to alternate sources for production 
Members of Congress have also warned Turkey that deploying the S 400 could lead to more severe sanctions under the Countering America s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act  Shanahan raised that warning in his letter   There is strong bipartisan U S  Congressional determination to see CAATSA sanctions imposed on Turkey if Turkey acquires the S 400  
President Donald Trump and Erdogan agreed last month to form a study group to look at the S 400  though the American view is that the group s findings will support the U S  position that deploying the Russian system would put the F 35 at risk  according to a U S  official  Despite the agreement  it isn t clear what the time frame for the study group would be or when it will be formed 
Shanahan emphasized that there is still time for Turkey to prevent the program from being suspended and he spelled out what he said were some of the broader costs of the dispute  particularly if sanctions are imposed 
 Pursuing this path will cause a loss in jobs  gross domestic product  and international trade   he said   President Trump committed to boost bilateral trade from  20 billion currently to more than  75 billion  however that may be challenging if the United States imposes CAATSA sanctions  ",2019-06-07,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/pentagon-chief-warns-turkey-f35-cooperation-will-end-by-july-31-1891897,1891897

133394,354909,LMT,GD Or LMT  Which Is The Better Value Stock Right Now ,opinion,"Investors looking for stocks in the Aerospace   Defense sector might want to consider either General Dynamics  GD  or Lockheed Martin  LMT   But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now  Let s take a closer look 
There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks  but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits 
Right now  both General Dynamics and Lockheed Martin are sporting a Zacks Rank of   2  Buy   Investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook since the Zacks Rank favors companies that have witnessed positive analyst estimate revisions  But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in 
Value investors analyze a variety of traditional  tried and true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
GD currently has a forward P E ratio of 15 82  while LMT has a forward P E of 18 20  We also note that GD has a PEG ratio of 1 81  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  LMT currently has a PEG ratio of 2 56 
Another notable valuation metric for GD is its P B ratio of 4 21  The P B ratio is used to compare a stock s market value with its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  LMT has a P B of 37 63 
These metrics  and several others  help GD earn a Value grade of B  while LMT has been given a Value grade of C 
Both GD and LMT are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks  but based on these valuation figures  we feel that GD is the superior value option right now ",2019-08-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/gd-or-lmt-which-is-the-better-value-stock-right-now-200457949,200457949

133401,354916,LMT,How U S  sanctions over a Russian weapon could rattle Turkey,news,By Jonathan Spicer ISTANBUL  Reuters    Turkey is on the cusp of facing U S  sanctions over its decision to buy a Russian S 400 missile defense system  leaving its already soft currency and economy vulnerable and raising questions over its position within NATO and the region   If no solution is found in coming weeks and U S  Turkish tensions continue to worsen  tit for tat sanctions could hit trade between the allies and prolong a recession in Turkey that has already tested President Tayyip Erdogan s grip on power   Turkey also risks being rapidly cut out of the production and use of American F 35 fighter jets  which could mark a step toward a re evaluation of its 67 year membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization    It s very complex to resolve because both U S  and Turkish officials see this as a reflection of a larger geo political balancing   said Galip Dalay  visiting scholar at the University of Oxford s politics and international relations department   Sanctions would have a very consequential effect on Turkey  but probably not mark a breaking point in its U S  relationship   he said   Ankara and Washington have squabbled for months over the Turkish plan to buy the S 400s  which the United States says is incompatible with the Western alliance s defense network and poses a threat to the F 35s that Turkey also plans to buy  Turkey says defending its territory poses no threat to allies  and stresses it has met all NATO obligations   Both sides are entrenched even while they have repeated a desire to avoid so called CAATSA sanctions  which by U S  law would be triggered when the Russian anti aircraft weapon arrives on Turkish soil  possibly as soon as July   An agreement to delay shipment of the S 400s could still open the door to U S  President Donald Trump convincing Erdogan to turn his back on what the Turkish leader has repeatedly called a  done deal  with Russia   The pair agreed on Wednesday to meet on the sidelines of a G 20 conference on June 28 29  Yet Ankara s ties with Moscow have been strengthening  and Turkey s defense minister said last week Turkish military personnel were in Russia for S 400 training  In response  the United States is considering halting the training of Turkish pilots on F 35 stealth fighters in Arizona   The showdown comes as the Russia backed Syrian army escalates an assault on some Turkish backed rebels near Turkey s border  More broadly in the Middle East  the United States is ramping up pressure on Turkey and other nations to isolate Iran including blocking all Iranian oil exports   If the U S  sanctions are bad  Turkey could reconsider its decision to comply with U S  sanctions on Iran   said Dalay    PATH TO ESCALATION  Washington wants Ankara to buy its alternative Patriot surface to air missile batteries and has made an offer that expires on June 4  according to a person familiar with the matter   If Ankara accepts delivery of the S 400s as planned  the U S  Congress has moved to block delivery of F 35s to Turkey and remove it from the list of nations working together to build them   The delivery would also force Trump to select five of 12 possible sanctions under the Countering America s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act  or CAATSA  which targets purchases of military equipment from NATO foe Russia   The sanctions range from banning visas and denying access to the U S  based Export Import Bank  to the harsher options of blocking any transactions with the U S  financial system and denying export licenses   Trump may initially choose milder options targeting individual Turks rather than the government  a decision that could buy time for more diplomacy even while it may prompt Congress to separately impose tougher sanctions    There is a U S  reticence to completely block the military industrial relationship with Turkey   said Sinan Ulgen  a former Turkish diplomat and a visiting scholar at Carnegie Europe in Brussels   Yet U S  sanctions of any sort would likely hammer the Turkish lira  which has shed 14  of its value against the dollar this year in part due to fraying U S  ties   Last year  a separate set of U S  sanctions and tariffs over a jailed U S  pastor helped set off a currency crisis that knocked 30  off the lira  tipped Turkey into recession and rattled emerging markets around the world  Ratings agency Moody s said this month that Turkey s political risk is  high  and warned that the S 400s could trigger not only U S  but also NATO sanctions   Turkey has a track record of responding in kind to foreign sanctions and tariffs   Ulgen said any sanctions dispute could escalate into tariffs that harm U S  based  Lockheed Martin   NYSE LMT  Corp s business with Turkish industrial companies  and even threaten future upgrades to Turkey s existing fleet of F 16 jets   Heavier sanctions could follow if the United States finds itself on a path to escalation with Turkey  beyond the usual rhetoric   he said

133409,354924,LMT,U S  to stop training Turkish F 35 pilots because of Russia deal  sources,news,"By Phil Stewart and Humeyra Pamuk WASHINGTON ISTANBUL  Reuters    The United States has decided to stop accepting any more Turkish pilots who had planned to train in the United States on F 35 fighter jets  three U S  officials said  in a sign of an escalating dispute over Ankara s plans to purchase Russian air defenses  The two NATO allies have sparred publicly for months over Turkey s order for Russia s S 400 air defense system  which Washington says poses a threat to the  Lockheed Martin  Corp  NYSE LMT  F 35 stealthy fighters  which Turkey also plans to buy  The United States says Turkey cannot have both  but had avoided taking steps to curtail or halt planned training of Turkish pilots in the program  a reprisal that could be seen as an embarrassment in Turkey  The three U S  officials  who spoke to Reuters this week on condition of anonymity  left open the possibility the decision could be reversed  perhaps if Turkey altered its plans  They said the decision so far only applied to upcoming rounds of Turkish pilots and maintenance crews who would have normally trained in the United States  Reuters was first to report the U S  decision on pilots  which traders said pressured the Turkish lira on Friday  A spokesman for Turkey s Defense Ministry declined comment on Friday   The Pentagon declined comment on whether it would accept new Turkish pilots  But it has stressed discussions are taking place with Ankara on potentially selling Turkey Patriot missile defenses  which are made by Raytheon  NYSE RTN  Co  The United States also has threatened to halt training of Turkish pilots and maintenance crews already in the United States  two of the officials said  Reuters reported last week that the step was being seriously considered  One official said the pilots in the United States could be removed by the end of July  Four Turkish pilots are currently training at Luke Air Force Base in Arizona  Two additional Turkish pilots are there working as instructors  Beyond those six Turkish officers  there are an additional 20 Turkish aircraft maintainers at the base undergoing training as well  the U S  military says  Turkey has expressed an interest in buying 100 of the fighters  which would have a total value of  9 billion at current prices  STRAINED RELATIONSHIP If Turkey were removed from the F 35 program  it would be one of the most significant ruptures in recent history in the relationship between the two allies  experts said  Strains in their ties already extend beyond the F 35 to include conflicting strategy in Syria  Iran sanctions and the detention of U S  consular staff in Turkey  The disclosure of the decision on the pilots follows signs that Turkey is moving ahead with the S 400 purchase  Defense Minister Hulusi Akar said on May 22 that Turkish military personnel were receiving training in Russia to use the S 400  and that Russian personnel may go to Turkey  President Tayyip Erdogan said on Tuesday it was  out of the question  for Turkey to back away from its deal with Moscow   Erdogan said the United States had not  given us an offer as good as the S 400s    The Turkish lira declined as much as 1 5  on Friday before recovering some losses  The currency has shed nearly 10  of its value against the dollar this year in part on fraying diplomatic ties and the risk of U S  sanctions if Turkey accepts delivery of the S 400s  Kathryn Wheelbarger  one of the Pentagon s most senior policy officials  said last week that Turkey s completion of the transaction with Russia would be  devastating   dealing heavy blows to the F 35 program and to Turkish interoperability within the NATO alliance

133412,354927,LMT,Why Lockheed Martin  LMT  Is A Top Dividend Stock For Your Portfolio,opinion,"Whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  all investors love seeing their portfolios score big returns  But for income investors  generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus 
Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long term returns  with dividend contributions exceeding one third of total returns in many cases 
Lockheed Martin in Focus
Headquartered in Bethesda  Lockheed Martin  LMT  is an Aerospace stock that has seen a price change of 43 98  so far this year  The aerospace and defense company is currently shelling out a dividend of  2 2 per share  with a dividend yield of 2 33   This compares to the Aerospace   Defense industry s yield of 0 96  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 93  
Taking a look at the company s dividend growth  its current annualized dividend of  8 80 is up 7 3  from last year  In the past five year period  Lockheed Martin has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 10 30   Looking ahead  future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Right now  Lockheed s payout ratio is 43   which means it paid out 43  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
LMT is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  21 04 per share  with earnings expected to increase 19 61  from the year ago period 
Bottom Line
From greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages  investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  But  not every company offers a quarterly payout 
High growth firms or tech start ups  for example  rarely provide their shareholders a dividend  while larger  more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  That said  they can take comfort from the fact that LMT is not only an attractive dividend play  but also represents a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  ",2019-08-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-lockheed-martin-lmt-is-a-top-dividend-stock-for-your-portfolio-200454217,200454217

133436,354951,LMT,U S  may suspend training of Turkish pilots for F 35 jets over Russia missile deal,news,"By Humeyra Pamuk and Phil Stewart WASHINGTON  Reuters    The United States is seriously considering suspending training for Turkish pilots on advanced F 35 fighter jets as Ankara moves ahead with plans to purchase a Russian missile defense system despite objections from Washington  sources told Reuters on Tuesday  The two NATO allies have argued for months over Turkey s order for the Russian S 400 defenses  which Washington says are incompatible with the Western alliance s defense network and would pose a threat to American F 35 stealth fighters which Turkey also plans to buy  The two sources  who are familiar with Turkey s role in the F 35 program and who spoke on condition of anonymity  said a final decision had not yet been made  The deliberation follows signs that Turkey is moving ahead with the S 400 purchase  Defense Minister Hulusi Akar said on May 22 that Turkish military personnel were receiving training in Russia to use the S 400  and said Russian personnel may come to Turkey  Turkish pilots have also been training at Luke Air Force Base in Arizona  It was unclear whether a decision to suspend their training would mean they would have to leave the country  or would be allowed to remain at the base until a final decision is made about Turkey s future in the F 35 program  The United States has said plainly that Turkey cannot have the S 400 and be part of the F 35 program  The F 35 is made by  Lockheed Martin  Corp  NYSE LMT   If Turkey was removed from the program  it would be one of the most significant ruptures in recent history in the relationship between the two allies  experts say   Washington is signaling that while it would rather not break military ties with Turkey  it is ready to do so if Ankara does not change its mind regarding the S 400 purchase   said Soner Cagaptay  director of the Turkish program at the Washington Institute  Strains in ties between Washington and Ankara already extend beyond the F 35 to include conflicting strategy in Syria  Iran sanctions and the detention of U S  consular staff in Turkey  DONE DEAL The Pentagon and State Department declined to comment on any deliberations about the pilots  But Pentagon spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Mike Andrews noted discussions are taking place with Ankara on potentially buying the Patriot missile defense system  Andrews said the Patriot system  made by Raytheon  NYSE RTN  Co    remains a robust  NATO interoperable alternative to the S 400 for  Turkey s  national defense requirements   On Monday  Turkish broadcaster Haberturk quoted Akar as saying in an interview that the delivery of the S 400 may not happen in June  when Turkey previously said the missiles were due to arrive  He added the agreement was a done deal  however   They may not make it by June but they will come in the months ahead  The process has begun   he was quoted as saying   Objecting to Ankara s planned Russian defense purchase  the United States in late March halted delivery of equipment related to the F 35 to Turkey  which is both a buyer and a production partner in the program  The move was the first concrete step of what could eventually be the full removal of Turkey from the F 35 program  The United States has warned that if Turkey takes delivery of the Russian system  it will also trigger U S  sanctions under CATSAA  a law calling for sanctions against countries procuring military equipment from Russia   Turkey has said that as a NATO member it poses no threat to the United States and the sanctions should not apply  Ankara has also increasingly pinned its hopes on President Donald Trump to protect it from such penalties

We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits 
Wesco Aircraft Holdings and Lockheed Martin are both sporting a Zacks Rank of   2  Buy  right now  Investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook since the Zacks Rank favors companies that have witnessed positive analyst estimate revisions  But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in 
Value investors are also interested in a number of tried and true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics  including the popular P E ratio  as well as the P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years

improvement can be attributed to higher segment operating income  lower interest expense and a lower share count Operational PerformanceIn the quarter under review  the company s total sales of  639

income increased 9  to  56 2 million  operating margin expanded 110 basis points  bps  to 17 7   The improvement in the operating margin was driven by the company s ongoing margin improvement initiatives and gain on the sale of a building Defense  Sales at this segment slipped 1  year over year to  145 million  This can be attributed to higher sales of tactical data link equipment  TCG acquisition   which was offset by lower sales of embedded computing equipment on various programs Meanwhile  adjusted operating income declined 21  to  30 5 million and adjusted operating margin contracted 540 bps to 21   The downside in operating income can be attributed to unfavorable mix and higher research and development expenses Power  Sales at this segment improved 9  year over year to

133471,354986,LMT,S P 500 Record Has Skeptics But Some Strategists See Upside,news," Bloomberg     The S P 500 s vulnerabilities are myriad  Stocks may be overvalued  the economy might be weakening  trade tensions are everywhere    the list goes on  And yet  here we are at a record high  contemplating where the gauge goes from here 
 The market recovery from the downturn at the end of last year is now complete   declared Brad McMillan  the chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network   With markets breaking out again  the likelihood of further gains is high  especially if earnings continue to come in ahead of expectations  
The S P 500 rose 0 9 percent to close at a record 2 933 68 on Tuesday after the likes of  Twitter Inc   NYSE TWTR   and  Lockheed Martin  Corp  NYSE LMT   rallied on positive earnings surprises  Futures were little changed on Wednesday at 7 30 a m  in New York  So far this reporting season  79 percent of companies have beaten profit estimates  That has propelled the gauge almost to the 2 950 median year end level seen by strategists tracked by Bloomberg  meaning it has already eclipsed the expectations of many market watchers 
 FOMO   or fear of missing out  has been the subject of discussion for weeks given the torrid pace of the equity rally that started 2019  And so far investors haven t quite responded by jumping in en masse  but expectations continue that they will join at some point 
 Given the level of potential underinvestment by hedge fund longs  we see the possibility of a  catch up  trade in U S  equities   Macro Risk Advisors  New York based quantitative strategist Max Grinacoff wrote in an April 23 note   Look at the rolling one month beta of daily returns for the HFRI Global Hedge Fund Index against the S P 500 as a proxy for level of investment    this measure is nearly 2 5 standard deviations below the five year mean  
And then there are the technicals 
Citigroup Global Markets senior technical strategist Shyam Devani says the next meaningful level above 2 940  the intraday record  is the trend across the January 2018 and September 2018 highs  That comes in at 3 001 
Beyond that   we expect gains of approximately 25 percent for the year  giving a target of around 3 132    Singapore based Devani said April 24 
Watching 3 000
Evercore ISI technical strategist Rich Ross s view dovetails with Devani s    the S P 500  remains in position to trade 3 000 on the breakout  and there s  still room here  for advancement  he said in an April 23 note 
The historical record argues that stocks could continue upward  as well 
 This marks one of the best ever recoveries from at least a correction from an all time high   according to Jason Goepfert  the founder of Sundial Capital Research  He examined the S P 500 s performance after full recoveries from losses in patterns like the current period  and found it was  pretty good   if not  great  
 Returns were about in line with random  and the risk reward was about what we usually see   Goepfert said   The most impressive time frame was over the next year  which was consistently positive enough to suggest significance  
While it s been a feature of post Financial Crisis markets to have a strong element of skepticism  even strategists who are cautious for the immediate time frame may see advances further down the road 
Chris Zaccarelli  the North Carolina based chief investment officer of Independent Advisor Alliance LLC  has near term concerns  He cites a low VIX showing complacency and some technical indicators crossing into overbought levels  but says that  over the long term  this bull market should be able to sustain any pullbacks and could run for another 1 2 years  
Even cyclical concerns are somewhat on hold for the time being  especially after the Federal Reserve pivoted to a more dovish stance  easing concerns that tighter conditions might send the economy into recession 
 While now late cycle  we view the current growth  inflation  and monetary policy environment as still supportive of risk assets   Brian Rose of UBS s wealth management arm wrote in a note April 22   In our tactical asset allocation we remain risk on  
 Many of the concerns that took markets down in the fourth quarter have faded   Commonwealth s McMillan wrote 

The Mueller report was less damaging than feared
Brexit has turned from tragedy to farce
And for all the worries about growth and corporate earnings  both seem to be beating expectations

 With the passing of much of the worry  markets may be now free to keep moving higher   McMillan said ",2019-04-24,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/sp-500-record-has-skeptics-but-some-strategists-see-upside-1844395,1844395
133474,354989,LMT,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Lockheed  HEICO  Teledyne And Wesco,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL  July 24  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Lockheed Martin   NYSE LMT    HEICO Corp    NYSE HEI    Teledyne Technologies   NYSE TDY   and Wesco Aircraft Holdings  Inc    NYSE WAIR   Here are highlights from Tuesday s Analyst Blog 4 Defense Stocks to Gain from Bipartisan Budget DealOn Jul 22  President Trump and leaders of the U S  Congress announced that they have reached a crucial agreement on the federal budget and debt ceiling  The agreement is being viewed as an unexpected win for the pragmatists on Capitol Hill  For some time now  they have worked to prevent a government shutdown or the first federal default Trump was quick to hail the deal as a victory  especially for the armed forces  And in many ways it is  though not as much as congressional Republicans would have wanted  Be that as it may  the agreement guarantees a significant increase in defense funding next fiscal  This is why it makes sense to stock up on defense stocks now Hard Bargaining Leads to  Near Final  DealWeeks of tense negotiations have led to an agreement  which fails to meet the expectations of all parties involved  At the same time  it addresses key concerns  which is why Republicans are likely to claim a victory  In effect  the bipartisan deal suspends the U S  debt ceiling and raises expenditure limits for the next two years The House of Representatives must approve the deal this week itself since a six week recess commences from Jul 26  However  the Senate can vote on the agreement to vote as late as next week  In a statement on Monday night  the White House urged both houses of Congress to  quickly move this deal to the president s desk for signature  Trump seemed thrilled with the deal stating that no  poison pills  would be forced into follow up legislation   This was a real compromise in order to give another big victory to our Great Military and Vets   he tweeted  The deal broadly agrees to approve  1 37 trillion in agency spending in 2020 with a modest increase the following year Defense Spending Receives Major BoostAs a result of the deal  the Defense Department is likely to receive a major increase in funding in the next fiscal year  Since the agreement does away with the last two years of budget caps  also known as sequestration  military expenditure is set to clock in at  738 billion in fiscal 2020  This represents a year over year increase of 3  Nitpickers will point out that the figure is almost  12 billion lower than the level congressional Republicans had demanded  They have maintained for long that this level of spending is required to rebuild the armed forces and counteract threats to national security But it is at least much more than the lower  733 billion funding target that the Democrats were insistent about  This is why hawkish Republicans have agreed to support the new spending deal  According to a senior member of the House Armed Services Committee  while the country s defense  needs more funding than this agreement provides   the approved level will still make U S  armed forces  stronger and more agile  Our ChoicesThe new budget deal is being touted by Trump as a major victory for the armed forces  This is true to a great extent since the military spending approved under this plan exceeds the figure Democrats were insisting on till recently  As a result  spending on defense will rise significantly in the near future Investing in defense stocks looks prudent at this point  We have narrowed our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and other relevant metrics Lockheed Martin is the largest defense contractor in the world  Its

133475,354990,LMT,Teledyne  TDY  Hits 52 Week High  Can The Run Continue ,opinion,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Teledyne Technologies  TDY   Shares have been on the move with the stock up 12 8  over the past month  The stock hit a new 52 week high of  306 47 in the previous session  Teledyne Technologies has gained 44 7  since the start of the year compared to the 27 2  move for the Zacks Aerospace sector and the 34 7  return for the Zacks Aerospace   Defense Equipment industry 
What s Driving the Outperformance 
The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises  as it hasn t missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters  In its last earnings report on July 24  2019  Teledyne reported EPS of  2 8 versus consensus estimate of  2 4 
For the current fiscal year  Teledyne is expected to post earnings of  9 58 per share on  3 1 billion in revenues  This represents a 7 88  change in EPS on a 6 69  change in revenues  For the next fiscal year  the company is expected to earn  10 52 per share on  3 23 billion in revenues  This represents a year over year change of 9 86  and 4 17   respectively 
Valuation Metrics
Teledyne may be at a 52 week high right now  but what might the future hold for the stock  A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level 
On this front  we can look at the Zacks Style Scores  as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks  beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security   These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value  Growth  and Momentum  while there is a combined VGM Score as well  The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style 
Teledyne has a Value Score of D  The stock s Growth and Momentum Scores are A and A  respectively  giving the company a VGM Score of B 
In terms of its value breakdown  the stock currently trades at 31 3X current fiscal year EPS estimates  On a trailing cash flow basis  the stock currently trades at 24 5X versus its peer group s average of 14 6X  Additionally  the stock has a PEG ratio of 4 17  This isn t enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective 
Zacks Rank
We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock  as this supersedes any trend on the style score front  Fortunately  Teledyne currently has a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy  thanks to rising earnings estimates 
Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B  it looks as if Teledyne meets the list of requirements  Thus  it seems as though Teledyne shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come 
How Does Teledyne Stack Up to the Competition

133500,355015,LMT,4 Defense Stocks To Gain From The Bipartisan Budget Deal ,opinion,On Jul 22  President Trump and leaders of the U S  Congress announced that they have reached a crucial agreement on the federal budget and debt ceiling  The agreement is being viewed as an unexpected win for the pragmatists on Capitol Hill  For some time now  they have worked to prevent a government shutdown or the first federal default Trump was quick to hail the deal as a victory  especially for the armed forces  And in many ways it is  though not as much as congressional Republicans would have wanted  Be that as it may  the agreement guarantees a significant increase in defense funding next fiscal  This is why it makes sense to stock up on defense stocks now Hard Bargaining Leads to  Near Final  DealWeeks of tense negotiations have led to an agreement  which fails to meet the expectations of all parties involved  At the same time  it addresses key concerns  which is why Republicans are likely to claim a victory  In effect  the bipartisan deal suspends the U S  debt ceiling and raises expenditure limits for the next two years The House of Representatives must approve the deal this week itself since a six week recess commences from Jul 26  However  the Senate can vote on the agreement to vote as late as next week  In a statement on Monday night  the White House urged both houses of Congress to  quickly move this deal to the president s desk for signature  Trump seemed thrilled with the deal stating that no  poison pills  would be forced into follow up legislation   This was a real compromise in order to give another big victory to our Great Military and Vets   he tweeted  The deal broadly agrees to approve  1 37 trillion in agency spending in 2020 with a modest increase the following year Defense Spending Receives Major BoostAs a result of the deal  the Defense Department is likely to receive a major increase in funding in the next fiscal year  Since the agreement does away with the last two years of budget caps  also known as sequestration  military expenditure is set to clock in at  738 billion in fiscal 2020  This represents a year over year increase of 3  Nitpickers will point out that the figure is almost  12 billion lower than the level congressional Republicans had demanded  They have maintained for long that this level of spending is required to rebuild the armed forces and counteract threats to national security But it is at least much more than the lower  733 billion funding target that the Democrats were insistent about  This is why hawkish Republicans have agreed to support the new spending deal  According to a senior member of the House Armed Services Committee  while the country s defense  needs more funding than this agreement provides   the approved level will still make U S  armed forces  stronger and more agile  Our ChoicesThe new budget deal is being touted by Trump as a major victory for the armed forces  This is true to a great extent since the military spending approved under this plan exceeds the figure Democrats were insisting on till recently  As a result  spending on defense will rise significantly in the near future Investing in defense stocks looks prudent at this point  We have narrowed our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and other relevant metrics Lockheed Martin   NYSE LMT   is the largest

133522,355037,LMT,Will Lockheed Martin  LMT  Continue Strong Earnings Growth In Q2 ,opinion,"Lockheed Martin   NYSE LMT   is set to report its fiscal 2019 second quarter earnings this week  The aerospace company has been able to see some sound growth this year  and shares are up 36 4  year to date  Lockheed is coming off a solid first quarter where it was able to report strong year over year growth  The broader aerospace defense sector has risen 24  this year and has been able to provide solid returns for investors  The overall success of the sector could bring investors flocking to companies like Lockheed if they can post another solid quarterly report  Let s take a look at the company and what to expect from them this earnings season 
Company Overview 
Lockheed Martin is the largest defense contractor in the world with its main area of focus being in defense  space  intelligence  homeland security  and information technology  The defense contractor directly benefits from the United States  high defense expenditures   In 2018  70  of the company s net sales were from the U S  government  60  of which were from the Department of Defense  Furthermore  28  of its sales were from international customers and the remaining 2  was from U S  commercial and other consumers  Lockheed operates its business in four segments  Aeronautics  Missiles and Fire Control  Rotary and Missions Systems  and Space Systems 
Solid demand growth for the company s many different defense products has been a catalyst for Lockheed s success  The company s F 35 program continues to be a primary growth driver for the defense contractor  The U S  government is currently setting an inventory target of 2 456 fighter jets for the Air Force  Marine Corps  and Navy  In response to the U S  intentions  Lockheed Martin has been consistently increasing the production of its F 35 aircrafts  In late June  Lockheed Martin received a new contract to produce missiles for the U S  as well other certain foreign militaries  The company announced that it would be producing Army Tactical Missile System missiles under the  561 8 million contract 
Q2 Outlook 
In the first quarter of 2019  Lockheed Martin reported  14 3 billion in revenue with earnings of  5 99 per share  which was a 49  jump from Q1 2018  LMT was able to surpass our Consensus Earnings Estimates by 39 63  and revenue estimates by 13 4   The company returned  920 million of cash back to shareholders  including repurchasing one million shares for  280 million 
LMT s Aeronautics segment generated  5 6 billion in Q1 for a 27  year over year increase and the Rotary and Mission Systems reported  3 8 billion  The Missiles and Fire Control sector produced  2 4 billion for a 40  surge from the year ago quarter and the Space segment attributed  2 6 billion  In addition  the Missiles and Fire Control sector generated  417 million in profit  which was a 60  surge from Q1 2018 and was the second most profitable sector behind Aeronautics  
Our Consensus Estimates are currently forecasting Lockheed to bring in  14 2 billion in revenue in Q2 for a 5 67  increase  earnings are projected to jump 9 98   Consensus Estimates are also looking for the Aeronautics segment to increase 7 1  year over year with  5 7 billion and for the Space segment to bring in  2 5 billion 
In addition  Consensus Estimates are anticipating the Missiles and Fire Control segment to continue its success in Q2 with a projected  2 4 billion for a 15 6  spike from Q2 2018  Rotary and Mission Systems is estimated to bring in  3 6 billion in revenue this quarter  and the Aeronautics sector is expected to lead the pack again with  610 million in profit  the Missiles and Fire Control segment should come in second with  329 million 
Takeaway 
Lockheed Martin is currently sitting at a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  with a Style Score of B in Growth  The U S  government s inventory target for its military s aircraft could help Lockheed post solid delivery figures in Q2  which can in turn boost the company s Aeronautics top line this quarter  The F 35 program was a large contributor to the Aeronautics segment s success in Q1  and the inventory target can propel the success into Q2 
In May of 2019  a senate committee approved allocating  750 billion for defense spending as part of a budget bill  This authorization from the government to allocate further expenditures into defense can cement success for companies like Lockheed for the remainder of the year

speculation over how much rate cut will be implemented by the Fed  All the three major stock indexes     the Dow  S P 500 and Nasdaq Composite     posted biggest weekly losses since May 31  Meanwhile  no meaningful development has taken place so far related to the year long trade dispute with China Second Quarter Earnings Mixed So FarAt present  the market is anticipating a negative earnings session for the second quarter of 2019  As of Jul 19  total Q2 earnings for the S P 500 Index are expected to be down 1 7  from the year earlier period on 4  higher revenues  This is a significant improvement over an earnings decline of 3 4  on 3 9  higher revenues  expected on Jul 12 As of Jul 19  79 S P 500 members reported second quarter earnings results  Total earnings for these 79 index members are up 2 6  from the same period last year on 2 9  higher revenues  Notably  79 7  companies surpassed EPS estimates while 60 8  beat revenue estimates Although trade related issues  especially tariff conflict  took a toll on several companies which have already reported  it is important to note that these issues did not lead to the board based negative guidance by those companies

133536,355051,LMT,Turkey Seeks Trump s Support to Defuse Russian Missile Dispute,news," Bloomberg     Turkey has taken its case for buying a Russian air defense system directly to President Donald Trump  in a last ditch effort to defuse tensions between the NATO allies 
 We delivered our message and received quite positive feedback   Treasury and Finance Minister Berat Albayrak told reporters on Monday  after he explained to the U S  president why Turkey needs missiles that have raised questions about its alliance with the West  It s likely to use the advanced system to defend Istanbul  the country s commercial center  and its capital  Ankara  according to Defense Minister Hulusi Akar 
Turkey s decision to purchase the Russian missiles has poisoned ties with the U S  since it was made public in 2017  Ankara says it was forced to turn to Russia for protection against aerial attacks after Washington balked for years at selling it Patriot missile defense systems  But the U S  says the Russian missile shield was designed to shoot down American and allied aircraft  including  Lockheed Martin  Corp  NYSE LMT   s F 35 Joint Strike Fighter  which Turkish manufacturers help build 
Washington has threatened to impose sanctions under legislation that allows the punishment of entities doing business with parts of the Russian state  and to expel Turkey from the F 35 program  U S  sanctions would likely intensify market turmoil  as happened during a diplomatic standoff between the countries last year 
In December  the U S  State Department abandoned its opposition to selling Patriots to Turkey in a gambit to get it to halt the S 400 deal  But Turkey has rejected the U S  proposal unless the Patriot technology is shared 
The first batch of S 400 missiles may be delivered as early as June  Future shipments might involve technology transfer to Turkey  Akar told reporters who traveled to Washington  where he was meeting with American officials  Albayrak  the Turkish president s son in law  said he also met Trump s son in law  Jared Kushner 
Patrick Shanahan  the acting U S  defense secretary  has called Turkey s planned purchase of the S 400  incompatible  with the sale of F 35s  U S  officials have said they re concerned that sensitive F 35 technology designed to evade such a system could be compromised and used to improve Russian air defense technology 
The Turkish defense chief tried to play down that threat  saying the S 400 would operate independently from systems used by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization  to which Turkey belongs 
 Turkish American ties can t be disregarded   Akar said a day before his planned meeting with Shanahan   Our hope and wish is that these meetings will make it possible to find a solution to the problems   Ankara is proceeding on the assumption that it will receive F 35s and use them alongside the S 400  he added 
On Monday  pro government columnist Okan Muderrisoglu wrote in the Sabah daily that the Russian missiles could be stationed in neighboring Azerbaijan or Qatar 
When asked about the possibility of receiving the S 400 system  but not deploying it to avert further American pressure  Akar said   These are all options  Let s see what the process ahead will bring

133578,355093,LMT,Lockheed Martin  LMT  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"The market expects Lockheed Martin  LMT  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 23  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This aerospace and defense company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  4 74 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  10  
Revenues are expected to be  14 16 billion  up 5 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Lockheed 
For Lockheed  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 14  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  1 
So  this combination indicates that Lockheed will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Lockheed would post earnings of  4 29 per share when it actually produced earnings of  5 99  delivering a surprise of  39 63  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Lockheed appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/lockheed-martin-lmt-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200440181,200440181
133579,355094,LMT,Lockheed  LMT  Is An Incredible Growth Stock  3 Reasons Why,opinion,"Growth stocks are attractive to many investors  as above average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  However  it isn t easy to find a great growth stock 
In addition to volatility  these stocks carry above average risk by their very nature  Also  one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end 
However  the task of finding cutting edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Our proprietary system currently recommends Lockheed Martin  LMT  as one such stock  This company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market  And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   returns are even better 
Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this aerospace and defense company a great growth pick right now 
Earnings Growth
Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth  as surging profit levels is what most investors are after  For growth investors  double digit earnings growth is highly preferable  as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Lockheed is 11 8   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 16 6  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 4 9  
Impressive Asset Utilization Ratio
Growth investors often overlook asset utilization ratio  also known as sales to total assets  S TA  ratio  but it is an important feature of a real growth stock  This metric exhibits how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales 
Right now  Lockheed has an S TA ratio of 1 23  which means that the company gets  1 23 in sales for each dollar in assets  Comparing this to the industry average of 0 87  it can be said that the company is more efficient 
While the level of efficiency in generating sales matters a lot  so does the sales growth of a company  And Lockheed looks attractive from a sales growth perspective as well  The company s sales are expected to grow 7 9  this year versus the industry average of 5 6  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above  investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is a plus here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
The current year earnings estimates for Lockheed have been revising upward  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0 1  over the past month 
Bottom Line
While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Lockheed a Zacks Rank  1 stock  it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above 
You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

133589,355104,LMT,Trump s border wall money may come at expense of schools for military kids,news,"WASHINGTON  Reuters    The U S  Department of Defense is proposing to pay for President Donald Trump s much debated border wall by shifting funds away from projects that include  1 2 billion for schools  childcare centers and other facilities for military children  according to a list it has provided to lawmakers  The Pentagon gave Congress a list on Monday that included  12 8 billion of construction projects for which it said funds could be redirected  Around 10 percent of the list relates to educational establishments and includes school buildings for the children of service members in places like Germany  Japan  Kentucky and Puerto Rico  The move comes as a surprise given the Trump administration s oft touted support for the sacrifices made by military families and suggests the White House s desire to build a wall on the border with Mexico outstrips nearly all other issues  However  of the  1 2 billion in projects related to education  approximately  800 million worth are far in the future  and those funds could readily be used for wall construction and replaced later  The Pentagon told Congress that just because a project was listed  it  does not mean that the project will  in fact  be used  as a funding source to build sections of the border wall   Trump earlier in March asked for  8 6 billion in his 2020 budget request to help pay for his promised wall on the U S Mexico border to combat illegal immigration and drug trafficking  It drew swift criticism from Democrats  Trump declared a national emergency in a bid to fund the wall without congressional approval  allowing his administration to use money from the military construction budget  if needed  In a tense Congressional hearing last week  Democratic senators demanded that they be provided a list of military funds that could be utilized to fund wall construction  Military officials have vowed that they would not use any funds from military housing  A recent Reuters investigation  found thousands of U S  military families were subjected to serious health and safety hazards in on base housing  prompting moves from lawmakers to improve landlord controls  But elementary and middle schools on bases around the world serving military families are at risk of suffering from the funding diversion  as well as a new engineering building and parking garage at West Point  the Army s military academy in New York state  Joint Base Andrews  where the president s Air Force jet is based  was slated to receive  13 million for a  Child Development Center   but funding for that project is on the list  The base currently has three child development centers serving the 12 000 to 14 000 active and reserve military stationed there  The children of pilots for the F 35A jet  being made by  Lockheed Martin   NYSE LMT  at a cost of  89 million each  could be impacted  Alaska s Eielson Air Force Base is slated to get  22 5 million to build a school to enroll 240 additional children  in a remote arctic climate  when the jet begins operations there

133592,355107,LMT,Exclusive  U S  may soon pause preparations for delivering F 35s to Turkey,news,"By Idrees Ali and Phil Stewart WASHINGTON  Reuters    The United States could soon freeze preparations for delivering F 35 fighter jets to Turkey  officials told Reuters  in what would be the strongest signal yet by Washington that Ankara cannot have both the advanced aircraft and Russia s S 400 air defense system   The United States is nearing an inflection point in a years long standoff with Turkey  a NATO ally  after so far failing to sway President Tayyip Erdogan that buying a Russian air defense system would compromise the security of F 35 aircraft   The S 400 is a computer  The F 35 is a computer  You don t hook your computer to your adversary s computer and that s basically what we would be doing   Katie Wheelbarger  acting assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs  told Reuters   While no decision has been made yet  U S  officials confirmed that Washington was considering halting steps now underway to ready Turkey to receive the F 35  which is built by  Lockheed Martin  Corp  NYSE LMT     There  are  decisions that come up constantly about things being delivered in anticipation of them eventually taking custody of the planes   said Wheelbarger   So there s a lot of things in train that can be paused to send signals to them  that we re serious    she added  without detailing those steps  However  another U S  official said one of the measures the United States was looking at was alternatives to an engine depot in Turkey  without giving more details  The official said any potential alternatives would likely be somewhere in Western Europe  Turkey is home to an F 35 engine overhaul depot in the western city of Eskisehir  Asked about the Reuters report  the top U S  military officer said on Thursday he was hopeful that Washington would find a way to resolve the dispute with Turkey over the S 400 but cautioned   It is a tough issue    Both the executive branch of our government and legislative branch of our government are going to have a hard time reconciling the presence of the S 400 and the most advanced fighter aircraft that we have  the F 35   General Joseph Dunford  the chairman of the U S  Joint Chiefs of Staff  said during an event   If Turkey was removed from the F 35 program  it would be the most serious crisis in the relationship between the two allies in decades  according to Bulent Aliriza  director of the Turkey project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies  The strains on ties between Washington and Ankara already extend beyond the F 35 to include strategy in Syria  Iran sanctions and the detention of U S  consular staff   This  the F 35 standoff  is really a symptom  not a cause of the problem between the two countries   Aliriza said   Many U S  officials  speaking on condition of anonymity  worry that Turkey is drifting away from NATO and watch improving relations between Ankara and Moscow with concern  The prospect of Russian contractors or officials on Turkish bases that also are home to the F 35 is unfathomable to many U S  officials  The tensions could further escalate  If Ankara goes ahead with the Russian deal  Turkey also could face U S  sanctions   A Turkish foreign ministry official said on Thursday that Ankara s position had not changed   Our position on this matter is evident   the official said  ERDOGAN IMPASSE Despite U S  hopes that Turkey may still forgo the S 400  experts say Erdogan may have already backed himself into a rhetorical corner  He has repeatedly said he would not reverse course on the S 400  saying earlier in March   Nobody should ask us to lick up what we spat   A decision to drop Turkey from the F 35 program would have broader repercussions  since Ankara helps manufacture parts for the aircraft  including components of the landing gear  cockpit displays and aircraft engines  Wheelbarger acknowledged that the Pentagon  in light of the standoff  was looking  across the board  at potential alternate suppliers for F 35 parts  including in other NATO countries   It s prudent program planning   to ensure that you have stability in your supply chain   she said  without speculating that Turkey might be dropped from the program  Washington has sought to persuade Turkey to purchase the American made Raytheon  NYSE RTN  Co Patriot defense system  instead of S 400s  Erdogan has said that Turkey was still open to buying Patriot systems from the United States but only if the conditions are suitable   Pentagon spokesman Eric Pahon said that in addition to the Patriot air defense system  the American offer  includes significant government to government cooperation on advanced system development   Although Turkey has held out the prospect of buying both the S 400 and the Patriot system  the United States has warned Turkey it will take its offer of Patriots off the table unless it changes course   A Turkish S 400 purchase could also trigger a fight with the U S  Congress  which has already blocked all major arms sales to Ankara while the S 400 deal is pending  Lawmakers could renew attempts to introduce legislation that would legally prohibit the Trump administration from allowing Turkey to have the F 35 if it secures the S 400s

Here are highlights from Monday s Analyst Blog  
Top Analyst Reports for Verizon  McDonald s and Lockheed Martin
The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Verizon  McDonald s and Lockheed Martin  These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today 
You can see all of today s research reports here    
Verizon s shares have gained  13 3  in the past year  outperforming the Zacks Wireless National industry s increase of  8 7  during the same period  The Zacks analyst thinks that Verizon is well positioned to benefit from the impending 5G boom  driven by healthy traction in the wireless business 
The telecom giant is seeking first mover advantage in the 5G race with the launch of commercial 5G smartphones  in collaboration with Samsung  KS 005930   Focus on online content delivery  mobile video and online advertising will likely drive future growth  Furthermore  the company has upped the ante against its rivals by launching 5G Ultra Wideband network in Chicago  Minneapolis  and in select locations of Denver and Providence 
However  it continues to struggle in a competitive U S  wireless market  The company s wireline division is struggling with losses in access lines due to competitive pressure from VoIP service providers  Verizon is spending heavily on promotion and lucrative discounts to woo customers  which weighs on its margins 
Shares of McDonald s have gained  10 2  in the past three months  outperforming the Zacks Restaurants industry  which has increased  8 7  over the same period  The Zacks analyst thinks that its various sales and digital initiatives as well as positive comparable sales bode well 
Furthermore  global comps at McDonald s have been positive over the trailing 15 quarters  The company s increased focus on delivery and accelerated deployment of Experience of the Future restaurants in the United States should boost its performance  These apart  efforts to drive growth in international markets are encouraging  However  high labor costs and currency headwinds remain concerns 
Additionally  revenues have been under pressure for quite some time due to strategic refranchising initiatives  Even its heightened focus on refranchising might reduce capital requirements and facilitate EPS growth  McDonald s margins have been under pressure 
Lockheed Martin s shares have gained  21 5  in the past year  outperforming the Zacks Aerospace Defense industry which has gained  8 4  over the same period  The Zacks analyst thinks that Lockheed Martin  being the largest defense contractor in the world  enjoys strong demand for its high end military equipment in domestic and international markets 
As a result  solid order growth has been a key catalyst for the company  F 35 continues to be a major revenue contributor  Of late  the company is witnessing increased demand for its THAAD missiles from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 
However  the company s higher debt to equity ratio shows that the stock is highly leveraged when compared to its industry  and thus bears higher chance of insolvency  Lockheed Martin also faces intense global competition for its broad portfolio of products and services  Higher cost expenditure related to the F 35 program may also hurt growth trajectory

133607,355122,LMT,Lockheed Setting The Stage For An Unpleasant Surprise,opinion,"Lockheed Martin  NYSE LMT  has been one of the best companies to own during the last ten years  The Great Recession dragged the stock down to  57 41  Once again  the point of maximum pessimism turned out to be the best time to buy  Two days ago  LMT closed at a new all time high of  370 38 a share 
In other words  Lockheed is up 549  since 2009  not counting the dividends  With the stock at a record high and the company posting its best business results ever  few seem to be worried about a possible decline  But is investors  complacency warranted 

Lockheed  s weekly chart above reveals the Elliott Wave structure of the entire bull market since 2009  It looks like a textbook five wave impulse pattern  labeled  1   2   3   4   5   The sub waves of waves  1  and  3  are also clearly visible  It is interesting to note that waves  2  and  4  retraced almost exactly to the 61 8  and 38 2  Fibonacci levels  respectively 
Anyway  what makes this pattern important is its Elliott Wave implications  The theory states that a three wave correction of the same degree follows every impulse  This means that once wave  5  is over  possibly near the  400 mark  a major bearish reversal can be expected 
The anticipated decline has the potential to drag Lockheed stock back to the support area of wave  4  or even lower  If this analysis is correct  complacency is investors  worst enemy right now  A bearish reversal can soon occur  followed by a 40 50  drop in the next few years

133663,355178,LMT,Melting missiles  just one problem with F 35s stopping N Korea rockets,news,By Mike Stone WASHINGTON  Reuters    Looking for a quick way to stop North Korean missiles immediately after lift off  the Pentagon is studying as a near term option whether a group of F 35 fighter jets hovering around North Korean airspace could pick off freshly launched rockets  In its current form  the idea defies physics  missile defense experts say  It calls for interceptor missiles that fly so fast they could melt one expert said  and the only surefire way for U S  military aircraft to defeat a missile with current technology would be to fly in hostile airspace  according to three experts interviewed by Reuters   The idea  part of a six month study launched last month  shows how the Pentagon is seeking ways to neutralize the threat posed by Pyongyang even as President Donald Trump meets North Korean leader Kim Jong Un this week in Vietnam in his effort to stop Kim s nuclear program  Concern over U S  missile defenses has grown with the escalating threat from North Korea  Two years ago North Korea conducted about a dozen missile tests  some with multiple rockets  including the launch of a suspected inter continental ballistic missile that could hit the U S  mainland  They also tested a purported hydrogen bomb   The F 35 plan under study would likely involve continuously flying a group of the stealthy jets within range of known North Korean missile sites  Once a missile is launched towards U S  territory  the F 35 s advanced sensors would detect and then fire a special air to air missile before the Pyongyang projectile exits the atmosphere  the latest missile defense strategy and Pentagon leadership have said   Military officials say the F 35 option is the one they want to test first because it could use existing military hardware and potentially be operational sooner than other strategies  and at a relatively low cost  At the same time Pentagon leadership says the tests may reveal a new interceptor is needed  or that the F 35 may only have a role in detecting the just launched missile and not necessarily also shoot it down   Speaking about that option after last month s release of the defense strategy review  Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering Michael Griffin said   we do think it could be both cost effective and     within the bounds of math and physics   Among other proposals included in the review was one involving lasers mounted on drones   proposed to stop missiles just after take off in what is called the boost phase  During this portion of the flight the missile is most vulnerable  flying at its slowest speed  easily detected by the heat from its engines  and incapable of evading interceptors as it accelerates to break out of the earth s atmosphere  MELTING MISSILES Geography complicates the F 35 plan  Tom Karako  a missile defense expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington noted that jets lying in wait for a North Korean missile would in theory need to respect North Korean airspace  But remaining at such a distance could leave the jets too far from the missile launch to be effective  Theodore Postol  a missile defense expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology said even a modified air to air missile would be too slow to take out an intercontinental ballistic missile before it exited the atmosphere  Air to air missiles like those made by Raytheon  NYSE RTN  Co would only have an estimated 200 seconds to hit a ballistic missile before reaching an altitude where the air is too thin to maneuver  Given that it would take an F 35 approximately 50 60 seconds to detect  lock onto and launch an air to air missile  Postol said  the jet would need to be very close to the ballistic missile to take it out   If you are on top of it you can shoot it down   the retired rocket scientist said   But the odds are going to be very low that you can be on top of it   Even if a much faster and lighter version air to air missile was mounted in an F 35 jet  depending on the distance the weapon would have to fly so fast it would begin to melt  Postol added  Despite the obstacles  the very fact that Pentagon was weighing such an option was significant  Karako said   This shows a broader cultural shift   Rather than some giant program  Karako said  the Pentagon is considering  a mission that is integrated into a broader mesh of tactical programs the Department of Defense can call on    Making it work will be a challenge  though   You would need to be very close to the launch site  within North Korea itself  said physicist Laura Grego  who studies missile defense at the Union of Concerned Scientists  Grego said that even if the air to air missile traveled at five times the speed of sound  the F 35 would need to be within about 50 miles of the missile   probably closer  to be realistic   That gives a huge advantage to the stealthy F 35 which could get much closer to a possible launch area than a non stealth aircraft   This is one of the advantages of the F 35   said retired U S  general David Deptula  He added that the radar evading jets  can get in much closer to an adversary launch area than     a non stealthy aircraft    That suggests that by using the F 35 made by  Lockheed Martin   NYSE LMT   the U S  could secretly monitor for ballistic missile launches with jets flying inside North Korean airspace   This version of the story adds Trump s first name in paragraph 3

133713,355228,LMT,Should Investors Get Excited About Rare Earth Metals ,opinion,"Terbium is used to make flat panel displays  Thulium can be found in your microwave  Dysprosium demand is growing with increased production of wind turbines and electric vehicles 
The 17 so called  rare earth metals   of which the three mentioned above are members  may not have household names like gold or copper  but they play strong supporting roles in many of the consumer electronics we enjoy on a daily basis  from our TVs to smartphones 
They also have important high tech military  energy  health care and transportation applications  According to the Rare Earth Technology Alliance  RETA   each Lockheed Martin  NYSE LMT  F 35 requires some 920 pounds of the metals  Some nuclear powered submarines use up to 9 200 pounds 
All of this could be something of a concern in the near term  China  which accounts for close to 80 percent of the world s annual production of rare earth metals  is allegedly preparing to curb the export of these important materials to the U S  as a bargaining chip in the ongoing trade war between the two superpowers  and as retaliation for the recent U S  ban on imports from Chinese telecommunications firm Huawei  In a tweet dated May 28  Hu Xijin  editor of the Chinese state controlled Global Times newspaper  said that he believes the country  is seriously considering restricting rare earth exports to the U S   Some market commentators are already calling this China s  nuclear  option 
 Rare   by the way  is a misnomer here  The metals are actually more plentiful than precious metals such as gold and platinum  But because processing them is costly and leads to heavy pollution  China has risen to become the global leader  As few as six state owned enterprises  SOEs  dominate the Chinese rare earth metals mining and refining industry 

The U S  was actually the leader in global rare earth production from the 1960s to 1980s  but today  California s Mountain Pass mine is the only such mining and processing facility in the U S  As such  China supplies some 80 percent of U S  rare earth requirements 
Obviously this has some serious national security as well as economic implications  There are other countries the U S  can import these metals from including Australia  Estonia and Myanmar but it would be challenging to make up the difference 
American Ingenuity To The Rescue
If you remember  the U S  faced a similar  crisis  involving oil around 20 years ago  Some people were talking about  peak oil  
But American ingenuity gave us hydraulic fracturing  or fracking  and today the U S  is the world s largest producer of crude  having surpassed Russia and Saudi Arabia sometime last year 
Should China follow through with its threats and cut off its rare earth exports  I believe the U S  should build up its own mining and refining capacity aside from finding new suppliers  American innovators gave the U S  fracking and soon to be energy independence  They can and should do the same with respect to rare earth metals 
Where To Invest 
As expected  Hong Kong and Shenzhen listed rare earth miners surged this week and last  China Rare Earth Holdings gained more than 108 percent in a single session on May 21  JL Mag Rare Earth Co   which Chinese president Xi Jinping recently visited  has had a remarkable 13 straight days of positive returns   and is now up 171 percent since May 13 
Seeing as how this rally is driven purely by geopolitics  it s hard to say at this point how much gas is in the tank  so to speak 
I still find more traditional materials and resources attractive   crude oil  copper  paper products  chemicals and more  The rare earth trade flare up may expose America s own vulnerabilities  but it also demonstrates just how much we depend on natural resources in general to keep our lives running smoothly  For my money  that s worth betting on ",2019-05-30,Frank Holmes,https://www.investing.com/analysis/should-investors-get-excited-about-rare-earth-metals-200426797,200426797

133759,355274,LMT,Has Lockheed Martin  LMT  Outpaced Other Aerospace Stocks This Year ,opinion,"Investors focused on the Aerospace space have likely heard of Lockheed Martin  LMT   but is the stock performing well in comparison to the rest of its sector peers  A quick glance at the company s year to date performance in comparison to the rest of the Aerospace sector should help us answer this question 
Lockheed Martin is one of 37 companies in the Aerospace group  The Aerospace group currently sits at  1 within the Zacks Sector Rank  The Zacks Sector Rank gauges the strength of our 16 individual sector groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups 
The Zacks Rank is a successful stock picking model that emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions  The system highlights a number of different stocks that could be poised to outperform the broader market over the next one to three months  LMT is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  
Within the past quarter  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for LMT s full year earnings has moved 5 76  higher  This means that analyst sentiment is stronger and the stock s earnings outlook is improving 
Our latest available data shows that LMT has returned about 30 37  since the start of the calendar year  Meanwhile  stocks in the Aerospace group have gained about 19 14  on average  This shows that Lockheed Martin is outperforming its peers so far this year

133760,355275,LMT,Looking For A Growth Stock  3 Reasons Why Lockheed  LMT  Is A Solid Choice,opinion,"Growth stocks are attractive to many investors  as above average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  However  it isn t easy to find a great growth stock 
By their very nature  these stocks carry above average risk and volatility  Moreover  if a company s growth story is over or nearing its end  betting on it could lead to significant loss 
However  it s pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Lockheed Martin  LMT  is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends  The company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market  And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   returns are even better 
While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this aerospace and defense company is a great growth pick right now  we have highlighted three of the most important factors below 
Earnings Growth
Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor  as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors  For growth investors  double digit earnings growth is highly preferable  as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Lockheed is 11 8   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 15 3  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 10 7  
Impressive Asset Utilization Ratio
Growth investors often overlook asset utilization ratio  also known as sales to total assets  S TA  ratio  but it is an important feature of a real growth stock  This metric shows how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales 
Right now  Lockheed has an S TA ratio of 1 23  which means that the company gets  1 23 in sales for each dollar in assets  Comparing this to the industry average of 0 88  it can be said that the company is more efficient 
While the level of efficiency in generating sales matters a lot  so does the sales growth of a company  And Lockheed is well positioned from a sales growth perspective too  The company s sales are expected to grow 7 2  this year versus the industry average of 6  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Superiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is of course favorable here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
There have been upward revisions in current year earnings estimates for Lockheed  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 5 5  over the past month 
Bottom Line
Lockheed has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above  but it also carries a Zacks Rank  2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions

bps  to 13 4   The improvement in the operating income was driven by higher sales and favorable overhead absorption from industrial valve and sensors products Defense  Sales at this segment rose 2

133861,355376,LMT,Trump stands by Saudi prince despite journalist Khashoggi s murder,news,"By Mike Stone WASHINGTON  Reuters    President Donald Trump vowed on Tuesday to remain a  steadfast partner  of Saudi Arabia despite saying that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman may have known about the plan to murder dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi last month  Defying intense pressure from U S  lawmakers to impose tougher sanctions on Saudi Arabia  Trump also said he would not cancel military contracts with the kingdom  claiming it would be a  foolish  move that would only benefit Russia and China  Trump said U S  intelligence agencies were still studying the evidence around Khashoggi s murder inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct  2 and who planned it  Since the murder  Trump has taken varying positions on how to react  including possible sanctions   It could very well be that the Crown Prince had knowledge of this tragic event   maybe he did and maybe he didn t   Trump said in a statement issued by the White House  His comments contradicted the Central Intelligence Agecy   CIA   which believes Khashoggi s death was ordered directly by the crown prince  Saudi Arabia s de facto ruler widely known by his initials MbS  Trump was quickly accused by Democratic lawmakers of undermining his own intelligence agencies and failing to confront Saudi Arabia over a human rights atrocity   Human rights is more than just a phrase  it has to mean something  And that means standing up and condemning a brazen murder by a foreign government  Everyone who played a role in this killing must be held accountable   Senator Dianne Feinstein said  Democratic and Republican lawmakers have urged Trump to drop his support for MbS over the Khashoggi case  but the president has been reluctant  Trump said on Tuesday that both Saudi Arabia s King Salman and MbS  vigorously deny any knowledge of the planning or execution of the murder   and that the truth may never be known  He also stressed that Saudi Arabia  a major oil producer  is an important business partner and a  great ally  in the fight against Iranian power in the Middle East   The United States intends to remain a steadfast partner of Saudi Arabia to ensure the interests of our country  Israel and all other partners in the region   Trump said  On Twitter  Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said of the statement   Mr  Trump bizarrely devotes the FIRST paragraph of his shameful statement on Saudi atrocities to accuse IRAN of every sort of malfeasance he can think of   Congressman Adam Schiff  who is expected to become leader of the House of Representatives  Intelligence Committee in January  said the United States should immediately end support for Saudi Arabia in the Yemen war  suspend arms sales to the kingdom  and reduce its reliance on Riyadh in the Middle East   The president adds to his track record of ignoring his own intelligence agencies  and undermining American values at home and abroad  by giving Saudi Arabia a pass for the brutal and premeditated murder of a U S  resident and journalist  Outrageous   Democratic Senator Dick Durbin said  REPUBLICANS  CRITICISM Some of Trump s fellow Republicans have also vowed to break with him and push for firmer U S  action against Saudi Arabia  Representative Francis Rooney  a Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee  said Washington should apply the so called Magnitsky Act to those responsible for Khashoggi s death  The legislation hits human rights violators with freezes on U S  assets  U S  travel bans  and prohibitions on Americans doing business with them  Trump has placed the alliance with Saudi Arabia at the heart of his Middle East policy  and it was the first country he visited after becoming president in 2017  Republican Senator Lindsey Graham  a sometime Trump ally  said there will be bipartisan support for sanctions against Saudi Arabia   including appropriate members of the royal family  for this barbaric act which defied all civilized norms    While Saudi Arabia is a strategic ally  the behavior of the crown prince   in multiple ways   has shown disrespect for the relationship and made him  in my view  beyond toxic   Graham said  Trump s son in law  Jared Kushner  has developed a close relationship with MbS  and both he and Trump have tried to maintain the alliance  Trump said on Tuesday he would not suspend arms sales to Riyadh   If we foolishly cancel these contracts  Russia and China would be the enormous beneficiaries   and very happy to acquire all of this newfound business  It would be a wonderful gift to them directly from the United States   Trump said   Representative Eliot Engel  who has the power to block arms deals as the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee  said the United States should use its ability to sell weapons to the Saudis as leverage to influence Riyadh s behavior   The reality is that the Saudis couldn t simply buy their weapons somewhere else   Engel said in a statement   It would take years for the Saudi military to re equip with Russian or Chinese weapons   When Trump mentions the  110 billion package with Riyadh last year  he often adds that  it s 500 000 jobs    But arms manufacturer  Lockheed Martin  Corp  NYSE LMT  predicts the deal could create nearly 10 000 new jobs in Saudi Arabia  while keeping up to 18 000 existing U S  workers busy if the whole package comes together   an outcome industry experts say is unlikely  U S  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo defended Trump s support for Saudi Arabia  The United States was obligated to adopt policies that furthered U S  national security interests  Pompeo told a news conference following a meeting with Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu in Washington  
Cavusoglu said that Turkey is not entirely satisfied with the level of cooperation it is receiving from Saudi Arabia over Khashoggi s murder  and may seek a formal United Nations inquiry ",2018-11-20,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/trump-us-will-stand-by-saudis-even-though-prince-may-have-had-knowledge-of-killing-1695512,1695512

However  it s pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects 
Lockheed Martin  LMT  is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system  In addition to a favorable Growth Score  it carries a top Zacks Rank 
Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market  And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  
Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this aerospace and defense company a great growth pick right now 
Earnings Growth
Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor  as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors  For growth investors  double digit earnings growth is highly preferable  as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Lockheed is 10 2   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 12 6  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 8 4  
Impressive Asset Utilization Ratio
Asset utilization ratio    also known as sales to total assets  S TA  ratio    is often overlooked by investors  but it is an important indicator in growth investing  This metric exhibits how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales 
Right now  Lockheed has an S TA ratio of 1 23  which means that the company gets  1 23 in sales for each dollar in assets  Comparing this to the industry average of 0 87  it can be said that the company is more efficient 
In addition to efficiency in generating sales  sales growth plays an important role  And Lockheed is well positioned from a sales growth perspective too  The company s sales are expected to grow 7  this year versus the industry average of 5  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above  investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is a plus here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
There have been upward revisions in current year earnings estimates for Lockheed  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 4 7  over the past month 
Bottom Line
Lockheed has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above  but it also carries a Zacks Rank  2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions

133875,355390,LMT,Why Lockheed Martin  LMT  Is A Great Dividend Stock Right Now,opinion,"Whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  all investors love seeing their portfolios score big returns  However  when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long term returns  with dividend contributions exceeding one third of total returns in many cases 
Lockheed Martin in Focus
Lockheed Martin  LMT  is headquartered in Bethesda  and is in the Aerospace sector  The stock has seen a price change of 27 3  since the start of the year  The aerospace and defense company is currently shelling out a dividend of  2 2 per share  with a dividend yield of 2 64   This compares to the Aerospace   Defense industry s yield of 0 94  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 86  
Taking a look at the company s dividend growth  its current annualized dividend of  8 80 is up 7 3  from last year  In the past five year period  Lockheed Martin has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 10 60   Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company s payout ratio  a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Right now  Lockheed s payout ratio is 44   which means it paid out 44  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Earnings growth looks solid for LMT for this fiscal year  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  20 28 per share  representing a year over year earnings growth rate of 15 29  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits  It s important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout 
High growth firms or tech start ups  for example  rarely provide their shareholders a dividend  while larger  more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  During periods of rising interest rates  income investors must be mindful that high yielding stocks tend to struggle  With that in mind  LMT presents a compelling investment opportunity  it s not only an attractive dividend play  but the stock also boasts a strong Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  ",2019-04-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-lockheed-martin-lmt-is-a-great-dividend-stock-right-now-200413747,200413747

133895,355410,LMT,Exclusive  Defense firms see only hundreds of new U S  jobs from Saudi mega deal,news,"By Mike Stone WASHINGTON  Reuters    Every time President Donald Trump mentions the  110 billion arms deal he negotiated with Saudi Arabia last year  he quickly follows up  saying  It s 500 000 jobs   But if he means new U S  defense jobs  an internal document seen by Reuters from  Lockheed Martin  forecasts fewer than 1 000 positions would be created by the defense contractor  which could potentially deliver around  28 billion of goods in the deal  Graphic  U S  weapons deliveries to Saudi Arabia    Lockheed instead predicts the deal could create nearly 10 000 new jobs in Saudi Arabia  while keeping up to 18 000 existing U S  workers busy if the whole package comes together   an outcome experts say is unlikely  A person familiar with Raytheon s planning said if the Saudi order were executed it could help to sustain about 10 000 U S  jobs  but the number of new jobs created would be a small percentage of that figure   Lockheed Martin Corp  NYSE LMT  declined to comment on the Saudi package  Raytheon Co s Chief Financial Officer Toby O Brien said last week that hiring overall is growing  but he did not pin it to any particular program  The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment  Jobs are important to Trump  He campaigned on his ability to create American jobs  especially high paying manufacturing ones  Meanwhile he has limited his criticism of Saudi leadership over the killing of a prominent critic because he did not want to endanger the massive arms deal  Trump s 500 000 figure has been greeted with widespread skepticism given the five biggest U S  defense contractors  who make nearly every item on the Saudi list  now employ 383 000 people  Documents seen by Reuters and interviews with defense industry sources familiar with the arms package suggest that between 20 000 and 40 000 current U S  defense industry workers could be involved in Saudi bound production if the whole  110 billion package goes through   Existing workers typically are experienced  skilled  who can be redeployed more easily than new hires who would require significant upfront investment in their training  One significant caveat to any predictions on job creation is whether all of the missile defenses and radars  ships  tanks  software  bombs and other equipment listed in the full Saudi package get delivered  SAUDI ARABIA JOBS Interviews with people familiar with other major defense contractors  plans and estimates reflect similar dynamic as Lockheed s and Raytheon s plans   relatively minor additions to their U S  workforce and more significant build up in Saudi Arabia  Since Trump s trip to the Kingdom last year  little economic activity has taken place beyond Lockheed s work on four frigates the Saudis have ordered  The order will yield nearly 10 000 jobs in the Saudi ports for maintenance workers  but only 500 new U S  jobs will be created  according to documents seen by Reuters  Executives at the several of top U S  defense companies say Riyadh had wanted much of the military equipment as a way to both develop new domestic industry and to create new jobs and local expertise as a part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman s Vision 2030 initiative to wean the country off oil dependency  Saudi Arabia has set a goal of creating 40 000 defense industry jobs by 2030   The arms package Trump announced in May 2017 came under renewed scrutiny after the Oct  2 killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul  The killing provoked international outrage and both the administration and defense contractors have been working to prevent a backlash that could imperil what Trump has called a  tremendous order  and 500 000 jobs  Industry executives have argued that without the Saudi package coming through they would have fewer orders to fill  but robust U S  defense budgets  which account for the majority of their sales  coupled with a record backlog of orders suggest little risk that workers would face layoffs if the Saudi sales package failed to materialize  Certainly for each defense manufacturing job  other adjacent jobs are supported indirectly by higher demand for defense products  But Heidi Garrett Peltier  a research fellow at the Political Economy Research Institute  estimated that for this type of industry the highest multiplier would be just below 3 2  Given that  20 000 to 40 000 sustained or new jobs could generate between about 64 000 to 128 000 jobs in related industries  Reuters calculations show  bringing the total of sustained and new jobs to between 84 000 and 168 000  In short  500 000 jobs Trump keeps bringing up is at least three to five times higher than what one could expect from the Saudi deal  given the estimates from the companies themselves  plus the most generous use of the indirect multiplier

On economic data front Tuesday  the US new home sales surged to 692K from prior 662K  revised downwards from 667K   higher than the expectations of 647K  On a sequential basis  the new home sales grew by  4 5  in March from prior  5 9   revised upwards from  4 9   and higher than the expectations of a slump of  3 0   The new home sales soared to a 16 month high  rising for the 3rd straight month as home as prices plunged  But the recent tick up of 30Y mortgage rates from around 4 12  to 4 25  may be a great headwind for the US housing market along with a short supply of affordable cheap houses going forward 
On Monday  data shows that the US existing home sales dropped to 5 21M from prior 5 48M  revised downwards from 5 51M   lower than the expectations of 5 30M  On a sequential basis  the US existing home sales slumped  4 9  in March from a growth of  11 2   revised downwards from  11 8   and lower than the expectations of  3 8  
The recent tick up of 30Y mortgage rates from around 4 10  to 4 25  may be a headwind for the US housing market going forward along with a lower limited supply of cheaper houses at affordable prices  But overall  falling mortgage rates  from a recent high of around 4 94  to 4 12    higher real wage growth  slowing housing price inflation were tailwinds for the US housing market  which is always a great spot for the US economy except for some recent quarters amid hawkish Fed and higher mortgage rates  The US economy may be strong  but not so much strong so that it could sustain a 30Y mortgage rate of 4 50  
On last Thursday  18th April   data shows that the US initial jobless claims slumped to 192K from prior 197K  revised upwards from 196K  and lower than the expectations of 205K  The US continuing jobless claims slumped to 1653K from prior 1716K  lower than the expectations of 1720K  The 4 week average jobless claims  better gauze to measure the underlying data  as it irons out week to week volatility  also dropped to 201 25K from prior 207 25K  revised higher from 207K  
Overall  the US jobless claims fell for the 5th straight week and the lowest since last 50 years  1969   also invited an applause tweet from Trump as the number of Americans filing applications for unemployment benefits fell to a record low last week  pointing to sustained strength in the economy  As a pointer jobless claims tend to be volatile around this time of the year because of the different timings of the Easter holiday and spring breaks 
In brief  although the trend in hiring has slowed recently  job gains remain above the roughly 100K needed per month to keep up with growth in the working age population  demography   The unemployment rate is currently at 3 8   also near the 3 7  Fed target  by the end of the year  2019  
The US core retail sales jumped  1 2  in March sequentially from the prior slump of  0 2   revised higher from  0 4   and higher than the expectations of  0 7   The US headline retail sales surged  1 6  in March sequentially from prior  0 2  and higher than the expectations of  0 9  and grew at the fastest pace since Sep 2017 as spending on autos  gasoline  furniture  and especially clothing jumped 
As a reminder  the Fed also pointed to terrible retail sales in Dec Feb as one of the reasons for its neutral stance projections  dot plots  for the entire 2019  Thus the rebound in March retail sales  although on lower base may be hawkish for Fed policy and boosted the USD to some extent  Almost 80 85  of the US GDP comes from consumer spending  the largest in the world  followed by China   A consistent positive real wage growth and tight job market may be helping the US consumption along with some fall in consumer borrowing costs amid the Fed s patience and flexibility 
The National Retail Sales Federation  NRF  said   March s numbers are very encouraging and set the stage for improved expectations for the economy in the coming months  especially since the Q4 is typically weak  These numbers  could  boost Q1 performance and suggest a strong consumer  It s clear that underlying consumer fundamentals including job  wage growth  and healthy household balance sheets continue to support spending  Consumers were busy in March after weaker than expected spending earlier  
NRF added   The March numbers could have been better if not for cold weather early in March and changes in the timing of two key regional holidays  The change of seasons is always a factor because of the  adverse  weather  and a later  delayed  Easter and Passover this year mean holiday related sales that took place in March last year won t come until April this year and sizable impact year over year comparisons  
Overall  the NRF is now forecasting the US retail sales may grow around 3 8 4 4  in 2019  y y  to more than  3 8T  
After the upbeat US core retail sales for March  the Atlanta Fed raised its Q1 GDP growth forecast to  2 8  from prior  2 4  on an annualized basis  Prior to this  the US Q1 GDP growth estimate was also upgraded from a low of  0 5  amid upbeat trade  inventories  and construction spending data  The US economy grew at a  2 2  pace in the Q4 2018  But in any way  the Fed may watch incoming economic data for another quarter  Q2 June 19  for any change in its dot plots 
The market is concerned that the US economy will slow this year as the stimulus from a  1 5T Trump tax cut package fades and the impact of Fed rate hikes higher borrowing costs over the last few years lingers 
The US Markit Manufacturing PMI for April was unchanged at 52 4  lower than the expectation of 52 8  The reading pointed to the slowest growth in factory activity since June of 2017  amid softer increases in output and new orders  And  Q1 average was the lowest since Q3 2017  The US service PMI slumped to 52 9 in April from prior 55 3  lower than the expectation of 55 0  
Markit painted a gloomy picture of the US economy in Q1 Q2 
 The underlying data indicated that improved readings for output and new orders were generally offset by slower increases in employment and pre production inventories  The latest increase in new business was the quickest for three months  Nevertheless  the expansion was well below those seen this time last year  with foreign demand also remaining relatively muted  As a result  production volumes expanded at a slightly quicker  albeit still modest  pace  
 Finally  inflationary pressures softened further across the manufacturing sector  The rate of input price inflation eased for the sixth successive month and was the weakest since July 2017  Smaller increases in costs were generally passed on to clients through a softer rise in factory gate prices  
 The US economy started the second quarter with its weakest expansion since mid 2016 as businesses reported a marked slowing in output  new orders  and hiring  The survey indicates that the manufacturing downturn seen in the first quarter has persisted into April  but growth in the service sector has now also slumped to a two year low as the malaise showed further signs of spreading beyond the factory sector  
 The April surveys are consistent with GDP rising at an annualized rate of just under 2   with the official measure of manufacturing production remaining in decline  April also saw firms become more reluctant to hire as a result of weaker order book growth  pushing jobs growth to a two year low  The survey s headline employment index is indicative of non farm payrolls growing by 130 000 in April  well below the 198 000 average indicated in the first quarter  
 A drop in price pressures meanwhile suggests that inflationary pressures continued to moderate  signaling that annual consumer price inflation could drop below 1  in coming months  as pricing power fades alongside weaker demand  
 While the overall rate of growth and job creation being signaled remain relatively solid  the slowdown likely has further to run  Companies  expectations of future growth slid to one of the lowest levels seen since comparable data were first collected in 2012  Only mid 2016 has seen gloomier business prospects  
Finally  the US business inventories for February slumped to  0 3  sequentially from prior  0 9   revised upwards from  0 8    but higher than the expectations of  0 4  
In Fed talks  on last Wednesday  17th April   Fed s Harker  non voter  and a known hawk also sounds like a real hawk as he sees  sound  U S  economy and two rate hikes in 2019 and 2020  
The Philadelphia Fed President Harker said   With a strong labor market  muted inflation and ongoing growth point to a fundamentally sound U S  economy  But there is enough uncertainty that policymakers should be patient as the data roll in   Thus  I continue to be in wait and see mode  and my outlook for rates remains  at most  one hike for 2019 and one for 2020  
Fed s Bullard  a known dove  and a contrarian sound less dovish and more optimistic as he said the US economic data should improve and yield curve steepen in coming months 
The St  Louis Fed President Bullard said on last Wednesday   My baseline case is that the temporary weakness we observed in January and February is going to dissipate and is dissipating  We will continue to get better news on the U S  economy as we get into the second quarter and the third quarter and   The yield curve will steepen  
On Thursday  18th April   Fed s Bostic  a known hawk  sounds neutral less hawkish as he said   Rates may go up or down but we are preserving optionality as the inflation still a little lower than Fed s 2  target and the uncertainty over outlook has still not cleared  
Fed s Beige Book published on last Wednesday  17th April  sees  slight to moderate  growth despite strengthening in a few regions  The Fed s Beige Book  a glimpse of the economy based on conversations with business contacts across all 12 of the Fed s districts  found economic activity grew at a slight to moderate pace in March and early April  while a few districts reported some strengthening in economic growth 
Fed s Beige Book  Full text
Overall Economic Activity
 Economic activity expanded at a slight to moderate pace in March and early April  While most Districts reported that growth continued at a similar pace as the previous report  a few Districts reported some strengthening  There was little change in the outlook among contacts in reporting Districts  with those expecting slight to modest growth in the months ahead  Reports on consumer spending were mixed but suggested sluggish sales for both general retailers and auto dealers  
 Reports on tourism were generally more upbeat  Reports on loan demand were mixed but indicated steady growth  Reports on manufacturing activity were favorable  although contacts in many Districts noted trade related uncertainty  Most Districts reported stronger home sales  although some Districts noted low demand for higher priced homes  Among reporting Districts  agricultural conditions remained weak  with contacts expressing concerns over the impact of current and future rainfall and flooding  
Employment and Wages
 Employment continued to increase nationwide  with nine Districts reporting modest or moderate growth and the other three reporting slight growth  While contacts reported gains across a variety of industries  employment increases were most highly concentrated in high skilled jobs  However  labor markets remained tight  restraining the rate of growth  A majority of Districts cited shortages of skilled laborers  most commonly in manufacturing and construction  Contacts also reported some difficulties finding qualified workers for technical and professional positions  
 Many Districts reported that firms have offered perks such as bonuses and expanded benefits packages in order to attract and retain employees  This tight labor market also led to continued wage pressures  as most Districts reported moderate wage growth  Wages for both skilled and unskilled positions generally grew at about the same pace as earlier this year  
Prices
 On balance  prices have risen modestly since the previous report  Input costs increased in the modest to moderate range  Tariffs  freight costs  and rising wages were often cited as key factors driving this trend  The ability of firms to pass increased input costs on to consumers was mixed  Changes in material costs were likewise mixed  with several Districts noting increases in metal prices and decreases in lumber prices  
 Construction firms across most Districts nevertheless reported net increases in material costs  with several also reporting passing those costs on to their customers  Some Districts noted increasing fuel prices  while others noted increasing oil prices and decreasing natural gas prices  Crop price pressures generally remain historically low  but price changes since the last report have varied by commodity  
Overall  the Fed s latest Beige Book was less dovish than the previous report  Fed s Beige Book basically painted the Goldilocks nature of the US economy  labor market remains tight  the economy continues to grow and inflation pressure remains modest  The US labor markets remained tight as businesses struggled to find skilled workers and wages grew modestly 
Prices inflation have risen modestly since the last Beige Book  with tariffs  freight costs and rising wages often cited as key factors behind the increase in input costs  Overall  the consumer spending was mixed but Fed s latest Beige Book also suggested sluggish sales for both general retailers and auto dealers 
In terms of the manufacturing sector  the Fed s latest Beige Book said contacts in many districts reported that trade related uncertainty was weighing on activity  Several Fed districts said flooding and severe weather in the Midwest were affecting agricultural production  And recent blizzards and flooding could weigh on the farming sector in the coming months  as it had resulted in damaged infrastructure and losses of cattle and crops  positive for food headline inflation in the coming days 
Overall  the US headline CPI may surge well above 2  in the coming days as oil is boiling  thanks to Trump s bellicose Iran Venezuelan policy and a possible surge in food inflation due to the recent polar vortex and devastating flood  This could also transmit into higher core inflation in the coming days  hawkish for the Fed s monetary policy  Thus  the Fed may not keep its  patience  throughout 2019 despite its March flip flops and consistent Trump pressure to cut ahead of 2020 election  The Fed may hike in Dec 19 again if incoming data support and for that the June meeting may be vital 
Another factor for higher US inflation  imported tariff  may be Trump s trade war agenda  Trump is also not ready to roll back his 10  additional China tariffs or foreign metal tariffs despite a possible trade deal with China and requests by the US business leaders  For Trump  the additional tariff is a great source of revenue  now around  5B month on an average    being paid by China   But actually  it s being paid by US consumers and importers  not Chinese exporters  Trump is basically trying to balance a part of his surging fiscal deficit  tax fiscal stimulus revenue loss  by these additional tariffs  revenue gain  
Talking about the US China marathon trade talks  on Monday  the White House CEA NEC Kudlow said the US China trade talks to resume in Beijing on Apr 30 and he was cautiously optimistic but not there yet 
Kudlow said   The negotiations were making progress and I am cautiously optimistic  on striking a deal   We ve come further and deeper  broader  larger scale than anything in the history of U S  China trade  But we re not there yet  We re still working on the issues   so called structural issues  technology transfers  Also  ownership enforcement is absolutely crucial  Lowering barriers to buy and sell agriculture and industrial commodities  It s all on the table  We ve gotten closer on a US China trade agreement  The US and China are also considering  visitation exchange  as part of trade talks  
Elsewhere  the White House announced that the USTR Lighthizer and the US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin will travel to Beijing on April 30 to continue trade talks  11th round   As usual  China s team will be led by Vice Premier Liu He  Liu is expected to fly to Washington again on May 8 for additional discussions  12th round  
In the WH statement  it s noted that  the subjects of next week s discussions will cover trade issues including intellectual property  forced technology transfer  non tariff barriers  agriculture  services  purchases  and enforcement  
On Iran  Kudlow said   The US decision to end Iran oil waivers won t boost oil prices as markets are well supplied   On Fed  Kudlow said   The Fed target rate should be lower  
Meanwhile  ahead of the BOJ policy meeting on Thursday  25th April   Maeda  the BOJ Executive Director of International Affairs  reiterated on Monday that the BOJ stands ready to ease monetary policy further if needed  
Maeda said   if the economy s momentum for achieving our price target is threatened  we are ready to ease monetary policy as necessary  And  we ll continue to take steps as needed  including a combination of them  with an eye on their effects and side effects on the financial system  
Elsewhere  the Japanese Finance Minister Aso said  There is no plan for the government to test a heterodox modern monetary theory  That is  countries issuing their own currencies can never run out of money    QQE as 24 7 money printing machine 
The market is expecting another dovish hold from BOJ tomorrow  25th April  and this huge monetary policy divergence between the Fed and the BOJ is supporting the USDJPY  The Fed is now talking less dovish even after its patience and flexibility  after 3 years of tightening cycle and 9 hikes from 0 25  to 2 50  and QT   But the BOJ is still busy with jawboning and QQE 
As a result of BOJ s ultra loose monetary policy and YCC  almost zero 10YJGB yield  for decades even well after the 2008 GFC  Japan s banks   financials are suffering from muted growth  also negative for the Japanese wage growth and Japanese consumption and economic growth  The same is true for the ECB EU to some extent  Japan and the EU are now too much dependent on U S  and Chinese consumption due to their slowing domestic economy consumption  This is a great leverage for Trump in his trade war agenda to make  America great again  
Technical view  USDJPY
Technically  whatever may be the narrative  USDJPY now has to sustain over 112 15 for a further rally to 112 50 112 95  113 50 114 00 and 114 55  114 75 115 50 116 10 in the near term  under bullish case scenario  
On the flip side  sustaining below 111 90  USDJPY may fall to 111 50 111 00 110 80  110 40 and 110 00 109 70  109 00 108 50 in the near term  under bear case scenario

1  Big Day for Dow Earnings
Earnings come fast and furious before the bell tomorrow  including from a number of Dow components that will grab the headlines 
3M  NYSE MMM    Caterpillar   NYSE CAT   United Technologies  NYSE UTX   Verizon  NYSE VZ  and McDonald s  NYSE MCD  will all weigh in ahead of trading 
Along with the obvious beat or miss on earnings and revenue  3M and Caterpillar results will be examined to see any impact from President Donald Trump s trade battles  especially with China

 United Tech  will be talking more about its acquisition of Rockwell Collins  NYSE COL  
And of special interest in McDonald s results will be any information on delivery and automated ordering  which has become part of the fast food landscape revolution 
2  Two Trump Tied Names Also Report
Other companies of note reporting before the bell are  Lockheed Martin   NYSE LMT   Harley Davidson  NYSE HOG  and JetBlue  NASDAQ JBLU  
Politics come into play in the first of those names 
Analysts on the call will likely ask Lockheed what impact a further deterioration in U S Saudi relations would have on the company and how much it is relying on an arms deal Trump has touted as essential to provide U S  jobs 
Harley Davidson was  at one point  the face of the Trump trade wars and it will be interesting to see if tariffs are still hurting its business and if being decried by the president has had a big impact or was just quarterly noise in the end 
JetBlue will give further insight into how much higher fuel costs hit the airline industry as a whole 
3  Oil Prices Could Hinge on Turkey PM Speech
Oil prices were little changed today  but that may be the calm before the storm 
Crude could move sharply if  as expected  Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan gives a speech about the death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi that implicates Saudi Arabia in a premeditated plot 
Erdogan has promised the  naked truth  in his speech to parliament 
That could rock Western and Saudi relations and lead to speculation of a loss of power by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman  This  in turn  could lead to bets that Saudi Arabia will disrupt crude production to use as leverage against any moves against it  like sanctions  despite its assurances to the contrary 
Trump said Monday that he is  not satisfied  with the current Saudi explanation of Khashoggi s death ",2018-10-22,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/day-ahead-top-3-things-to-watch-1654286,1654286

133925,355440,LMT,German halt to Saudi arms sales could put squeeze on Eurofighter,news,By Andrea Shalal and Sabine Siebold BERLIN  Reuters    Germany s hardline halt to arms sales to Saudi Arabia over the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi may jeopardize a big UK led Eurofighter order from Riyadh and could hit jobs at a shipyard in struggling northeastern Germany  German Chancellor Angela Merkel has been more outspoken than fellow major arms exporters the United States  Britain and France about stopping sales to Saudi Arabia until Khashoggi s case is cleared up  a stance that a senior conservative ally said could also affect previously approved orders  Berlin is now reviewing all Saudi sales  including contracts approved in September for more patrol boats built by privately held Luerrsen and four Cobra counter battery radar systems built by a consortium that includes France s Thales  Airbus and the U S  defense company  Lockheed Martin   NYSE LMT   German authorities approved more than 400 million euros worth of Saudi arms supply contracts in the first nine months of 2018  but have not specified the value of equipment not yet delivered  Germany accounts for just under 2 percent of total Saudi arms imports  a small percentage internationally compared with the United States and Britain   but  crucially  also makes components for other countries  export contracts  The biggest impact may be on a 10 billion pound   12 99 billion  agreement by Saudi Arabia to buy 48 new Eurofighter Typhoon fighter jets from Britain  given that a third of their components would come from Germany  industry sources said  The deal  nailed down in a memorandum of understanding in March  has not been finalised yet  and is not reflected in BAE Systems  LON BAES  Plc s 2018 financial statements  BAE declined to comment on the issue  as did officials from the German based Eurofighter consortium  Britain s Foreign Office had no immediate comment  Nearly four years in the making  the Saudi Eurofighter order would secure thousands of jobs at BAE  and help extend production of the European warplanes until a next generation fighter jet to be designed in coming years goes into production  Saudi Arabia is also one of the few remaining export markets for the Eurofighter  given the warplane program s losses to the Lockheed F 35 fighter jet in other tenders  including a decision expected soon from Belgium   PATROL BOATS UNDER CONSTRUCTION Of more immediate concern are three patrol boats currently under construction at the Luerrsen shipyard in Wolgast  in the financially strapped northeastern German state of Mecklenburg Vorpommern  It employs 300 people  Stern magazine reported  Of 33 boats ordered in total  16 must still be approved  it said  Luerssen declined to comment on the Saudi work  but said it would respect any political decision on the fate of the boats while underscoring the importance of the orders for the yard  Germany has taken a far tougher approach on arms sales to Riyadh following Khashoggi s killing inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul  which has stirred international outrage  than major allies such as the United States  France and Britain  U S  President Donald Trump has voiced concern that shelving arms sales to Riyadh could push Saudi Arabia  its key Arab ally against Iran  to place orders with Russia and China  Tim Stuchtey  executive director of the Brandenburg Institute for Society and Security  BIGS   said Germany faced a tough dilemma   whether to follow its moral instincts or pursue a realpolitik led agenda of arms sales out of economic interest  Merkel is guided in part by the March 2018 governing accord with her coalition partners  the left leaning Social Democrats  who insisted on language that bans arms sales to any parties to the devastating war in Yemen   where Saudi led Arab forces intervened in 2015   except for certain previously approved items and those that will remain in the purchasing country  Divergent views in Europe on the issue also underscore the challenges facing an ambitious Franco German program to develop a future fighter jet  he said   As long as we don t have unified European rules for arms exports  we will always have this problem  It will be difficult to square French and British attitudes about arms exports with German moral imperatives   PRICE OF FOREIGN POLICY  If Berlin does halt work on approved orders for the Saudi patrol boats  it may have to compensate the shipyard  which invested heavily to be able to execute the work  said Jan Techau  a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund think tank   Ultimately  the question is  how much is a principled foreign policy worth   he said   If the shipyard in Wolgast suffers damage due to a policy shift  it may cost money  That s the decision they ll have to make   Arising in part from its Nazi past  Germany s cautious approach to weapons sales  and past moves to slow down approvals for exports  have raised eyebrows in other European countries  It has already prompted France to market certain weapons as  100 percent French    not subject to disruption by suppliers in other countries  according to one executive  Norbert Roettgen  who chairs the German s parliament s foreign affairs committee  told broadcaster ZDF on Monday that Germany s credibility was at stake if it did not halt all arms deliveries to Saudi Arabia until the ultimate responsibility for Khashoggi s killing is established  or serious consequences were seen in Saudi Arabia  But industry experts say blocking work on contracts vital to its partners also raises questions about Germany s viability and reliability as a partner for future projects   It s clear   Techau said   that global supply chains require agreements among partners  and that coordinated positions are needed on a European level  but that is not yet the case today

133951,355466,LMT,For All Trump s Talk  the Saudis Don t Buy That Much Stuff From the U S ,news," Bloomberg     Listening to President Donald Trump  you d think the U S  economy has a huge amount riding on continued weapons sales to Saudi Arabia 
Arguing against a rush to judgment in the case of Jamal Khashoggi  the Washington based journalist allegedly murdered by a Saudi hit team  Trump has repeatedly cited the importance of that trade    and rejected growing calls in Congress to cut it off   That would be hurting us   the president said last week   We have jobs  we have a lot of things happening in this country  
Trump likes to tout what he describes as  110 billion in arms deals signed during his visit to Riyadh last year  The figure is inflated  according to Bruce Riedel at the Brookings Institution  who analyzed Trump s claim and found the headline number to be a mishmash of previously signed agreements and vague wishlists  Still  it s true that Saudi Arabia is a big military spender and one of the best customers for the U S  arms industry  And its purchases from companies like  Lockheed Martin  Corp  NYSE LMT   do generate American jobs 
But that s the case for all exports of everything to everywhere  And in the aggregate  planes and tanks included  the Saudis just don t buy that much stuff from America 
It s clear from a comparison with the closest economy in size to Saudi Arabia s    which happens to be Switzerland  about as different from the desert kingdom as could be  snowy  hyper democratic  and famous for staying above the geopolitical fray 
The Swiss consistently buy more U S  goods than the Saudis  and the gap has been widening in the past two years as exports to Saudi Arabia declined 
Of course  Trump is probably hoping that those Saudi numbers can be made to spike higher    especially if American pressure is applied over Khashoggi  Even before the journalist s disappearance  Trump was complaining that actual Saudi purchases fell short of promised ones 
And Saudi Arabia s strategic importance for the U S  goes far beyond the quantity of American weapons it buys  It s the chief supplier of oil to the global economy and sits in the heart of the world s most combustible region  where it s aligned with America against rivals led by Iran 
Still  in strictly economic terms the impact of an arms embargo would be limited  Who thinks the U S  would suffer much if for some reason it called off sales of precious metals and stones to Switzerland  which last year were multiples larger than the weapons trade with the Saudis ",2018-10-18,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/for-all-trumps-talk-the-saudis-dontbuy-that-much-stuff-from-the-us-1650408,1650408

133954,355469,LMT,Lockheed Martin  LMT  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"The market expects Lockheed Martin  LMT  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 23  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This aerospace and defense company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  4 29 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  6 7  
Revenues are expected to be  12 65 billion  up 8 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 04  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Lockheed 
For Lockheed  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  4 16  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Lockheed will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Lockheed would post earnings of  4 39 per share when it actually produced earnings of  4 39  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Lockheed appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/lockheed-martin-lmt-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200407242,200407242

biggest military exercise since 2002  For two weeks from Oct  25  40 000 troops from 30 countries will conduct air  sea and land operations from Finland and the Baltic Sea in the east  to Iceland in the west  A command post exercise    involving commanders and their staffs at headquarters    will then be held from Nov  14 23  Oslo has also persuaded Washington to more than double the number of U S  Marines present in Norway  Hundreds will from next year be sent to Troms  an Arctic region closer to Russia than the Marines  current base in central Norway    We see that there is no reason to believe that potential tension could start in the Arctic  but it could easily end up here if it starts elsewhere   Norwegian Foreign Minister Ine Eriksen Soereide told Reuters   And that is of course due to Russia building up their military capacity  especially on the Kola Peninsula   she said in Ny Aalesund  a research station on Svalbard that is the world s northernmost permanent settlement  Norway has a 196 km  122 mile  land border with Russia and Russia s Northern Fleet has its main base in Severomorsk  about 100 km from the border with Norway on the Kola Peninsula  a region dotted with naval bases and restricted military zones  NATO fears Russia s military build up in the Arctic  under way in the Arctic since 2008 and involving the creation and reopening of six military bases  could reduce the alliance s freedom of navigation  Russia  which staged its largest military maneuvers since the Cold War in eastern Siberia in September  has also shown signs of concern about the military situation in Norway  It sees the plan to send more U S  Marines there as an unfriendly act which could have  consequences    This makes Norway less predictable and could cause growing tensions  triggering an arms race and destabilizing the situation in northern Europe   the Russian Embassy said in a statement on its Facebook  NASDAQ FB  page in June  RUSSIAN INTERESTS Norway has meanwhile been boosting economic activity on Svalbard  which is in the Arctic Ocean midway between continental Norway and the North Pole   Svalbard s traditional industry  coal mining  is not profitable so Oslo has increased tourism  scientific research and fisheries there   Russia also has an interest in Svalbard  Under the 1920 treaty that gives Norway sovereignty over the archipelago  citizens of all signatories to the treaty can settle there without a Norwegian visa  This includes Russia  There are 467 Russians registered as living on Svalbard and a Russian coal mining company has for decades operated in the town of Barentsburg  Another Russian settlement  Pyramiden  is now abandoned but is on the tourist trail as a Soviet ghost town  Svalbard has moved up NATO s agenda because of Russia s annexation of the Crimea peninsula from Ukraine in 2014 and Moscow s frequent naval exercises in the Arctic   Norway  which was a founding member of NATO but is not a member of the European Union  has been beefing up its forces because of the Russian military buildup   It has ordered 52 F 35 fighter jets from  Lockheed Martin   NYSE LMT   is rebuilding infrastructure to support them and is ordering four new submarines from Germany s ThyssenKrupp  It is also building up a cavalry battalion in a military base in the Finnmark region bordering Russia  Russian President Vladimir Putin has said Moscow will not threaten anyone from the Arctic but that it is taking measures to guarantee its security   The modernization of the Northern Fleet includes the addition of 23 new vessels including two nuclear submarines  the Russian defense ministry website quoted Valery Gerasimov  chief of the general staff of Russia s armed forces  as saying  Gerasimov said Russia had  restored its presence in the strategic regions of the Arctic Ocean and ensured security of its economic activity    By the end of this year  the Northern Fleet is set to receive weapons and equipment including five military ships  15 planes and 62 radar facilities and air defense complexes  Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu was quoted as saying in August by Russian Zvezda TV channel  In addition  coastal defense troops are supplied with three  Bal  and  Bastion  missiles divisions  New military airdromes are being built and others are being modernized by Russia  The Russian Foreign Ministry did not respond to requests for comment   U S  WANTS TO  UP ITS GAME  The U S  military has also attached increasing importance to the Arctic  especially as global warming opens up new sea lanes and oil and mineral reserves   Certainly America s got to up its game in the Arctic  There s no doubt about that   U S  Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said this year   Mattis visited Norway in July for talks with Soereide and Defence Minister Frank Bakke Jensen  The deployment of additional Marines was confirmed the following month   Oslo and Moscow concluded a deal in 2010 to end a dispute over their maritime border  enabling oil and gas exploration and allowing for visa free travel permits for residents of the border areas  But since Russia s annexation of Crimea  Norwegian military and government officials have increasingly voiced concern  including about Russia simulating bombing raids on Norwegian targets and adopting quieter submarines that are harder to detect  Norway is also worried Russia would be able to block NATO troop movements or reinforcements by taking control of the so called GIUK gap    an area in the northern Atlantic Ocean between Greenland  Iceland and Britain  Speaking in August on the arrival of German troops  tanks and equipment for the Trident Juncture maneuvers  Frank Bakke Jensen said the global and regional security environment had fundamentally changed

Headquartered in Bethesda  Lockheed Martin  LMT  is an Aerospace stock that has seen a price change of 16 25  so far this year  Currently paying a dividend of  2 2 per share  the company has a dividend yield of 2 89   In comparison  the Aerospace   Defense industry s yield is 0 96   while the S P 500 s yield is 1 96  
Looking at dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  8 80 is up 7 3  from last year  In the past five year period  Lockheed Martin has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 10 57   Looking ahead  future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Lockheed s current payout ratio is 49   meaning it paid out 49  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
LMT is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  19 46 per share  representing a year over year earnings growth rate of 10 63  
Bottom Line
From greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages  investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  But  not every company offers a quarterly payout 
High growth firms or tech start ups  for example  rarely provide their shareholders a dividend  while larger  more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  During periods of rising interest rates  income investors must be mindful that high yielding stocks tend to struggle  With that in mind  LMT is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-03-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/lockheed-martin-lmt-is-a-top-dividend-stock-right-now-should-you-buy-200396833,200396833

134014,355529,LMT,Ottobock reaches for growth with industrial exoskeletons,news,"By Caroline Copley BERLIN  Reuters    German artificial limb manufacturer Ottobock  plans to start selling a mechanical exoskeleton that makes manual labor for factory workers easier this week  joining a field already crowded with major industrial players and start ups  The 99 year old firm  which started out making prosthetics for World War One veterans  is seeking to tap new growth opportunities ahead of a possible stock market listing  The family owned company has tested the  Paexo   a wearable upper body exoskeleton designed to ease the physical strain of repetitive overhead assembly work  on 30 workers at a Volkswagen  DE VOWG p  plant in Bratislava  After 80 percent of workers said they would recommend it to colleagues  Ottobock is talking to Volkswagen about using the Paexo in series production  said Soenke Roessing  head of Ottobock s Industrials unit  VW said it was in final consultations about rolling out the exoskeleton in series production  Exoskeletons were developed for medical and military use  But as workers age  sales of exoskeletons for industry are forecast to rise to  1 76 billion in 2028 from  67 29 million this year  according Rian Whitton  an analyst at technology market intelligence firm ABI Research  This corresponds to more than 126 000 units in 2028  against around 3 900 this year  as companies seek to make workers more productive and protect them from injury  Ottobock plans to launch the Paexo on Thursday  Beyond the automotive sector  it is targeting the aerospace  shipping and construction industries as well as tradespeople  and is running pilots at over 20 sites in Europe  Roessing said  Hans Georg Naeder  grandson of Ottobock s founder  sold a 20 percent stake to Swedish private equity firm EQT last year aiming to increase the company s value ahead of a possible IPO  Since then  Ottobock  which had sales of 927 4 million euros   1 08 billion  in 2017  has revamped its management with Naeder appointing Oliver Scheel as CEO  the first non family member to run the company   Ottobock began by developing exoskeletons to help people with partial paralysis or spinal injury walk again  Its move into industry is part of a broader bet on bionics   using mechanics to augment human strength  It will not be alone  A host of new start ups  including Dutch firm Laevo and California s SuitX  are racing more established players in the defense and engineering space  such as  Lockheed Martin   N LMT  and Panasonic  T 6752   Ottobock s closest competitor  Iceland s Ossur  CO OSSR   has teamed up with  Fiat  Chrysler s  MI FCHA  robotics specialist Comau and plans to launch an upper body exoskeleton in December  Other car companies are testing the technology too   Ford Motor Co   N F  started testing upper body skeletons developed by Ekso Bionics Holdings  O EKSO  at two U S  factories last year  Meanwhile workers at BMW s  DE BMWG  Spartanburg factory in the United States have trialed an exoskeleton vest from Levitate Technologies  Audi  DE NSUG  is rolling out a  Chairless Chair  exoskeleton made by Swiss start up Noonee that allows workers to sit instead of standing at its Ingolstadt factory  It has also tested upper body exoskeletons from Laevo and is planning a comparative study with Ottobock s Paexo and Levitate s Airframe later this year  HUMAN ROBOT COLLABORATION Patrick Schwarzkopf  managing director of the VDMA Robotics   Automation Association  said the scramble to develop exoskeletons underscored a trend towards closer interaction between humans and machines in factories   An exoskeleton is probably the most intense form of human robot collaboration  In a way  your arm becomes a robot arm because it has reinforced strength   he said  Schwarzkopf sees exoskeletons competing with inexpensive collaborative robots  or  cobots   which can work alongside humans  for example placing a tyre on a vehicle while leaving the worker to screw it into place  A cobot can cost as little as  10 000  although they typically cost two to three times that  Ottobock s Paexo is priced at 5 000 euros  The Paexo is a  passive  exoskeleton that works by transferring the weight of the raised arms to the hips through a mechanical cable technology that takes the stress off a worker s shoulders  The backpack weighs 1 9 kilograms and gives the user s arms a feeling of weightlessness akin to floating in a swimming pool  Roessing said the Paexo was the lightest of its kind and can be worn for eight hour shifts  allowing workers to hold heavy tools or screw in parts overhead without strain  To make his point  he wore the Paexo throughout an interview with Reuters  Juergen Klippert  an expert on the future of work at the IG Metall union  said exoskeletons ostensibly provided relief  But it was unclear whether a worker s joints would be burdened by holding heavy tools for prolonged periods  Ottobock plans to make its exoskeletons  intelligent  by adding sensors to help workers correct their posture and tell them what part to place where in the assembly process  Prototypes to support the back and hand are also in development  After colleagues kept asking to borrow the  Paexo  for the weekend to do home renovations  Roessing now wants to launch a simplified version for the price of a good power tool

134040,355555,LMT,Japan picks  1 2 billion Lockheed radar for Aegis Ashore batteries,news,"TOKYO  Reuters    Japan said on Monday it had picked  Lockheed Martin  Corp  NYSE LMT  to build a powerful new  1 2 billion radar for two ground based Aegis ballistic missile defense stations meant to guard against North Korean missile strikes 
 By using this new radar we will increase our ability to cope with missiles on lofted trajectories raising the level of ballistic missile defense   Japanese Minister of Defence Itsunori Onodera told reporters 
The decision is the latest sign that Japan is forging ahead with plans to reinforce its defenses despite a North Korean pledge to denuclearize  The purchase could also help Tokyo ease trade friction with Washington as its key ally threatens to impose tariffs on Japanese auto imports 
The two radars will cost around 130 billion yen   1 17 billion  each  with maintenance and other operational costs putting the estimated budget at the two sites over 30 years at 466 billion yen  according to a Ministry of Defence news release 
Other outlays  including for missile launchers  interceptors  buildings and defenses for the two sites  will add to the final tally 
The radar decision means Aegis Ashore can be added to a defense budget proposal slated for release next month ahead of any meeting between Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and U S  President Donald Trump in September  when Abe is expected to attend the United Nations in New York 
Trump has cranked up pressure on Tokyo with tariffs on steel and threats of levies on car imports  although during a visit to Tokyo in November he welcomed Japan s procurement of Lockheed Martin F 35 stealth fighters and urged Japan to buy more U S  weapons and  billions and billions of dollars of additional products of all kinds  
The Aegis Ashore radar choice was between Raytheon Co s Spy 6 radar  designed to upgrade the U S  Navy s fleet of Aegis warships  and a version of Lockheed Martin Corp s Long Range Discrimination Radar  which will be deployed in the Ground Based Midcourse Defense anti ballistic missile system in Alaska around 2020 
Both radars have far greater ranges than current Aegis radars operated by Japan or the U S

134059,355574,LMT,This Is Why Lockheed Martin  LMT  Is A Great Dividend Stock,opinion,"Getting big returns from financial portfolios  whether through stocks  bonds  ETFs  other securities  or a combination of all  is an investor s dream  But for income investors  generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus 
While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments  income investors hone in on dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
Lockheed Martin in Focus
Based in Bethesda  Lockheed Martin  LMT  is in the Aerospace sector  and so far this year  shares have seen a price change of 11 54   The aerospace and defense company is paying out a dividend of  2 2 per share at the moment  with a dividend yield of 3 01  compared to the Aerospace   Defense industry s yield of 1 04  and the S P 500 s yield of 1 98  
Looking at dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  8 80 is up 7 3  from last year  Over the last 5 years  Lockheed Martin has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 10 57   Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company s payout ratio  a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Right now  Lockheed s payout ratio is 45   which means it paid out 45  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
Earnings growth looks solid for LMT for this fiscal year  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  19 49 per share  with earnings expected to increase 10 80  from the year ago period 
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for many reasons  they greatly improve stock investing profits  decrease overall portfolio risk  and carry tax advantages  among others  But  not every company offers a quarterly payout 
High growth firms or tech start ups  for example  rarely provide their shareholders a dividend  while larger  more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  LMT is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-01-29,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/this-is-why-lockheed-martin-lmt-is-a-great-dividend-stock-200381153,200381153

134079,355594,LMT,Lockheed Martin  LMT  Q4 Earnings Meet Estimates,opinion,"Lockheed Martin  LMT  came out with quarterly earnings of  4 39 per share  in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  This compares to earnings of  4 30 per share a year ago  These figures are adjusted for non recurring items 
A quarter ago  it was expected that this aerospace and defense company would post earnings of  4 32 per share when it actually produced earnings of  5 14  delivering a surprise of 18 98  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times 
Lockheed  which belongs to the Zacks Aerospace   Defense industry  posted revenues of  14 41 billion for the quarter ended December 2018  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 26   This compares to year ago revenues of  15 14 billion  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Lockheed shares have added about 9 9  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 5 5  
What s Next for Lockheed 
While Lockheed has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Lockheed was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

134104,355619,LMT,Why Lockheed  LMT  Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well positioned to maintain its earnings beat streak in its upcoming report  It is worth considering Lockheed Martin  LMT   which belongs to the Zacks Aerospace   Defense industry 
This aerospace and defense company has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 14 89  
For the most recent quarter  Lockheed was expected to post earnings of  4 32 per share  but it reported  5 14 per share instead  representing a surprise of 18 98   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  3 89 per share  while it actually produced  4 31 per share  a surprise of 10 80  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Lockheed lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Lockheed currently has an Earnings ESP of  6 72   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on January 29  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-01-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-lockheed-lmt-could-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200378495,200378495
134112,355627,LMT,Japan Snubs Homegrown Weaponry to Buy From the U S ,news," Bloomberg     While there s little prospect that Japanese consumers will ever buy enough American cars to please Donald Trump  the Abe government s record spending on defense is shaping up as a bright spot in bilateral trade for the U S  president 
Japan s purchases through the U S  Foreign Military Sales program represent 16 percent of all non personnel costs for the nation s self defense forces so far this year  more than double the level in 2014  according to calculations by Bloomberg based on government data 
Plans to buy advanced American radars  stealth fighter jets and missile defense systems in coming years will mean billions of dollars for U S  weapons makers  Japanese companies  already struggling to compete  don t stand to benefit as much because economies of scale have made homegrown technology more expensive and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe s government wants to get more bang for its buck 
During a visit to Tokyo last November  Trump urged Abe to buy  massive amounts of military equipment  from the U S  Even without the incentive to ease trade friction  Japan was already an enthusiastic consumer as Abe pushed defense spending to a record 5 2 trillion yen   47 billion  this fiscal year to counter both a nuclear armed North Korea and a more assertive China 
To Trump s dismay  Japan bought just  533 million in new passenger vehicles from the U S  in 2017 while Americans purchased  39 8 billion in Japanese cars and trucks  Outside the military sphere  Japan has looked to boost energy purchases such as liquefied natural gas to placate the U S  The nation s biggest imports from the U S  in 2017 were agricultural products  chemicals and machinery 
Local Jobs
A preference for U S  equipment helps the two militaries work together more smoothly  but buying complete American weapons systems doesn t generate jobs for local parts makers and will drive them out of business  according to Naohiko Abe  senior vice president of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd  It s Japan s biggest defense contractor  making fighter planes  helicopters  ships  missiles  and other weapons 
While there is little threat to domestic production of warships  costs are an issue especially for aircraft 
A finance ministry committee has recommended switching to the  Lockheed Martin  Corp  NYSE LMT   made C 130 J30 cargo plane  which although slower and with a shorter range  costs less than half the cost of the domestically produced C 2  Japan will buy two C 2s from Kawasaki Heavy Industries this fiscal year  after buying three last year 
F 35A Fighters
Japan is currently purchasing new F 35A fighters to replace decades old planes  The next battleground for domestic manufacturers will be who makes the fighter jet to replace the F 2  which is the last domestically produced fighter 
Even before new F 2 production ended in 2011  suppliers were fleeing the defense business  Sumitomo Electric Industries started ending its business with the defense ministry in 2007  citing a poor growth outlook  and in 2010  Yokohama Rubber Co  ceased making airplane tires for the ministry  In 2016  52 of 72 companies supplying the industry said they d seen parts makers disappear and supply disruptions  according to a ministry survey 
The F 2 will start to retire from 2030  and companies including Mitsubishi Heavy and IHI Corp  developed the X 2  an advanced technology demonstrator jet  to show that a replacement fighter could be built domestically   Japan must take the lead of development in order for the domestic industry to survive   Mitsubishi Heavy s Abe told the media last month 
The successful 2016 test flight of the jet showed that the domestic industry is fully capable of developing the replacement  he said  But the local Jiji Press reported in March that the defense ministry had ruled out a domestically produced jet  citing high costs 
While Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera has denied those media reports  the ministry is looking to develop the plane jointly with overseas companies  Reuters recently reported that it issued requests for information to manufacturers in the U S  and Europe 
Some ruling Liberal Democratic Party lawmakers want defense spending to support domestic companies  Kenji Wakamiya  director of the LDP s national defense division  said in May that it was important to support domestic companies and help them become competitive against foreign competitors 
Military Exports
An LDP committee also recommended June 1 that Abe increase the defense budget further  as it s still less than 1 percent of gross domestic product  well below the 2 percent that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has set for its members 
In order to bring down costs  Wakamiya wants Japan to boost exports of its military equipment so that production will increase  but so far  there s been little success 
On top of cost  strict limits on information disclosure get in the way of making deals  according to Takashi Yoshimura  a director of the industrial technology bureau at Japan s biggest business lobby 
Defense companies  are gritting their teeth and getting on with it out of a sense of mission   he said  adding that  their efforts are reaching the limit  ",2018-07-10,Bloomberg,https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/japan-snubs-homegrown-weaponry-to-buy-from-the-us-1524523,1524523

134128,355643,LMT,Sector ETF Week In Review For January 7 11,opinion,"Summary
All sectors rose this week 
Defensive sectors underperformed on a one month basis 
Although the industrial sector ETF is rising on a relative performance basis  the fundamentals don t support moving into this sector 
Let s start where we always do  performance tables

First of all  everybody rose  the only difference is degree  A more dovish Fed tone hoisted real estate into the top position  But industrials and consumer discretionary were the second and third best performing ETFs  At the bottom of the list are two defensive sectors   utilities and staples  Technology   the largest component sector of both   525 SPY   and QQQ   were up 3 32   
The monthly chart has a very interesting development  the defensive sectors were not only the worst performers  but they also lost money  In contrast  consumer discretionary and basic materials   two early cycle sectors   were up  even if only modestly 

The three month table has a classic defensive orientation to it  However  the under performance of these sectors in the one week and one month time frame could lead to them underperforming in the coming weeks 
Defensive sectors are still leading the market  But all four sectors continue to move lower  healthcare and staples are close to shifting to the weakening sector  Industrials  financials  and basic materials continue to inch closer to leading the market 
Let s turn our attention to the industrial sector  starting with the two month charts 

Most of the charts contain conflicting signals  The 20  and 50 day EMA for all is moving lower  indicating a longer term downtrend  But seven have sharp rallies since the beginning of the year  These moves higher have shifted prices above one or both of the EMAs  which is a bullish development  It s this recent rally that is obviously responsible for the change in XLI s position relative to SPY  NYSE SPY  
But the six month charts are still decidedly bearish  with the shorter term rally occurring within a broader move lower 
That doesn t mean there aren t some compelling opportunities 

Caterpillar  NYSE CAT   United Technologies  NYSE UTX   and Lockheed Martin  NYSE LMT  are fairly cheap from a PE perspective 
On a forward PE basis  there are five potential buys 

On a price earnings growth basis  three are below 1 

Two are yielding over 3   and MMM is at 2 83 
Two names make three appearances in the top three positions of these tables  Lockheed Martin has a low current PE  a very low price growth ratio  and a yield over 3 17   51  payout ratio and 16 years of growth   It s in the defense industry  which was in favor over the last two legislative years  However  the Democrats are now in control of the House  which means defense appropriations might take a modest hit  And the company relies on international sales  which might be caught up in trade issues going forward 
Caterpillar is high up on the PE  forward PE  and PEG list  However  it also has a very strong international presence and so is subject to the trade problems we re currently experiencing  Its product is expensive  which means companies must be willing to commit to longer term payments  One of the company s biggest buyers   China   is currently slowing down  And steel tariffs will put pressure on its margins  Overall  the fundamental backdrop is weak 
Fundamental events explain the recent rise in the industrial sector  Over the last few months  we heard dribs and drabs of good news on the trade front  with China and the US both saying progress is being made  Furthermore  the Fed is now in  pause  mode  further easing pressure on the economy  This ripples through the global economy  as a less aggressive Fed  will lower the dollar  making U S  exports cheaper  It will also ease some pressure on emerging economies that have borrowed in dollars 
However  as I noted in this week s Technically Speaking  European industrial production has taken a sharp hit over the last few months  And according to the latest global PMI  we can probably expect continued subdued performance  emphasis added  

The global manufacturing sector continued to register a subdued performance at the close of 2018  Output growth remained weak  while rates of expansion in new orders and employment both slowed  The trend in international trade flows also remained weak  with new export business declining for the fourth straight month 
The J P  Morgan Global Manufacturing PMI    a composite index1 produced by J P  Morgan and IHS Markit in association with ISM and IFPSM   fell to a 27 month low of 51 5 in December  down from 52 0 in November  The average reading over the fourth quarter  51 8  was the lowest since quarter three of 2016 

What we re witnessing right now is a news based rally  where a headline will spark a short term buying binge  But the underlying fundamentals don t support the idea of moving into this area of the market

134167,355682,LMT,Exclusive  U S  military looking at deploying anti missile system in Germany   sources,news,"By Andrea Shalal BERLIN  Reuters    The U S  military has held preliminary discussions about moving a powerful missile defense system to Germany to boost European defenses  according to two sources familiar with the issue  a move that experts said could trigger fresh tensions with Moscow  The tentative proposal to send the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense  THAAD  system to Europe predates U S  President Donald Trump s decision to withdraw from the 2015 Iran nuclear accord  and comes amid a broader push to strengthen Europe s air and missile defenses  While Europe and the United States are at odds over the fate of the nuclear agreement  they share concerns about Iran s continued development of ballistic missiles  Iran s Shahab 3 missiles can already travel 2 000 km  enough to reach southern Europe  and its Revolutionary Guards have said they will increase the range if threatened since the range is capped by strategic doctrine  not technology constraints  U S  European Command has been pushing for a THAAD system inEurope for years  but the U S  withdrawal from the Iran nuclear accord has added urgency to the issue  said Riki Ellison  head of the non profit Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance  A senior German military official cited the need to add more radars across Europe to better track and monitor potential threats  and cue interceptors if needed  The U S  Defense Dept said no such action had been decided   There are currently no plans to station THAAD systems in Germany  We do not discuss potential future military planning  as we would not want to signal our intent to potential adversaries  Germany remains among our closest partners and strongest allies   said Pentagon spokesman Eric Pahon  Deploying another U S  defensive system to Europe could reassure NATO allies in southern Europe already within striking range of Iran s missiles  said one military official from that region  Talk of deploying a THAAD system in Europe also comes against the backdrop of rising tensions between the West and Russia  NATO has long insisted that its missile defense program is not directed at Russia  but the alliance has adopted a tougher tone toward Moscow in the wake of the poisoning of a Russian former spy in England  Moscow denies any involvement in the poisoning  and blames the tensions on NATO s military expansion eastward  and its assembly of a ballistic missile shield with a key site inRomania that was declared combat ready in 2016  Moving THAAD to Germany could plug a radar gap caused by a two year delay in completion of a second Aegis Ashore missile defense site in Poland that was initially due to open this year  The issue may be raised in a new Pentagon missile defense review expected in early June  The review may draw a closer connection between missile defense and a need to deter Russia that was highlighted in the new U S  national defense strategy  said Tom Karako  senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies  MESSAGE TO EUROPEAN ALLIES One U S  military official said there had been preliminary talks with German military officials on moving a THAAD system to Ramstein Air Base in Germany  headquarters for the U S  Air Force in Europe and NATO Allied Air Command   It would be a further political message to the Europeans that we re serious about protecting our allies   said the official   The initial assessment is that Germany would very likely not have a problem with a THAAD deployment   U S  General Curtis Scaparrotti  head of U S  EuropeanCommand  last week said he was seeking more troops and equipment to deter Russia  but declined further comment  A second source said German officials were open to the move as a way to better protect civilian populations  The German defense ministry is working to rebuild its own short  and medium range missile defenses after years of cuts  Starting later this year  it also plans to review territorial missile defense needs in a conceptual study that will also look at THAAD and the Arrow 3 anti missile system built by Israel and the United States  a spokesman said  The German foreign ministry  which oversees foreign troops stationed in Germany  said it could not confirm sending any signals about a possible THAAD deployment to the United States  Washington does not need Germany s permission to move such equipment under existing basing contracts  but the sources said a formal notification would be sent before any move to proceed

134171,355686,LMT,Senate passes defense bill  battle looms with Trump over China s ZTE,news,By Patricia Zengerle and Mike Stone WASHINGTON  Reuters    The U S  Senate passed a  716 billion defense policy bill on Monday  backing President Donald Trump s call for a bigger  stronger military but setting up a potential battle with the White House over Chinese telecommunications firm ZTE  HK 0763  Corp  SZ 000063   The Republican controlled Senate voted 85 10 for the annual National Defense Authorization Act  or NDAA  which authorizes U S  military spending but is generally used as a vehicle for a broad range of policy matters  Before it can become law  the bill must be reconciled with one already passed by the House of Representatives  That compromise measure must then be passed by both chambers and signed into law by Trump  Considered must pass legislation  the fiscal 2019 Senate version of the NDAA authorizes  639 billion in base defense spending  for such things as buying weapons  ships and aircraft and paying the troops  with an additional  69 billion to fund ongoing conflicts  This year  the Senate included an amendment that would kill the Trump administration s agreement to allow ZTE to resume business with U S  suppliers  one of the few times the Republican led Senate has veered from White House policy  That ZTE provision is not included in the House version of the NDAA  While strongly supported by some of Trump s fellow Republicans as well as some Democrats  the measure is opposed by the White House and some of its close Republican allies  who control the House as well as the Senate  It could face a difficult path to being included in the final NDAA  especially if Trump lobbies the Republican led Congress against it  as he is expected to do  Republicans and Democrats have expressed national security concerns about ZTE after it broke an agreement to discipline executives who had conspired to evade U S  sanctions on Iran and North Korea  The U S  government placed a ban on ZTE earlier this year  but the Trump administration reached an agreement to lift the ban while it is negotiating broader trade agreements with China and looking to Beijing for support during negotiations to halt North Korea s nuclear weapons program  Republicans Tom Cotton and Marco Rubio and Democrats Chuck Schumer and Chris Van Hollen  who led the Senate push for the ZTE provision  said in a joint statement after the vote that they were  heartened  by support  adding   It is vital that our colleagues in the House keep this bipartisan provision in the bill as it heads toward a conference   But the final NDAA could include only a much less stringent provision  included in the House bill  that would bar the Defense Department from dealing with any entity using telecommunications equipment or services from ZTE or another Chinese company  Huawei Technologies Co Ltd   FOREIGN INVESTMENT RULES The Senate version of the NDAA also seeks to strengthen the inter agency Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States  which assesses deals to ensure they do not compromise national security  The bill would allow CFIUS to expand the deals that can be reviewed  for example making reviews of many proposed transactions mandatory instead of voluntary and allowing CFIUS to review land purchases near sensitive military sites  The Senate NDAA also includes an amendment prohibiting sales to Turkey of F 35 Joint Strike Fighter jets made by  Lockheed Martin  Corp  N LMT  unless Trump certifies Turkey is not threatening NATO  purchasing defense equipment from Russia or detaining U S  citizens  Senators included the legislation because of the imprisonment of U S  pastor Andrew Brunson and the purchase of the S 400 air defense system from Russia  The measure also includes an amendment to bar the U S  military from providing aerial refueling support for the Saudi led coalition in Yemen unless Secretary of State Mike Pompeo certifies that Saudi Arabia is taking urgent steps to end the civil war in Yemen  ease the humanitarian crisis there and reduce the risk to civilians   Shipbuilders General Dynamics Corp  N GD  and  Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc   N HII  could benefit from the bill s authorization of advance procurement of materials needed for the Virginia class nuclear submarines ,2018-06-18,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/senate-passes-defense-bill-battle-looms-with-trump-over-chinas-zte-1497647,1497647

134175,355690,LMT,Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day Lockheed Martin  Texas Roadhouse  Gaming And Leisure Properties  Americold Realty Trust And Arbor Realty Trust,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   December 28  2018    Lockheed Martin   NYSE LMT   as the Bull of the Day  Texas Roadhouse   NASDAQ TXRH   asthe Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Gaming and Leisure Properties  Inc    NASDAQ GLPI    Americold Realty Trust   NYSE COLD   and Arbor Realty Trust   NYSE ABR   Here is a synopsis of all five stocks  With equity markets coming on strong after Monday s rough session  there are several names which could be today s Bull of the Day  This one happens to be in the Aerospace   Defense industry which ranks in the Top 37  of our Zacks Industry Rank  I m talking about Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  Lockheed Martin  Lockheed Martin Corporation  a security and aerospace company  engages in the research  design  development  manufacture  integration  and sustainment of technology systems  products  and services worldwide  It operates through four segments  Aeronautics  Missiles and Fire Control  MFC   Rotary and Mission Systems  RMS   and Space The reason for the favorable Zacks Rank lies in the earnings estimates for the current year and next year  Over the course of the last sixty days  analysts have increased their earnings estimates for both these time periods  The bullish sentiment has pushed up our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year from  17 02 to  17 51  Next year s number has gone from  18 97 to  19 49 If you look at the Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise Chart  you can see that there s been divergence between the stock price and the earnings estimates  This divergence could lead to outperformance in Lockheed over the next several months  With price coming down as estimates go up  forward valuations are on the move lower  Currently  Lockheed is trading at 12 92x forward 12 month earnings estimates  Lockheed hasn t traded at a multiple that low since 2012 The 52 week high of  363 is a far cry from the current price of  259 79  The 200 day moving average is all the way up at  317 93  providing plenty of topside resistance should the stock stage a serious rally  Before that  the 50 day moving average is at  296 61  While it may seem tempting to buy everything you can when the market bounces like it has the last couple of days  you have to maintain your discipline  By taking note of the Zacks Rank  you can stop yourself from buying story stocks without the earnings to back it up  Stocks which are Zacks Rank  4  Sell  and Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  often have earnings estimates which are going lower  Today s Bear of the Day is one of those stocks  I m talking about restaurant stock Texas Roadhouse  Texas Roadhouse  Inc   together with its subsidiaries  operates casual dining restaurants in the United States and internationally  The company operates and franchises Texas Roadhouse and Bubba s 33 restaurants  As of October 29  2018  it owned and operated approximately 575 restaurants Texas Roadhouse is in the Restaurant industry which ranks in the Bottom 36  of our Zacks Industry Rank  It s also currently a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   The reason for the unfavorable Zacks Rank lies in the recent negative earnings estimate revisions  Over the last sixty days  ten analysts have dropped their earnings estimates for the current year and next year  The bearish sentiment has cut down the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year from  2 33 to  2 19 while next year s number has come from  2 66 to  2 53  The negative revisions are part of the reason why the stock has come down from over  75 in early September to the  58 73 level it closed at today Additional content 3 Great REITs to Buy Right NowThe stock market s strong run over the past few years brought attention to high flying growth stocks  usually from the technology sector  that were consistently outpacing the market  However  fresh volatility within the last few months has shifted some focus back towards other investment strategies  and now it might be time for investors to check out things like real estate investment trusts  or REITs REITs are companies that own  operate  or finance real estate properties that produce income  such as apartment complexes or retail locations  These companies are heavily regulated and must meet a number of qualifications to be classified as a REIT  but they do offer investors a few distinct advantages First of all  real estate can be a very profitable investment sector when certain economic conditions are present  What s more  REITs must pay at least 90  of their taxable income in dividends to shareholders  so they are a great option for income investors looking for steady payouts The presence of mortgage debt makes this a rate sensitive industry  so investors might not love some REIT choices in this rising rate environment  But many companies offset this through strong funds from operations  FFO  growth or they stick out from the pack with large amounts of their debt already fixed at a low rate Luckily for Zacks readers  the proven Zacks Rank which emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions works with REITs just as it would with any other company  We prefer to use FFO as the metric of profitability here  but the trends work the same otherwise  The strongest REITs are going to be those with improving outlooks and great Zacks Ranks With that said  check out the REITs that our model says are impressive options right now 1  Gaming and Leisure Properties  Inc  Gaming and Leisure Properties is an owner of regional casino properties leased to the likes of Boyd Gaming  Eldorado

134259,355774,LMT,South Korea  India Cut Trade Surpluses With U S  as Trump Rails,news," Bloomberg     As President Donald Trump railed against a growing trade deficit last year  two countries in Asia quietly cut their bilateral surpluses with the U S  It s unclear what they got in return 
India and South Korea were among a handful of nations worldwide that narrowed their trade surpluses with the U S  in 2017 by raising imports of U S  goods  long before Trump announced tariffs aimed at offsetting the U S  deficit and balancing trade with partners 
Shortly after Trump s inauguration in January 2017  South Korea said it would increase imports of U S  energy and high tech machinery  It ended up more than doubling its purchases of U S  semiconductor manufacturing machinery last year to  6 billion  while imports of liquefied natural gas soared to  806 million from only  11 million in 2016  data from the Korea International Trade Association show 
Meanwhile  South Korea s exports of cars and parts to the U S  declined by 6 percent and 16 percent  respectively  in 2017  The result was that South Korea s surplus in goods trade with the U S  tumbled by 23 percent last year from 2016 to  18 billion  according to South Korean data  The Korean numbers differ from U S  figures due to different methods of calculation 
Those efforts didn t stop Trump from insisting on renegotiating their bilateral deal  Trump called the deal unfair  complaining that the U S  deficit with Korea had doubled since it took effect in 2012 
Even after a new one was reached  though  Trump threatened to hold it as a bargaining chip in negotiations with North Korea  However  Seoul was granted an exemption to Trump s steel tariffs 
U S  Hardware
India cut its goods trade surplus with the U S  as well  by 6 1 percent to  22 9 billion  as it took delivery of defense purchases that were part of efforts to diversify its sources of military hardware  More than half of its current inventory is Russian origin equipment 
India s imports of aircraft and parts from the U S  more than doubled in fiscal 2017 to  4 24 billion  India s commerce ministry data show  That included six  Lockheed Martin  Corp  NYSE LMT   s C 130J Hercules military transport planes  according to the state run Press Information Bureau

134297,355812,LMT,China  not North Korea  to dominate Japan military planning,news,"By Tim Kelly and Nobuhiro Kubo TOKYO  Reuters    North Korea s growing missile arsenal might be the most obvious and immediate military threat facing Japan  but defense planners in Tokyo are focused on a much larger and more challenging foe as they prepare for the years ahead  China has stepped up military spending and already dominates the South China Sea  through which Japan s trade with major markets including Europe and the Middle East flows   Now  Japanese military experts are worried Beijing may be on the brink of opening access to the Pacific through a Japanese island chain that has marked the limit of China s military influence for decades  Tokyo sees unfettered passage for Chinese warships and warplanes through the Okinawan island chain as a threat to vital sea lanes  For China that access is part and parcel of becoming a global superpower   Now  we are evenly matched but the reality Japan faces is that it is becoming the underdog   said Nozomu Yoshitomi  a professor at Nihon University in Tokyo who advised Japan s government as a Self Defence Forces military analyst   CHINESE AMBITION In addition to having Asia s second largest military  Japan is also defended by U S  forces that have used the country as their main Asia base since the end of World War Two  Under a security treaty  Washington is obliged to aid Tokyo if its territory is attacked   China has  essentially established de facto control over the South China Sea and the East China Sea is next   said a retired senior U S  military commander on condition he wasn t identified   The United States  for its part  has been in relative retreat in the Western Pacific for a decade   Beijing is ramping up military spending to build a world class fighting force by 2050 with advanced kit  including stealth jets and  according to state run media  a nuclear powered aircraft carrier   In 2018  Beijing plans to spend 1 11 trillion yuan   175 billion  on its armed forces  more than three times as much as Japan  That would also be around a third of what the United States pays for the world s most powerful military  including 30 000 marines in Okinawa and a navy carrier attack group based near Tokyo   The pace of Chinese activity in waters around Japanese territory has expanded and accelerated   Japan s Minister of Defence Itsunori Onodera said this month   China is building the capacity to operate in distant seas and that can be see with China s acquisition of its first carrier and its construction of a second flat top    China says its military is for defensive purposes and its intentions in the region are peaceful  China s Defence Ministry did not respond to a request for comment  HUNKER DOWN Japan s defense outlays for the past five years have risen by just 1 percent a year  It will likely grow at around the same pace over the next five year plan as health and welfare spending on an aging population takes priority  a government defense official said    Finance is our weakness  but our strength is the resilience of our society   said another defense ministry adviser  who also asked not to be identified  If Japan is able to hunker down long enough  he explained  the threat from China should recede as future internal strife  economic woes or other events prompt a retreat   To restrain Beijing in the meantime  Japan needs advanced weaponry and new munitions able to strike targets further away  said the sources with knowledge of the plans   Japan s defense reviews  which will likely be released in December  may propose it establish its first joint command headquarters to coordinate air  ground and naval forces and strengthen cooperation with Washington  the sources said  New equipment may include amphibious ships along with aerial drones to monitor Chinese activity and potentially target missiles in the boost phase of any launch  Japan s military will get new air and ground missiles able to hit shipping and land targets at greater ranges  It will also place fresh orders for  Lockheed Martin  Corp  NYSE LMT  F 35 stealth fighters including vertical take off and landing versions  the sources said   The review will lay out plans to train more Ground Self Defence troops  GSDF  in marine fighting tactics and for their wider deployment to Okinawa  The GSDF s unit there will grow to division strength from a battalion  said former defense minister Gen Nakatani   CHINESE PRESSURE Yet as Tokyo formulates those plans  Beijing is already testing Japanese defenses   In a maneuver in January that Japan protested as a  serious escalation   a Chinese submarine entered waters contiguous to disputed islands in the East China Sea claimed as the Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China   That followed a series of longer range sorties by People s Liberation Army Air Force bombers and fighters  China can  test the readiness and response of Japanese forces  to better understand Japanese defenses  and  over time  to engage in peacetime attrition   said Toshi Yoshihara  a professor and Senior Fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments in Washington   If Chinese operations become routine  they force Japan to accept the PLA s growing presence as a fact of life   Tokyo was especially alarmed in November when six Xian H 6 bombers flew through a 290 km  180 mile  gap in Japan s island chain between Okinawa and Miyakojima  accompanied by an electronic warfare TU 154 and a Y 8 monitoring plane  One senior defense official said the exercise  looked like a practice strike package on Guam   another major U S  military base  China s Defence Ministry did not respond to request for comment on the exercise

134312,355827,LMT,Zacks com Highlights  Lululemon Athletica  Malibu Boats  MCBC Holdings And Lockheed Martin,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   November 5  2018   Stocks in this week s article include  Lululemon Athletica Inc    NASDAQ LULU    Malibu Boats  Inc    NASDAQ MBUU    MCBC Holdings  Inc    NASDAQ MCFT   and Lockheed Martin Corporation   NYSE LMT   Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research 4 Top Efficient Stocks to Buy in NovemberCompanies with favorable efficiency levels are likely to be on investors  radar  irrespective of market conditions  as price performance is believed to be positively correlated with efficiency  Efficiency  a company s ability to transform its inputs into outputs  is a potential indicator of a company s financial health How to Measure Efficiency  We have considered four popular ratios in order to find efficient companies that have the potential to provide impressive returns Inventory TurnoverInventory level is one of the key indicators of a company s business health  While a high inventory level may indicate that the company is going through a rough patch in terms of sales  a dwindling level may indicate that the company will run out of stock in a favorable sales condition  This is where inventory turnover comes into play  It is the ratio of 12 month cost of goods sold  COGS  to a 4 quarter average inventory  Thus  a high value of the ratio indicates a low level of inventory relative to COGS  while a low ratio signals that the company has excess inventory Receivables TurnoverThis ratio is used to measure a company s capability to extend its credit and collect debts on the basis of that credit  Receivables turnover ratio or the  accounts receivable turnover ratio  or the  debtor s turnover ratio  is calculated by dividing 12 month sales by four quarter average receivables  While a high ratio indicates that the company efficiently collects its accounts receivables or has quality customers  a low ratio signals that the company has an inefficient collection procedure or has low quality customers or an inefficient credit policy Asset UtilizationThis is a widely used measure of a company s efficiency  Asset utilization indicates a company s potential to utilize its assets  It is a ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last 4 quarter average of total assets  So  the higher the ratio  the greater is the chance that the company is utilizing its assets efficiently  On the contrary  a low value of the ratio signals that it is failing to use its assets effectively Operating MarginAnother popular efficiency ratio is operating margin  Operating profit margin  which is simply operating income over the past 12 months divided by sales over the same period  indicates how well a company is controlling its operating expenses  If a company has a high operating profit margin in relation to its competitors  it is doing a better job at controlling operating expenses All these ratios can be considered as effective measures if one compares different companies within a particular sector or industry  This is the reason why we have considered only those companies that have higher ratios than their respective industry averages And that s what we re screening for today For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at  Get the remaining stocks on

Prior to today s trading  shares of the aerospace and defense company had lost 14 36  over the past month  This has lagged the Aerospace sector s loss of 10 46  and the S P 500 s loss of 6 76  in that time 
Investors will be hoping for strength from LMT as it approaches its next earnings release  which is expected to be February 4  2019  On that day  LMT is projected to report earnings of  4 34 per share  which would represent year over year growth of 0 93   Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of  13 72 billion  down 9 33  from the year ago period 
For the full year  our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of  17 48 per share and revenue of  53 04 billion  which would represent changes of  31 13  and  3 9   respectively  from the prior year 
Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for LMT  Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near term business trends  As a result  we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company s business outlook 
Based on our research  we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near team stock moves  To benefit from this  we have developed the Zacks Rank  a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system 
Ranging from  1  Strong Buy  to  5  Strong Sell   the Zacks Rank system has a proven  outside audited track record of outperformance  with  1 stocks returning an average of  25  annually since 1988  Within the past 30 days  our consensus EPS projection has moved 2 68  higher  LMT is holding a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy  right now 
In terms of valuation  LMT is currently trading at a Forward P E ratio of 17 12  Its industry sports an average Forward P E of 15 9  so we one might conclude that LMT is trading at a premium comparatively 
It is also worth noting that LMT currently has a PEG ratio of 2 14  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  The Aerospace   Defense was holding an average PEG ratio of 1 43 at yesterday s closing price 
The Aerospace   Defense industry is part of the Aerospace sector  This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 73  putting it in the top 28  of all 250  industries

134352,355867,LMT,4 Top Efficient Stocks To Buy In November,opinion,Companies with favorable efficiency levels are likely to be on investors  radar  irrespective of market conditions  as price performance is believed to be positively correlated with efficiency  Efficiency  a company s ability to transform its inputs into outputs  is a potential indicator of a company s financial health How to Measure Efficiency  We have considered four popular ratios in order to find efficient companies that have the potential to provide impressive returns Inventory TurnoverInventory level is one of the key indicators of a company s business health  While a high inventory level may indicate that the company is going through a rough patch in terms of sales  a dwindling level may indicate that the company will run out of stock in a favorable sales condition  This is where inventory turnover comes into play  It is the ratio of 12 month cost of goods sold  COGS  to a 4 quarter average inventory  Thus  a high value of the ratio indicates a low level of inventory relative to COGS  while a low ratio signals that the company has excess inventory Receivables TurnoverThis ratio is used to measure a company s capability to extend its credit and collect debts on the basis of that credit  Receivables turnover ratio or the  accounts receivable turnover ratio  or the  debtor s turnover ratio  is calculated by dividing 12 month sales by four quarter average receivables  While a high ratio indicates that the company efficiently collects its accounts receivables or has quality customers  a low ratio signals that the company has an inefficient collection procedure or has low quality customers or an inefficient credit policy Asset UtilizationThis is a widely used measure of a company s efficiency  Asset utilization indicates a company s potential to utilize its assets  It is a ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last 4 quarter average of total assets  So  the higher the ratio  the greater is the chance that the company is utilizing its assets efficiently  On the contrary  a low value of the ratio signals that it is failing to use its assets effectively Operating MarginAnother popular efficiency ratio is operating margin  Operating profit margin  which is simply operating income over the past 12 months divided by sales over the same period  indicates how well a company is controlling its operating expenses  If a company has a high operating profit margin in relation to its competitors  it is doing a better job at controlling operating expenses All these ratios can be considered as effective measures if one compares different companies within a particular sector or industry  This is the reason why we have considered only those companies that have higher ratios than their respective industry averages Screening ParametersIn addition to the above mentioned ratios  we have added a favorable Zacks Rank   Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy    to the screen with an objective to make this strategy more profitable Inventory Turnover  Receivables Turnover  Asset Utilization and Operating Margin greater than industry average  Values of these ratios higher than industry averages may indicate that the efficiency level of the company is higher than its peers      Zacks Rank better than or equal to  2  Buy  Only Zacks Rank  1 and 2 stocks can get through  The use of these few criteria has narrowed down the universe of over 7 904 stocks to only 26  Here are four of the 26 stocks that passed the screen Lululemon Athletica Inc    NASDAQ LULU

134378,355893,LMT,Exclusive  Japan to buy at least 20 more F 35A stealth fighters   sources,news,"By Tim Kelly and Nobuhiro Kubo TOKYO  Reuters    Japan plans to buy at least 20 additional F 35A stealth fighters over the next six years  some or all of which it may purchase directly from  Lockheed Martin  Corp  N LMT  in the United States rather than assemble locally  three sources said   In view of budgets and production schedules a new acquisition of around 25 planes is appropriate   said one of the sources with knowledge of the plan  The sources asked not to be identified because they are not authorized to speak to the media   The sources said buying complete aircraft from the United States  at about  100 million each  will save Japan about  30 million per airframe   The purchase will add to an earlier order for 42 of the fighters  most of which are being constructed at a  final assembly and check out  plant in Japan operated by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries  T 7011   the country s leading defense contractor   That plant is one of only two such factories outside the United States  The other  in Italy  is operated by Leonardo Spa  MI LDOF   As China fields ever more advanced aircraft  including stealth planes  and as North Korea pushes ahead with its nuclear weapon and ballistic missile programs  adding F 35s will further increase Japan s reliance on U S  military technology to give it an edge over potential foes in East Asia   Japanese military planners are also considering buying F 35Bs  the vertical takeoff and landing  VTOL  version of the aircraft  Those models can operate from small islands skirting the East China Sea or from ships such as the Izumo class helicopter carriers    We have not yet made any plan and we are evaluating what fighter aircraft we need   Itsunori Onodera said at a news briefing on Tuesday when asked whether Japan planned to buy more F 35s  Onodera s ministry will release two defense reviews by the end of the year that will outline Japan s security goals and military procurement plans for the five years beginning in April 2019  The first of the 42 F 35As ordered by Japan s Air Self Defence Force  ASDF  are being deployed to Misawa Air Base in northern Japan  Japanese government officials and Lockheed Martin executives are set to attend a ceremony there on Saturday to mark the entry of the first Japanese F 35 into service  The F 35 accounts for about a quarter of Lockheed Martin s total revenue  The company is hiring 1 800 workers for its Fort Worth  Texas  factory to build a fleet that is expected to grow to more than 3 000 jets worldwide  Lockheed Martin is scheduled to nearly triple annual production to more than 160 jets by 2023  The first Japanese F 35s will replace aging F 4 Phantom fighters that date back to 1960s  The next batch will allow Japan to retire some of the aging 200 F 15s flown by the ASDF that are the main interceptor workhorse of the nation s air defenses

134379,355894,LMT,China s military flexes muscles for domestic objective  more funding,news,"By Ben Blanchard and Michael Martina BEIJING  Reuters    With stealth jets entering service  leaked pictures of new high tech naval artillery and proud reports of maneuvers that  dare to shine the sword   China s armed forces are putting on a show of power as they lobby for greater defense spending  Although it is the world s largest military  the People s Liberation Army has been privately unhappy that it got less than double digit funding increases the past two years  It has recently been making the case that it needs more money to deal with increased global uncertainty  diplomats and several sources with ties to the armed forces say  In the run up to the defense budget s release at the annual meeting of China s parliament next week  state media outlets have been filled with coverage of military drills  advanced new equipment and thrilling tales of derring do in a new film very loosely based on China s evacuating people from Yemen s civil war in 2015  The overall message is clear  China faces serious challenges  from U S  President Donald Trump s threats of force against nuclear armed North Korea to an increasingly tense border dispute with India and what Beijing sees as efforts by self ruled Taiwan to assert its sovereignty  Confronting those challenges requires cash  a point the military is now trying to drive home   If you keep telling your people China is facing all these threats  you have to be able to back it up to show you are spending enough   said a senior Beijing based Western diplomat   President Xi Jinping promised in his keynote speech to the Communist Party Congress in October to make China s armed forces world class by the middle of the century  The military has deployed an increasingly sophisticated propaganda machine to make sure that promise stays top of mind  A professionally shot air force video released to celebrate the Lunar New Year this month entitled  New fighters of the great power to safeguard the new era  led with footage of the latest fighter to enter service  the J 20 stealth jet  designed as a counterpart to the radar evading the  Lockheed Martin   NYSE LMT  F 22 Raptor   It looks like they are making the case for a large rise in defense spending   said an Asian diplomat  speaking of the recent uptick in military related stories in China  NERVOUS NEIGHBORS China s defense spending is only about one quarter that of the United States  if official figures are accurate  China has repeatedly said that it has no hostile intent  that its military is for defensive missions  and that defense spending is transparent   Many of the country s neighbors beg to differ  calling out what they see as Chinese sabre rattling as it ramps up drills in the region   Vietnam  one of the most vocal opponents of China s South China Sea claims  has tightened its military relationship with the United States  Taiwan has pledged to grow defense spending  and wants to buy new  advanced U S  equipment   The official People s Liberation Army Daily said this month that although China was committed to a defensive military policy  it had to  dare to shine the sword  with air patrols far from China s coast  whether close to Taiwan or over uninhabited islets disputed with Japan in the East China Sea   Such flights  it said  protected China s  bottom line  on strategic issues  One source with ties to the military said another pressing area for more spending was salaries  which have not kept up with those of private sector workers   Simply relying on  the great Xi to lead us to victory  won t cut it   the source said  referring to efforts to recruit the best and the brightest into the military by appealing to national pride  BETWEEN THE LINES  The defense budget will only disclose a top line number  with a percentage comparison to the previous year  No breakdown on spending is provided  Last year  China s parliament did not initially release the figure  sparking questions over transparency  But when it did  the budget increase was 7 percent  the smallest in more than a decade  The budgeted increase of 7 6 percent for 2016 was the lowest in six years and the first single digit rise since 2010  following a nearly unbroken two decade run of double digit increases  Experts say the true figure is likely much higher than what is officially reported  with money for some military projects included in ostensibly non military spending   Particularly given China s civil military integration  it is difficult to know where defense spending ends  and civilian research and development begins  said another Western diplomat  who analyses China s military  Some defense experts say that China is eroding the United States  military technology dominance and that the People s Liberation Army could surpass the U S  military in artificial intelligence capabilities  which have become a spending priority for Beijing  But in the absence of transparency about new technologies  such as an experimental electromagnetic railgun state media suggested this year was being tested aboard a Chinese warship  there is skepticism about their combat readiness  China has not fought a war since 1979  a brief invasion of Vietnam that ended badly for China  
China s Defense Ministry declined to comment ahead of the figure being released by parliament  The general percentage rise is typically given the day before parliament opens  and the raw figure the next day  Parliament opens March 5 ",2018-02-28,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/chinas-military-flexes-muscles-for-domestic-objective-more-funding-1315970,1315970

134381,355896,LMT,Ukraine says weapons decision heralds new era of cooperation with U S ,news,"By Alessandra Prentice and Sergiy Karazy KIEV  Reuters    Ukrainian Defence Minister Stepan Poltorak on Friday said the decision by the United States to approve the supply of anti tank missiles opened the door for closer military cooperation in the face of Russian aggression  On Thursday  the Pentagon announced that the sale of Javelin missiles and launch units to Ukraine had been approved   a move the United States has been mulling since early 2015 to help Ukraine in its standoff with Russia backed separatists   Unfortunately the issue of giving lethal weapons was under consideration for a long time   Poltorak said in an interview with Reuters   But we received it  the decision  when we received it    We have all possibilities to cooperate with the United States and to increase our cooperation including in the defense sector   he said  He didn t give further details   The United States has been one of Kiev s staunchest supporters since Moscow s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the subsequent outbreak of fighting in Ukraine s eastern Donbass region that has killed more than 10 000 people  But the decision to provide lethal aid is sensitive  The Kremlin has repeatedly said supplying weapons to Ukraine would further destabilize the situation by encouraging Kiev to use force  Russia denies accusations from Kiev and NATO that it supports the rebels with troops and weapons  Clashes between government troops and the rebels continue despite a notional ceasefire and diplomatic peace efforts  Speaking in a ministerial room decorated with photos of troops on the eastern front line  Poltorak said the weapons would help the Ukrainian military respond to attacks that he said Russia was responsible for coordinating   Its policy was aggressive and remains so  That s why the decision by the United States to supply lethal weapons is important for us   he said  
 Putin primarily uses the Donbass not only as a training ground to train servicemen for deployment in other hotspots  including Syria  and not only to test new weapons  equipment and other instruments  But he also uses it to prevent Ukraine from developing quickly   he said  It is not clear when the first supplies of anti tank missiles will be delivered to Ukraine  but Poltorak said preparations were already underway in terms of selecting personnel and safe storage for an expected delivery this year  According to the Pentagon  Ukraine has asked to buy 210 Javelin missiles and 37 Javelin Command Launch Units  The prime contractor will be a joint venture of Raytheon Co and  Lockheed Martin  Corp  NYSE LMT  ",2018-03-02,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/ukraine-says-weapons-decision-heralds-new-era-of-cooperation-with-us-1322392,1322392

134427,355942,LMT,U S government shutdown would increase Pentagon s weapons costs,news,"By Mike Stone WASHINGTON  Reuters    A U S  government shutdown will stall new defense department contracts and ultimately increase the costs of weapons  creating even more budgetary headaches as lawmakers grapple with a government funding crisis  Defense companies and Pentagon officials lamented the potential federal spending woes  saying it will hurt small suppliers who feed into weapons production while hitting bigger firms when the contract process is put on hold  Congress has been struggling for months to agree on long term government funding levels that may also include protections from deportation for 700 000 young undocumented immigrants  The federal government is operating on a third temporary funding measure since the new fiscal year began in October   While the impact of the shutdown will be felt across the government  the Pentagon has the biggest portion of discretionary spending in the federal budget and is closely watched given its role in national security   Since weapons makers can pass along some costs from a government shutdown on to the Department of Defense  according to the Secretary of the Navy  the prospect for higher procurements costs over the long term is very real  Navy Secretary Richard Spencer told Reuters a shutdown sends the  signal that we re going to interrupt cash flow  that s devastating to industry  That does us no good whatsoever   He added that the increased costs  come back to us in the form of more expensive equipment   The Pentagon s largest supplier   Lockheed Martin  Corp  NYSE LMT   told Reuters in a statement that  a government shutdown could result in costly schedule delays and breaks in production that will increase overall program costs and interrupt the delivery of critical equipment to our customers   Depending on the length of the shutdown it could cost hundreds of millions of dollars for the Pentagon  or even billions government wide in terms of legal disputes over contracts  procurement delays and downstream litigation costs said Franklin Turner  a partner in the government contracts and export control practice at McCarter   English LLP   While the Navy s biggest shipbuilder  Huntington Ingalls Industries  said the near term impact would be  minimal   its nearly 5 000 strong supply chain would likely feel the most impact because the lack of a federal budget creates uncertainty  That in turn inhibits their ability to hire and make capital investments  During a 16 day shutdown in 2013  small business contracts with the Department of Defense dropped by almost one third and spending dropped 40 percent  according to Office of Management and Budget

134452,355967,LMT,Taiwan plans to invest in advanced arms as China flexes its muscles,news,By Jess Macy Yu and Greg Torode TAIPEI HONG KONG  Reuters    Taiwan s ruling party plans to use a long term increase in defense spending to pursue advanced weapons systems  government officials say  in what is widely seen as growing determination to forge a stronger deterrent against a Chinese attack  The left leaning Democratic Progressive Party  DPP   led by President Tsai Ing wen  is working on detailed spending plans through 2025  two officials with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters  Tsai and her team have met repeatedly with military leaders in a push for new investment in training and equipment  one of the officials said  Immediate priorities include new missiles  drones and electronic warfare systems  fighter aircraft and ballistic missile defenses  according to a separate statement from the Ministry of National Defence sent to Reuters  Although some arms would be domestically produced  such as an existing plan to locally build eight submarines  they say a longer term Taiwanese drive for improved capabilities could mean fresh U S  deals  Those requests could deepen tensions between Beijing and Washington  China considers democratic Taiwan to be a wayward province and has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under its control  The United States  Taiwan s sole foreign supplier of arms  has for years called on Taipei to address a worsening military imbalance across the Taiwan Strait  which has recently seen heightened tensions amid military assertiveness by China  In the first week of 2018  China sailed an aircraft carrier and other military ships through the strait on a training mission   If there are three weapons systems that China s high command really wants to keep out of Taiwan s hands  it is submarines  fighter jets and ballistic missile defenses  Taipei is smartly investing in all three   said Ian Easton  a U S  based research fellow at the Project 2049 Institute  which studies Asia security issues   In October  Tsai signaled that defense spending would increase by at least 2 percent each year  with more possible based on the need for significant purchases   By 2025  Taiwan s annual defense spending is projected to increase by at least 20 percent   or NT 62 4 billion   2 08 billion    to NT 381 7 billion  the officials said  if the legislature approves the future budgets   With economic growth  on track  for this year  Taiwan s defense spending will  likely  exceed the baseline that the president has announced  one of the officials said    The Tsai administration is seeking to undo years of defense spending cuts   the two officials said in a separate written statement to Reuters   The additional funds will target enhancements in asymmetrical defense strategies in the short term  and advanced weapons and equipment either domestically produced or through defense procurements in the long term   one of them added   Taiwan s Ministry of National Defence confirmed to Reuters that electronic warfare  information security and improved drones were among the priorities for this year  along with existing programs  including upgrades of its Raytheon Co Patriot missile defenses   Lockheed Martin  Corp  NYSE LMT  F 16A B jet fighters and indigenously built training planes  The ministry also confirmed plans to improve mobile missile launchers  but has yet to detail whether that would mean reviving an earlier ballistic missile program or improving the cruise missiles Taiwan already has  Both are likely to face intense Chinese scrutiny   The planned increases mark a change in commitment from the previous China friendly Kuomintang government under President Ma Ying jeou  under whom defense spending from 2009 to 2016 slid from 3 percent to 2 1 percent of GDP  according to government data  Regional diplomats are watching developments closely  Although few nations have formal diplomatic or military ties with the island  any boost in Taiwan s military could complicate China s strategic domain   The military balance is rapidly shifting in China s favor  but the new Taiwanese government is more prepared to stand up to China s behavior   said Singapore based security analyst Tim Huxley   I think some countries  particularly Japan  will see that as a net benefit by making life more difficult for China   In recent months  China has ramped up its long range air force drills  particularly around Taiwan  In March  it said its defense spending would increase 7 percent for 2017  or 1 044 trillion yuan   158 70 billion    After taking office in 2016  Tsai has promoted Taiwan s domestic defense industry as one of several pillars under a so called  5 plus 2  program that seeks to foster important business sectors in Taiwan   Analysts have said Taiwan would need to improve both asymmetric warfare and high end capabilities like aircraft and missile defense after years of budgetary neglect   Asymmetric warfare means using limited resources to inflict unacceptable damage to a more powerful opponent  Taiwan is betting it can make an attack on it too painful for China to consider  according to Collin Koh  a research fellow at Singapore s S  Rajaratnam School of International Studies   The Taiwanese may not be able to overturn the balance of power now  but they can improve their abilities to raise the costs on China   he said

Oil closed lower on Friday  now for the second week in a row  Initially the announcement by US President Trump to levy tariffs on additional  100 billion worth of Chinese imports to the US sparked uncertainty  The concern that this trade war would escalate and thus affect economic output negatively was exacerbated by China vowing to retaliate against any new US tariffs while both sides are willingly taking economic  pain  into consideration as to not to back down

134473,355988,LMT,The 3 best ways to trade Amazon s retail dominance,news,"There are three main ways to profit from Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  s rapid growth and increasing dominance of the retail sector  according to Brian Belski of BMO Capital Markets 
Many of the best opportunities are in companies and industries peripherally related to Amazon  while others can be found in areas insulated from its influence 

 What s the best way to trade the rapid ascendance of Amazon into a global juggernaut 
The answer is not as simple as it may seem  After all  anyone with even a passing interest in business and markets knows that Amazon is muscling into new areas and expanding its reach on a daily basis  Entire portfolios have been kept afloat by the company s stock  which is up 50  this year 
With that in mind  the question is perhaps most accurately posed as  What s the best way to invest in a company that s viewed by nearly everyone as completely unstoppable 
Brian Belski  the chief investment officer of BMO Capital Markets  sees three main avenues 
1  Buy the stock outright   but with a catch
On the surface  this recommendation couldn t be more obvious  Buy Amazon s stock  and ride it higher  Simple as that 
But Belski says it s not that simple  and that s because of how expensive Amazon shares are right now  Sure  you can pay an arm and a leg for Amazon shares  but even if it churns out healthy gains  you re still paying a lot to enter the trade in the first place 
Belski points out that Amazon s price to earnings ratio   the most commonly used stock valuation metric   has been above 100 for most of the past five years  on a forward 12 month basis   At some point the party will be over   says Belski  who says that the stock will eventually adjust lower to more closely match earnings 
Applying that outlook  he recommends paring Amazon holdings on big stock spikes  and only adding to positions on  sharp price dislocations  
2  Buy stock in companies involved in Amazon s logistics
Belski s next suggestion is one step removed  betting on stocks that make up one small piece of Amazon s massive ecosystem 
That s right   while Amazon has repeatedly shown itself capable of creating or erasing billions of dollars of market value in other companies with a single action  it can also provide a major boost  Belski highlights the following areas as possible investment fodder   Technology  telecom  container board  tape  conveyor belts  retail REITs  rails  truckers  aerospace   you get the drift  
3  Buy stock in  anti Amazon  companies and themes
While it s impossible to know at this point which industries and companies are  Amazon proof   since the company has already proven itself capable of reaching far flung corners of the global marketplace  Belski has a few in mind 
One such group is  common sense retail   which includes the likes of Costco  NASDAQ COST  and  Home Depot   NYSE HD    companies whose product offerings will make it difficult for Amazon to chip away at market share 
Belski  working for a Canadian firm and all  says that four companies north of the border are some of the  best anti Amazon companies of all   He s referring to Canadian Tire  already so deeply embedded in the country s retail fabric   Dollarama  increasingly inelastic   Loblaws  a destination  and Restaurant Brands  offers a wide range of fast food  
Capital intensive areas that require expertise and infrastructure will also be relatively Amazon proof going forward  says Belski  He specifically means companies like Marriott  Waste Management and  Lockheed Martin   NYSE LMT   as well as sectors including energy  materials and utilities ",2017-11-22,Business Insider,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/the-3-best-ways-to-trade-amazons-retail-dominance-901352,901352
134474,355989,LMT,Exclusive  Pentagon evaluating U S  West Coast missile defense sites   officials,news,"By Mike Stone SIMI VALLEY  Calif  Reuters    The U S  agency tasked with protecting the country from missile attacks is scouting the West Coast for places to deploy new anti missile defenses  two Congressmen said on Saturday  as North Korea s missile tests raise concerns about how the United States would defend itself from an attack  West Coast defenses would likely include Terminal High Altitude Area Defense  THAAD  anti ballistic missiles  similar to those deployed in South Korea to protect against a potential North Korean attack   The accelerated pace of North Korea s ballistic missile testing program in 2017 and the likelihood the North Korean military could hit the U S  mainland with a nuclear payload in the next few years has raised the pressure on the United States government to build up missile defenses   On Wednesday  North Korea tested a new type of intercontinental ballistic missile  ICBM  that can fly over 13 000 km  8 080 miles   placing Washington within target range  South Korea said on Friday  Congressman Mike Rogers  who sits on the House Armed Services Committee and chairs the Strategic Forces Subcommittee which oversees missile defense  said the Missile Defense Agency  MDA   was aiming to install extra defenses at West Coast sites  The funding for the system does not appear in the 2018 defense budget plan indicating potential deployment is further off   It s just a matter of the location  and the MDA making a recommendation as to which site meets their criteria for location  but also the environmental impact   the Alabama Congressman and Republican told Reuters during an interview on the sidelines of the annual Reagan National Defense Forum in southern California   When asked about the plan  MDA Deputy Director Rear Admiral Jon Hill  said in a statement   The Missile Defense Agency has received no tasking to site the Terminal High Altitude Air Defense System on the West Coast   The MDA is a unit of the U S  Defense Department  Congressman Rogers did not reveal the exact locations the agency is considering but said several sites are  competing  for the missile defense installations  Rogers and Congressman Adam Smith  a Democrat representing the 9th District of Washington  said the government was considering installing the THAAD anti missile system made by aerospace giant  Lockheed Martin  Corp  NYSE LMT   at west coast sites   The Congressmen said the number of sites that may ultimately be deployed had yet to be determined  THAAD is a ground based regional missile defense system designed to shoot down short   medium  and intermediate range ballistic missiles and takes only a matter of weeks to install   In addition to the two THAAD systems deployed in South Korea and Guam in the Pacific  the U S  has seven other THAAD systems  While some of the existing missiles are based in Fort Bliss  Texas  the system is highly mobile and current locations are not disclosed   A Lockheed Martin representative declined to comment on specific THAAD deployments  but added that the company  is ready to support the Missile Defense Agency and the United States government in their ballistic missile defense efforts   He added that testing and deployment of assets is a government decision  In July  the United States tested THAAD missile defenses and shot down a simulated  incoming intermediate range ballistic missile  IRBM   The successful test adds to the credibility of the U S  military s missile defense program  which has come under intense scrutiny in recent years due in part to test delays and failures  Currently  the continental United States is primarily shielded by the Ground based Midcourse Defense system  GMD  in Alaska and California as well as the Aegis system deployed aboard U S  Navy ships  The THAAD system has a far higher testing success rate than the GMD  The MDA told Congress in June that it planned to deliver 52 more THAAD interceptors to the U S  Army between October 2017 and September 2018  bringing total deliveries to 210 since May 2011

134515,356030,LMT,Airbus  Dassault vie for leadership of Franco German fighter,news,"By Tim Hepher PARIS  Reuters    With the ink barely dry on a deal between France and Germany to develop a new combat jet  Airbus and Dassault are squaring up for leadership of a project that could reshape Europe s fragmented fighter industry  French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel unveiled the plans at a summit in July  burying past defense industry rivalries as part of efforts to tighten co operation as Britain withdraws from the European Union  The new combat system could involve a mixture of manned and unmanned aircraft and would eventually replace the Rafale and Eurofighter  rival jets that compete fiercely for global sales  as well as the older Panavia Tornado  That sets the tone for co operation between Airbus  which represents Germany and Spain in the Eurofighter consortium  and Dassault Aviation  the manufacturer of France s Rafale  But there has been little formal discussion yet over the shape of the project  let alone who would take the lead in development  according to industry and defense officials  Airbus  whose mostly Germany based defense arm makes up about a quarter of its sales  laid claim to the leading role in an op ed article published on Friday   On the assumption that the necessary political will is in place  Airbus is offering to drive cooperation with its European partners and to shape this aspect of our common European future   Dirk Hoke  chief executive of Airbus Defense   Space  wrote in Germany based defense newsletter Griephan Briefe  He described his company as  the lead   for a project of this nature   Dassault has itself offered to be the  architect  of the Franco German project and Chief Executive Eric Trappier told Reuters recently that it would be the natural leader due to its experience in building an all French fighter plane  nL5N1KH7O7  Airbus s call also appeared aimed at speeding up the project as Germany looks to U S  rivals to meet interim fighter gaps  Germany earlier this year asked Washington for a briefing on the  Lockheed Martin   N LMT  F 35 fighter as it gears up to replace its current fleet of fighter jets from 2025   nL1N1K206B  It has also asked for data on Boeing s F A 18E F  Hoke said buying American could weaken the European defense industry and make it ever more reliant on U S   black box  technology that is not shared with foreign operators  while injecting uncertainty into Franco German plans for a new jet   An interim solution for the replacement of old fleets already appears probable  If important decisions are delayed  a stopgap of this type could take on a dimension that would cast doubt on the economic efficiency of the entire project   he said  France and Germany said in July they aim to come up with a roadmap by mid 2018 for jointly leading development of the new aircraft to replace their existing fleets of rival warplanes  Dassault Aviation appears to have been caught by surprise by July s announcement  which cut across its existing partnership with BAE Systems  LON BAES  to build a demonstrator for an unmanned combat vehicle  called Future Combat Air System  FCAS   Defense analysts say the French company is in a strong position to be in the driving seat from a technological point of view  having made it plain it regards BAE as its technological peer  But at least for now  such considerations are likely to take a backseat to how the project will be funded amid tight defense budgets  an industry source said   
 It is quite normal for industrialists to claim leadership  but it is too early to talk about that   he added ",2017-11-03,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/airbus-dassault-vie-for-leadership-of-francogerman-fighter-763693,763693

134518,356033,LMT,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Lockheed Martin  Raytheon And Cardinal Health,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   Feb 14  2018   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include Lockheed Martin   NYSE LMT    Raytheon   NYSE RTN   and Cardinal Health   NYSE CAH   Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations    Here are highlights from Tuesday s Analyst Blog  M A Continues to Fuel MarketThe stock market has been dealing with many variables over the last week or so but the one constant over the past 7 8 years inserted itself into the US Stock market narrative once again over the last 24 hours  takeovers General Dynamics  NYSE GD  announced a deal to buy CSRA and Walgreen s approaching Amerisource about the purchase of the 76  of ABC stock that it doesn t already own  ABC is up about 9  today on the rumors of the deal and CSRA was positive about 32  yesterday on the announced nearly  10b offer from GD including about  2 6b of debt   One of the best kept secrets of this US stock market is the shrinking share count available to investors to purchase   Over the last half dozen years or so nearly  7T  yes  that s TRILLION  has been taken out of the market due to 2 factors  mergers and acquisitions  takeovers included  and stock buybacks   Stock buybacks make up about  4 5 5T of that number with the remaining due to M A   You may ask  why is that important   well  namely Earnings Per Share or EPS As shares decrease over time  the amount of attributable earnings which are spread over those shares can either rise  stay the same or fall  In two of those cases  staying the same or rising earnings means greater EPS   Even in a falling earnings environment  depending on the rate  the ratio between the two  at which shares are being retired  EPS does not necessarily have to fall  Some would argue that share repurchases by themselves are not indicative of future positive stock performance and in certain cases  like IBM  NYSE IBM   they might be correct   But in general  share repurchase programs are but a function of an overall capital return program to shareholders and not the strategic blueprint for a company s success   Point being  IBM s lagging performance over the last decade is about operational and management miscues  not a buyback   With this as a backdrop I looked at both of the above deals and searched out possible investing set ups  taking into account  competitors  sector  option volatility levels and other possible external catalysts  In either case  neither provides for a clear cut  we should buy XYZ because it s very clearly the next target  but in looking at both sectors  Defense Aerospace and Drug Distribution Supply Chain  I did find two exceptional Zacks Rank  2 stocks in Defense and one Zacks Rank  2 stock in Drug Distribution   I ll begin with the two Defense stocks Lockheed Martin  a defense stock darling and a Zacks Rank  2  sports a 2 31  dividend yield and sits squarely in what may be one of the strongest defense spending cycles we have seen in decades   This is part of my  external catalyst  thinking and along with the current elevated option environment  owning the stock here   350ish  and selling the June 370 calls for  8 00 is a nice 22 5  annualized yield if taken out of the position above  378  Along the way  you also pick up one quarter of the annual  8 dividend so an extra  2 of return to tack on   Zacks has earnings estimates for LMT increasing 15 71  for the current FY and although LMT trades at a peer and market multiple  its cash flows are prodigious dwarfing the industry average and are approximately 50  greater than GD Raytheon  another defense stalwart  Raytheon s business mix  mainly combat ready defense products to buyers globally including the US Defense Department apparatus  positions the company to build on its already strong cash generating capabilities   A Zacks Rank  2 stock that pays a dividend yielding 1 54   RTN is enjoying earnings estimates that are increasing 16 99  this current FY   Buying RTN here and selling the MAY 230 calls for  2 70 sets up an investor to realize an approximate 39  annualized yield if taken out of the position above  232 70  while also collecting a quarter of that yearly  3 19 dividend Cardinal Health  this drug distribution  Zacks Rank  2 stock is a bit more complicated  Three things are happening to this company and none are overly bullish on a very short term basis  1  Possibility of losing a major customer 2  the threat of Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  3  not being the company bought by WBA today   Parceling out each of these    s 2 and 3 could actually work to CAH s favor  Amazon could buy CAH   CAH has a market cap of only  18b and Amazon paid  13 5b for Whole Foods  if you think about supply chain and delivery mechanisms  it s certainly not a reach to think of Amazon buying its way quickly into the drug distribution pipeline using an expert like CAH as the conduit  Customer retention is not easy  cutthroat competition is driving prices lower but CAH continues to acquire great companies  has a pristine balance sheet and enjoys long term contracts  For investors looking to add a bit more speculative  punch  to their portfolio  buying the stock around  66 and selling the JUNE 72 5 calls for  2 00  producing an annualized yield of 34 5  if taken out above  74 5  could be a great trade set up  You also pick up a dividend at the end of March which is a healthy 2 72  annual dividend yield These 3 companies  all Zacks Rank  2 stocks  provide solid portfolio additions or could be added to if already owned   The elevated nature of macro volatility should be captured by the individual investor   Owning these stocks and selling upside calls at these volatility levels makes tremendous investing sense   And maybe best of all  all 3 companies are in the middle of multi billion dollar share repurchase programs The Hottest Tech Mega Trend of AllLast year  it generated  8 billion in global revenues  By 2020  it s predicted to blast through the roof to  47 billion  Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce  the world s first trillionaires   but that should still

134551,356066,LMT,CEOs suggest Trump tax cut may lift investors more than jobs,news,"By Mike Stone WASHINGTON  Reuters    U S  President Donald Trump is selling tax reform to Americans on the promise it will create extra income for companies to invest in their businesses and create jobs  Some of the biggest companies have very different plans  U S  corporations are saying they would use a tax reform windfall to buy back shares  retire debt and other shareholder friendly moves  in recent post earnings calls with investors and securities analysts  The Trump administration wants to cut the U S  corporate income tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent and encourage multinationals to bring home profits held overseas  The president promised his tax reform would give companies incentives to build plants in the United States rather than overseas  The White House Council of Economic Advisers bolstered that with an analysis that concluded lower corporate taxes would motivate companies to invest in new machines and hire more skilled workers   But several of the biggest S P 500 companies have plans more pleasing to investors than workers    If tax reform occurs in its presently drafted form  the  17 billion could be deployed entirely in the U S  and be apportioned amongst dividend  M A  share repurchases and debt repayment   Darius Adamczyk  the chief executive of Honeywell International Inc  N HON   told investors on Oct  10  The situation could be a replay of the massive 2004 repatriation  holiday  under President George W  Bush  in which 843 U S  based multinationals brought back  362 billion in overseas profits at a deeply slashed tax rate of 5 25 percent   Most of that money went to stock buybacks and dividend increases  The tax break was called a costly failure in a 2011 report by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations  which found it cost the U S  Treasury  3 3 billion in lost revenue and  produced no appreciable increase in U S  jobs or domestic investment    Unlike the voluntary Bush program  Trump s proposal calls for mandatory repatriation of an estimated  2 6 trillion in profits stashed offshore  It would impose two different rates  3 5 percent on earnings invested in illiquid assets and 8 75 percent on cash and liquid assets  But the outcome would likely be similar to the Bush experience  said Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  in a research note on Thursday  Top Republicans have said legislation will not order companies to use tax reform windfalls to create jobs  The White House had no immediate comment on the issue   Even small companies  which pay the highest effective tax rate and would be the main beneficiaries of a Trump tax windfall  do not appear focused on hiring  Reuters contacted the 100 largest companies by market value in the benchmark Russell 2000 Index of U S  small and mid cap stocks  as well as another 50 in that index that are not covered by securities analysts  None of the 17 companies that responded to Reuters mentioned boosting their headcount   Lockheed Martin  Corp  N LMT  would take a different tack to benefit shareholders with any tax windfall  The biggest U S  defense contractor is looking at front loading pension contributions to take advantage of any lower corporate tax rates next year  Chief Financial Officer Bruce Tanner told analysts on a conference call this week

S P 500 Futures   ES F Up 188 Handles Or   7  in 18 Trading Days

Friday morning  Asian markets closed mixed  the Stoxx 600 was up  0 50   and the dollar continued to slide  On Globex the S P 500 futures traded up to 2852 25  up 11 handles  On the 8 30 CT futures open the ES traded 2850 00  pulled back down to 2846 50  did a little back and fill  and then traded up to 2850 50  two ticks above the opening print 
After a few small pullbacks  and a triple top at the 2850 50 level  it sold off a few ticks below the vwap  down to 2848 00  and then in came a big buy program that pushed the future up to a new all time high at 2856 50  Again  there was some back and fill  and at 12 54 CT traded up to 2862 75 
At 2 00 the MiM went showing over  800 million  to sell to  500 million to sell  to  87 million to sell  and as it did the ES pulled back down to 2859 50  On the 2 45 cash close the MiM flipped to buy  800 million  and the ES went flying up to 2772 75  and went on to settled at 2874 00 on the 3 15 futures close  up 31 50 handles  or  1 12  
In the end  a weak dollar  a batch of stronger than expected earnings  and fresh data showing continued economic growth around the globe helped push the ES to a new all time high at 2876 00  up almost 8  in 2018  We have seen a lot of stock market moves  but none like this 
Are The Big Bank Predictions For 2018 Off The Mark 
Big and small investors always want to know what the big banks think about where the S P is going in the year ahead  They have not been very accurate over the last few year  and we do not think they will be this year either  Marko Kolanovic  who serves as JPMorgan s global head of quantitative and derivatives strategy  said at the end of 2017 that   The upcoming reduction of US corporate tax rates may be one of the biggest positive catalysts for US equities this cycle  We think that little is priced into the market and hence there is potential for market upside  Clients are not repositioning portfolios until they see the reform passed   
Kolanovic set a price of 3 000 for his year end prediction  He thinks that the US stock market is  not even close to pricing in the full positive effect of a successful GOP tax bill   His forecast is that volatility will rebound from near record levels next year  and sees tail risks mounting in the second half of the year 

I believe that Marko Kolanovic is one of the best strategist we ve seen on Wall Street in many years  I also believe that what he said about the benefits of the tax bill having not fully been priced into the markets is 100  correct  No one knows for sure how high the S P can go  but what we do know is that the S P can t keep going up like it is forever 
Other predictions  Oppenheimer   John Stoltzfus   Target  3 000  Bank of Montreal   Brian Belski   Target  2 950  Jefferies   Sean Darby   Target  2 855  Morgan Stanley  NYSE MS    Mike Wilson   Target  2 750  Scotiabank   Vincent Delisle   Target  2 750  Stifel Nicolaus   Barry Bannister   Target  2 750  HSBC   Ben Laidler   Target  2 650 
Whatever your prediction is  it would be hard to believe that anyone would have thought the S P would go up so fast  That said  what is you 2018 prediction

The UH 60M Blackhawk helicopters are an upgraded version of combat proven UH 60 helicopter  The Multi mission UH 60M is the latest in the Black Hawk helicopter family and is more capable  survivable  maintainable  powerful and effective than its predecessors  The UH 60M provides additional payload and range  advanced digital avionics  better handling qualities and situational awareness  active vibration control  improved survivability and improved performance using high speed machined parts The centerpiece of the UH 60M Black hawk helicopter is an advanced digital avionics suite that provides improved situational awareness and interoperability with the Future Combat System  It is more effective with its integrated digital cockpit  moving map display  enhanced GPS INS system and fully coupled flight controls Our View
Lockheed Martin had acquired Sikorsky Aircraft from United Technologies Corp  NYSE UTX   in November 2015 that boosted the former s position as the world s largest defense contractor  strengthening its military helicopter business  The acquisition added Sikorsky s world known aircraft  Black Hawk  along with different variants of combat and commercial choppers to Lockheed Martin s helicopter product line 
In the third quarter of 2017  the Sikorsky business saw a drop in net sales margin  However  for 2017  the company has increased its sales outlook  on expectations of contributions from its Rotary and Mission Systems  RMS  unit  which includes the Sikorsky unit  We believe generous fund flows from Pentagon  in the form of contracts like the latest one  will allow Lockheed Martin to make a rebound in the RMS business unit 
Price Movement
Lockheed Martin s stock has moved up about 32 1  in a year  compared with the broader  s gain of 53 9   This underperformance may have been caused by intense competition that the company faces for its broad portfolio of products and services in the domestic and international markets

boost results  Let s take a detailed look at the factors influencing Raytheon s quarterly results Missile Systems Unit Driving GrowthSegment wise  Missile systems business unit that represent almost 30  of the company s total business sales continues to be a major growth driver  The fourth quarter is also poised to benefit from this unit   Notably  the company won a modification contract worth  300 million for supplying Tube launched Optically tracked Wireless guided missiles and another modification contract worth  304 2 million to procure 618 Joint Standoff Weapon  JSOW  air to ground missiles  containers  component parts support equipment  spares  and engineering technical assistance  Moreover  at the end of the year the company won a  634 2 million deal for manufacturing the 31st

quarter  the Government Accountability Office dismissed the protest surrounding the Domino contract worth  1 billion and Raytheon is now actively working with the Department of Homeland Security on this largest single cybersecurity contracts ever awarded  We may expect further gains from this contract to get reflected in the company s fourth quarter sales Such a steady contract securing

134621,356136,LMT,Can Vertex Sell Off Aid L3 Technologies  LLL  Q4 Earnings ,opinion,L3 Technologies  Inc    NYSE LLL   is scheduled to release fourth quarter and full year 2017 results on Jan 25  before the opening bell Last quarter  the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1 03   Its Aerospace Systems segment is not likely to register substantial sales growth in the quarter under review  However  order flow is likely to fuel the company s bottom line growth Let s see how things are shaping up at the company prior to this announcement Is Vertex Divesture a Prudent Move  Contract price modifications at Vertex Aerospace unit raised concern about L3 Technologies  Aerospace Systems segment s growth   In fact  the company has identified this segment to be its most challenging business and remains skeptical about this unit s growth rate as well as profitability To focus its resources on higher value added and more profitable business  the company decided to divest the Vertex Aerospace business  at the onset of the fourth quarter  However  the divesture is likely to drive the Aerospace Systems segment s revenues in the long run and not have any impact in the fourth quarter Management further added that several other financial pursuits of this segment will impact its 2018 sales growth  Therefore  the Aerospace Systems segment will most likely suffer a decline in sales year over year Evidently  the Zacks consensus estimate for the segment s fourth quarter revenues is pegged at  539 million reflecting an annual decline of 49 9  Orders Growth    A Key CatalystA smooth order flow tends to boost the bottom line of defense contractors like L3 Technologies  Considering its encouraging order performance  the company s enhanced its 2017 earnings guidance  Notably the company increased its EPS midpoint by 10 cents to  8 85  reflecting 8  growth over 2016 Primarily lower taxes and high interest income  along with the favorable contract performance in sensors and electronics businesses led the company to increase its full year earnings guidance Notably the Zacks consensus estimate for 2017 earnings is  8 38 per share  representing 2 1  annual rise L 3 Technologies Inc  Price and EPS Surprise     Unimpressive Top line Estimates  It is imperative to mention that the top line estimates for L3 Technologies  for both the fourth quarter and full year 2017  are unlikely to register an annual improvement  The company s fourth quarter sales expectation of  2 8  2 9 billion also reflects 6  decline in organic growth  Probably this prediction led the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth quarter earnings of  2 31 per share to reflect 2 9  annual decline For 2017  the company lowered its estimated international sales to organic decline of 7  and that s primarily due to new business delays taking place in aerospace systems unit Will Communication Systems Unit Play a Spoilsport L3 Technologies is currently consolidating two traveling wave tubes businesses in communication systems segment  which is scheduled to be completed by first quarter 2018  As a result  this segment is incurring solid traveling wave tube business consolidation expenses  which may hamper its performance in the fourth quarter In line with this  our consensus estimate for the unit s fourth quarter revenues is pegged at  544 million  reflecting 6 5  annual decline What

Advanced Capability Three  PAC 3  missile system is a long range  air defense and medium to high altitude guided missile system  It is designed to counter tactical ballistic missiles  cruise missiles and advanced aircraft  The system s radar set provides tactical functions of airspace surveillance  target detection  identification  classification  tracking  missile guidance and engagement support Per Lockheed Martin  the PAC 3 Missile Segment Enhancement  PAC 3 MSE  interceptor employs a two pulse solid rocket motor that boosts altitude and range  The company projects strong demand for this advanced missile system  particularly in politically tense regions of the Middle East Our ViewWith rising geo political tension around the globe  nations are strengthening arsenals and taking initiatives to upgrade their defense systems  Defense equipments  in particular missile systems  have been witnessing improved traction recently  courtesy of the ongoing conflict between North Korea and the United States  Considering the fact that Lockheed Martin is a renowned missile maker and Pentagon s largest defense contractor  the company has been winning major contracts  in recent times Evidently  in the third quarter  the State Department approved the sale of THAAD anti missile defense system worth  15 billion  which will allow Saudi Arabia to purchase 44 Terminal High Altitude Area Defense  THAAD  launchers and 360 missiles  as well as fire control stations and radars  The contract is likely to bolster the company s long term growth In the third quarter  the company also won a contract worth  900 million for delivering LRSO cruise missiles  designed to infiltrate and survive integrated air defense systems and prosecute strategic targets These contract wins came on the back of increasing prospects in the missile market  In line with this  the rocket and missile market is projected to reach  70 billion during 2017 2022 at a CAGR of 4 7   as per Markets and Markets research firm Such estimates for missile market may have made induced Lockheed Martin s management to raise 2017 sales outlook for three business segments  including Missiles and Fire Control  by a collective  550 million  The raised view was supported by higher expected volumes  We believe  rising demand for missiles in the global space along with the procurement of major contracts  like the latest one  will enable the company to successfully achieve its enhanced sales targets  in the upcoming days Price MovementLockheed Martin s shares have returned about 28  in a year compared with the

134643,356158,LMT,Exclusive  Japan seeks Southeast Asia clout with chopper parts for Philippines military   sources,news,"By Tim Kelly and Nobuhiro Kubo
TOKYO  Reuters    Japan s army will give thousands of helicopter parts to keep Philippine military choppers airborne  helping Tokyo gain clout with Manila in a contest with China to secure influence over the strategic South China Sea nation  four sources said 
Military diplomacy is a new means for Japan to confound China s bid for control in the bitterly contested South China Sea as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe seeks a regional military role amid a retreat from decades of state pacifism 
The pact could be the first in a series of similar deals as Tokyo cranks up defense diplomacy with Southeast Asian nations eager for hand me down patrol aircraft  ships and other military equipment 
 This is a demonstration of the robust strategic partnership and cooperation of the two allies   a senior Philippine Air Force commander told Reuters  adding that Japan would deliver around 40 000 parts under the deal 
The value of the parts could not be determined 
The sources  who have knowledge of talks between the two countries  asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to talk to the media 
The supply agreement will be Japan s first military aid deal since lawmakers scrapped a rule in June barring giveaways of surplus military kit to other countries 
 We are looking at what we will do with our spare parts  but have nothing concrete we can discuss   said a spokesman for the procurement agency of Japan s defense ministry 
 In order to strengthen national security we want to push ahead with defense equipment cooperation  
Malaysia  the Philippines and Vietnam have already asked about taking Japan s submarine hunting P3 C maritime patrol aircraft  made by  Lockheed Martin  Corp  NYSE LMT   as they are replaced by Kawasaki Heavy Industries P 1 planes  two of the sources said 
 There has been some preliminary discussion   said one of the sources 
Japan worries that Beijing could blunt opposition to its territorial assertiveness in the South China Sea with arms sales and development aid to countries surrounding the busy waterway 
About  5 trillion of ship borne trade passes through the sea each year  much of it touching Japanese ports 
WINNING FRIENDS
The aircraft parts for the Philippines are meant for workhorse UH 1 utility helicopters that can be used for transport or deployed as airborne gunships  the sources said 
Japan s Ground Self Defence Force  GSDF  retired older H versions of its Vietnam era Hueys in 2012  after four decades of use  but retained their spare parts 
Japan earlier agreed to supply the Philippines with three second hand Beechcraft TC 90 King Air patrol planes  in a deal structured as a lease arrangement  under the old rule 
Other initiatives by Japan to build military ties include a four day South China Sea tour aboard its navy flagship  the Izumo helicopter carrier  by military officers of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations  ASEAN  in June 
Military officials of Indonesia  Malaysia  the Philippines  Singapore  Thailand and Vietnam also observed disaster relief drills in Japan 
Abe s government believes Japan is better placed than Washington to woo Southeast Asia away from Chinese influence  as it is free from the rules forbidding the United States to fully engage with non democratic regimes  such as Thailand and Vietnam 
Conditions set by the United States forced the Philippines to turn to China and Russia for arms supplies  the Southeast Asian nation s defense minister has said

134654,356169,LMT,BAE Systems Rides Defense Spending Wave,opinion,"Summary


BAE Systems PLC   LON BAES  is a high quality UK based defense company currently going through a correction due to concerns over Qatar s spat with Saudi Arabia  possibly affecting its Eurofighter orders 


With increasing geopolitical tensions around the world  global defense budgets are now set to grow north of  2 trillion by the end of 2026  And weapon systems manufacturers such as BAE Systems are especially well placed to benefit from this trend 


Compared to its global peers such as Lockheed Martin  NYSE LMT  and Raytheon  NYSE RTN   especially after its recent correction  BAE Systems is currently trading at an attractive valuation of 18 7x FY2016 P E  providing investors with a good opportunity to gain exposure to the steadily growing defense industry 


Current Correction Due To Qatar Worries
BAE Systems is the world s 3rd largest defense company by revenue  with main geographical exposures to the United States  39  by revenue   United Kingdom  22   and Saudi Arabia  21    The London based weapon systems manufacturer produces the widely used Eurofighter Typhoon fighter aircraft  supplying it to the air forces of the UK  Germany  Italy  Spain  Austria and even Saudi Arabia  BAE also manufactures and supports the maintenance of various weapon systems such as the Challenger 2 main battle tank for the British Army  and the Mk 45 Mod 4 Naval Gun System for the US Navy  just to list a few 
In terms of financial health  BAE Systems also looks to be in good shape  The company generates a return on invested capital of 11 51  based on FY2016 figures  significantly above its cost of capital of 8 2   thereby generating positive value for all of its capital providers  Though BAE operates in a capital intensive industry  prudent working capital management has kept its cash conversion cycle relatively fast at only about 30 days  contributing to its high free cash flow generation of  659 million in FY2016  3 8  FCF yield   Balance sheet wise  BAE does take on a fair bit of debt   about  1 6 billion of net debt as of FY2016  However  it s worth to note that the company can easily pay this off  given that its net debt is only a meager 0 8x that of its EBITDA 
Recently  the company went through a major correction  about 15  since October  due to worries that Qatar might not follow through with their letter of intent to buy 24 Eurofighter Typhoons  due to its diplomatic standoff with Saudi Arabia  The market has taken this news in bad taste  especially with the uncertainties coming out of Brexit  possibly increasing the cost of doing business for UK based companies such as BAE  However  we think it is worth to note that Qatar only represents a small portion of overall revenues  and the 3 main revenue generators for BAE remain the US  UK and Saudi Arabian militaries  and these long standing business relationships are unlikely to break so easily

Attractive Valuations Vs  Global Peers
After the recent correction  BAE systems currently trade at a valuation of 18 7x FY2016 P E  with a projected EPS growth rate in the region of 45  50  for FY2017  according to Bloomberg  Taken on face value  this represents an attractive valuation given that many of BAE s global peers trade at much higher valuations with lower growth prospects  Lockheed Martin  the world s largest defense company  and its American peer Raytheon  trade at 25x   27x historical P E  with high single digit projected growth rates  Compared to these large cap American players  we think BAE Systems offer greater value at current market prices  providing an opportunity for investors to gain exposure to the steadily growing defense industry

Earlier this month  the U S  State Department said it has approved the possible sale of seven Patriot missile defense systems worth  3 9 billion to Romania 
A NATO member since 2004 and European Union member since 2007  Romania has committed to boost its defense spending to two percent of gross domestic product this year 
Asked whether talk of acquiring Patriot missiles and recent military drills were straining relations with Russia  Iohannis told reporters   Firstly  we must look at what these acquisitions are for  
 We are not getting ready to attack anyone  We are preparing     for our army to benefit from modern  efficient features  They are meant to defend us  to guarantee the security of Romanians  
Asked whether recent regional military exercises could deter Russia  Iohannis said  Of course they could  and I think they do so  
Russia  whose annexation of the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 prompted concern among NATO s eastern members such as Poland and the Baltic states  has said NATO was threatening stability in Eastern Europe by building up its military presence there and staging war games

destabilizing impact of introducing high tech drones into South Asia  where tensions are simmering between India and Pakistan  particularly over Kashmir  which is divided between them  Other strains have emerged  with the United States vexed by a growing bilateral trade deficit and Trump accusing New Delhi of negotiating unscrupulously at the Paris climate talks to walk away with billions in aid  U S  officials expect a relatively low key visit by Modi  without the fanfare of some of his previous trips to the United States  and one geared to giving the Indian leader the chance to get to know Trump personally and to show that he is doing so  Modi is also not expected to press hard on a U S  visa program the Trump administration is reviewing to reduce the flow of skilled foreign workers and save jobs for Americans  seeing limited gains from raising a sensitive issue  they said  FALLING OFF THE RADAR  There is a palpable fear in New Delhi that the new U S  president s lack of focus on India  and limited appointment of South Asia focused advisors  has resulted in India falling off the radar in Washington   Eurasia Group s Shailesh Kumar and Sasha Riser Kositsky said in a note  Defense deals are one area where the two countries could make progress because of bipartisan support  an Indian official involved in the preparations for the visit said  The two sides have stepped up efforts in recent weeks to get inter agency clearance for the sale of the Guardian drone   India has raised the issue of the drones with the Pentagon three times since June 2016  officials said   U S  Senators John Cornyn and Mark Warner wrote in March to Defense Secretary James Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson saying the Guardian deal  estimated at more than  2 billion  would advance U S  national security interests and protect U S  jobs  An industry official involved in promoting India U S  business ties said the drone sale enjoyed support from the White House and Congress  and was awaiting clearance from the State Department  While the Guardian drones that India is pushing for are unarmed  the Indian military originally asked for missile firing Predator Avenger aircraft  a request turned down by the Obama administration   Sources say there is some concern in the State Department that if India were to get the surveillance drones  New Delhi would renew its push to acquire armed drones  which its military has eyed ever since they were deployed by U S  forces against militants in Pakistan   U S  export laws typically prohibit the transfer of such arms to a country unless it is fighting alongside U S  forces   FIGHTER JETS India and the United States will also discuss the sale of U S  fighter jets during Modi s trip  in what could be the biggest deal since they began deepening defense ties more than a decade ago  On Monday   Lockheed Martin   NYSE LMT  announced an agreement with India s Tata Advanced Systems to produce F 16 planes in India  provided it won a contract to equip the Indian Air Force with hundreds of new aircraft  Lockheed has offered to shift its ageing F 16 production line from Fort Worth  Texas  as part of Modi s  Make in India  drive while it ramps up production of the high end F 35 aircraft at home  
Since Trump s election on an  American First  platform  U S  and Indian officials have sought to play down any contradiction between his stated desire to protect American jobs and Modi s  Make in India  policy  arguing  for example  that deals in which components made in the United States are shipped to India for assembly benefit workers in both countries ",2017-06-22,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/india-eyes-breakthrough-on-u.s.-surveillance-drones-ahead-of-modi-trip-498113,498113

134768,356283,LMT,Poland plans Trump era defense spending splurge  critics say  unrealistic ,news,"By Lidia Kelly WARSAW  Reuters    Poland s new plans to nearly double defense spending and add a further 100 000 personnel to its armed forces seem  on paper  to be just what NATO allies need to counter U S  President Donald Trump s charge that Europe does not pay enough for its security   Partly a response to Moscow s actions in Poland s eastern neighbor Ukraine  the  Concept of Defense of the Republic of Poland  aims to enable Warsaw to resist any possible Russian aggression without having to rely so much on help from the thousands of U S  and other NATO troops already based in Poland   But the plan risks alienating Poland s allies  could allow Russia to exploit new weaknesses and may prove financially ruinous for Warsaw  NATO diplomats  security analysts and some in the Polish military and government say   In no more than 12 years Poland will be able to defend itself with its own armed forces   Defense Minister Antoni Macierewicz said when presenting the strategy in late May  The right wing Law and Justice  PiS  government s strategy essentially focuses on what it sees as Russia s goal to  create a new international order   It assumes a prolonged  aggressive stance  from Moscow towards Poland and its allies  Macierewicz has accused Poland s previous centrist government of underestimating threats from Russia  which in 2014 annexed Ukraine s Crimea peninsula  He has also stressed the need to boost the domestic defense industry  scrapping some earlier plans to buy equipment including drones from abroad   ABSOLUTELY UNREALISTIC  About a quarter of the Polish top brass has quit since PiS swept to power in late 2015  citing disagreements with Macierewicz over personnel and other decisions  Even within the government not all are convinced by the new military strategy and its emphasis on Poland s ability to defend itself  alone if necessary  from foreign aggression    Self sufficiency  How  This is absolutely unrealistic   one government official told Reuters   Do we really want to send a message to our NATO allies that we don t care about them   In Brussels  the NATO alliance has not publicly commented on Poland s change of tack but privately officials are wary  with one saying   No one can stop any member country from shooting itself in the foot  The consequences of that will be apparent when something really collapses   Poland s armed forces have suffered from decades of under investment and some two thirds of their equipment still dates from the Soviet era  but Macierewicz scrapped much of the previous government s modernization program  That program had envisaged  among other things  buying 70 multi task helicopters  with deliveries starting next year   But the PiS government broke off a 13 5 billion zlotys deal signed with European planemaker Airbus to supply some of those helicopters  It now says they are no longer a priority  The government still expects by the end of 2017 to sign a  7 6 billion deal with U S  firm Raytheon to buy eight Patriot missile defense systems  but a person close to the talks said the deadline was no longer realistic    The lack of army modernization is the biggest problem right now   Waldemar Skrzypczak  a general who resigned as an adviser to the defense ministry earlier this year  told Reuters   The government has also dismayed some military experts by taking the unusual step of moving its modern  German made battle tanks away from its western border and sending them to Warsaw  closer to Russia  In their place are now ageing Soviet era tanks that regularly break down and are difficult to maneuver   Moving the German made tanks to Warsaw requires equipping the base there with the infrastructure and trained personnel to operate them  That would take about two years and means that in case of a sudden attack  Poland would not be able to use them  the experts said   Moscow strongly denies any plans to invade Poland or the Baltic republics and instead accuses NATO of threatening stability in Europe with its troop maneuvers in the region  MORE CASH Poland  already one of only five NATO members to meet the alliance s defense spending target of 2 percent of national output  now aims to raise spending to 2 5 percent by 2030  assuming positive economic growth  That would mean a near doubling in real terms to about 80 billion zlotys   21 50 billion    Such an ambition is likely to impress Trump when he visits Warsaw next month  At a NATO summit last month the U S  president was publicly critical of allies who fail to meet the 2 percent target  Among several planned new acquisitions  Warsaw aims to buy two squadrons of  Lockheed Martin   NYSE LMT  F 35 fighters that each costs at least  100 million  Critics of the Polish government s ambitious plans say they lack a clear time frame and proper costing  Poland is required along with other European Union member states to keep its budget deficit under 3 percent of national output  but Macierewicz s ministry has proposed a draft bill that would not limit how much is spent on specific programs   Is this all realistic  Absolutely not   said Marek Swierczynski  a security analyst at Polityka Insight  a pro European think tank based in Warsaw

EUR USD   is looking for direction as it is being going down on the latest strong data out of the US and in order for the USD to continue to strengthen good inflation data is needed today  but is also moving up as the increased risk off sentiment is causing an outflux out of USD assets  although it is much less than we have seen in the past and the EUR is not able to really benefit  As mentioned the inflation data today will be important and possible also the comments from FED member Dudley shortly thereafter   USD JPY   the JPY is still stronger as the tension with North Korea is still an issue  although a bit less and as such it has managed to climb a little bit to trade around the support level just below the 110 level  The rhetoric has still not ended and as such we could expect a further appreciation of the JPY  although there are some that are trying to tone down the rhetoric   GBP USD    remains trading around the 1 30 level as we await production data out of the UK which is expected not to be that strong in the first place  The fact that the BOE is not likely to raise the interest rate took quite some wind out of the GBP run as also Brexit is obviously lingering over the GBP as always  NZD USD   as expected the RBNZ didn t change the interest rate level and indicated it expected that to remain the level for the foreseeable future amid a low inflation level  As indicated yesterday  the RBNZ doesn t want to see a NZD which is too high  something RBNZ Governor Wheeler indicated in his comments when he said that he prefers to see a weaker NZD and that the RBNZ could interfere whenever necessary  

Indices
Dollar Index   is starting to trade a bit sideways this week without too much movement  although that is likely to change today and tomorrow as we await inflation data out of the US   S P 500   remains under pressure as tensions are still high  even though US Secretary of State Tillerson tried to lower them by saying that a military option is not being prepared and the Americans can sleep well at night as the threat hasn t changed 
Commodities
Corn  Cotton  Soybean  Sugar   Wheat    could all be very interesting today  as the monthly WASDE report is published which tends to cause for quite some volatility in said agricultural instruments  Gold   continued to benefit from the demand in safe havens due to the Korean crisis as it breached through the resistance around the 1270 level to reach the next resistance level around the 1276 level to trading above this level as well now  It has reached the highest level in 2 months and if the tensions keep on increasing we could see another attempt at the 1300 level  However  we have inflation data today  and if inflation is picking up  we can see gold move down as that should strengthen the USD  A miss though could help gold move towards that 1300 level   Oil   saw some volatility but not as large as we have seen in the past  Nonetheless  oil moved up as inventories indeed dropped by 6 5 million barrels and more surprisingly also production dropped slightly  Output from refineries increased to levels not seen in years which indicates that there is still sufficient demand  It has been indicated that production is not leveling out  as we have seen that is not increasing as it has in the past and the number of active rigs is stalling  The inventories are now 17 5 million barrels below the level it was this time last year  so we are seeing a tightening of the market  Since April we have seen inventories drop by over 60 million barrels and have had only 2 weeks which saw inventories increase  Gasoline inventories however increased surprisingly which capped further gains for now as we are also approaching the end of the driving season in the US  Today will also see a joint press conference of the Saudi and Iraqi oil ministers  addressing the oil market as well as the OPEC s monthly report

134939,356454,LMT,Even with THAAD defense  North Korea missile barrage poses threat to South,news,"By James  Pearson   LON PSON 
SEOUL  Reuters    North Korea s latest weapons test showed it can accurately fire multiple medium range ballistic missiles  an attack strategy that experts said could test the advanced U S  THAAD anti missile system which began to arrive in South Korea on Tuesday 
Advances in North Korea s banned missile program have also caused concern in Tokyo  where sources with knowledge of the government s thinking said a  swarm like  attack using multiple missiles could overwhelm Japan s already stretched defenses 
Images released by North Korean state media showed leader Kim Jong Un presiding over Monday s simultaneous launch of four ballistic missiles  which landed in seas off Japan s northwest 
In response  the United States started the early deployment of its advanced Terminal High Altitude Area Defense  THAAD  anti missile system in South Korea on Tuesday  despite angry opposition from China 
THAAD s job is to intercept and destroy a ballistic missile in its final phase of flight  either inside or just outside the earth s atmosphere 
But with its specifications secret and having never been used in wartime  THAAD s ability to deal with a barrage of missiles at the same time is uncertain 
 The use of multiple shots  timed ever more closely together  appears destined to rehearse saturating a defensive system by presenting it with an overwhelmingly complex radar picture   Joshua Pollack  editor of the U S  based Nonproliferation Review  said of Monday s launch 
South Korean military and intelligence officials said the four North Korean missiles appeared to be an upgraded version of the Scud type   the  ER  or  Extended Range  Scud 
 An advantage of the ER Scud over the Rodong is that the ER Scud is much cheaper   said Jeffrey Lewis of the California based Middlebury Institute of International Studies 
 So North Korea can presumably build more ER Scuds to overwhelm THAAD   Lewis said 
STRIKE CAPABILITY
Most experts believe North Korea would likely need to fire off more than four ballistic missiles at one time to inundate a THAAD battery   perhaps 10  according to Michael Elleman  a U S  based rocket expert with the International Institute for Strategic Studies 
 I would be disappointed to learn that four attacking missiles would overwhelm THAAD   he said 
Manufacturer  Lockheed Martin   NYSE LMT  declined to comment 
 The specific number of threats  THAAD  can engage at once is classified  but we have successfully demonstrated the ability to engage multiple targets   Pentagon spokesman Gary Ross said 
A greater concern than multiple Scud type missiles would be if North Korea proved the ability to fire simultaneous salvos of other types of missiles that could carry heavier payload  said one U S  official  speaking on the condition of anonymity 
North Korea theoretically had enough launchers to send at least 36 ballistic missiles of various types at the same time  said Joseph S  Bermudez  a strategic advisor at Allsource Analysis Inc and contributor to the 38 North Korea monitoring project 
To counter that risk  South Korea  Japan and the United States have installed layers of different missile defenses that can work together to reduce the threat 
 If all three nations and their assets are integrated   and they can be integrated  there are systems for doing that   then the system has a synergy that is quite remarkable   Bermudez said 
In addition to the new THAAD system  South Korea also operates a Patriot PAC 3 missile defense system while Japan is upgrading its PAC 3 defenses and mulling a shore based version of the Aegis missile defense system used on Japanese ships 
North Korea s actions have also prompted discussions in Tokyo about THAAD  which  because it is already in operation with the U S  Army  may be an easier to deploy alternative to the Aegis system   For a graphic on THAAD compared with other missile defense systems  click  
REGIONAL TENSIONS
A deployed THAAD battery comprises four parts  The truck mounted launcher  eight anti missile  interceptors  which can destroy an incoming missile  a radar system  and a fire control system which connects the battery to U S  military commanders 
 The number of interceptors is limited  and the number that one THAAD system could handle at once is limited  too   said Markus Schiller  a rocketry expert based in Germany 
 THAAD has fared well in tests  but has not been used in real combat  under real conditions   Schiller added 
It is THAAD s sophisticated radar  which according to the U S  Missile Defense Agency is the  largest air transportable x band radar in the world   that has spurred tensions with China 
Once fully deployed in South Korea  a THAAD battery could theoretically use its radar to see and monitor activity beyond North Korea  deep into Chinese territory 
Russia also worries the deployment could compromise its security  and said it would lead to a stalemate on the Korean peninsula  Separately  Moscow has criticized a ballistic missile defense shield which the United States has activated in Europe as a step to a new arms race 
U S  Pacific Command said in a statement accompanying the announcement to start deploying THAAD in South Korea that the system is  strictly defensive  and poses  no threat to other countries in the region  
The U S  military released grainy neon green night vision video which showed a military transport plane delivering two THAAD trucks to Osan Air Force Base in South Korea 
So far  only the  first elements  have arrived  with the rest due to arrive by April  Yonhap news reported 
The planned location for South Korea s two THAAD launchers in the rural county of Seongju means Seoul is outside of their protective range 

But with so much conventional North Korean artillery pointed at the South Korean capital  just 40 km  25 miles  from the North Korea border  Pyongyang could carry out its threat to turn Seoul into a  sea of fire  by using only its Soviet era guns ",2017-03-07,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/even-with-thaad-defense,-north-korea-missile-barrage-poses-threat-to-south-464487",464487
134940,356455,LMT,As North Korea missile threat grows  Japan lawmakers argue for first strike options,news,"By Tim Kelly and Nobuhiro Kubo TOKYO  Reuters    Rattled by North Korean military advances  influential Japanese lawmakers are pushing harder for Japan to develop the ability to strike preemptively at the missile facilities of its nuclear armed neighbor   Japan has so far avoided taking the controversial and costly step of acquiring bombers or weapons such as cruise missiles with enough range to strike other countries  relying instead on its U S  ally to take the fight to its enemies  But the growing threat posed by Pyongyang  including Monday s simultaneous launch of four rockets  is adding weight to an argument that aiming for the archer rather than his arrows is a more effective defense   If bombers attacked us or warships bombarded us  we would fire back  Striking a country lobbing missiles at us is no different   said Itsunori Onodera  a former defense minister who heads a ruling Liberal Democratic Party committee looking at how Japan can defend against the North Korean missile threat   Technology has advanced and the nature of conflict has changed   For decades  Japan has been stretching the limits of its post war  pacifist constitution  Successive governments have said Tokyo has the right to attack enemy bases overseas when the enemy s intention to attack Japan is evident  the threat is imminent and there are no other defense options  But while previous administrations shied away from acquiring the hardware to do so  Prime Minister Shinzo Abe s LDP has been urging him to consider the step    It is time we acquired the capability   said Hiroshi Imazu  the chairman of the LDP s policy council on security   I don t know whether that would be with ballistic missiles  cruise missiles or even the F 35  fighter bomber   but without a deterrence North Korea will see us as weak   The idea has faced stiff resistance in the past but the latest round of North Korean tests means Japan may move more swiftly to enact a tougher defense policy   We have already done the ground work on how we could acquire a strike capability   said a source with knowledge of Japan s military planning  He asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue  Any weapon Japan acquired with the reach to hit North Korea would also put parts of China s eastern seaboard within range of Japanese munitions for the first time  That would likely anger Beijing  which is strongly protesting the deployment of the advanced U S  Terminal High Altitude Area Defense  THAAD  anti missile system in South Korea    China has missiles that can hit Japan  so any complaints it may have are not likely to garner much sympathy in the international community   said Onodera  GROWING THREATS  Currently  more than three missiles at one would be too many for Japan s already stretched ballistic missile defense to cope with  another source familiar with Japan s capability said  One serious concern for Japan is North Korea s development of solid fuel systems demonstrated last month that will allow it to conceal preparations for missile strikes because it no longer needs fuel its missiles just prior to firing  That test also demonstrated a cold launch  with the rocket ejected from its launcher before engine ignition  minimizing damage to the mobile launch pads  Japanese officials also noted that the launch truck was equipped with tracks rather than wheels  allowing it to hide off road   North Korea says its weapons are needed to defend against the threat of attack from the United States and South Korea  which it is still technically at war with  Japan is already improving its ballistic missile defenses with longer range  more accurate sea based missiles on Aegis destroyers in the Sea of Japan and from next month will start a  1 billion upgrade of its ground based PAC 3 Patriot batteries  Also under consideration is a land based version of the Aegis system or the THAAD system  Those changes  however  will take years to complete and may not be enough to keep pace with rocket technology advances by Pyongyang  the sources said   A quicker option would be for Japan to deploy ground to ground missiles to defend against an attack on its Yonaguni island near Taiwan fired from bases on Japanese territory several hundred kilometers to the east   A missile with that range could also hit sites in North Korea   Japan could also buy precision air launched missiles such as  Lockheed Martin   NYSE LMT  Corp s extended range Joint Air to Surface Standoff Missile  JASSM  or the shorter range Joint Strike missile designed by Norway s Kongsberg Defence Aerospace AS for the F 35 fighter jet   But with limited capability to track mobile launchers  some Japanese officials still fear any strike would leave North Korea with enough rockets to retaliate with a mass attack   A strike could be justified as self defense  but we have to consider the response that could provoke   said another LDP lawmaker  who asked not to be identified

135039,356554,LMT,3 Defense Stocks For Uncertain Times,opinion,"The world is a scary place right now  We have been dealing with terror groups for years and tensions with other countries like North Korea are high  Many people are worried about war and other conflicts  As an investor  the best thing you can do is invest in defense stocks 
When I talk about defense stocks  I am referring to stocks that do business with the military  I am not talking about defensive stocks that are good hedges to own when the market drops 
But with that said  defense stocks in general tend to do well when there is uncertainty in the world and the stock market  And it only helps when President Trump asks for an increase in military spending to the tune of  54 billion 
3 Defense Stocks To Own
 1  Lockheed Martin Corporation  NYSE LMT 
Lockheed Martin is the granddaddy of defense stocks and the company and stock have been performing incredibly well the past few years  However  when Lockheed reported its recent earnings  there was a red flag 
First quarter sales grew by 7  and profit margin held at 10   However net income fell by 15   Part of this decrease was due to the sale of their ISGS business  When you take that out of the picture from last year s earnings  net income fell only 5  
Still  having net income decrease at a time when business should be booming is a concern  The question is  is it a large enough concern to make you not invest in the stock 
My feeling is that Lockheed Martin is still a good stock to invest in long term  With the increase in military spending  the stock should hold up well  And the 3  dividend the company pays helps too 
 2  Raytheon Company  NYSE RTN 
Raytheon is another defense stock that does a lot of business with the military  Primarily they deal with missile defense systems and build sensors and components for weapons systems 
Over the past 5 years  Raytheon has grown earnings by 7   In their most recent earnings release  they did  6 billion in quarterly sales  which is 3  more than the same time last year  They also improved their operating profit margin to 12  and their net profit margin to 8   Earnings per share increased by 21  
Overall  the outlook for Raytheon is bright  They are growing the business and don t have any of the issues that Lockheed Martin has 
If you are on the fence between the two  I would pick Raytheon 
 3  Heico Corporation  NYSE HEI 
Heico is not a pure defense stock in the sense that it works primarily with the military  Heico designs  manufactures and distributes generic replacement parts for airplane engines and components and part of this is with the military 
I included it in this list because it does deal with the military and the stock has been on fire  The company recently reported an increase of 12  in sales  a net income increase of 31  and diluted earnings per share of 28  
For 2017  Heico expects to continue to improve margins and grow even more  How do they do this  They have perfected a 3 step approach 
They are able to grow organically  they have been acquiring other smaller firms that meet their strict requirements and they have been able to keep costs in line  When you can execute in all 3 areas  you are going to quickly grow your business  And this is what Heico has been doing and should continue to do 
Final Thoughts
Defense stocks outperformed the market in 2016 and many are saying they cannot continue to trade at these high valuations  I disagree  These companies are making money and growing earnings and as a result  investors will want to own a piece of them 
Add to this the uncertain times we live in and it only makes sense that investors flock to safer stocks to protect their money  Investing in defense stocks achieves this goal

	Further  increased budget for the Department of Defense is expected to boost defense giants like Lockheed Martin  However  tough competition remains a major dampener for the stock   You can   

	Shares of DuPont have gained  22 9  over the one year vs   16 8  gain for the Zacks Diversified Chemicals industry  DuPont s adjusted earnings for first quarter 2017 topped expectations  aided by its cost management actions and healthy demand for new products  Revenues also rose year over year and exceeded estimates 

	DuPont is moving forward with its planned mega merger with Dow Chemical  NYSE DOW   which is expected to create significant synergies  However  DuPont continues to face challenges in the agriculture business  Additionally  the company is exposed to currency headwinds and volatility in energy and raw material costs   You can

135063,356578,LMT,Exclusive  U S  supplied drones disappoint Ukraine at the front lines,news,"By Phil Stewart WASHINGTON  Reuters    Millions of dollars  worth of U S  supplied drones that Kiev had hoped would help in its war against Russian backed separatists have proven ineffective against jamming and hacking  Ukrainian officials say  The 72 Raven RQ 11B Analog mini drones were so disappointing following their arrival this summer that Natan Chazin  an advisor to Ukraine s military with deep knowledge of the country s drone program  said if it were up to him  he would return them   From the beginning  it was the wrong decision to use these drones in our  conflict    Chazin  an advisor to the chief of the general staff of Ukraine s armed forces  told Reuters  The hand launched Ravens were one of the recent highlights of U S  security assistance to Ukraine  aiming to give Kiev s military portable  light weight  unarmed surveillance drones that were small enough to be used widely in the field  They are made by AeroVironment  But they appear to have fallen short in a battle against the separatists  who benefit from far more sophisticated military technology than insurgencies the West has contended with in Afghanistan  Iraq or Syria  Whether President elect Donald Trump s administration might seek to provide Kiev anything more robust  however  is unclear  given his stated desire to improve ties with Russia and prioritize the fight against Islamic militants  U S  restrictions on technology exports could also limit new aid  The Air Force command of Ukraine s armed forces acknowledged to Reuters that the Ravens supplied by the United States had a fundamental drawback  Russia and the separatist forces it supports can intercept and jam their video feeds and data   The complex is analog  therefore command channels and data are not protected from interception and suppression by modern means of electronic warfare   it said  U S  officials  speaking on condition of anonymity  acknowledged that Russia s electronic warfare capabilities were far more sophisticated than thought when the conflict began and that both the U S  and Ukrainian militaries were adapting  Asked about Ukraine s reaction to the Ravens  one official said it took a considerable amount of time for the drones to reach Ukraine and that by then  they were much less effective than they would have liked  than we would have liked   AeroVironment referred questions from Reuters about the Raven contract to the U S  Army  The U S  Army told Reuters it still uses Ravens but has upgraded to digital versions   STONE AGE   Some 38 Ukrainian students were trained at Redstone Arsenal in Alabama on how to operate the drones between March and July this year  a U S  Army spokesman said  Ukraine said it distributed the Ravens across the services and gave one batch to the Zhytomry Military Institute for training purposes  There were mixed accounts on how much the Ravens were being used in Ukraine  which saw Crimea annexed by Russia in 2014 and which has been fighting Russian backed separatist forces in the east  Nearly 10 000 people have died in the conflict  The Air Force command of Ukraine s armed forces said they were being used in the  Anti Terrorist Operation  zone  including in combat situations  One Ukrainian official  however  speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity  said that although drones were being used in the zone  they were not employed on the front lines   Chazin said they were largely in storage and called them a vulnerability  allowing the enemy to see Ukrainian military positions and  when it wanted  easily take them down  They had short battery life and were unable to reliably fulfill the key mission of gaining intelligence on artillery positions  he said    Analog  basically puts you back in the stone age of the UAVs   said James Lewis  director of the strategic technologies program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies  using an acronym for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles  or drones   I m not being critical of the Raven  I love the Raven     But it s a cheap  disposable UAV  And for more intense conflict  that may not cut the ice anymore   TRUMP S UKRAINE POLICY  The drones  along with other U S  supplied items like radar  first aid kits  night vision and communications gear  fit into President Barack Obama s strategy of providing non lethal military assistance while focusing on sanctions and diplomacy to end the war  Within that context  the miniature drones  even though small  were a noteworthy element of the more than  600 million in training and equipment that the United States has provided Ukraine so far  Ukraine pegged the Raven program s value at over  12 million  How Trump might alter U S  support remains unclear  particularly given cabinet picks that include retired Marine General James Mattis  who has been vocal about his concerns about Russia and was nominated to become U S  defense secretary  Some of the most prominent Republican lawmakers in Congress have called for Ukraine to receive lethal arms   If anything  it creates a new opportunity   said Luke Coffey at the Heritage Foundation  a conservative Washington think tank  Ukrainian officials have sought to put a brave face on Trump s election  downplaying comments on the campaign trail that included appearing to recognize Crimea as part of Russia and contemplating an end to U S  sanctions on Russia   Ukraine s President Petro Poroshenko is expected to visit Washington next year  and U S  assistance is sure to be high on his agenda  Topping Ukraine s wish list are Javelin anti tank missiles made by made by Raytheon and  Lockheed Martin   NYSE LMT   The top U S  military officer in Europe  General Curtis Scaparrotti  told a Senate hearing this year  there s a requirement for an anti tank weapon  like Javelin   One of the U S  officials cautioned about limitations on America s ability to export drones that can evade Russia s electronic warfare capabilities  
That could leave Ukraine s military to continue building drones from commercially available technology  It now assembles them from components supplied by firms in countries such as Australia  China and the Czech Republic for only  20 000 to  25 000 apiece  Chazin said  and they are more advanced than the more pricey Ravens  which are often funded from private donations ",2016-12-21,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/exclusive:-u.s.-supplied-drones-disappoint-ukraine-at-the-front-lines-449262,449262

At 11 15AM ET  16 15GMT   the Dow Jones gained 41 points  or 0 21   and the S P 500 was unchanged  while the tech heavy Nasdaq Composite traded down 26 points  or 0 47  
Although the S P was wavering along the flat line on Monday  the benchmark index briefly hit a new intraday record high of 2 264 85 points  with the Dow matching pace with its own all time high of 19 824 59 points 
With Monday s gains  the blue chip index was also on track to record what would be its 15th record closing high since the November elections  The Dow has only closed down on 4 days since Donald Trump won the U S  elections 
On a down note  Trump did cause a ruckus in shares of Lockheed Martin  NYSE LMT  after tweeting that the costs for its F 35 program were  out of control  and promising that  billions of dollars can and will be saved on military  and other  purchases after January 20  when he officially takes office  Shares slumped 4

On Wednesday  the Federal Reserve  Fed  will release its latest decision on interest rates  alongside updated economic projections with a follow up press conference by its chief Janet Yellen

With the policy tightening on Wednesday essentially considered a  done deal   Fed fund futures were pricing in the next move for June 2017 with odds at 64 5  
Investors will undoubtedly eye the publication of the Fed s updated dot plot that outlines  anonymously  individual Fed projections for the future path of interest rates

135099,356614,LMT,Under U S  plan  Afghans may get Black Hawks to replace Russian aircraft,news,"By Josh Smith KABUL  Reuters    The U S  military wants to replace Afghanistan s well worn fleet of Russian helicopters with American made aircraft  according to a new budget proposal  a decision aimed at reducing the Afghan air force s decades long reliance on Russian equipment  The Afghan air force  trained and assisted by NATO advisers  has slowly gained strength  but remains too small to meet the needs of security forces struggling to combat a stubborn Taliban insurgency  Now the U S  Defence Department is requesting funding to refurbish and update 53 older model U S  military UH 60 Black Hawk helicopters for the Afghans  enough to replace the current fleet of Russian designed Mi 17 helicopters  Donald Trump s victory in the U S  presidential election  and the prospect of warmer U S  Russian ties  could yet impact the proposed move  but were it to go through  it would cost hundreds of millions of dollars and require retraining potentially hundreds of Afghan pilots to fly the new craft  Roughly 50 Mi 17 transport helicopters form the backbone of the air force  flying missions including troop and supply transport  medical evacuation and close air support  Heavy fighting  hard conditions and maintenance problems have taken their toll on the fleet  however  and the U S  military has faced legal barriers to providing new Mi 17s and parts amid deteriorating relations with Russia   The Department of Defence has determined that procuring U S  made helicopters is a more sustainable long term solution to meet the requirements   spokesman Adam Stump said  Among the reasons were  legal restrictions on spending DoD funds to maintain or buy more Russian helicopters   NEW FUNDING REQUESTED The  814 million request  made in a budget amendment submitted this month  would also provide money for other new attack aircraft for the Afghans  It would help push the total funding for Afghan security forces to  4 2 billion for 2017  surpassing the  1 2 billion requested for arming and supporting local forces in Iraq and Syria  Under the proposal  UH 60A helicopters earmarked for the Afghans would be taken from the U S  Army s inventory and upgraded to a UH 60A  variant  which Stump said was  suitable for the challenging Afghanistan environment   Military planners hope to begin fielding the Black Hawks in Afghanistan  already a common sight during America s 15 year war there  within two years of Congress approving funding  he added  The budget also requests funding for 30 additional armed MD 530 attack helicopters  six A 29 fixed wing close attack aircraft and five AC 208 aircraft for the Afghan air force  Altogether  the military may order as many as 159 Black Hawks for the Afghans  said U S  Senator Richard Blumenthal  who represents Connecticut  home of the helicopter s manufacturer Sikorsky  and other lawmakers in a statement  Of roughly 3 000 Black Hawks in use in the world  the U S  Army operates at least 2 300  according to Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation  which was acquired by military aviation giant  Lockheed Martin   NYSE LMT  last year  Afghan officials in Kabul said they had yet to be officially informed of any decision  but would welcome Black Hawks   They have been tested in Afghanistan and can support our forces on the ground   said Mohammad Radmanish  a spokesman for the Afghan Defence Ministry  Russia s state owned Rostec  parent company of the main Russian military helicopter manufacturer  and

Since 2010  the United States has provided at least  3 7 billion to develop and support the Afghan air force  which has struggled to field enough trained crews to operate its aircraft   Stump said there were now enough personnel  But switching to more complex Black Hawks would require retraining potentially hundreds of pilots  crew chiefs  and maintenance workers  Captain Jason Smith  a

what recapitalization looks like once approved   While many vehicles  aircraft  and weapons provided to Afghan security forces by the United States are American made  military officials originally favored the Mi 17 because Afghan pilots and mechanics were already familiar with it  That decision was made at a time when the United States and Russia were cooperating on a range of Afghanistan related issues  including a major supply route for the NATO coalition in and out of the country  Since then the relationship has soured over conflicts in Syria and Ukraine  Under pressure from Congress in 2013  the Pentagon scrapped a plan to spend more than  1 billion on new Mi 17s  and in 2014 President Barack Obama issued formal restrictions on doing business with Russian arms manufacturers  With the U S  military s endorsement  India has been involved in helping provide a handful of Russian helicopters to Afghanistan  but the Pentagon s decision would almost entirely supplant the Afghans  Russian aircraft  While incoming president Trump campaigned on promises of protecting American manufacturing jobs  he has also signaled a desire to repair relations with Russia   Given President Elect Donald Trump s desire to improve relations with Moscow  the Mi 17s could be making their return not too far down the road   said Michael Kugelman  an analyst with the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington  D C

135110,356625,LMT,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  Lockheed Martin  General Dynamics  AAR And Wesco Aircraft Holdings,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL   April 11  2017   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Industry  Aerospace Defense  Part 3  including Lockheed Martin Corp   NYSE         General Dynamics  Inc   NYSE         AAR Corp   NYSE        and Wesco Aircraft Holdings  Inc   NYSE        

	Industry  Aerospace Defense  Part 3

	Link  

	The U S  has been the world s largest defense consumer since World War II  Iraq and Afghanistan wars in the past have given a boost to spending on weaponry and armed forces  pushing the U S  defense market to historic heights  However  the winding down of these wars and severe pressure to lower the national debt burden following the country s major financial distress since the Great Depression had cast a long shadow over the U S  defense budget 

	In fact  continued budget cuts by the U S  Department of Defense  DoD  took its toll on the U S  aerospace and defense industry in the past couple of years  Although the current macroeconomic factors and President Donald Trump s promise of spending  bigly  are in favor of the nation s economic growth  rising rate hikes and an ever strengthening U S  dollar have instilled concerns that this growth might be short lived  In certain times  the U S  government might not be able to fulfill its promise of spending amply on defense companies 

	Various regulations imposed on international trade of defense equipment remain significant barriers to this sector s growth  Moreover   disproportionate  cuts to modernization and research and development funding could act as major impediments to defense players 

	Below we discuss the headwinds that could weigh on the aerospace and defense sector in the near term 

Market Pricing Scenario   There is no reason to doubt that the Trump administration s pledge to substantially ramp up defense spending has given a boost to the U S  aerospace and defense industry  However  the aerospace sector has hardly been cheap after Trump took over  In fact  over the last five years  the sector traded as high as 18 7x forward 12 month earnings estimates and as low as 10 6x  It is currently trading at 18 2x forward 12 month EPS estimates toward the high end of this five year range and also higher than the S P 500 index s 17 7x forward 12 month EPS estimates 

	Also  the company s Price Book Value ratio of 7 92 was higher than that of the market s ratio of 3 54 over the last 5 years  This indicates that the aerospace sector is already overvalued when compared to market value and any further upside is unlikely 

Regulatory Impediments   The Aerospace   Defense industry is subject to multiple regulatory standards in the markets they serve  including safety  fuel economy  emissions control and chemicals use  In addition  the industry must comply with regulations related to government contracting and international trade  In the U S   several agencies within the federal government have jurisdiction over various aspects of the Aerospace   Defense industry 

	To comply  companies bear heavy costs  In addition  certain U S  government contracts span one or more base years and multiple option years  The U S  government generally has the right not to exercise option periods and may not exercise an option period for various reasons  which in turn might hamper revenue growth of defense corporations 

	Further  companies in this industry must manage price and environmental expectations in order to meet government requests for proposals  RFPs   which seek to align contract work with broader government goals  In trying to meet such regulations  at times  companies are compelled to forgo a part of their profits  which in turn affects the growth of the entire sector 

Budget Loopholes   The recently proposed FY 2018 defense budget and the appropriations put forward by Trump s administration for FY 2017 are expected to bring in military stability  But one cannot overlook the risk of an economic downturn 

	Indeed Trump s FY 2018 budget proposal itself seems to be a threat to the growth of the nation s economy  While the  America First Budget  proposed a 10  hike in the defense spending  to avoid any further budget deficit  Trump s plan includes a simultaneous decline in spending in non defense programs  particularly foreign aid  agriculture  commerce  education  energy  environment protection agency  EPA  and health 

	Now it is true that increasing fiscal budget deficit put immense pressure on an economy under huge debt  slowing down its growth trajectory  But to ensure a balanced budget  it is not wise to sacrifice the other pillars of the economy  Stability in economy is not guaranteed only by the departments of justice  defense and homeland security  Neither does social security depend only on the strength of a defense system  Qualities of health  education as well as environmental services are also crucial to a nation s well being  Many analysts fear that such deep cuts in these sectors that offer the basic amenities of life might shake the very foundation of the U S  economy 

	Among the sectors that will suffer the most  the EPA s operating budget would be cut by 25  eliminating approximately 3 000 jobs and reducing its total staff from 15 000 to 12 000  This would not only raise the unemployment rate but also hurt programs dealing with air and water pollution and climate change research 

	Indeed  Trump s budget seems to have created an economic conflict in America  with concerns that reducing funds for these important industries might do more harm than good  Going forward  under Trump s planned budget cuts  federal spending is likely to see a  10 5 trillion reduction over 10 years  However  if the reduction is not even among all federal departments  everyone will suffer severe economic repercussions in times of recession 

	Also  the 10  hike promised by Trump in FY 2018 s defense budget might not be kept if the  30 billion appropriations that he proposed for FY 2017 are accepted 

Rate Hike   Strong U S  Dollar   A gradually recovering economy  at least in the near term  with increased consumer spending and lower unemployment has set the stage for a series of rate hikes in the U S  As a result  we witnessed a hike of a quarter point in the lending rate last month  following last December s hike and projections of two more hikes this year  Although rate hike reflects stability in the economy  it pumps up the credit rate that banks extend to their customers  Aerospace defense being a highly capital intensive industry  such a rate hike is not good news for its expansion 

	Also  a rate hike magnifies borrowing costs for the government  thereby raising national debt  Presently  the national debt is approximately  20 trillion  which itself raises questions as to whether adding more to this number will prove any wiser  Higher public debt might drag the economy to the path of decelerated growth and put pressure on U S  taxpayers 

	Moreover  positive economic data boost expectation of more rate hikes from the U S  Federal Reserve which in turn leads to the U S dollar appreciation  This affects U S  based companies as a strong dollar is not only proving to be a currency translation drag  but is also having a bearing on foreign military sales 

	With the Fed set to hike rates twice this year  dollar should also be on an uptrend  As a result  U S  based defense companies earning from overseas operations will be deeply affected  A stronger dollar might also damage the nation s export competitiveness 

Intense Competition   Aerospace and defense companies vie among themselves for a finite number of small and large programs 

	Moreover  China is developing space technologies aimed at blocking U S  military communications  per a report commissioned by a panel formed by Congress  China s goal is to become a space power as forceful as the U S  and to promote a space industry equal to those in the U S  and Europe 

	In the same line of action  as per a report by CNBC  Russian defense officials have acknowledged deploying radar imagery jammers and developing laser weapons designed to blind U S  intelligence and ballistic missile defense satellites  Russia and China continue to pursue weapon systems capable of destroying satellites on orbit  placing U S  satellites at greater risk for the next few years 

	North Korea has also been giving the U S  a hard time lately on the defense frontier  Last month  the two countries got engaged in a hostile missile rift when North Korea fired four ballistic missiles into the waters off its east coast  In retaliation  the U S  military deployed Lockheed Martin Corp  s  NYSE       THAAD anti ballistic missile system in South Korea 

	Given the looming headwinds  we advise investors against names that offer little growth opportunity over the near term  These include companies for which estimate revision trends reflect a bearish sentiment 

	We remain apprehensive of Zacks Rank  4  Sell  stocks like General Dynamics  Inc   NYSE        AAR Corp   NYSE       and Wesco Aircraft Holdings  Inc   NYSE         You can see   

Our Take

	It is true that the aerospace   defense industry has remained mostly stable amid economic downturns  thanks to its non cyclical nature  On top of that  the rise in global geopolitical uncertainty is expected to bring good fortunes for it 

	Yet we cannot overlook issues like global competition  rapid changes in technology  national and worldwide economic conditions and global policies affecting defense stocks  Also  aerospace manufacturers now giving more emphasis on commercial aviation 

	The fast changing world with rising global uncertainty requires the aerospace and defense industry to act with speed and flexibility  We believe that careful management and prudent spending will help the industry to overcome its headwinds

135118,356633,LMT,South Korea says Trump pledged commitment to its defense,news,"By Jack Kim and Ju min Park SEOUL  Reuters    U S  President elect Donald Trump pledged his commitment to defending South Korea under an existing security alliance during a phone call with South Korean President Park Geun hye on Thursday  her office said  Trump had said during the election campaign he would be willing to withdraw U S  military stationed in South Korea unless Seoul paid a greater share of the cost of the U S  deployment  but an adviser to the president elect played down such comments on Thursday  There are about 28 500 U S  troops based in South Korea helping to defend the country against nuclear armed North Korea  which has remained in a technical state of war with the South since the 1950 53 Korean conflict  Park said the U S  South Korean alliance had grown in the past six decades and she hoped it would develop further  She asked Trump to join in the effort to help minimize the threat from North Korea  which has carried out repeated nuclear and missile tests in defiance of U N  Security Council resolutions and sanctions  South Korea s presidential Blue House said Trump agreed with Park and it quoted Trump as saying   We will be steadfast and strong with respect to working with you to protect against the instability in North Korea   Trump s transition team did not respond to requests for comment  but an adviser to the president elect played down concerns about any changes in approach to alliances in Asia   I think what we are going to see is a very mainstream Republican administration   he said  adding that sharing the costs of sustaining combined defense was a matter for negotiation  as it always had been   It s going to be a respectful conversation that s going to be done at the working level and will have absolutely nothing to do with the overall strength of these alliances  which is going to remain extremely close   he said  The adviser  who did not want to be identified by name  also noted that during the election campaign Trump had dropped comments he had made saying he would consider letting Japan and South Korea build their own nuclear weapons rather than have them rely on the United States nuclear umbrella   He has moved on to talk about non proliferation in a way that you would hear from any Republican president   he said   We are very much committed to both non proliferation and assuring the allies that not only will they continue to be under the nuclear umbrella  but that we are going to be strengthening our missile defense in ways that alleviate some of their concerns about North Korea   The Blue House said the call between Park and Trump lasted about 10 minutes and Park said she hoped Trump would be able to visit South Korea soon  COST SHARING CONCERNS There has been concern in South Korea that a Trump presidency will demand that Seoul sharply raise its share of the cost of maintaining the U S  military presence  Under a five year cost sharing accord reached two years ago  Seoul agreed to contribute  867 million toward U S  military costs in 2014  about 40 percent of the total  The deal called for the amount to rise annually at the rate of inflation  Trump said earlier this year that the United States was paid  peanuts  for the troop presence and that he would be willing to withdraw U S  forces from South Korea and Japan  but  would not do so happily    South Korea believes its share of the cost is much higher when the vast amount of land occupied by the U S  forces  including a large area in central Seoul  are considered   Some members of the South Korean parliament have suggested that the country has little choice but to consider nuclear armament if U S  forces are withdrawn while North Korea continues to develop nuclear weapons and missiles that could carry them  South Korea s Defense Ministry spokesman Moon Sang gyun said on Thursday the country paid its share of the cost of maintaining the U S  military and the contribution had been recognized by the U S  government and Congress  South Korea and the United States have also agreed to deploy a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense  THAAD  anti missile system with the U S  military to counter missile threats from North Korea  South Korea has consistently said it had no plan to buy the THAAD system  which is built by  Lockheed Martin  Corp  NYSE LMT  and costs an estimated  800 million a piece  that will likely add to the cost of maintaining the U S  military presence  The official newspaper of the North s ruling Workers  Party said on Thursday the U S  wish for North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons program was  only a fantasy of a bygone era  and the policy of pressure and sanctions had failed   The only accomplishment of the Obama administration is that it is leaving behind for the new administration coming next year the burden of having to deal with a strong nuclear power   Rodong Sinmun said in a commentary  It did not mention Trump by name  But Choson Sinbo  a pro North Korean newspaper published in Japan and controlled by Pyongyang  said   Trump is well advised to learn the lesson of history from Obama s failure

135136,356651,LMT,Trump s Jawboning Won t Deliver Enough Jobs,opinion,"President Trump does not have to deliver on all his campaign promises even all the big ones but he does have to rev up growth and create more jobs if he is to avoid a dramatic setback for Republicans in the mid term elections and maximize his chances in 2020 
Key elements of his economic program tax  regulatory and trade reform are delayed by the considerable distraction of replacing ObamaCare  For now  he can only tout progress by pointing  as he did in his recent address to congress  to the deals with corporate leaders to move jobs back to America 
The list is impressive United Technologies  NYSE UTX   Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV  NYSE FCAU  and other top companies have jumped on board  but the impact of those agreements pale in comparison to the task at hand 
The Obama recovery accomplished 2 1 percent annual economic growth and averaged about 186 000 new jobs a month  Mr  Trump would have to create at least 100 000 more jobs each month to bring growth up to and substantially improve living standards for ordinary working Americans 
Generally  company announcements include  before the president s surprise election  For example  Lockheed Martin  NYSE LMT  CEO Marillyn Hewson promised 1 800 jobs at its Fort Worth factory after meeting with the persuasive president  but those include some 1 000 that were announced in 2015 
Most deals announced only create 1 000 to 2 000 jobs  Calculating generously  Trump would need 50 new deals each month  a Herculean task to hit his growth goals 
Even if Trump found the time for so much jawboning and enlisted Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross  the administration would quickly run out of big companies who could afford to placate the president s demands 
In fairness  Trump is countering foreign government practices that sway multinationals to manufacture abroad even when U S  locations may make good economic sense 
China tightly regulates foreign investment and requires most American companies to take joint venture partners  Often  these deals entail shifting production and R D to access the Chinese market 
In Germany  Volkswagen  DE VOWG p  to accommodate the next generation of automation and mass produce electric vehicles  Thanks to German law  the union and the government of Lower Saxony combine to hold a majority of seats on the company board  creating a decided preference for domestic over foreign locations 
All this notwithstanding  congress and the president must recognize other countries have done a lot in recent years to become more competitive  For example  Mexico has negotiated an extensive network of free trade agreements  U S  and foreign auto makers can make cars and parts there for sale duty free throughout North America  Europe and Japan that is not something automakers can do in the United States  Given the dependence of the U S  industry on components from Mexico  it is not at all clear that the United States would come out the winner in a trade war 
U S  corporate tax rates are much higher than elsewhere and business regulations have grown more burdensome in recent years  And comprehensive free trade agreements that accomplish fair market access  currency reform and balanced trade are sorely needed to motivate scores more businesses to keep manufacturing  R D and administrative activities here without presidential attention 
Tax and regulatory reform face barriers posed by divisions within the Republican Party in congress  opposition from Democrats and the bureaucratic requirements of legislation that slow rule changes  And his new trade policy document emphasizes lodging individual company complaints against foreign governments instead  for example  of taking on China to accomplish comprehensive compliance with its WTO commitments 
Unfortunately  the impulse to rely on individual deals runs deep in the new administration that s how Messrs  Trump  Mnuchin and Ross amassed fortunes 
As businessmen  they were great at exploiting the system including controversial records of lobbying for protection and outsourcing jobs  Now they must try their hands at accomplishing radical systemic reform and need cooperation from congress and foreign governments  where leaders have ideas of their own and can t be fired by Trump 
Presidential blustering can motivate negotiating partners to offer some quick  token results but it won t work well for making the really big deals America needs to prosper again ",2017-03-21,Peter Morici,https://www.investing.com/analysis/trump’s-jawboning-won’t-deliver-enough-jobs-200179646,200179646
135137,356652,LMT,Can Defense Sector Cross Hurdles On Its Path To Growth ,opinion,"The U S  has been the world s largest defense consumer since World War II  Iraq and Afghanistan wars in the past have given a boost to spending on weaponry and armed forces  pushing the U S  defense market to historic heights  However  the winding down of these wars and severe pressure to lower the national debt burden following the country s major financial distress since the Great Depression had cast a long shadow over the U S  defense budget 
In fact  continued budget cuts by the U S  Department of Defense  DoD  took its toll on the U S  aerospace and defense industry in the past couple of years  Although the current macroeconomic factors and President Donald Trump s promise of spending  bigly  are in favor of the nation s economic growth  rising rate hikes and an ever strengthening U S  dollar have instilled concerns that this growth might be short lived  In certain times  the U S  government might not be able to fulfill its promise of spending amply on defense companies 
Various regulations imposed on international trade of defense equipment remain significant barriers to this sector s growth  Moreover   disproportionate  cuts to modernization and research and development funding could act as major impediments to defense players 
Below we discuss the headwinds that could weigh on the aerospace and defense sector in the near term 
Market Pricing Scenario  There is no reason to doubt that the Trump administration s pledge to substantially ramp up defense spending has given a boost to the U S  aerospace and defense industry  However  the aerospace sector has hardly been cheap after Trump took over  In fact  over the last five years  the sector traded as high as 18 7x forward 12 month earnings estimates and as low as 10 6x  It is currently trading at 18 2x forward 12 month EPS estimates toward the high end of this five year range and also higher than the S P 500 index s 17 7x forward 12 month EPS estimates 
Also  the company s Price Book Value ratio of 7 92 was higher than that of the market s ratio of 3 54 over the last 5 years  This indicates that the aerospace sector is already overvalued when compared to market value and any further upside is unlikely 
Regulatory Impediments  The Aerospace   Defense industry is subject to multiple regulatory standards in the markets they serve  including safety  fuel economy  emissions control and chemicals use  In addition  the industry must comply with regulations related to government contracting and international trade  In the U S   several agencies within the federal government have jurisdiction over various aspects of the Aerospace   Defense industry 
To comply  companies bear heavy costs  In addition  certain U S  government contracts span one or more base years and multiple option years  The U S  government generally has the right not to exercise option periods and may not exercise an option period for various reasons  which in turn might hamper revenue growth of defense corporations 
Further  companies in this industry must manage price and environmental expectations in order to meet government requests for proposals  RFPs   which seek to align contract work with broader government goals  In trying to meet such regulations  at times  companies are compelled to forgo a part of their profits  which in turn affects the growth of the entire sector 
Budget Loopholes  The recently proposed FY 2018 defense budget and the appropriations put forward by Trump s administration for FY 2017 are expected to bring in military stability  But one cannot overlook the risk of an economic downturn 
Indeed Trump s FY 2018 budget proposal itself seems to be a threat to the growth of the nation s economy  While the  America First Budget  proposed a 10  hike in the defense spending  to avoid any further budget deficit  Trump s plan includes a simultaneous decline in spending in non defense programs  particularly foreign aid  agriculture  commerce  education  energy  environment protection agency  EPA  and health 
Now it is true that increasing fiscal budget deficit put immense pressure on an economy under huge debt  slowing down its growth trajectory  But to ensure a balanced budget  it is not wise to sacrifice the other pillars of the economy  Stability in economy is not guaranteed only by the departments of justice  defense and homeland security  Neither does social security depend only on the strength of a defense system  Qualities of health  education as well as environmental services are also crucial to a nation s well being  Many analysts fear that such deep cuts in these sectors that offer the basic amenities of life might shake the very foundation of the U S  economy 
Among the sectors that will suffer the most  the EPA s operating budget would be cut by 25  eliminating approximately 3 000 jobs and reducing its total staff from 15 000 to 12 000   This would not only raise the unemployment rate but also hurt programs dealing with air and water pollution and climate change research 
Indeed  Trump s budget seems to have created an economic conflict in America  with concerns that reducing funds for these important industries might do more harm than good  Going forward  under Trump s planned budget cuts  federal spending is likely to see a  10 5 trillion reduction over 10 years   However  if the reduction is not even among all federal departments  everyone will suffer severe economic repercussions in times of recession 
Also  the 10  hike promised by Trump in FY 2018 s defense budget might not be kept if the  30 billion appropriations that he proposed for FY 2017 are accepted 
Rate Hike   Strong U S  Dollar  A gradually recovering economy  at least in the near term  with increased consumer spending and lower unemployment has set the stage for a series of rate hikes in the U S  As a result  we witnessed a hike of a quarter point in the lending rate last month  following last December s hike and projections of two more hikes this year  Although rate hike reflects stability in the economy  it pumps up the credit rate that banks extend to their customers  Aerospace defense being a highly capital intensive industry  such a rate hike is not good news for its expansion 
Also  a rate hike magnifies borrowing costs for the government  thereby raising national debt  Presently  the national debt is approximately  20 trillion  which itself raises questions as to whether adding more to this number will prove any wiser  Higher public debt might drag the economy to the path of decelerated growth and put pressure on U S  taxpayers 
Moreover  positive economic data boost expectation of more rate hikes from the U S  Federal Reserve which in turn leads to the U S dollar appreciation  This affects U S  based companies as a strong dollar is not only proving to be a currency translation drag  but is also having a bearing on foreign military sales 
With the Fed set to hike rates twice this year  dollar should also be on an uptrend  As a result  U S  based defense companies earning from overseas operations will be deeply affected  A stronger dollar might also damage the nation s export competitiveness 
Intense Competition  Aerospace and defense companies vie among themselves for a finite number of small and large programs 
Moreover  China is developing space technologies aimed at blocking U S  military communications  per a report commissioned by a panel formed by Congress  China s goal is to become a space power as forceful as the U S  and to promote a space industry equal to those in the U S  and Europe 
In the same line of action  as per a report by CNBC  Russian defense officials have acknowledged deploying radar imagery jammers and developing laser weapons designed to blind U S  intelligence and ballistic missile defense satellites  Russia and China continue to pursue weapon systems capable of destroying satellites on orbit  placing U S  satellites at greater risk for the next few years 
North Korea has also been giving the U S  a hard time lately on the defense frontier  Last month  the two countries got engaged in a hostile missile rift when North Korea fired four ballistic missiles into the waters off its east coast  In retaliation  the U S  military deployed Lockheed Martin Corp  s  LMT  THAAD anti ballistic missile system in South Korea 
Given the looming headwinds  we advise investors against names that offer little growth opportunity over the near term  These include companies for which estimate revision trends reflect a bearish sentiment 
We remain apprehensive of Zacks Rank  4  Sell  stocks like General Dynamics  Inc   GD   AAR Corp   AIR  and Wesco Aircraft Holdings  Inc   WAIR   You can see  
Our Take
It is true that the aerospace   defense industry has remained mostly stable amid economic downturns  thanks to its non cyclical nature  On top of that  the rise in global geopolitical uncertainty is expected to bring good fortunes for it 
Yet we cannot overlook issues like global competition  rapid changes in technology  national and worldwide economic conditions and global policies affecting defense stocks  Also  aerospace manufacturers now giving more emphasis on commercial aviation 
The fast changing world with rising global uncertainty requires the aerospace and defense industry to act with speed and flexibility  We believe that careful management and prudent spending will help the industry to overcome its headwinds

 signed two orders today to move forward with construction of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines  Trump campaigned on promises to increase domestic energy industry production and before taking office indicated he supported completion of the Dakota pipeline and revival of the Keystone XL project 
Environmental activists broadly opposed the Keystone XL pipeline and campaigned against it for more than seven years  Shares of ETP  NYSE ETP   the company building the 450 000 barrel a day Dakota line  rose 3 5 percent  Trump owned ETP stock through at least mid 2016  per financial disclosure forms  and ETP s chief executive  Kelcy Warren  donated  100 000 to his campaign  U S  Energy Secretary nominee Rick Perry was until recently on ETP s board 
Coincidentally  the Canadian government today reported a pipeline spill in the western Canadian province of Saskatchewan has leaked about 52 000 gallons of oil  The spill came seven months after another major incident in Saskatchewan  in which a Husky Energy Inc   OTC HUSKF  pipeline leaked 60 000 gallons into a major river and cut off the drinking water supply for two cities 
Trump s administration has also asked the Environmental Protection Agency to temporarily halt all contracts  grants and interagency agreements pending a review

The proposed merger of health insurers Aetna  NYSE AET  and Humana  NYSE HUM  has been blocked on antitrust grounds  A federal judge said the tie up would threaten competition and would ve resulted in higher prices and reduced services for seniors who buy Medicare Advantage  Aetna will owe Humana a  1 billion breakup fee 
You may recall that Aetna threatened the government last summer with pulling out of 11 of the 15 states where it participated in the Obamacare individual insurance markets  claiming it was a  business decision   The threat was made while the Department of Justice was investigating the merger but before it filed its antitrust lawsuit  After the lawsuit was filed  Aetna followed through on its threat 
However  in an opinion on the case  the judge wrote that it wasn t just a  business decision   there was more to it   Aetna tried to leverage its participation in the exchanges for favorable treatment from DOJ regarding the proposed merger   Aetna then tried to cover up that connection between the threat to pull out of those markets and the antitrust investigation to the point where the  repeated efforts to conceal a paper trail about the decision making process  bordered on  malfeasance   he wrote 
U S  District Judge Bates determined that there was  persuasive evidence that when Aetna later withdrew from the 17 counties  it did not do so for business reasons  but instead to follow through on the threat that it made earlier

	Staffing companies stand to gain the most from such initiatives  Jobless claims staying at its lowest level in more than four decades  unemployment rate declining considerably and the economy adding jobs at a steady clip  also bode well for such companies Trump Plans to Bring Back Millions of Jobs
	Trump turned to manufacturing executives and powerful business leaders  praising their efforts toward generating jobs in the U S  and pledged to bring back jobs  which corporate America has outsourced to other countries in search of cheaper labor 
	In his first month in office  Trump insisted many top executives to hire in the U S   while he promised to roll out favorable proposals  including a plan to overhaul the tax code and increase in infrastructure spending that was part of his 2016 presidential campaign promises  These measures will eventually help companies create jobs  He also touched on his plans of deporting illegal immigrants to Mexico  while Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is already in Mexico on what Trump described as a  tough trip  
	U S  has lost more than five million manufacturing jobs since 2000  mostly due to lower wages  automation and foreign competition  Many companies look at trimming their employment costs by moving jobs to places were workers are paid a lot less than that in the U S  Trump added that a lot of manufacturing jobs were lost since the U S  joined the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994  while around 70 000 factories were shut down since China joined the World Trade Organization almost 16 years ago Manufacturing Executives Ecstatic

	Lest we forget that the unemployment rate has dropped to an impressive 4 8   while the labor market is close to or at full employment level  Unemployment figures continue to decline as many companies are searching for jobs and are also holding on to their employees as the economy continues to gather steam at a steady pace  The U S  economy had already added 227 000 jobs during the month of January  the best monthly job gains since September  read more     3 Best Staffing Stocks to Buy Now

135198,356713,LMT,Germany may decide soon on smaller transport planes  defense minister,news,By Sabine Siebold BERLIN  Reuters    Germany s defense minister says a decision may be made soon on acquiring smaller military transport planes to cover a serious gap in capabilities once the Transall transporter leaves service in 2021  NATO member Germany is part of a European consortium that funded development by Airbus of the A400M transport plane  But German studies have said there is a need for extra planes that can land at sites with  minimal infrastructure   which they say are challenging for the A400M  The smaller Transall transporters  which date back to the 1960s  are able to land in tight spots on rough terrain  but will be retired in 2021   German officials say they first recognized looming  significant capability gaps  in the mobility  deployability and endurance of its transport fleet in 2008  but the issue has taken on new importance as Transall s retirement nears   I am optimistic that we will be able to provide answers this autumn   Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen told Reuters in an interview   That includes how we want to cover the expected capability gap for the time after 2021   Von der Leyen declined comment on whether Germany could buy C 130J Super Hercules transport planes built by  Lockheed Martin  Corp  NYSE LMT  on its own  or with other  countries  She said Germany was working with other countries involved in the A400M program about how to cover needs not addressed by the new transport plane   Since the A400M was a joint program by several countries  we are examining whether we could fill this gap with some of those countries   she added   We are in talks with several countries that are very interested in such a cooperation   Von der Leyen did not name those countries  but sources familiar with the matter said Germany had been in discussions with France  which has already decided to buy 4 C 130J aircraft  It has also been in touch with Britain  which was the launch customer for the J model of Lockheed s workhorse C 130s in 1998 and has said it is looking at selling some of the first C 130Js it bought  Airbus says it is meeting the specifications set out for the larger military transport  and says the A400M has demonstrated  outstanding unpaved runway capabilities which are superior to any aircraft in service today    Airbus spokesman Kieran Daly said the plane was already certified to use gravel runways at its maximum weight and flight testing of its ability to land on grass and soft soil runways had been completed   There are  of course  some airfields in the world where the taxiways or ramp area are not capable of supporting the weight of any heavy aircraft  This is entirely unconnected from an aircraft s unpaved runway capability   he said  Military experts say Germany will still need a smaller transport outside the A400M to carry out specific missions at remote sites for which the new transport was not designed   The A400M has only a very limited ability to land at unprepared runways   said one military expert   The danger of damage to the airplane during landings is just too great   Government sources said in the past that the purchase of additional planes would be a last resort  with officials hoping to develop a multinational solution  such as leasing transport capabilities from Britain  the United States or France   Germany has also looked at buying planes with other countries and operating them together   Von der Leyen declined comment on the total sum of fines that Airbus faced for delays in deliveries of its A400M aircraft  She said negotiations were continuing on that issue   Under the current contract  each day of delay costs the company money  The total sum will depend on how quickly the manufacturer can solve its problems and deliver what was promised   she said ,2016-09-29,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/germany-may-decide-soon-on-smaller-transport-planes:-defense-minister-429349,429349

135200,356715,LMT,North Korean missile advances expose Japan in two decade arms race  sources,news,"By Nobuhiro Kubo and Tim Kelly TOKYO  Reuters    Successful rocket tests have propelled North Korea ahead in a two decade long arms race with Japan  leaving Tokyo unsure it could fend off a missile strike by the Pyongyang regime without U S  help  military sources told Reuters   Under young leader Kim Jong Un  North Korea has test fired 21 ballistic missiles since the start of the year  an unprecedented burst of activity that has rattled its neighbors and the international community   Their progress has been faster than anticipated   a senior Japanese military commander said   There is a limit to what our current ballistic missile defense system can achieve   he added  asking not to be identified because he isn t authorized to speak to the media  Planned upgrades to Japan s ballistic missile defense  BMD  are not due to begin until April at the earliest  while the deployment of new systems designed to destroy incoming warheads could take years to complete   Constrained by production schedules and tight budgets that limit its ability to accelerate those plans  Japan may instead have to lean more heavily on its U S  ally to guard against attacks  the sources said   Our only option for now may be to rely on the U S  to stop them   said another source at Japan Self Defence Forces  SDF   MUSUDAN THREAT Tokyo and Pyongyang have been locked in an arms race since 1998 when North Korea fired a missile over Japan   In June  a medium range Musudan rocket reached an altitude of 1 000 km  620 miles  on a lofted trajectory  marking a breakthrough that could allow Pyongyang lob warheads over the range of Japanese BMD Aegis destroyers patrolling the Sea of Japan  That would leave older PAC 3 Patriot missile batteries protecting major cities including Tokyo as a last line of defense  A  1 billion program to improve their range and accuracy will begin after March  but the first will not be ready until the 2020 Tokyo Olympics  sources previously told Reuters  Warheads from missiles such as Pyongyang s Rodong  with an estimated range of 1 300 km  800 miles   travel at speeds of up to 3 km  1 9 miles  a second  But rockets like the Musudan  which can fly as far as 3 000 km  1 860 miles   plunge from space at speeds reaching 21 km  13 miles  per second  potentially too fast for existing Patriot batteries  Japan s Ministry of Defense also plans to improve the performance of SM 3 missiles on its small Aegis fleet  The SM 3 missiles are designed to hit warheads at the edge of space  but the sources who spoke to Reuters were unsure they could tackle the Musudan  A more powerful version of the SM 3 jointly developed by Japan and the United States  dubbed the Block IIA  is nearing completion  with Japan planning to buy the first of those next year  It has not  however  said how many it will acquire  or when they will be deployed  Longer term  Japan is evaluating whether to buy  Lockheed Martin   NYSE LMT  Corp s Terminal High Altitude Air Defence  THAAD  system  to add a middle layer to BMD  or build Aegis batteries on shore to bolster its defenses   Any roll out of those  however  would take several years because of time needed to study the technology  secure funding and build and integrate the systems  the sources said   U S  HELP As Japan struggles to bolster its defenses  the U S  is stepping up help to neighboring South Korea  promising last week to speed up deployment THAAD batteries there   We still think they need time  but whatever the purpose is  the North is doing things at a rate that is beyond our imagination   South Korean Defence Minister Han Min koo said in parliament in late August Pentagon spokesman Commander Gary Ross said the United States had recently reaffirmed its  unwavering and ironclad  commitment to defend both South Korea and Japan   guaranteed by the full spectrum of U S  military capabilities  including conventional  nuclear  and missile defense capabilities    We continue to support  South Korean  and Japanese efforts to strengthen their respective defense capabilities against the North Korean nuclear and missile threat   Ross said in an emailed response   For now  Japan is making do with a diminished force  It has four Aegis destroyers each equipped with eight SM 3 missiles  Two of those  however  are laid up for maintenance leaving only two available to watch for North Korean missiles  a third SDF source told Reuters   The heightened threat  comes just as we face a pinch with our Aegis fleet   he said   Cooperation with the U S  Aegis ships deployed in Japan is going to be crucial    By March 2019 Japan plans eight BMD Aegis ships  but training and maintenance means that only two ships will likely be out on regular patrols at any one time  U S  reinforcements that could help cover more sky are  however  sailing into the region  The U S  Navy  as part of a plan to bolster its presence formulated before North Korea s latest missiles tests  has increased its BMD Aegis ships patrolling the region to ten from seven in the past two years  Whether that will prove sufficient to protect against further North Korean advances is yet to be seen

Q1 Earnings and Guidance 

	On November 17th PLCE released its third quarter earnings with a 14  beat  The company reported  2 29 verse the  2 03 expected  Revenue came in at  473 8 million verse the  460 million expected  Gross margins year over year ticked higher to 41  from 39 6   while same store sales came in at 4 6

Stock Surges

	Headed into earnings the stock was already in full blown bounce mode  After the election  the stock ran from  75 to  90 in just over a week  After the numbers came out  it jumped another 14 points to  104  A total move of 38  just since the election  While some investors have missed a lot of the move already  any pullbacks should be considered  as estimates for the company continue to rise higher 

Estimate Revisions

Slashing guidance 

	On September 27th Tempur issued 2016 revenue guidance of  3  to  1  year over year  This implied revenue would be at  3 06 3 12 billion verse the  3 23 billion expected 

	The stock plummeted over 25  to test 2016 lows  CEO Scott Thompson had some comments on the quarter to try to calm investors 

	 While our net sales are below expectations  our operational initiatives are going well and are continuing to drive considerable margin expansion  The net impact of the revenue shortfall and our continued margin expansion is that we felt it was appropriate to lower the midpoint of our adjusted EBITDA guidance by 5   The midpoint of this updated guidance implies an increase in adjusted EBITDA of approximately 12  and approximately 20  growth in adjusted earnings per share compared to 2015  

	While the stock has bounced off the lows since the company release earnings on October 27th  estimates don t look great for the long term 

Estimates revisions are headed lower

	Looking at company s revisions  investors can see how another move lower might happen  In just the last 60 days  estimates for 2016 have been taken 6  lower  While estimates for 2017 have been taken 7  lower  While there is a recent uptick  the overall trend is lower and the stock should follow the trend

135232,356747,LMT,Lockheed F 35 fighter shows off capabilities at UK air show,news,"By Andrea Shalal
RAF FAIRFORD  England  Reuters     Lockheed Martin  Corp s  N LMT  F 35 fighter jets made their first appearance at the world s largest military air show on Friday  in what U S  and British generals described as part of a larger drive to bolster NATO s defenses in Europe 
Six F 35 jets  including one owned by Britain  were on display at the Royal International Air Tattoo  drawing cheers from huge crowds two years after engine trouble and a fleetwide grounding prevented their international debut at the show 
One F 35 jet flight simulated refueling in midair  another showcased the aircraft flying with the F 22 Raptor fighter jet  also built by Lockheed  and a third showed how the jets can hover and land vertically 
U S  Air Force Chief of Staff General David Goldfein told reporters the flights were meant to send a strong signal to Russia and other possible foes about NATO s resolve 
 This is a message to anyone internationally about what we bring to the fight with our coalition partners   he said  adding that the new jets  ability to gather and share intelligence represented the future of warfare 
The flights came as NATO leaders agreed to deploy military forces to Eastern Europe and increase air and sea patrols to reassure allies who were once part of the Soviet bloc following Russia s seizure of Crimea from Ukraine 
Launched 15 years ago  the world s largest weapons program was plagued for years by cost overruns and technical challenges  but with more than 180 F 35 jets now flying it is finally hitting its stride 
Production costs are coming down  the U S  Air Force is poised to declare an initial squadron of jets ready for combat later this year  and new customers including Belgium and Switzerland are interested in buying the planes 
Lockheed is building three variants of the plane for the U S  military  Britain  Turkey  Australia  Italy  Denmark  Norway  the Netherlands  Israel  Japan and South Korea  It expects to sell 3 000 jets in coming decades  with production expected to peak at around 170 180 airplanes a year around 2023  according to Lockheed officials 
The U S  Marine Corps last week launched a second operational squadron of jets  and will send an initial squadron of 10 jets to Iwakuni  Japan  in January  said U S  Lieutenant General Jon Davis  deputy Marine Corps commandant for aviation 
 This program is maturing  We re building mass and velocity  capability and confidence   Davis said in an interview 
Minister of Defence Procurement Philip Dunne said Britain was on track to declare an initial operational capability of the F 35 jets in 2018  and they would be deployed at sea once the new Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier was done ",2016-07-08,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/lockheed-f-35-fighter-shows-off-capabilities-at-uk-air-show-413336,413336

A drop in the value of the British pound could help lower some costs  since 15 percent of the jet is built by UK firms ",2016-07-09,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/pentagon-says-near-deal-with-lockheed-for-more-f-35-fighter-jets-413385,413385

135248,356763,LMT,Is Something Up  Defense Contractors Near 52 Week Highs,opinion,"In a few months  the U S  will inaugurate a new president 
This changing of the guard could bring some big changes to America s foreign policy  And in 2016  the foremost foreign policy issue is  and stabilizing Iraq and Syria 
It s imperative that the next president has a solid and actionable plan for the Middle East  Otherwise  many years of intelligence gathering and measured interventions could go to waste 
That possibility seems to be freaking out our current defense leadership 

Defense Contractors  Suspiciously Bullish
In recent weeks  the stocks of many defense contractors have climbed higher  A bunch of them are at or near 52 week highs  It seems like the Pentagon is concerned about its new boss  And it wants to buy as much arsenal as possible before it meets him or her 

Raytheon Company  NYSE RTN  and Booz Allen Hamilton Holding  NYSE BAH  are up more than 20  this past year  Lockheed Martin  NYSE  NYSE LMT  and United Technologies  NYSE  NYSE UTX  both hit annual highs in the last couple months 
In the case of Lockheed  we can see what caused the recent rally  But it brings up more questions than it answers  Shares have been climbing all summer  after Lockheed smashed second quarter earnings estimates  It surprised analysts by a whopping 13 7   United Technologies has seen similar performance  beating Q2 estimates by 10 3  
It s abundantly clear that defense spending is on the rise in recent months  Why  We don t quite know  That sort of information is usually classified 
And there s another indicator that suggests something big is going on in the defense community 
Rumors of a Military Buildup
Recently  reporters caught wind that President Obama has deployed an additional 600 troops to Iraq  They re going to assist Iraqi forces in retaking Mosul  the largest city under ISIS control 
That brings the total deployment up to 5 000 soldiers in Iraq  Plus an undisclosed number of special operators in Syria 

So let s put all these things together  We re seeing a spike in defense spending  Defense contractor stocks have been rallying toward a 52 week high  US allied local forces are converging on Mosul  And about four months from now  we ll have new people in the White House 
At Investment U  we re financial analysts  not military analysts  But these occurrences suggest the Pentagon is preparing for a final push into Iraq and Syria  It wants to go on the offensive and deal a fatal blow to ISIS before the next president is inaugurated 
And if that s the case  the market effects could be huge

135249,356764,LMT,South Korea  U S  to deploy THAAD missile defense  drawing China rebuke,news,"By Jack Kim SEOUL  Reuters    South Korea and the United States said on Friday they would deploy an advanced missile defense system in South Korea to counter the threat from nuclear armed North Korea  drawing a sharp and swift protest from neighboring China   The Terminal High Altitude Area Defense  or THAAD  anti missile system will be used only as protection against North Korea s growing nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities  South Korea s Defence Ministry and the U S  Defense Department said   This is an important     decision   General Vincent Brooks  commander of U S  forces in South Korea  said in a statement   North Korea s continued development of ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction require the alliance to take this prudent  protective measure to bolster our     missile defense   The announcement came a day after the U S  Treasury Department blacklisted leader North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for human rights abuses  North Korea called this  a declaration of war  and vowed a tough response  Beijing said on Friday it lodged complaints with the U S  and South Korean ambassadors over the THAAD decision  It also criticized the decision to impose sanctions on the leader of its ally North Korea  Analysts say the U S  moves are likely to further raise tensions between Washington and Beijing ahead of an international court ruling due on Tuesday in a case the Philippines  a U S  ally  has brought against China s extensive claims in the South China Sea   China said the THAAD system would destabilize the regional security balance without achieving anything to end North Korea s nuclear program  China is North Korea s main ally but it opposes its pursuit of nuclear weapons and backed tough new United Nations sanctions against Pyongyang in March   China strongly urges the United States and South Korea to stop the deployment process of the THAAD anti missile system  not take any steps to complicate the regional situation and do nothing to harm China s strategic security interests   China s Foreign Ministry said  A South Korean Defence Ministry official said selection of a site for THAAD could come  within weeks   and the allies were working to have it operational by the end of 2017   It will be deployed to U S  Forces Korea  to protect alliance military forces   a joint statement said  The United States maintains 28 500 troops in South Korea  a legacy of the 1950 53 Korean war   It will be focused solely on North Korean nuclear and missile threats and would not be directed towards any third party nations   the statement said   SEVEN SUMMITS The decision to deploy THAAD is the latest move to squeeze the increasingly isolated North Korea  but China worries the system s radar will be able to track its own military capabilities  Russia is also opposed to the basing of a THAAD system in South Korea  Its foreign ministry will take the deployment into account in Moscow s military planning  Interfax news agency quoted it as saying on Friday  Bonnie Glaser  an Asia expert at Washington s Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank  said the U S  moves raised tensions with China ahead of the South China Sea ruling but doubted Beijing would reduce cooperation on North Korea   Chinese policy toward North Korea  including the degree to which they implement sanctions  is based on China s interests and those will not change as a consequence of this decision   she said   The Chinese overreached  thinking they had sufficient leverage over South Korea to prevent the deployment  They miscalculated  The U S  and Japan have cooperated on missile defense and in many other ways that China has opposed  and Beijing has not retaliated   Japan has said it is considering another layer of ballistic missile defense  such as THAAD  to complement ship borne missiles aboard Aegis destroyers in the Sea of Japan and its ground based Patriot missiles  Japanese Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Koichi Hagiuda said Tokyo supported the Korean deployment  because it bolsters security in the region   TRUMP S ARGUMENT THAAD is built by  Lockheed Martin  Corp  N LMT  and designed to defend against short  and medium range ballistic missiles by intercepting them high in the Earth s atmosphere  or outside it  The United States already has a THAAD system in Guam  Each system costs an estimated  800 million and is likely to add to the cost of maintaining the U S  military presence in South Korea  an issue in the U S  presidential campaign  Republican candidate Donald Trump has argued that U S  allies South Korea and Japan should pay more toward their own defense  Michael Elleman  a contributor to Washington based North Korea monitoring project 38 North  cautioned that the system would not offer absolute protection against a North Korean attack as Pyongyang would likely develop counter measures  such as by launching missiles in salvos to overwhelm the defences  A joint South Korea U S  working group has been discussing the feasibility of deployment and potential locations for the THAAD since February  This followed a North Korean space launch in February that was condemned by the U N  Security Council as a test of a long range missile in disguise and the country s fourth nuclear test a month earlier  
North Korea launched an intermediate range ballistic missile off its east coast in late June  a test that was believed to show some advancement in the weapon s engine system ",2016-07-08,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/south-korea,-u.s.-agree-to-deploy-thaad-missile-defense-to-counter-north-korea-threat-413146",413146

135284,356799,LMT,How France sank Japan s  40 billion Australian submarine dream  ,news,"By Tim Kelly  Cyril Altmeyer and Colin Packham TOKYO PARIS SYDNEY  Reuters    In 2014  a blossoming friendship between Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott and his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe looked to have all but sewn up a  40 billion submarine deal  Then French naval contractor DCNS hatched a bold and seemingly hopeless plan to gatecrash the party  Almost 18 months later  France this week secured a remarkable come from behind victory on one of the world s most lucrative defense deals  The result  Tokyo s dream of fast tracking a revival of its arms export industry is left in disarray  Interviews with more than a dozen Japanese  French  Australian and German government and industry officials show how a series of missteps by a disparate Japanese group of ministry officials  corporate executives and diplomats badly undermined their bid   In particular  Japan misread the changing political landscape in Australia as Abbott fell from favor  The Japanese group  which included Mitsubishi Heavy Industries  MHI   T 7011  and Kawasaki Heavy Industries  KHI    T 7012  also failed to clearly commit to providing skilled shipbuilding jobs in Australia  And Tokyo realized far too late its bid was being outflanked by the Germans and particularly the French  the sources involved in the bid said   France  on the other hand  mobilized its vast and experienced military industrial complex and hired a powerful Australian submarine industry insider  Sean Costello  who led it to an unexpected victory  Japan s loss represents a major setback for Abe s push to develop an arms export industry as part of a more muscular security agenda after decades of pacifism   We put our utmost effort into the bid   the head of the Ministry of Defense s procurement agency Hideaki Watanabe said after the result was announced on Tuesday   We will do a thorough analysis of what impact the result will have on our defense industry   By the end of 2014  Japan was still comfortably in the driving seat thanks to the relationship between Abe and Abbott  which had begun soon after Abbott s 2013 election and strengthened quickly  Japan and Australia   key allies of the United States   had wanted to cement security ties to counter to China s growing assertiveness in the South China Sea and beyond  FRENCH OVERTURES Still  France saw an opportunity to get into the game  In November 2014  DCNS CEO Herve Guillou prevailed on French Defence Minister Jean Yves Le Drian to visit Australia and start the pitch for France  Le Drian traveled to Albany in the country s remote southwest  where officials had gathered to commemorate the 100 year anniversary of the first sailing of Australian soldiers to fight on France s Western Front during World War One   The poignant shared history opened the door to discussions about the submarine contract  a source close to the French Ministry of Defense told Reuters    The French minister wished to be there for this important event  There  he held talks with his Australian counterpart David Johnston and with     Abbott   said the source  who along with other officials asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to speak to the media   FIGHTING FOR JOBS Soon after  however  Australia s political instability would erode Japan s advantage with the old guard   In December 2014  Johnston  the Australian defense minister  was forced to resign after disparaging the skills of Australian shipbuilders   South Australian lawmakers  worried that Abbott had quietly agreed to Japan supplying the new submarines  insisted the government look at options to build them in their state  They pressured the prime minister into holding a competitive tender which DCNS and Germany s ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems  DE TKAG  quickly joined   In February 2015  Abbott called his  best friend in Asia   as he had previously described Abe  to tell him about the new bidding process  Abe sympathized and said he would do his best to comply  two sources with knowledge of the conversation said   Yet  convinced the deal was still in the bag  Japan s bidding group dithered    Even though we were in the competition we acted as though nothing had changed   said one Japanese government source involved in the bid   We thought we had already won  so why do anything to rock the boat    The Japanese did not attend a conference for the Future Submarines project in March  failing to understand the importance of the crucial lobbying event and leaving the field to their German and French rivals  sources within the Japanese bid said  Japan s belated attempt to engage with potential local suppliers at a follow up event in August 2015 went badly  Companies complained Tokyo was unwilling to discuss substantive deals  Having only ever sold arms to Japan s military because of a decades old ban on exports that Abe lifted in 2014  neither Japanese company had any Australian military industrial partners  And unlike France and Germany which quickly committed to building the submarines in Australia  Japan initially only said it would follow the bidding rules  which required building in Australia as just one of three options   The Japanese had been invited in on a handshake deal and were left trying to compete in an international competition having no experience in doing such a thing   an Australian defense industry source said   By September 2015  Japan s key ally Abbott had been deposed by Malcolm Turnbull  blowing the competition wide open  LOCAL EXPERTS Industry officials said all of the sub offerings had some drawbacks  meaning other factors including experience and connections came into play  Crucially  in April 2015  DCNS hired Costello  who had earlier that year lost his job as chief of staff of Australia s Defence Ministry in the wake of Johnston s resignation   A former navy submariner who had also been the general manager for strategy at state run Australian submarine firm ASC  Costello was ideally placed to lead a bid  Had the Japanese called first  Costello would have likely have accepted an offer to head their bid  according to a source who knows Costello   They didn t pick up the phone   he said  Costello declined to speak publicly about the bid  Costello s team drew up a list of a dozen tasks DCNS needed to complete to win the deal  including the critical job of winning over U S  defense companies  Lockheed Martin  Corp  N LMT  and  Raytheon Co   N RTN   one of which will eventually build the submarine s combat system  In a final coordinated push  a huge delegation of French government and business leaders visited Australia a month ago  touting the economic benefits of their bid  LATE JAPANESE PUSH Finally stung to action  Japan ramped up its campaign in September 2015  Senior defense bureaucrat Masaki Ishikawa stepped in to unite what had until then been a disjointed approach spread around various ministries  the Japanese ambassador in Canberra  Sumio Kusaka  and MHI   Japan began talking about investment and development opportunities beyond defense  including the possibility of opening a lithium ion battery plant in Australia  while MHI opened an Australia unit  In a last ditch attempt to woo Australia  Japan sent one of its Soryu submarines to Sydney this month  But as it sailed home on Tuesday  Turnbull announced the deal had gone to DCNS   In an echo of his first Albany trip  Le Drian heard of France s win on Monday as he attended an ANZAC Day service for Australia s war dead in northwestern France  For Tokyo  another big international defense competition that could help Japan develop the arms export industry that Abe envisaged is unlikely any time soon   A more likely tack will be joint development projects with overseas partners to embed Japanese companies in military industrial supply chains  That might even include components for Australia s French submarines  one source in Tokyo said   Other Japanese officials still want Australia to explain why they lost so they can learn from the painful and bewildering experience

135321,356836,LMT,F 35 fighter jets will cost less to produce  more to operate  Pentagon,news,"By Idrees Ali and Andrea Shalal WASHINGTON  Reuters    The Pentagon on Thursday forecast a 3 percent drop in acquisition costs for  Lockheed Martin  Corp s  N LMT  F 35 fighter jet  but said plans to use the jets six more years would add about  45 billion to the projected operating costs through 2070  The Defense Department s annual report on major weapons programs forecast the total cost of the stealth fighter jet program would reach  1 5 trillion by 2070 including development and procurement  as well as operating costs and inflation  That was up from the previous estimate in 2014 of  1 41 trillion  The F 35 program chief said the projected cost increase in the Pentagon s biggest arms program was due largely to a decision by the services to reduce the jets  annual flying hours to 250 hours from 300   The jets have a service life of 8 000 hours  meaning they would be flying for an additional six years or 1 6 million flying hours  which in turn would add significant operating costs  Bogdan said  Barring that decision  he said  the program would have seen a  22 billion drop in operations and maintenance costs  with annual Navy and Air Force costs down between 2 to 4 percent due to the increasing maturity of the new warplane  Pentagon officials on Wednesday said the program had made steady improvements in cost  schedule and technical performance over the past year  but still faced delays in software development and a complex computer based logistics system  Projected operating and maintenance costs  including inflation  are now seen up 10 percent to  1 12 trillion from  1 02 trillion in last year s report  But Bogdan dismissed the relevance of the long term forecast for operating and maintenance costs  given the difficulty in forecasting fuel costs that far into the future  Lockheed is developing three models of the jet for the U S  military and nine countries that have already placed orders  Britain  Italy  Turkey  the Netherlands  Norway  Australia  Japan  Israel and South Korea  In the statement  the program chief said the F 35A had a decrease in cost of  1 8 million per jet while the remaining two variants saw a decrease of approximately  1 million per jet

135323,356838,LMT,Israel says Mideast arms proliferation imperils its military edge,news,"By Dan Williams
TEL AVIV  Reuters    Israel s neighbors are buying arms on a scale that threatens its regional military superiority  the deputy Israeli air force chief said on Sunday  in remarks that appeared aimed at helping secure more defense aid from a reluctant Washington 
U S  military payouts to Israel  currently around  3 billion annually  expire in 2018  and Israeli officials have spoken of needing around  4 5 billion  U S  officials have balked at such an increase 
At the heart of the dispute is how to perpetuate Israel s qualitative military edge   a guarantee that it gets more advanced U S  weapons than Arab states get  Israel says it needs to bulk up its armed forces  not just upgrade their technologies  to keep ahead of potential foes 
 There are countries here which have plans that are being actualized for arms deals in the hundreds of billions of dollars  for the most advanced Western weaponry and the most advanced Eastern weaponry   Brigadier General Tal Kelman told a conference to promote Israel s purchase of the advanced U S  fighter jet the F 35 
Kelman did not specify countries other than Iran  which the Israelis fear will use sanctions relief from last year s nuclear agreement to build up its ballistic missile program and arm Islamist guerillas like Lebanon s Hezbollah militia 
Some Israeli officials have privately voiced concern about U S  weapons systems being supplied to Western aligned Gulf Arabs  as well as Egyptian interest in advanced Russian arms  though in neither case are the countries openly hostile toward Israel 
 There is a very great danger here  because today s enemy can be tomorrow s friend  and today s friend could be tomorrow s enemy   Kelman told the forum  hosted by Israel Defense magazine and Fisher Brothers Institute for Air and Space Strategic Studies 
 There is a potential here for the erosion of the IDF s  Israel Defence Force  qualitative edge and the IAF s  Israel air force  qualitative edge  
Russia s military intervention last year in Syria s civil war has also worried Israel  given Moscow s dispatch of S 300 and S 400 air defense systems capable of seeing deep into its territory

Deteriorating infrastructure  rising income inequality  elevated pension and medical costs  large current account and government budget deficits are causes of concern  Further  any improvement on the global growth front is yet to be seen  Nonetheless  household spending is likely to continue boosting the U S  economy on the back of a buoyant consumer confidence  solid employment and faster wage growth 

Weak investment levels continue to hamper growth  which is in turn is leading to lower productivity  Thus  the combination of rising wage levels and low productivity will likely pose a threat to profitability of corporates in the coming quarters  In fact  based on these concerns  the International Monetary Fund lowered its outlook for the U S  economic growth rate by 0 2  to 2 2   in its latest global outlook 

In such a scenario  it becomes difficult for investors to pick right stocks  A basic analysis solely based on a stock s fundaments may not be sufficient to take an investment decision on it  Hence  one can rely on broker recommendations  Brokers have a deeper understanding of the impact of economic developments on the stocks and the sectors  so their advice should lead to better returns  Also  an average of all broker recommendations provides the most likely picture of the stock s future

135366,356881,LMT,7 Stocks With Recent Price Strength For Your Portfolio,opinion,In the stock game  winning means reaching a higher price However  finding a win win strategy is easier said than done  In the current highly volatile market  it is difficult for even an ardent investor to come up with a foolproof approach One could resort to commonly used techniques to find beaten down stocks that have the potential to recover faster than others  But this bears the risk of disappointment  Particularly  one could get stuck in the value trap if the hidden weaknesses in selected stocks are not identified So  wouldn t it be safer to look for stocks that are winners currently and have the potential to gain further If you are convinced of this strategy  here s how to execute it One should primarily look for stocks that have recently been witnessing a price increase  Actually  stocks backed by recent price strength have a high chance of carrying the momentum forward If a stock is continuously moving higher  there must be a good reason for the rise or else it probably would have fallen or remained stable  So  looking at stocks that have already won the game and are capable of beating the benchmark that they have set themselves sounds rational However  recent price strength alone cannot create magic  So you need to set other relevant parameters for a successful investment

that the stock moved higher in the last four weeks Percentage Change Price  12 Weeks  greater than 10  This indicates that the stock saw momentum over the last three months  This lowers the risk of choosing stocks that may have drawn attention due to the overwhelming performance of the overall market in a very short span Zacks Rank 1  No matter whether the market conditions are good or bad  stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  have a proven history of outperformance Average Broker Rating 1  This indicates that brokers are also highly hopeful about the stock s future performance Current Price greater than 5  The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher Current Price 52 Week High Low Range more than 85   This criterion filters stocks that are trading near their respective 52 week highs  This indicates that these are strong enough in terms of price Here are seven of the 13 stocks that made it through this screen Innospec Inc    NASDAQ IOSP    formerly known

135398,356913,LMT,Factors That May Unsettle Stable Defense Stocks,opinion,"Granted that geopolitical uncertainty has improved the outlook for the broader defense space  there are still certain issues holding the sector back  The global markets witnessed a Brexit begotten June and the sell off induced by that event  On top of it  weak second quarter economic data has certainly put the brakes on the positive momentum Apart from tepid economic data   disproportionate  cuts to modernization and research and development funding could act as major impediments for the defense industry Below we have discussed the headwinds that might spoil the prospects of the aerospace and defense sectors in the near term Brexit Effect  The U S  and the U K  maintain a close tie when it comes to national security matters  Britain based companies  such as  BAE Systems  LON BAES   develop platforms for the U S  military  and the British military buys goods from U S  companies  such as the F 35 Among the biggest purchases between the two countries  the U K has plans to buy 138 F 35Bs from Lockheed Martin Corp  NYSE LMT    LMT   The decreasing value of the pound means the price tag on these joint strike fighters will go up in the short term  Although this may not hold in the long term  Brexit could weaken the British pound and the euro in the near term  prompting countries to scale back purchases of American made weapons  such as  the F 35 Joint Strike Fighter  which is being bought by Britain  the Netherlands  Denmark and Italy A Positive But Cautious Fed Meet  As expected  the Fed stayed put in its July policy meeting and kept the short term interest rates steady in the 0 25 0 50  band  Although the Fed painted an encouraging picture and said other indicators were pointing to growth  it still believes the domestic economy is still too vulnerable to move rates beyond the 1 4 to 1 2  it established seven months ago Economic Picture  The U S  has been the world s largest defense consumer since World War II  Iraq and Afghanistan wars in the past decade boosted spending  driving it to historic heights  However  the winding down of those wars and severe pressure to lower the national debt burden following the country s major financial distress since the Great Depression had cast a long shadow over the U S defense budget  Although the defense market received the latest two year budget deal with much enthusiasm  as it brought military stability  one cannot overlook the risk of an economic downturn A country s ability to spend on defense is a function of its economic health  The same is true at the global level   the faster the global economy grows  the higher will be the defense spending  Following the global crisis in 2008  there was a marked shift in defense spending growth from the developed to the emerging countries Notably  U S  gross domestic product or GDP  the broadest measure of goods and services produced across the U S   grew at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1 2  in the second quarter  well below market expectations  With this  the economy has grown at less than a 2  pace for three straight quarters The gain marks only a slight acceleration from the first quarter  when GDP advanced at a downwardly revised 0 8  pace  The first quarter was previously seen as increasing 1 1  from the prior period Moreover  the White House has released figures showing that the FY 2016 budget deficit will be  162 billion more than originally projected  That brings the deficit back up to  600 billion after a few years of declining deficits from a high of  1 4 trillion in 2010 Strong U S  Dollar  A gradually recovering U S  economy  slower global growth and expectations of more rate hikes from the U S  Federal Reserve had led to the U S dollar appreciation  This has affected U S  based companies as the strong dollar is not only showing up as a currency translation drag  but is also having a bearing on foreign military sales Although the Fed has held itself from raising interest rates again given market jitters and Brexit concern  it will ultimately resume rate hikes  It has kept its benchmark rate at a record low for seven years  The dollar is expected to gain further if the rates start to climb north  A stronger dollar could damage U S  export competitiveness Will Weapons Programs Be Hit in Fiscal 2017 Budget  The U S  Department of Defense  DoD  announced this February that it plans to purchase fewer F 35 fighter jets from Lockheed Martin over the next five years than it had originally planned  The Pentagon s next

135399,356914,LMT,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  Lockheed Martin  Embraer SA  AAR And Triumph Group,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL   August 08  2016   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses Aerospace   Defense  Part 3  including  Lockheed Martin Corp  NYSE LMT       Embraer SA     AAR Corp       and Triumph Group  Inc     

	Industry  Aerospace   Defense  Part 3

	Link  

	Granted that geopolitical uncertainty has improved the outlook for the broader defense space  there are still certain issues holding the sector back  The global markets witnessed a Brexit begotten June and the sell off induced by that event  On top of it  weak second quarter economic data has certainly put the brakes on the positive momentum 

	Apart from tepid economic data   disproportionate  cuts to modernization and research and development funding could act as major impediments for the defense industry 

	Below we have discussed the headwinds that might spoil the prospects of the aerospace and defense sectors in the near term 

Brexit Effect  The U S  and the U K  maintain a close tie when it comes to national security matters  Britain based companies  such as  BAE Systems  LON BAES   develop platforms for the U S  military  and the British military buys goods from U S  companies  such as the F 35 

	Among the biggest purchases between the two countries  the U K has plans to buy 138 F 35Bs from Lockheed Martin Corp       The decreasing value of the pound means the price tag on these joint strike fighters will go up in the short term  Although this may not hold in the long term  Brexit could weaken the British pound and the euro in the near term  prompting countries to scale back purchases of American made weapons  such as  the F 35 Joint Strike Fighter  which is being bought by Britain  the Netherlands  Denmark and Italy 

A Positive But Cautious Fed Meet  As expected  the Fed stayed put in its July policy meeting and kept the short term interest rates steady in the 0 25 0 50  band  Although the Fed painted an encouraging picture and said other indicators were pointing to growth  it still believes the domestic economy is still too vulnerable to move rates beyond the 1 4 to 1 2  it established seven months ago 

Economic Picture  The U S  has been the world s largest defense consumer since World War II  Iraq and Afghanistan wars in the past decade boosted spending  driving it to historic heights  However  the winding down of those wars and severe pressure to lower the national debt burden following the country s major financial distress since the Great Depression had cast a long shadow over the U S defense budget  Although the defense market received the latest two year budget deal with much enthusiasm  as it brought military stability  one cannot overlook the risk of an economic downturn 

	A country s ability to spend on defense is a function of its economic health  The same is true at the global level   the faster the global economy grows  the higher will be the defense spending  Following the global crisis in 2008  there was a marked shift in defense spending growth from the developed to the emerging countries 

	Notably  U S  gross domestic product or GDP  the broadest measure of goods and services produced across the U S   grew at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1 2  in the second quarter  well below market expectations  With this  the economy has grown at less than a 2  pace for three straight quarters 

	The gain marks only a slight acceleration from the first quarter  when GDP advanced at a downwardly revised 0 8  pace  The first quarter was previously seen as increasing 1 1  from the prior period 

	Moreover  the White House has released figures showing that the FY 2016 budget deficit will be  162 billion more than originally projected  That brings the deficit back up to  600 billion after a few years of declining deficits from a high of  1 4 trillion in 2010 

Strong U S  Dollar  A gradually recovering U S  economy  slower global growth and expectations of more rate hikes from the U S  Federal Reserve had led to the U S dollar appreciation  This has affected U S  based companies as the strong dollar is not only showing up as a currency translation drag  but is also having a bearing on foreign military sales 

	Although the Fed has held itself from raising interest rates again given market jitters and Brexit concern  it will ultimately resume rate hikes  It has kept its benchmark rate at a record low for seven years  The dollar is expected to gain further if the rates start to climb north  A stronger dollar could damage U S  export competitiveness 

Will Weapons Programs Be Hit in Fiscal 2017 Budget 

	The U S  Department of Defense  DoD  announced this February that it plans to purchase fewer F 35 fighter jets from Lockheed Martin over the next five years than it had originally planned  The Pentagon s next five year plan  beginning fiscal 2017 through fiscal 2020  covers the purchase of 299 jets  down by 37 units from the previous expectation   Total funding   procurement  research  and development   drops from  11 602 billion in FY 2016 to  10 504 billion in the FY 2017 proposal 

	Certain limitations on the budget related to training  personnel costs and force structure may have an implication on weapons programs in the fiscal 2017 budget plan 

	Lockheed Martin s F 35 fighter jet is undoubtedly the single largest weapons program of the DoD  Apart from that  total funding proposal for the P 8A Poseidon program   procurement  research  and development   in FY 2017 dropped to  2 165 billion from  3 373 billion in FY 2016  Funding proposal for FY 2017 for Stryker  the Amphibious Combat Vehicle  ACV   DDG 51 Arleigh Burke destroyer along with Space Based Infrared System  SBIRS  and the DoD s Global Positioning System  GPS  program has also witnessed a sharp decline 

	Some defense suppliers may have to migrate their business models toward other channels to offset the secular decline in weapons related procurement 

Intense Competition    Aerospace and defense companies compete among themselves for a finite number of small and large programs 

	Moreover  China is developing space technologies aimed at blocking U S  military communications  per a report commissioned by a panel formed by the U S  Congress  China s goal is to become a space power as forceful as the U S  and to promote a space industry equal to those in the U S   Europe and Russia 

	Given the looming headwinds  we advise investors against names that offer little growth opportunity over the near term  These include companies for which estimate revision trends reflect a bearish sentiment 

	We are skeptical of these Zacks Ranked  5  Strong Sell  stocks  Embraer SA     AAR Corp     and Triumph Group  Inc

135405,356920,LMT,Lockheed warns Sikorsky could underperform,news,"WASHINGTON  Reuters     Lockheed Martin  Corp  N LMT   the Pentagon s No  1 supplier  on Wednesday warned investors that the Sikorsky helicopter unit it acquired last year could underperform  given changes in oil prices and other global economic conditions 
Lockheed included the warning in its annual 10 K filing with the U S  Securities and Exchange Commission  saying it remained upbeat that it would benefit from the unit it bought from United Technologies Corp  N UTX  for  9 billion last year 
 However  the integration process is complex  costly and time consuming and we may not be able to capture anticipated synergies  tax benefits  cost savings  and business opportunities in the time frame anticipated  or at all   the company said 
Lockheed Chief Financial Officer Bruce Tanner told analysts last month that the sustained drop in world oil prices had halved the company s projected forecast for Sikorsky s commercial helicopter sales from July  when the deal was first announced 
Lockheed said concerns raised by Pentagon officials about defense industry consolidation in connection with the Sikorsky acquisition could change the company s business relationships and its ability to compete for future orders 
Pentagon chief arms buyer Frank Kendall on Tuesday said other government agencies are now reviewing his draft of legislative language that would give the U S  Department of Defense  DOD  more leverage to block large mergers and acquisitions outside the traditional antitrust reasons 

 Changes in DoD policy or perception of our size could have adverse impacts on our business  including our success in future contract pursuits   Lockheed said ",2016-02-24,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/lockheed-warns-sikorsky-could-underperform-386385,386385

Clinton vs  Trump  Best Stocks  ETFs to Bet On

With the presidential election less than 100 days away  investors and strategists are scrambling to figure out which stocks will emerge as winners or losers if Clinton or Trump becomes the 45th president of the United States  Recent polls show a tight race with the difference between two candidates being within the margin of error in many  Further  can we really trust the polls after the Brexit vote  Remember  most polls and pundits had predicted a win for the  Remain  campaign 
	Uncertainty over the outcome of the presidential election and the direction of the economic policy post election is expected to slowdown economic growth this year as companies are putting investments on hold despite ultra low borrowing rates   Read    
	The general perception is that the Republicans are more business friendly but that may not really be true in the current election cycle  Further  per    since 1945  the S P 500 index has gained 6 7  annually during a Republican presidency versus a 9 7  gain with a Democratic president Defense and Infrastructure May Emerge Stronger in Either Scenario
	Both Trump and Clinton have talked about lifting defense spending  Take a look at defense stocks like Lockheed Martin     
	Infrastructure spending may also get a boost no matter who occupies the White House next year  Hillary has a  275 billion plan to improve US infrastructure over the next five years  Yesterday  Trump said he ll spend more than  500 billion to rebuild infrastructure and will finance the spending with debt Wall Street Banks May Lose Irrespective of Who Wins
	Both the Democrats and the Republicans have called for revival of the Glass Steagall law which separated investing banking from commercial banking for Wall Street banks but they differ on the Dodd Frank Act  While Trump has called for repealing the Act  the Democrats promise to      it  The Act  which was enacted in the aftermath of the financial crisis  imposed stricter regulations on banks 
	Big banks like JP Morgan Chase    are likely to face more headwinds ahead   Read   

Healthcare  Pharma   Biotech
	Clinton plans to continue and expand Obamacare whereas Trump has vowed to repeal it  A Clinton presidency would thus boost hospital stocks as it is expected to bring a large number of currently uninsured Americans under healthcare coverage  Check out the iShares U S  Healthcare Providers ETF    
	At the same time  a Clinton presidency may pressure profit margins of biotech and drug companies  Her tweet on price gouging in the specialty drug market had sent earlier high flying biotech stocks and ETF s like the iShares NASDAQ Biotech ETF     tumbling last year Oil  Gas and Clean Energy
	Clinton favors clean energy and wants to reduce US dependence on fossil fuels  Guggenheim Solar ETF    may flourish if she wins the election   Read     Trump on the other hand has vowed to resuscitate the dying coal industry and he is also likely to more supportive of the Oil industry Immigration
	Trump s position on immigration will hurt companies that rely on low  and as well as high skill foreign born workers  Most US technology companies  particularly technology consulting companies  rely heavily on immigrant workers and sourcing STEM talent is going to be a challenge for them  A Clinton presidency would be friendlier for these large companies 
	The US agriculture sector also relies on nonimmigrant and guest workers to work on farms and orchards and may be impacted by the change in immigration policies Bottom Line
	Promises made by the nominees on the campaign trail are not binding  Many statements may just turn out to be campaign rhetoric and may not be followed up by any policy imitative  But given significant differences between policy positions of the two candidates  it is important for investors to stay informed on how one or the other might affect their portfolios and be prepared to make changes if required

135426,356941,LMT,North Korea rocket launch may spur U S  missile defense buildup in Asia,news,"By Andrea Shalal and David Brunnstrom WASHINGTON  Reuters    North Korea s latest rocket launch might kick off a buildup of U S  missile defense systems in Asia  U S  officials and missile defense experts said  something that could further strain U S  China ties and also hurt relations between Beijing and Seoul  North Korea says it put a satellite into orbit on Sunday  but the United States and its allies see the launch as cover for Pyongyang s development of ballistic missile technology that could be used to deliver a nuclear weapon  Washington sought to reassure its allies South Korea and Japan of its commitment to their defense after the launch  which followed a North Korean nuclear test on Jan  6  The United States and South Korea said they would begin formal talks about deploying the sophisticated Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system  or THAAD  to the Korean peninsula  at the earliest possible date   South Korea had been reluctant to publicly discuss the possibility due to worries about upsetting China  its biggest trading partner  Beijing  at odds with the United States over Washington s reaction to its building of artificial islands in the disputed South China Sea  quickly expressed  deep concern  about a system whose radar could penetrate Chinese territory  China had made its position clear to Seoul and Washington  the Foreign Ministry said   When pursuing its own security  one country should not impair others  security interests   spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in a statement  TIPPING POINT But the North Korean rocket launch  on top of last month s nuclear test  could be a  tipping point  for South Korea and win over parts of Seoul s political establishment that remain wary of such a move  a U S  official said  South Korea and the United States said that if THAAD was deployed to South Korea  it would be focused only on North Korea  An editorial in the Global Times  an influential tabloid published by the ruling Chinese Communist Party s official People s Daily newspaper  called that assurance  feeble    It is widely believed by military experts that once THAAD is installed  Chinese missiles will be included as its target of surveillance  which will jeopardize Chinese national security   it said   Japan  long concerned about North Korea s ballistic missile program  has previously said it was considering THAAD to beef up its defenses  The North Korean rocket on Sunday flew over Japan s southern Okinawa prefecture  Chief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters on Monday the Defense Ministry had no concrete plan to introduce THAAD  but added the ministry believed new military assets would strengthen the country s capabilities  Riki Ellison  founder of the Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance  said the launch would give Japan momentum to deploy THAAD  Washington moved one of its five THAAD systems to Guam in 2013 following North Korean threats  and is now studying the possibility of converting a Hawaii test site for a land based version of the shipboard Aegis missile defense system into a combat ready facility  EFFECTIVENESS QUESTIONED Some experts questioned how effective THAAD would be against the type of long range rocket launched by North Korea and the Pentagon concedes it has yet to be tested against such a device  THAAD is designed to intercept and destroy ballistic missiles inside or just outside the atmosphere during their final  or terminal  phase of flight  It has so far proven effective against short  and medium range ballistic missiles  John Schilling  a contributor to the Washington based 38 North project that monitors North Korea  said THAAD s advanced AN TPY 2 tracking radar built by  Raytheon Co   N RTN  could provide an early  precise track on any such missile   David Wright  co director of the Global Security Program at the U S  based Union of Concerned Scientists  said that while THAAD could not shoot down the type of rocket launched on Sunday its deployment could reassure the South Korean public   Much of what missile defense programs are about is reassuring allies and the public   he said  SUITABLE SITE IDENTIFIED One U S  official said the North Korean launch added urgency to longstanding informal discussions about a possible THAAD deployment to South Korea   Speed is the priority   said the official  who asked not to be named ahead of a formal decision  Renewed missile defense discussions with the United States could also send a message to Beijing that it needs to do more to rein in North Korea s ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programs  another U S  official said  South Korean officials have already identified a suitable site for the system  but it could also be placed at a U S  base on the Korean peninsula  Ellison said  THAAD is a system built by  Lockheed Martin  Corp  N LMT  that can be transported by air  sea or land  The Pentagon has ordered two more batteries from Lockheed  One of the four THAAD batteries based at Fort Bliss  Texas  is always ready for deployment overseas  and could be sent to Japan or South Korea within weeks  Ellison said  
Lockheed referred all questions about a possible THAAD deployment to the U S  military ",2016-02-08,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/north-korea-rocket-launch-may-spur-u.s.-missile-defense-buildup-in-asia-383712,383712

135430,356945,LMT,U S  recovers Hellfire air to ground missile from Cuba,news,"WASHINGTON HAVANA  Reuters    The United States has recovered an inert Hellfire air to ground missile that had mistakenly ended up in Cuba  U S  and Cuban officials said on Saturday 
The laser guided AGM 114 Hellfire mistakenly arrived in Cuba in June 2014 and was retrieved on Saturday by U S  officials and representatives of  Lockheed Martin  Corp  N LMT   the missile s owner  the Cuban foreign ministry said in a statement 
 We can say  without speaking to specifics  that the inert training missile has been returned with the cooperation of the Cuban government   State Department spokesman Mark Toner said in a statement 
Lockheed Martin spokesman Bill Phelps declined comment 
The missile had been sent to Europe for a training exercise in 2014 but somehow ended up in Cuba in an embarrassing loss of military technology  the Wall Street Journal reported last month 
 The department is restricted under federal law and regulations from commenting on specific defense trade licensing cases and compliance matters  so we cannot provide further details   Toner said 
But he said reestablished diplomatic relations between the two countries have helped the U S   engage with the Cuban government on issues of mutual interest  
Cuba said the missile arrived by mistake or mishandling on a commercial flight from Paris and was not listed on the cargo manifest  and that it was discovered by customs inspectors 
 Once the U S  government officially informed the Cuban government that a training missile belonging to the company Lockheed Martin was mistakenly sent to our country and expressed its interest in recovering it  Cuba communicated the decision to hand it over and started arrangements for its return   the Cuban statement said  without revealing when the United States made the request

The longer 47 month delay would have increased the program s cost by over 30 percent from its current baseline  or 50 percent above the initial plan  triggering a live or die review of the program required under the Nunn McCurdy law  the document said  It said it was uncertain if the shorter delay would also trigger such a review ",2015-12-09,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/exclusive:-u.s.-air-force-to-work-on-alternative-gps-ground-system-375348,375348

4 Defense Sector Stocks to Buy Now

U S  defense stocks have had a good year up to now  propelled higher by geopolitical factors  Several major companies have posted encouraging results while the broader sector has also reaped the benefits  Meanwhile  global defense spending is likely to rise as a new customer has entered the picture 

The rest of the year is also likely to be favorable for defense stocks since the conditions which led to such gains will probably remain in place  Picking creditable performers for your portfolio makes for a smart move to capitalize on the gains ahead 

Stocks of Sector Heavyweights Rise  Earnings Impress

Stocks of many sector heavyweights have gained considerably over the year while posting encouraging earnings at the same time  For instance  Lockheed Martin Corp     reported better than expected first quarter earnings and revenues with both beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 8  and 5 5  respectively  The stock has gained 10 6  over the last three months 

However  this phenomenon is not simply restricted to a handful of companies  The largest ETF covering the sector  the iShares US Aerospace   Defense  ITA   has gained 3 6  year to date and 11 2  over the last three months 

Factors Boosting the Defense Sector

Defense companies thrive when the world is grappling with severe conflicts  Such a situation already exists in several regions of Africa and the Middle East  Meanwhile  sea related tensions are rising in Asia while the military posture of Russia has been a cause for worry  Nearly  29 billion worth of foreign arms sales have already been completed since January 

Meanwhile  a new market for arms will become available since Vietnam has been made accessible to U S  companies  A removal of a ban on arms sales will help the defense industry capitalize on the exponentially high increase in arms imports that the country has been making over the last five years 

However  domestic expenditure on defense has only been modest in recent years  But change is coming to the White House at the end of the year  which may also result in an increase on this front  With a contest between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump nearly certain  Clinton is being tipped to be ahead at the moment  She is likely to adopt a more hawkish posture  which would result in an expansion in domestic expenditure 

Our Choices

Defense stocks have been doing well this year  With rising global conflict and tensions in South China Sea  the trend is likely to persist  Stocks from the sector will continue to move higher as gains keep coming in 

This is why you must add select defense stocks to your portfolio  We have narrowed down our search based on a good Zacks Rank and other relevant metrics

135583,357098,LMT,Polish election frontrunner eyes army tender shakeup  risks causing delays,news,By Wiktor Szary and Pawel Sobczak WARSAW  Reuters    The expected winner of Poland s Oct  25 parliamentary election aims to shake up the country s military procurement plans but such a move could delay the modernization of its armed forces at a time of increased Russian assertiveness in eastern Europe  A delay to Warsaw s military acquisitions could also harm its reputation as one of NATO s most active members and undermine its long standing efforts to secure a permanent presence in its region for the Atlantic alliance  analysts say  A member of the U S  led alliance since 1999  Poland has earmarked  40 billion for military acquisitions by 2022 in a drive to bring its largely Soviet era military hardware and equipment up to NATO standards  Russia s annexation of Ukraine s Crimea region in 2014 and its support for separatists in eastern Ukraine prompted Poland to speed up the modernization plans  In April  the center right government provisionally selected French Airbus Group s utility helicopters and said it would buy Raytheon s Patriot missiles from the United States in tenders worth a combined  8 billion  But the nationalist minded Law and Justice  PiS  party  tipped to win this month s election  said it would review the tenders as part of efforts to boost the share of Poland s defense budget spent domestically if it wins the election   Each of these tenders will be subject to very careful analysis   Jaroslaw Gowin  the party s candidate for defense minister told Reuters  Gowin said that as defense minister he would seek to place more than 70 percent of defense orders with companies manufacturing locally  Officials say it would be illegal under European Union law to bar foreign companies from tenders  so the onus would be on local industry to be competitive in its offers   Additional political scrutiny in defense tenders is never a bad thing   said John Louth  Senior Research Fellow at the Royal United Services Institute  But rewinding the process too far back could delay the acquisitions  by years   Louth said  adding   Given the geopolitical situation  this should be a serious concern for Poland and its NATO allies   It would also probably weaken Poland s negotiating position at a NATO summit in Warsaw next year  where it will lobby for a permanent alliance presence in eastern Europe  Louth said  Poland agreed to raise its own defense spending to the required NATO target of 2 percent of gross domestic product  GDP  from next year to strengthen its case  Its demand faces resistance from Germany  wary of antagonizing Moscow by putting permanent NATO bases too close to the Russian border   PLAYING HARD BALL  Asked if a PiS led government would reconsider offers for the  3 billion helicopter tender made by U S  aircraft manufacturer Sikorsky and Italian British AgustaWestland  both of which already manufacture locally  Gowin said  the case is still open   Airbus said it planned to directly hire 1 250 people in Poland by 2020 and create a further 2 000 jobs in the sector in connection with the tender  Its offer was the only one that met all the tender s criteria  Airbus told Reuters in a statement  Poland s defense ministry said it would not comment on the opposition s plans  adding that the procurements were conducted independently of the political calendar   Last month  Poland s economy minister said that due to the complex character of the negotiations the contract was unlikely to be signed before the election  Sikorsky declined to comment on the PiS plans  AgustaWestland was not immediately available to comment  The  5 billion tender for a medium range air and missile defense system will also be subject to review  PiS lawmaker and deputy chairman of the parliamentary defense committee Bartosz Kownacki said   If we were to continue negotiating with Raytheon   then we would need guarantees that part of the manufacturing would be relocated to Poland   Kownacki told Reuters  A PiS led government would also reconsider  Lockheed Martin   N LMT  Corp s MEADS missile defense system  rejected by the current government in the earlier stages of the procurement  Kownacki said  arguing that it would be cheaper  Asked to comment on the PiS remarks  Raytheon said it was  committed to ensuring Poland s industrial participation  for the system  reaches as much as 50 percent of the contract value   A representative of MEADS International said its offer for Poland still stood   Tim Ripley  defense analyst at IHS Jane s  said the Polish opposition s announcements may simply be aimed at strengthening Warsaw s hand in future negotiations with Airbus and Raytheon    Defense deal negotiations are always hard ball  That s the name of the game   Ripley said  But some political analysts said it could also be a part of PiS  election strategy  aimed at securing the support of employees and trade unions at Sikorsky and AgustaWestland s facilities  both located in the party s traditional strongholds  Combined  the sites employ more than 5 600 people and trade unions at both facilities said that if the tender were awarded to Airbus  the other two companies would have to scale back their production and lay off workers

McCain  a Republican  and Senator Jack Reed  the top Democrat on the committee  raised concerns about the program in a letter to Kendall in August  They said  too much is at stake to accept the status quo and permit systems with long documented cost  schedule  performance  and reliability shortfalls to get a free pass into the fleet and production  ",2015-10-14,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/mccain-urges-scrutiny-of-lockheed-minehunting-vehicle-366162,366162

135594,357109,LMT,United Technologies Is Undervalued Despite 12 5  Total Return Potential,opinion,"United Technologies  NYSE UTX  has paid increasing dividends for 45 years  The company has compounded investor wealth at 13 7  a year  including dividends  over the last 25 years 
United Technologies is one of the largest publicly traded diversified industrial goods manufacturers in the world  The company was founded in 1934 and has grown to reach a market cap of nearly  90 billion 
United Technologies Business Overview
The company operates in 5 segments  Each segment is listed below along with the percentage of total operating profits produced for United Technologies in  
Otis generated 26  of total operating profits
UTC Climate  Controls    Security generated 28  of total operating profits
Pratt   Whitney generated 20  of total operating profits
UTC Aerospace Systems generated 24  of total operating profits
Sikorsky generated 2  of total operating profits
Otis is the world s largest elevator and escalator manufacturing  installation  and service company 
UTC Climate  Controls    Security is the leading provider of HVAC and refrigeration solutions  The segment owns the Carrier and Kiddie brands  among others 
Pratt   Whitney is one of the world s largest suppliers of aircraft engines for both the commercial and military markets 
UTC Aerospace Systems provides advanced aerospace products and aftermarket service solutions for aircraft manufacturers  airlines  military  space  and undersea markets 
Sikorsky is one of the world s largest helicopter manufacturers  The segment s margins and operating profits were down significantly in 2014 versus 2013  United Technologies  it would sell its Sikorsky division to Lockheed Martin  NYSE LMT  for  9 billion  The company s management will use funds the money from the sale for share repurchases 
Recent Weakness   Wall Street Woes
Wall Street did not take kindly to United Technologies second quarter earnings and announcement of the Sikorsky divestiture  The company s stock declined 7 1  in one day  The decline was due to the Sikorsky divestiture and news that both the Otis and UTC Aerospace segments  profits are expected to be lower than management previously anticipated 
Is The Company s Debt Load Sustainable 
In addition to its recent weakness  United Technology also carries  22 4 billion in debt on its balance sheet versus  5 9 billion in cash  In 2014  the company had total profits of  6 6 billion  While United Technologies does have a large debt load  the company has an average interest rate on debt of around 4   This translates into under  900 million in interest payments a year   not overly concerning given the company s highly profitable operations 
If United Technologies were to see earnings fall drastically during recessions  the company s debt load would be worrisome  Fortunately  United Technologies tends to perform well during recessions  The company saw earnings per share fall just 15 9  during the worst of the Great Recession  
United Technologies  contracts with military and aerospace customers help to insulate it from recessions  The company s relatively stable earnings over a wide range of economic conditions make United Technologies  debt load sustainable 
Competitive Advantage  Growth    Total Returns
United Technologies is one of the largest diversified manufacturers in the world  The company s competitive advantage comes from a mix of its size and scale combined with lean manufacturing  technological know how  and existing contracts and relationships with large government customers 
The company invests in its employees as well  United Technologies  employee scholarship program has allowed employees to earn nearly 37 000 degrees since 1996  The company tries to provide a quality experience to all its stakeholders   employees  shareholders  and customers 
United Technologies  employees speak well of the company and the synergies generated between segments  This comment on Seeking Alpha from a former employee  quoted below  shows the reality of the synergies between divisions at United Technologies 
 As a former employee  and still a shareholder  of UTX who worked in both segments for over 15 years each I can attest in the great synergy between the two  referring to aerospace and building   Engineers  production  quality  and financial staff regularly collaborated on projects  
United Technologies  competitive advantages have driven 7 4  earnings per share growth a year over the last decade  Despite temporary weakness  management is targeting 10   earnings per share growth through a mix of organic growth  share repurchases  margin expansion  and acquisitions 
United Technologies will likely grow closer to its historical growth rate than management s expectations  I expect earnings per share growth of 7  to 10  a year over the next several years  This growth  combined with the company s  2 5  dividend yield gives investors expected total returns of 9 5  to 12 5  a year going forward 
Valuation   Final Thoughts
Recent pessimism surrounding United Technologies has driven down the share price  The company is currently trading for a price to earnings ratio of just 14 4  United Technologies has traded for a price to earnings ratio above 16 for much of the past 2 years 
Wall Street may not have been fond of the Sikorsky divestiture  but the move should be very beneficial for shareholders  United Technologies  management will repurchase shares with the proceeds from the Sikorsky divestiture  The deal is  in the late 4th quarter of 2015 or early first quarter of 2016 
If United Technologies continues to trade for such a low price to earnings multiple through the Sikorsky divestiture  shareholders will benefit  Management will be able to repurchase a large block of shares   about 9  of the entire company   below fair value  Share repurchases done when a stock is trading below fair value are very accretive to shareholder value 
United Technologies currently has a dividend yield of 2 6   The company has a long history of rewarding shareholders with increasing dividends and rising earnings per share  United Technologies ranks highly using The 8 Rules of Dividend Investing thanks to its solid scores for stability  growth  and yield  The company makes an excellent addition to the portfolio of long term dividend growth investors ",2015-08-04,Ben Reynolds,https://www.investing.com/analysis/united-technologies-is-undervalued-despite-12.5-total-return-potential-260493,260493

135623,357138,LMT,Bonus Trading Idea For This Week  LMT,opinion,"Lockheed Martin  NYSE LMT   has been in a strong trend higher for quite some time  Since late December though it has been consolidating in a channel between 187 and 199  Unable to reach 200  The SMA s show the trend higher and notice that the last bottom in the channel touched the 100 day SMA before moving up 
It now rests at the top of the channel  As it sits there the Bollinger Bands  are opening higher to allow a move  Also the RSI is trending higher with a MACD crossed up and rising  These support more upside price action 
When the stock has moved up it has tended to be in  15 to  20 runs  That could move it to 215 to 220 on a break over 200  That is interesting  There is no resistance above the channel and support lower may come at 192 50 and 187  Short interest is low at about 1   The company does not report earnings again until April 28th 
The February options chain shows large open interest st both the 195 and 200 Strike Calls  with 200 the biggest  These both are at least double the open interest of any strike on the put side  They could act as a containment zone this week  With the larger open interest at 200 it could also start a break out of the channel on a pin at 200  March open interest shows large size at the 200 Strike Call as well but also at the 170 Strike Put 
Lockheed Martin   NYSE LMT 

Trade Idea 1  Buy the stock on a move over 199 with a stop at 193  A straight stock trade 
Trade Idea 2  Buy the March 200 Calls for  2 20  A cheaper  defined risk way to participate in a move higher in the stock 
Trade Idea 3  Sell the February 195 Straddle for a  3 65 credit  This trade looks for the range to continue this week and large open interest to stay in control of price  It also offers the possibility of owning the stock at 191 35 at the end of the week 
Trade Idea 4  Buy the February March 200 Call Calendar for  1 90  This trade looks to own those March 200 Calls cheaper  using the large open interest at 200 in February as a speed brake 
Trade Idea 5  Buy the February 195 June 210 Call Diagonal for 50 cents  This is a longer term trade and designed to call the stock at the end of the week  or roll up the February Calls to March Calls 
Elsewhere look for Gold to lower in the short term in the longer consolidation while Crude Oil consolidates  and may be ready to reverse higher  The US Dollar Index looks to continue in a consolidation range while US Treasuries are biased lower  The Shanghai Composite looks to continue to pullback in the uptrend and Emerging Markets look to hold in the bear flag  and might prove it a reversal higher

135624,357139,LMT,3 Ways To Play The Defense Aerospace Sector With ETFs,opinion,"The broader stock market  as measured by the NYSE Composite  may be making marginal progress  A 2 5  appreciation in price over the last nine months is mildly positive  Similarly  higher lows are typically indicative of ongoing strength 

It would be reasonable  however  to discuss whether the risk of participation is worthy of the potential reward  Retail sales in the warm weather month of April were flat  clearly  consumers have not been spending their windfalls from the gasoline pump since 2015 began  Moreover  views on the U S  economy in Bloomberg s Consumer Comfort Index sank to a five month low  If the trend towards saving over consumption continues  exports and investment by businesses would need to pick up the slack  Unfortunately  the strong U S  dollar has crucified exports in recent months and durable goods sales excluding aircraft defense have been tepid  These are trends that do no bode well for corporate revenue growth 
Another way to look at the discrepancy between the broader market and revenue winners is through the use of price ratios  For example  the iShares DJ Aeropsace and Defense ETF  NYSE ITA  SPDR S P 500 Trust  ARCA SPY  price ratio demonstrates the momentum that has been building for defense aerospace contractors for the better part of nine months  In addition  SPY sports an astronomical P S ratio of 1 8 whereas ITA boasts a more fundamentally sound P S of 1 3 

Granted  rising bond yields and a slow growth economy produce fewer tax dollars for government authorities to spend on the defense of the country  more tax dollars will go to paying the interest on Treasury debt obligations  leaving Democrats and Republicans to wrangle over where remaining funds should be allocated  Yet the recent military conquests by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria suggest to me that dollars will be found or created to finance operations that would undercut advances by radical elements in the Middle East 
There are three ETFs that cover the Defense Aerospace arena  Both ITA and the longer running Powershares Aerospace   Defense  NYSE PPA  tend to track one another fairly closely  Over the past 3 years  each has posted annualized gains of approximately 23 5  
The SPDR Aerospace   Defense ETF  NYSE XAR  tracks a modified equal weight index such that market cap giants like Lockheed Martin  NYSE LMT  and United Technologies  NYSE UTX  do not steal the entire limelight  The fact that XAR has a number of smaller companies with higher weight in the fund performance contributes to a bit more risk  though the reward has been commensurate with a 3 year trailing result of 25 5  

Purchasing any stock asset near all time record highs can be tricky  It may be even trickier when any additional economic downgrade would likely be accompanied by more earnings and revenue warnings  any economic uptick would give the Fed reason to hike borrowing costs  In essence  buying before a pullback may not be advisable  Nevertheless  if one has the confidence in the sector s ability to weather cyclical storms in the economy  one might be compensated for recognizing why defense aerospace contractors are likely to prosper for years to come

first step before a more comprehensive research effort  Our objective is to provide companies that have excellent historical records and appear reasonably priced based on past  present and future data and expectations  A quick glance at the graph itself and the orange earnings justified valuation line will tell the readers volumes about how well the company has historically been managed and performed as an operating business  Simply put  the reader should ask whether this example is worthy of a greater investment of their time and effort based on the data as presented and organized  The

results with the earnings and price correlated graph  validates the principles regarding the two components of total return  capital appreciation and dividend income  Dividends are included in the total return calculation and are assumed paid  but not reinvested  When presented separately like this  the additional rate of return a dividend paying stock produces for shareholders becomes undeniably evident  In addition to the 9 7  Annualized ROR  w o Div   green circle   long term shareholders of Lockheed Martin Corp  assuming an initial investment of  10 000  would have received an

as low as it has been since 2001 A further indication of valuation can be seen by examining a company s current P S ratio relative to its historical P S ratio  The current P S ratio for Lockheed Martin Corp is  73 which is historically low  Looking to the FutureExtensive research has provided a preponderance of conclusive evidence that future long term returns are a function of two critical determinants 1  The rate of change  growth rate  of the company s earnings2  The price or valuation you pay to buy those earningsForecasting future earnings growth  bought at sound valuations  is the key to safe  sound and profitable performance The Estimated Earnings and Return Calculator Tool is a simple yet powerful resource that empowers the user to calculate and run various investing

all investments potentially compete with all other investments  it is useful to compare investing in any prospective company to that of a comparable investment in low risk Treasury bonds  Comparing an

135683,357198,LMT,3 Safe Stocks For An Uncertain Market,opinion,"In case you haven t noticed yet  the stock market this year has been a lot different than in 2013  Not only have we seen much lower overall returns so far  we have experienced more volatility too 
There is no better example of this than the Russell 2000  It surged a remarkable 37  in 2013  But so far this year  it has fallen about 4  and is down about 8  from its all time high  And some industries  like speciality retail or high tech   have fared much worse 
However  there are pockets of safety in this market  So don t just stuff your money under the mattress or into ultra low yielding bonds or savings accounts just yet 
Large cap stocks  for example  have generally held up much better than small caps  The large cap S P 500 index has gained a respectable 7  year to date  for instance  And lower beta stocks have generally outperformed higher beta stocks  Utilities  which trailed the market badly last year  are leading the way this year 
Clouds of Uncertainty
One of the biggest reasons for the recent market pullback  particularly in smaller  higher beta stocks  has been uncertainty overseas  Tensions have been bubbling up in places like Russia and Ukraine along with the Middle East  And economic uncertainty in China and Europe has also riled investors 
This has led to a flight to safety  with the US dollar strengthening and U S  Treasuries rallying 
Another cloud hanging over the stock market has been monetary policy  While the Fed will likely end its quantitative easing program next month  the timetable for when it will hike interest rates is still very much up in the air 
Where to Find Shelter
There s no telling when this recent market turbulence will end  Although the U S  economy continues to hum along and earnings have been solid  investors don t seem too eager right now to jump into a stock market that is still near its all time highs 
So while I believe the longer term outlook for stocks still looks fine  investors should consider adding some stability to their portfolios in case the recent pullback gets worse 
But where should investors look 
The stocks I believe that are most likely to outperform in this environment are  1  large cap   2  low beta stocks  with  3  solid earnings momentum  that  4  pay a decent dividend  but don t have too high of a yield    5  have relatively conservative debt levels  i e   their interest expenses won t skyrocket if rates rise    6  are reasonably priced  and  7  have relatively low overseas exposure  i e   their business is not highly susceptible to a strong dollar and a weak global economy  
3 Safe Stocks for an Uncertain Market
Here are three stocks that meet these criteria 
Lockheed Martin Corporation  NYSE LMT 
Market Cap   57 1 billion  Beta  0 71  Zacks Rank  2  Dividend Yield  2 9   Debt Equity  1 4  12 month Forward P E  15x    Revenue Overseas  17

viewed more than 60 million times so far   reflects a mood of rising nationalism and confidence among the Chinese public and military  An assertive China under President Xi Jinping now believes its military has the technology to at the very least make the United States think twice before undertaking any military adventures in what China sees as its backyard   Can the United States be certain of getting the upper hand in the event of a showdown with China   retired Major General Luo Yuan  now a widely followed military commentator  wrote in June   China is preparing every day to win a modern war   Xi visits the United States at end of this month  Analysts see three potential arenas for such a showdown   the South China Sea  where China has a series of overlapping territorial disputes with its neighbors  the East China Sea  where remote islets are a source of friction between Beijing and U S  ally Japan  and any conflict over self ruled Taiwan   The United States remains by far the world s most powerful military nation and has pledged to keep sailing in what it regards as international waters off China  dedicating some of its most advanced assets to the region  But China s ostentatious display of some of its latest military hardware at a parade in Beijing last week to mark the end of World War Two underlined its growing might  A senior U S  official said that  while the Chinese military build up of recent years had been of ongoing concern  last week s parade was  more for a showcase effect and not something that has anybody in Washington overly worried   MISSILES ON SHOW Among the weapons unveiled for the first time at the parade was an anti ship ballistic missile  the Dongfeng 21D  a still untested weapon designed to destroy an aircraft carrier with one hit  Also on show were several intercontinental ballistic missiles such as the DF 5B and the DF 31A as well as the DF 26 intermediate range ballistic missile  dubbed the  Guam killer  by defense media because it bolsters China s ability to threaten the U S  Pacific Ocean base  Airfields and ports under construction on newly reclaimed Chinese islands in the disputed South China Sea will help China project power far into South East Asian waters    We ve already basically broken through the first island chain   retired rear admiral Zhang Zhaozhong said in state media this year  referring to the ability to confront the United States close to home around Taiwan   Now we need to break through the second and third island chains   he added  meaning being able to challenge the U S  Navy in the rest of East Asia and then out as far as Hawaii  Richard Bitzinger  a regional security analyst at Singapore s S  Rajaratnam School of International Studies  said while there was nothing technologically new on show last week  he was concerned at potential Chinese military over confidence   Just because they are developing capabilities that are complicating operations  especially for the Americans  doesn t mean they have won the war already   he said  PACIFIC POWER The United States  which under President Barack Obama has pursued a strategy of  rebalancing  towards Asia  is not about to give up its position as the leading naval power in the western Pacific any time soon  The U S  Navy says about 58 percent of all of its forces   ships  aircraft  sailors and Marines   are deployed to or home ported in the Pacific Fleet  including in Japan  Guam and Singapore  The USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier is on its way to Japan and three more American aircraft carriers are home ported on America s Pacific coast  A recent Pentagon report also noted significant gaps in Chinese defenses  saying it lacked  for example  a robust anti submarine warfare capability   Having these missiles and being able to use them effectively in a conflict are two very different things   said a Western official in Beijing  citing internal assessments of the missiles on show at the parade  adding it was not clear whether the newest models had even been deployed yet  Still  China s advances are already causing major headaches in democratic Taiwan  which China claims as its own and has never renounced the use of force to bring under its control  The United States is obligated by law to help Taiwan defend itself  An unpublished Taiwan Defense Ministry report  seen by Reuters  warned that China s upgraded H 6 bomber  when equipped with anti ship missiles  would enable China to project power even deep into the Indian Ocean  The same aircraft type appears in the Tencent

135707,357222,LMT,Bull Market In Bad Predictions,opinion,Why does this happen whenever I try to take a few days off  The market for dubious predictions has geared up in earnest  While on vacation I was watching the market  but without my customary TIVO   events developed exactly as I predicted  I warned about signal and noise  the challenge to traders  and the opportunity for long term investors  I have also been reading Nate Silver s book  The Signal and the Noise  which includes a lot of wisdom on these topics  I plan a full review when I finish  One of Silver s points concerns predictions without any confidence interval  Many themes will be familiar to readers  since I highlight pundits who claim expertise outside of their  happy zone   Let us highlight the three worst items from the past week  The fiction    the ECRI claims that we are now in a recession  This is ECRI 4 0 after their 2011 forecast failed  their revised 2012 forecast failed  and their complaint about seasonal adjustments being wrong has not proven out  They are now playing out the last straw  that they are the only ones who can forecast recessions in advance and that no one else knows until after it is over  This will obviously require a deeper look  Let me cite the most obvious incorrect statement in their claims  The business cycle has peaked and they are the only ones who know this The reality  No one knows whether the current period will eventually be defined as a recession  A recession requires a significant decline  which you do not know until you have seen it   At that point the NBER goes back to the last peak  The ECRI presentation last week  assumed facts not in evidence   They are ignoring the reduction in business spending before the election and the fiscal cliff  They are exploiting the Super storm Sandy effects  We can expect them to pound the drum even more during the next month  since the weak patch will take a couple of months to sort out  I have a personal sadness about this  since I like and admire the ECRI principals  I am going to write another piece about how and why their methods failed  I wish that they had just been willing to accept the changing evidence    and maybe open the kimono a little bit  The fiction     the decline to zero growth  GMO s Jeremy Grantham opines that the US economy is on a zero growth path until 2050  He focuses on the two best drivers of growth    population and productivity  In this CNBC segment Maria Baritromo      He gets paid to make predictions  Steve  That s what he s doing  By the way  his former predictions have been right  Let s give him that   The reality  No one knows what will happen in 2050  Grantham has ignored a decline in immigration  something that has helped US GDP in the past  to support his perma bear position  Pretending to this kind of knowledge gets headlines  but should be a warning signal to investors  The media commentary points out that he manages a gazillion dollars or so  Maybe a few of those investors should look to managers who are more grounded in facts  And by the way  maybe Maria should cite     47     before claiming that he has made so many great calls  Anyone who takes this silly prediction seriously should look back forty years for a comparison  The fiction  The latest new and greatest recession indicator  This is from Lance Roberts  who without apology highlighted the bogus 100  recession indicator   He is now back with a new entry  endorsed by John Hussman  Roberts takes some existing economic forecasting indicators that do not initially give the result he hopes for  He then does some arithmetic and creates something that has a lame correlation to past recessions  Hussman  who does similar things  embraces this approach The Reality  The St  Louis Fed creates about 60 000 data series  If you do some math transformations as Roberts did  you can turn this into a million or so possibilities  If you then set a  trigger  at an arbitrary level based upon a handful of past cases  the way Hussman does  you can multiply this into the hundreds of millions range  It is bad research  bad methodology  and a seriously misleading result  It is impossible to prove  since the bad guys used all of the data  There is nothing left to prove them wrong  Conclusion So much bogus commentary  and so little time  Can t a guy take a few days off  I will follow up on all of these themes  Here are the main ideas  Recession The ECRI errors will require a more careful review    it is on my agenda  Meanwhile you can get the basic concept of their mistake by reviewing my   Fiscal Cliff This theme continues with silly trading in the absence of information  Listen up   We have no new information since the election  We will not know anything new for a few weeks  Trade at your peril  Opportunity It almost seems too obvious  So many have much at stake in scaring investors  They have clearly won the battle  with aggressive money flowing into anything with a high yield and conservative money going to farmland and ammunition  My conversations with investors show that many are scared witless  TM OldProf   Since the big rewards go to the contrarian investor  there are some great opportunities  I like Caterpillar  CAT  as the proxy stock for an economic rebound  although it is  incorrectly  China centric  I also like some health care insurers and defense stocks    UnitedHealth Group  UNH  and Lockheed Martin  LMT  as examples    as winners in the fiscal cliff compromise  AFLAC  AFL  is a good play if there is no disaster in Europe  These are complex questions  so I plan to write more on each issue ,2012-12-05,Jeff Miller,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bull-market-in-bad-predictions-146192,146192
135708,357223,LMT,Industrials And Financials Showing Good Relative Earnings Strength ,opinion,Per ThomsonReuters  the  forward 4 quarter  earnings estimate for the SP 500 this week fell slightly to  112 32  from  122 37 The cumulative decline in the forward estimate since the Jan 4th  2013 all time high tick of  113 88 is  1 56 If you are wondering why this is the least bit relevant  let s compare it to one year ago  in early January  2012  the  forward 4 quarter estimate  hit  107 67  and by the end of February had been revised lower by  1 99 to  105 68 by 2 24 12 The small but important distinction there  and one of the reasons the forward estimate continues to grow year over year  is that we saw sharper downward revisions throughout 2012  which are now the comparison for 2013 The point being that  despite the financial media cacophony around earnings  while there is still pressure on forward estimates  that pressure is gradually becoming less severe Using the  112 32 estimate from this week  the SP 500 is trading at 13 5 x  that forward estimate  on expected earnings growth for 2013 of  9 3  For full year  2012  the SP 500 grew earnings 3 9   but returned 15 98  for the calendar year  Compare this to 2011  where the SP 500 grew earnings north of 10   but the benchmark returned 2 5  for 2011 The earnings yield for the SP 500 with Friday s close is 7 41   and the year over year growth of the forward estimate is 5 91  With Q4  12 earnings season now thought to be officially concluded with Wal Mart s earnings release of Thursday morning  Q4  12 earnings have grown 6  year over year  y y  while revenue growth grew  3 6    Long WMT  This is consistent with our prediction that Q4  12 earnings growth would be at least 5   which would be consistent with the pattern we have seen historically Stat of the week Earnings estimates for Q1  13 are now calling for expected growth of  1 3   down from  4 3  as of January 1  and  7 1  as of October 1  2012  Q1  13 estimates could go negative before the quarter is out This would bring Q1  13 earnings growth roughly in line with the Q3  12 s actual 0  to 1  growth  which we thought would have been the nadir for the cycle My own opinion is that when we see Q1  13 numbers starting April 15th  Q1  13 earnings will continue to be better than q3  12 s low for the cycle Here is the quarterly expectations for Industrials and Financials as of 2 22 13  the first column is the expected growth as of February 22nd  the 2nd column is the expected growth as of Jan 1   13 and the 3rd column is the expected growth as of October 1  12 Q4  13 Financials   23 6    26 1  n aIndustrials   20 5    18 1  n aSP 500   13 1    17 6 Q3  13 Financials   11 3    12 2    13 7 Industrials   10 4    8 8    15 8 SP 500   10 1    11 4    15 9 Q2  13 Financials   19 3    19 2    18 6 Industrials   2 5    2 1    6 8  SP 500   6 4    8 4    10 4 Q1  13 Financials   9 5    9 6    8 4 Industrials   1    1 7    6 7 SP 500   1 5    4 3    7 1 Q4  12   actual Financials   17 1    14 6    28 9 Industrials   4 4    5 5   3 4 SP 500   6    2 9    9 9 Perspective  As the reader can quickly see  Industrial and Financial sector estimates are showing better relative strength as we move through 2013  despite estimates being cut for 2013 for the SP 500 as a whole  Some of the strength in Industrials might be due to GE s recent news of additional share repurchases from the sale of NBC U to Comcast  With the announcement of the sale of the remaining 50  of NBC U  GE immediately increased the amount of their share repurchase plan  Ironically  if you are looking for one company that might encompass the Industrial and Financial sector strength  it could be GE  With GE Capital still being 30  of operating profit  the financial services arm of GE is not going away anytime soon   Long GE Industrials are 11  of the SP 500 by market cap  with Aerospace and Defense being 20  of the sector or roughly 2  of the SP 500 as a whole  With worries about sequestration  we think this is where the value is or long term investors  We are doing a lot of fundamental  bottoms up  homework on Lockheed Martin  LMT  and a few other names in the space  GE   as a true conglomerate   gets you exposure to Aviation and Financial Services  not just Industrial  Also  despite GE still being well below its 1999   2000 high of  60 per share  GE is still the 3rd largest company in the SP 500 by market cap Financial Services  Financials are roughly 17  of the SP 500 by market cap  We think BAC is big influence on earnings estimates  We think BAC is a tangential way to play the housing recovery  In 2013  BAC will benefit from improving capital ratios  a dividend likely in 2013  possibly more share repurchases  and the improvement in housing   long BAC Financials grew revenue in q4  12   20   the highest revenue growth rate in years  driven by Life   Health insurers and Broker Dealers  Don t expect that number to repeat itself anytime soon We think BAC and JPM are the best values in banking today   long BAC  JPM We also think SP 500 earnings will gradually improve as we move through 2013  the second half of the year  will be stronger than the first half of 2013  thanks to easier compares later in 2013  Expect full year 2013 SP 500 earnings growth to be high single digits  better than 2012 s  3 9  Conclusion  Sentiment around forward SP 500 earnings estimates continues to be too negative in our opinion  Stick with the sector s that are showing decent relative strength like Financials and Industrials  There is some talk about an  Earnings Cliff  on the horizon  but after the last 12 years  and particularly the earnings pressure we saw in  08  when the forward estimate fell from  102 to near  60  we think it would take another near economic meltdown to produce a similar drop in earnings estimates  The market malaise and continuing pessimism have thrown a wet blanket over future expectations  Earnings Cliff worries have not show itself in credit spreads yet either  Like Q4  12  we think future earnings will continue to surprise to the upside through 2013 The HYG  and JNK high yield bond ETF s are now officially oversold on the weekly charts  We bought a little of each this week   Long HYG and JNK  Why hasn t inflation been an issue  even though every other day since early 2009  there has been a guest on CNBC talking about the horrid inflation we are about to see  Bob Doll  the new CIO at Nuveen Asset Management  and former CIO at Merrill Lynch  thinks it is because the money multiplier remains subdued  The  velocity  of money is not yet where it should be   and this is my conclusion  probably because the growth rate of the US economy remains well below potential  I have heard Bob speak  both at a Nuveen lunch here in Chicago  and recently to the CFA Society of Chicago  and he has talked about the money multiplier both times  Inflation is not an issue yet  A contrary opinion we happen to agree with The consumer is the focus these days  with the payroll tax hike  sequestration and lackluster retail sales  Brian Wesbury  a pretty good economist at First Trust here in Chicago  thinks that the  financial obligations  ratio  which is after tax income divided by consumer debt like mortgages  car payments and credit cards is at a multi year low  In other words  consumer s debt service ability is at a multi year high  hopefully from refi ing mortgages the last few years at generational low rates  Check Wesbury s blog and the recent January retail sales comments for thoughts on the  financial obligations  ratio We still like Coach  COH  even as it slips below the 200 week moving average  towards the August  2011  lows near  45 70    45 76  We d buy more at that level  Great brands do not disappear overnight St  Louis Fed s graph on CPI inflation  The CPI is the narrowest of all inflation indicators  but you can see how the Fed was fighting  deflation  in late 2008  and 2009 We still like Wal Mart  WMT  as a stock for client accounts  The earnings per share beat on Thursday was partially due due to a lower tax rate  but the stock closed the week above the key previous  all time high of  70 25 high of January  2000  WMT management always guides conservatively   long WMT  Final thought  it still surprises me how the Street turns so bearish so quickly  Now everybody is expecting a correction  simply because we ve been overbought for so long  Todd Harrison once wrote that   markets can correct through TIME or price   meaning just moving sideways can work off an overbought condition  The pessimism around earnings  the consumer  the government headlines  sequestration  gas prices  etc  etc  is surprising  Seemingly no good news anywhere  EXCEPT Q4  12 earnings weren t too shabby ,2013-02-25,Brian Gilmartin,https://www.investing.com/analysis/industrials-and-financials-showing-good-relative-earnings-strength-156503,156503

135710,357225,LMT,Saudi Arabia satisfied with Obama s assurances on Iran deal,news,By Yeganeh Torbati and Julia Edwards WASHINGTON  Reuters    Saudi Arabia is satisfied with assurances from U S  President Barack Obama about the Iran nuclear deal and believes the agreement will contribute to security and stability in the Middle East  a senior Saudi official said on Friday  Saudi King Salman met with Obama at the White House on Friday to seek more support in countering Iran  as the Obama administration aimed to use the visit to shore up relations after a period of tensions  The visit is the king s first to the United States since ascending to the throne in January 2015  and comes after the United States agreed to a nuclear deal with Iran in July  The U S  Saudi relationship has suffered strain because of what Riyadh sees as Obama s withdrawal from the region  a lack of direct U S  action against President Bashar al Assad in Syria  and a perceived U S  tilt towards Iran since the 2011 Arab uprisings  But the countries share many strategic objectives and depend on each other on a number of core security  economic  and political issues  Speaking after the meeting between Obama and Salman  Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al Jubeir said Obama had assured the Saudi king that the agreement prevents Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon  includes inspections of military and suspected sites  and has a provision for the snapback of sanctions if Iran violates the agreement  Under those conditions  al Jubeir said  Saudi Arabia supported the deal   Now we have one less problem for the time being to deal with  with regards to Iran   al Jubeir said   We can now focus more intensely on the nefarious activities that Iran is engaged in the region   Gulf Arab states had previously expressed their support for the Iran nuclear deal  but fear that the lifting of sanctions on Iran would enable it to pursue destabilizing policies in the Middle East  Salman skipped a Gulf Arab summit at Camp David in May  a move widely seen as a diplomatic snub over Obama s Iran strategy  though both governments denied that interpretation  Critics say the nuclear deal will empower Iran economically to increase its support of militant groups in the region  Saudi Arabia and Iran are opposed on a number of regional issues  especially the 4 1 2 year long Syrian civil war and unrest in Yemen  where a coalition of Arab states led by Riyadh  assisted by the United States  are targeting Iran allied Houthi forces  Obama said on Friday that he and Salman share concerns about Yemen and the need to restore a functioning government and address the humanitarian situation there   U S  Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes said ahead of Salman s visit that the United States believed more care needs to be taken to avoid civilian casualties in the air strikes against Houthi forces in Yemen  Al Jubeir said on Friday that the humanitarian crisis in Yemen was being exacerbated by the Houthis and that supplies were at risk of being diverted from Yemenis who need them most  but that Saudi Arabia was working with international organizations to send supplies to Yemen  A Saudi led coalition has been conducting air strikes across Yemen against Iranian allied Houthi forces since March  pushing back Houthi forces but drawing criticism from international aid and rights groups for a mounting civilian death toll  Saudi Defense Minister Mohammed bin Salman also met on Friday with U S  Secretary of Defense Ash Carter and the two discussed Saudi Arabia s underlying defense requirements  the Pentagon said  The Obama administration is focused on providing the assistance that the president promised at the Camp David summit  including helping Gulf states integrate ballistic missile defense systems and beef up cyber and maritime security  Saudi Arabia remains the world s largest oil exporter  and its commitment to pumping oil freely despite a recent price decline has helped contribute to sustaining the U S  economic recovery  Obama and Salman will discuss the world economy and energy issues  Obama told reporters on Friday  Saudi Arabia has also joined the United States and other Arab states in air strikes against the Islamic State jihadist movement in Syria  also called ISIS   We continue to cooperate extremely closely in countering terrorist activities in the region and around the world  including the battle against ISIS   Obama said on Friday  Obama and Salman discussed the potential fast tracking of the release of American military technology and weapons systems to Saudi Arabia  al Jubeir said  and discussed a  new strategic partnership  between the two countries  although he gave few details  The Gulf state is in advanced discussions with the U S  government about buying two frigates based on a coastal warship that  Lockheed Martin  Corp  NYSE LMT  is building for the U S  Navy  a deal valued at well over  1

135731,357246,LMT,Airbus seeks to rebuild trust as A400M systems fall short,news,By Tim Hepher PARIS  Reuters    Airbus Group has told buyer nations of the A400M transporter aircraft that it cannot deliver all of its high tech defenses according to plan  casting a shadow over some of its military uses as Europe battles growing instability on its borders  The troop and cargo lifter was developed at a cost of 20 billion euros   22 billion  for seven European NATO nations and is already in service with French forces in Mali  Other core buyers include Belgium  Britain  Germany  Luxembourg  Spain and Turkey  Malaysia is so far the only export customer  Some of the state of the art systems designed to warn of threats such as missiles or hostile radar are more difficult than expected to develop  handing buyers a choice between taking planes or waiting for upgrades  European defense sources said  But after years of political disputes and technical problems  a new military aircraft management at Airbus Group  PA AIR  is working flat out to rebuild trust worn down by delays and overruns that are typical of large defense projects  An internal audit and regular updates appear to be paying off  people close to the talks said  with fewer visible signs of tensions that have led to costly stand offs in the past  A new setback came with the fatal crash of a plane being prepared for delivery to Turkey in May  Investigators are looking into a possible accidental data wipe  Ankara is negotiating with other A400M buyers to see whether it could get a replacement aircraft by swapping deliveries as it steps up its military role in the region  defense sources said  Although production is back to normal  a clampdown on some testing after the crash led to new development delays of up to three months  erasing the remaining  buffer   they said  Even though the destroyed plane was insured  some analysts expect Airbus to take a further modest provision on the A400M with its results on Friday  adding to 4 76 billion euros of charges already generated by Europe s biggest defense project  Airbus declined any comment ahead of the results  SUMMER NEGOTIATIONS A senior executive told Reuters in comments published this week that Airbus was confident of meeting the upper end of its revised production goal of 13 to 17 planes this year  following the accident  but declined further comment  The group appears certain it can deliver 13 of those planes  leaving 10 to deliver for the rest of the year  The remaining four are the subject of negotiations over how many customized features should be slotted in and when  with France  Germany and Britain seen at the center of the debate  Airbus met buyer nations this week and several weeks of negotiations lie ahead  sources in two capitals said  Although some of the plane s advanced defenses will be later than planned  European defense sources say buyers have been assured it can tackle shoulder held weapons held by non state actors that are one of the region s pressing threats  One of the A400M s other roles is dropping parachutists  Free jumping from the side doors has been approved but dropping paratroopers from both sides at once to speed up penetration of territory has introduced the risk of collision   Airbus is testing new parachutes to try to avoid this  Despite the flaws  supporters stress the A400M  which shot to the attention of the public in an action movie premiere last week  remains more sophisticated even than some fighters  However  Airbus has had to admit to buyers that refueling helicopters will be  mission impossible  any time soon  because the shape of the plane subjects choppers to too much turbulence when tethered on their relatively short fuel hoses  France  which views this as crucial for its special forces   is considering buying  Lockheed Martin   N LMT  C 130s  one of the planes the A400M was designed to replace  to address this gap  The setback could raise questions over ambitions to export the plane to the United States which uses C 130s to refill Black Hawks  though future research might overcome this    at a cost ,2015-07-30,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/airbus-seeks-to-rebuild-trust-as-a400m-systems-fall-short-353746,353746
135732,357247,LMT,Japan may give planes to Manila for South China Sea patrols  sources,news,By Tim Kelly and Nobuhiro Kubo TOKYO  Reuters    Japan wants to give planes to the Philippines that Manila could use for patrols in the South China Sea  sources said  a move that would deepen Tokyo s security ties with the Southeast Asian nation most at odds with Beijing over the disputed waterway  Four sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters that Japan was looking to offer three Beechcraft TC 90 King Air planes that could be fitted with basic surface and air surveillance radar   They said talks within the Japanese government were preliminary and would need to overcome legal hurdles  Japan had yet to formally propose the planes as an alternative to more sophisticated  Lockheed Martin   NYSE LMT  P3 C aircraft that Manila wants to track Chinese submarine activity  they added  Senior Philippine military and defense officials in Manila said they had not heard about the possible donation of the twin turboprop TC 90 aircraft  which Japan uses to train military pilots   The Philippines doesn t have enough aircraft to conduct regular patrols over the South China Sea   one of the sources in Japan said  declining to be identified because he was not authorized to talk to the media  Donating aircraft  even small planes  would represent a military upgrade for the Philippines  which has only a handful of fixed wing planes it can deploy on maritime patrols  Tokyo has no claims in the South China Sea  but is worried about Beijing s construction of seven artificial islands in the waterway s Spratly archipelago  which will extend Chinese military reach into sea lanes through which much of Japan s ship borne trade passes   Concerns over the islands have dominated regional meetings in Kuala Lumpur this week between Southeast Asia and countries including Japan  China and the United States  Equipping Manila with maritime capable patrol planes would dovetail with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe s more muscular security agenda but likely anger China  which has repeatedly accused Japan of interfering in the South China Sea dispute  A spokesman for Japan s Ministry of Defense said working level talks had been set up to explore possible cooperation in defense equipment with the Philippines but that there was no  concrete plan  to give Manila the TC 90s  Philippine Defence Minister Voltaire Gazmin told Reuters he was unaware of any Japanese plan to supply the aircraft  Top Philippine generals said they were also unaware of any proposal but welcomed the growing security cooperation with Japan  China s Defence Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment       POSSIBLE PRECEDENT To allow what would be its first donation of equipment used by the Japanese military to another country  lawmakers would have to amend financial regulations that require second hand government owned equipment to be sold at fair market value  sources said   That could open the way for Japan to give military equipment to other friendly nations in Southeast Asia  The sources in Japan said radar to monitor surface activity and aircraft could be easily installed on the TC 90 planes if they were transferred  The U S  military uses Beechcraft King Air 90s in transport roles and to train pilots  While Gazmin said Manila still wanted P3s that Tokyo will retire over the next several years  a senior Philippine military official said operating and maintaining such advanced surveillance aircraft and ground based support equipment would be a challenge  The P3s  which have four turboprops  also use a lot of fuel  he added  Japan worries that the Philippine military s lack of experience in maritime surveillance means it would struggle to operate the aircraft s equipment and be able to quickly analyze data collected  sources in Tokyo said  GROWING SECURITY COOPERATION China claims most of the South China Sea  The Philippines  Taiwan  Malaysia  Brunei and Vietnam also claim parts of the ocean  While acknowledging its new islands will have undefined military purposes  China insists it is not a threat to its neighbors and says the outposts will also have civilian uses such as search and rescue and weather monitoring  Recent satellite images show China has almost finished building a 3 000 metre long  10 000 foot  airstrip on one of the islands  The Philippines and Japan have conducted two naval exercises in and around the South China Sea in recent months  Philippine President Benigno Aquino and Abe also agreed in June to begin talks on a visiting forces agreement that would open the way for Japan to use bases in the Philippines to refuel aircraft and resupply naval vessels  The United States  which has security treaties with both Manila and Tokyo  has backed the cooperation because it wants its regional allies to shoulder more of the security burden as Chinese military power and assertiveness grows  Washington has asked the Japanese military to provide training and maintenance along with any aircraft it supplies to the Philippines  a U S  military source told Reuters

135759,357274,LMT,Memorial Day Thoughts On National Defense,opinion,We can best honor those who have given their lives for this nation in combat by making sure our military might is proportional to what America needs The United States spends more on our military than do China  Russia  Britain  France  Japan  and Germany put together With the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan  the cost of fighting wars is projected to drop   but the  base  defense budget  the annual cost of paying troops and buying planes  ships  and tanks   not including the costs of actually fighting wars  is scheduled to rise  The base budget is already about 25 percent higher than it was a decade ago  adjusted for inflation One big reason  It s almost impossible to terminate large defense contracts  Defense contractors have cultivated sponsors on Capitol Hill and located their plants and facilities in politically important congressional districts  Lockheed Martin  Raytheon  and others have made spending on national defense into America s biggest jobs program So we keep spending billions on Cold War weapons systems like nuclear attack submarines  aircraft carriers  and manned combat fighters that pump up the bottom lines of defense contractors but have nothing to do with 21st century combat For example  the Pentagon says it wants to buy fewer F 35 joint strike fighter planes than had been planned   the single engine fighter has been plagued by cost overruns and technical glitches   but the contractors and their friends on Capitol Hill promise a fight The absence of a budget deal on Capitol Hill is supposed to trigger an automatic across the board ten year cut in the defense budget of nearly  500 billion  starting January But Republicans have vowed to restore the cuts  The House Republican budget cuts everything else   yet brings defense spending back up  Mitt Romney s proposed budget does the same Yet even if the scheduled cuts occur  the Pentagon is still projected to spend over  2 7 trillion over the next ten years At the very least  hundreds of billions could be saved without jeopardizing the nation s security by ending weapons systems designed for an age of conventional warfare  We should shrink the F 35 fleet of stealth fighters  Cut the number of deployed strategic nuclear weapons  ballistic missile submarines and intercontinental ballistic missiles  And take a cleaver to the Navy and Air Force budgets   Most of the action is with the Army  Marines and Special Forces   At a time when Medicare  Medicaid  and non defense discretionary spending  including most programs for the poor  as well as infrastructure and basic R D  are in serious jeopardy  Obama and the Democrats should be calling for even more defense cuts A reasonable and rational defense budget would be a fitting memorial to those who have given their lives so we may remain free ,2012-05-27,Robert B.

 Reuters    United Technologies Corp  N UTX   which agreed on Monday to sell its Sikorsky helicopter business  cut its full year profit outlook on Tuesday as it warned of pressures in its aerospace systems and Otis elevators businesses 
 United Tech    whose shares fell 4 1 percent after the company also reported second quarter results  on Monday said it would sell its Sikorsky helicopter unit to  Lockheed Martin  Inc  N LMT  for  9 billion  after saying in June it planned to exit the business following a strategic review 
Excluding Sikorsky  United Tech now expects earnings from continuing operations in a range of  6 15 to  6 30 per share this year  down from the prior range of  6 35 to  6 55 per share 
The company said the commercial aftermarket for its UTC Aerospace Systems business will be  significantly below  expectations 
United Tech has been hurt as airlines have provisioned fewer replacement parts than expected for new aircraft for their maintenance stations  Chief Executive Greg Hayes said in an interview 
The company  which already twice this year had trimmed its 2015 outlook  also cited struggles for its Otis elevators business in Europe and China 
 It s a big take down and nobody is happy about it   Hayes said in an interview   I thought we had to just be realistic in terms of the second half  
With the fate of Sikorsky settled  Hayes said the company was ready to turn its focus to acquisitions  and was  looking at everything from  500 million to  5 billion  
 We re done shrinking UTC with the completion of this divestiture   Hayes said 
The U S conglomerate said that second quarter net income fell to  1 54 billion  or  1 73 per share  from  1 68 billion  or  1 84 per share  a year ago 
Analysts were looking for  1 71 per share  according to Thomson Reuters I B E S 
Sales fell 5 percent to  16 33 billion  hurt by the impact of the strong dollar on foreign sales  On an organic basis  revenue rose by 3 percent

135765,357280,LMT,Raytheon beats estimates with higher second quarter earnings  revenues,news,"By Andrea Shalal
WASHINGTON  Reuters     Raytheon Co   N RTN  posted higher than expected earnings and revenues for the second quarter  aided by strong international bookings and the favorable impact of a tax settlement  and the U S  weapons maker lifted its revenue target for the full year 
Raytheon  maker of the Patriot missile system  reported net earnings of  504 million from continuing operations  or  1 65 per share  up from  499 million and  1 59 per share a year earlier  Revenues rose 3 percent to  5 8 billion 
Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I B E S had forecast earnings of  488 million or  1 62 per share and revenues of  5 48 billion 
Chief Financial Officer Toby O Brien told Reuters that international orders comprised 44 percent of the company s backlog at the end of the second quarter  a record high  and should stay near that level for the full year 
O Brien said about 46 percent of bookings in the quarter came from international customers  including Saudi Arabia with a  2 billion order for the Patriot missile defense system 
International orders would likely slow in the second half  accounting for about 32 percent to 35 percent of total bookings for the full year  he said 
Raytheon said it now expected  22 7 billion to  23 2 billion in revenues for the full year  up from its earlier forecast of  22 3 billion to  22 8 billion 
The company lowered its outlook for earnings per share to a range of  6 47 to  6 62  from  6 67 to  6 82  to reflect about  0 25 in dilutive effect from the Websense acquisition  Excluding the acquisition  the company expected earnings per share to rise about  0 05  O Brien said 
O Brien said Raytheon remained upbeat about its acquisition of the cybersecurity firm  despite  Lockheed Martin  Corp s  N LMT  announcement this week that it may sell or spin off its commercial cyber unit and other services businesses 
 We re still excited about that acquisition  The threats that companies face continue to grow   he said  noting the firm gave Raytheon the scale needed to gain access to that market

135792,357307,LMT,Why The US Government Cant Get Anything Done,opinion,Public opinion seems to be that Congress  or more collectively Washington  is full of a bunch of lying  two faced  whiny toddlers who happen to be sophisticated enough to trade on inside information and get away with it  but can t agree on how to decrease unemployment and put America  back on track   Politicians spend more time pointing fingers at other people for past problems than they do trying to come up with solutions to fix current ones  Most are embarrassingly uneducated on subjects such as finance and economics that have enormous implications for citizens well being and future  This is easily evidenced by people like Michelle Bachmann and her  2 a gallon gas promise as well as Rick Perry and his inability to name even 3 programs he would cut to curb spending as witnessed during his now infamous  Oops  debate  never mind his inability to even understand the positives and negatives associated with those cuts   We had to waste time listening to a 9 9 9 pizza tax plan that clearly would increase taxes on the lower and middle class  although it can be argued validly that this would be more than fair  but that s another discussion for another time  The media continues to cherry pick its favorites by ignoring legitimate candidates like Jon Huntsman and Ron Paul and focusing on flavor of the week losers who are a disgrace to the republican party  it s shocking that the liberal media would do such a thing  apparently being liberal doesn t involve unbiased  free  and fairly reported news and no I am not a republican   Our newest flavor is Newt who has had 3 wives I believe  cheated on at least one of them  and took money from Fannie and Freddie for  consulting  services while supporting their growth in size  I am not here to make an argument for or against these programs  but rather to point out his hypocrisy in calling himself a republican as well as the fact that he is a sell out  sadly  that argument could be made for almost everyone in office   I don t really care how many women he cheated on as frankly it is not my business  but if an affair involving Herman Cain upsets the public so much that he has to pull out  pun intended  of the race over it  why does Newt get a free pass  We really aren t that na ve to think he s a changed man are we  I could go on and on regarding how inexplicably nauseating our politicians and political system is  Ironically  the bone chilling reality is that the politicians are not the root of the problem  the uneducated  indecisive  short sighted voters are  We  my beloved readers  are the problem and our disagreements and hypocrisy is reflected on a larger scale by Washington We have a party  the Tea Party  that has formed demanding extreme cuts in spending that would send the U S  spiraling into a depression giving rise to guys like Eric Cantor who play scenes from Hollywood movies  The Town  in meetings to rally Republicans on basically saying no to anything Democrats propose even if it based in conservative ideals  After all  we don t want Obama getting credit for anything before the 2012 election now do we  This party was and is funded by the billionaire Koch brothers and the Murdock family  not a conspiracy theorist  but quite the coincidence that the Murdoch scandal came out right around the time the Tea Party was gaining power and pissing people off in Congress   I m torn between laughing and crying when I see all the poor uneducated people supporting the cuts to the welfare and government spending that keeps them going as most don t understand what they are supporting in being a part of the Tea Party  neither do the OWS people who want socialism  more on that later  We have a President that back tracked on what he considered to be his biggest achievement that he fought tooth and nail for  healthcare reform  We have democrats trying to play off of the socialist Occupy Wall Street movement by promoting class warfare and talking as if those in the 1  are evil and should be heavily taxed  Apparently  everyone who is rich didn t earn it  they all cheated for their money and we should redistribute it to the poor  The disappointedly sobering fact of the matter is that most senators and members of the house are in the 1  and a lot of them did cheat to get there or improve upon their financial standing whereas the majority of the American people outside politics did not  All of these aforementioned extremes that are represented in our political system exist because significant slices of the American population have bunched themselves into these extreme categories  Instead of coming together united to solve this problem  the majority of us have all decided to join differing extremist groups that coincide with what hurts us and helps us on an individual basis  Let me explain what I mean We should all recognize that as individuals  states  and as a country we have spent more money than we could afford and did so on credit  We all screwed up  We all acted like pigs demanding tax cuts from our politicians combined with more entitlements  government spending   This led to an enormous deficit that was not helped by stupid irresponsible crusades in the Middle East based on false intelligence  to put it nicely  or bullshit and lies  to be blunt  Now the reality of our overspending is beginning to set in and people are pissed off  We have spent the last decade living lifestyles beyond our pay grade and now that we have tasted excess  we don t want to let it go  I would bet that many of you reading this know someone who is or was unemployed and could have worked but refused to accept a job because it didn t pay as much as they were making before  I know I do  The point is that no one wants to move backwards and will act illogically  having no income is not better than having some   living in denial about the reality of their situation  which is they were overpaid before and their skills are not longer worth as much or in demand   in a desperate attempt to cling to the  when everything was rosy  past  This desire to avoid the responsibility of dealing with the consequences that come from irresponsible and wreck less financial choices is what is splitting our nation apart Most people are smart enough to realize that the nation as a whole lived beyond its means for too long and needs to cut back ASAP  The problem is that the majority of Americans now depend on entitlement programs and government spending that helped bring us to where we are today  If you are poor you argue that it s unfair if your food stamps  heat subsidies  welfare  unemployment  etc are cut and feel that the rich should be taxed more  If you are rich you are annoyed that you have to pay for everyone else when you worked hard to get where you are  The top 1  pay about 40  of all federal income taxes while about 47  of people in this country give nothing back to society paying nothing in federal tax  If you are a doctor you want spending cut but not the government spending that comes from Medicare and Medicaid that pays your salary  If you are old you want your social security not to mention that it better not get reformed  If you work for Lockheed Martin you don t want defense spending cut and of course you believe that your program and job is crucial to America s safety  If you are a teacher you don t want education spending cut or your beloved unions broken up  God forbid you actually have to work 8 or more hours a day and more than 180 days a year and are held responsible for your performance  or lack thereof  with the possibility of losing your job  tenure s negatives are far greater than its positives and its existence makes me sick  like everyone else in this country  Government workers don t want their pensions reformed or retirement age pushed back  farmers want their subsidies  oil companies want to keep their tax breaks  and you get the idea Ahhhhh  now it s becoming more clear as to why the politicians can t agree on anything  can t agree on what to cut  and don t get anything done  Everything is everyone else s fault  not our own  cut spending just not spending that I depend on  For those of you passionate about economics  this is exactly why governments inevitably tax people via inflation and print money instead of engaging in meaningful spending cuts  On the aggregate  people are too uneducated to understand what is going on and it causes less alarm and raucous than outright cuts  The old and poor get hit the hardest in an inflationary environment Take a good look at Greece and Italy  Look at their unemployment and the enormous cuts and pain they are taking because of how they chose to live outside their means for so long  Look at the riots and the poverty  This is the path we are heading down with our growing belief that we are entitled to a house  food  a job  etc  Hell I even saw a YouTube video with an OWS protestors that wants all student loan debt forgiven because   that s what he wants   Did you know that more Porsche Cayenne were registered in Greece than people who declared making more than  50 000 a year in 2010  That is just one make from one car company  What a joke of a country  Let s make sure that we don t become Greece Now I have to propose some solutions or I too am just pointing fingers  right  Well the purpose of this article was to first recognize the source of the problem and to try and make it apparent to us all  We are the problem  We need to change our attitudes and our mentality  Life is not all about the good of the individual and instant gratification  We need to practice fiscal self control and cut back and take some pain for the mistakes made in the past  Whether it s fair or not  the rich should pay a little more  the poor should have some programs cut back  Get out of the Middle East and stop spending money on pointless wars to control oil  If we had taken that money and put it into alternative technologies we would have cheap and efficient electric cars  solar  and wind power by now  Amazing how GM can t even launch a  50k car that travels 40 miles on a charge  the Volt   but a start up relatively poor company  relative to GM  like Tesla can make a luxury one for about the same price that goes 300 without  fire safety issues  Bring us back to capitalism  bring back Glass Steagall  and break up the banks  Make them too small to bail out  Stop giving oil companies tax breaks and subsidies  Raise the retirement age to 70  do it over time if you have to  we are living longer and can t afford to pay for all the baby boomer retirees who were not responsible enough to save on their own without government help  social security   Find a way to let fiscally responsible citizens opt out of social security and instead contribute to a personal IRA  I don t think anyone wants the government taking money weekly from them that they will never see again in the same amount  If money must be taken from my paycheck I want to see it deposited in a retirement account that I can actually see online  This country was built on hard work not retirement  If you want to retire early  go to Greece  Public workers call it quits between 50 and 55 there  Have fun  Deregulate small business and promote entrepreneurship  Get rid of teachers unions  at least eliminate their influence on politicians   If you want to increase teacher s pay that s fine  but make the day 8 hours long and the school year longer  We don t need kids working on the farm during the summer anymore so we don t need 10 weeks of a brain drain vacation  Again  our country wasn t built on the idea that we should be lazy and have  fun  because we are young  it was built on hard work  Regardless  you can do both anyway  they are not mutually exclusive Pay all politicians the median income for the state in which they reside  Politicians are elected to serve the people  not profit off of them or live above them  Try politicians who have taken bribes or traded on inside information in a court of law  Regulate the amount of money companies are allowed to charge for drugs  I am all for capitalism  but not at the expense of human life  i e  just because someone will pay  1 000 for a pill to stay alive doesn t mean they should be charged that much if the pill was made for  10   Healthcare companies should not be publicly traded and neither should banks  but that is a whole different discussion  I wrote about this in my The Problem With Healthcare post if you are interested   Make it illegal for any corporation to contribute money to any politician  Personal contributions are okay  but should have a limit  maybe  5 000   In addition  a website should be created that has every politician s name with every single penny that they have ever received from any person or corporation as well as the time at which they received it  We need transparency in our political system  Someone needs to police Congress because the judicial branch has failed There are many more ideas and ways to help get our country back on track  The most important thing to take out of this is that we are all responsible for what this country has become and we will all be responsible for its future  Edmund Burke once wrote   when bad men combine  the good must associate  else they will fall  one by one  an unpitied sacrifice in a contemptible struggle   The bad  men  here are in all of us in the form of instant gratification  short sightedness  unwillingness to take the time to educate ourselves on political and economic issues thereby failing to garner the ability to cast a meaningful vote  and indecisiveness  Collectively  we all must recognize the need for sacrifice by everyone on both an individual and national scale  or else fail in our own contemptible struggle fueled by selfishness and na ve arrogance  Don t feel stupid  I had to look up contemptible too ,2011-12-08,James Berkley,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-the-us-government-cant-get-anything-done-108156,108156
135793,357308,LMT,Growth and Value  Esterline Technologies   a Leading Defense Contractor,opinion,Investing versus SpeculatingWith the amount of volatility seen in the equity markets today  many people seem to believe that the old proven practices of investing in solid businesses for the long run no longer apply   But it s important to remember that there is a significant distinction between true investing and speculating   And it s even more important to recognize that the level of risk taken by speculators is significantly greater than the amount of risk assumed by investors Although there are famous speculators  the average investor would not have the appetite for risk or the steely nerves that speculation requires   On the other hand  most of the great icons of sound and prudent investing practices offer insights and strategies that are as much common sense and prudent behavior  as they are genius   Therefore  the everyday investor is capable of applying their insights and lessons  and therefore achieving their own low risk investment success Famous investors like Warren Buffett  Philip Fisher  Peter Lynch  Bill Miller  John Neff  Sir John Templeton  Thomas Rowe Price and Bill Ruane are just a sampling of many great prudent investors who believe in investing in good businesses rather than speculating in the stock market   Then of course there is Ben Graham  who taught many of the above mentioned investing greats and offered us one of my favorite quotes to share   in the short run the market is a voting machine  but in the long run it s a weighing machine  Speculators focus on stock price movement and attempt to guess the magnitude and direction where the price of the market or a company may go next  Speculators tend to be very active traders  and therefore  tend to ignore  or at least pay very little attention to the fundamentals of the business  Consequently  the trader speculator  deals with the voting machine or short run market that Mr  Graham spoke about  To me at least  this turns the stock market into a casino  and trading is closer to gambling than it is to prudent behavior In contrast  sound investors are interested in owning the business and therefore take a longer term approach   Since they do not intend to sell the business they invest in for a long period of time  short term market volatility concerns them very little  Consequently  investors are interested in the  weight  of the business  and therefore carefully scrutinize the fundamentals underpinning the companies they are interested in  To prudent investors  the stock market merely represents the store where they can find good businesses to buy and hold for the long run   Once they buy their business  the store they bought it in is no longer of any interest to them  Esterline Technologies   Solid Fundamentals on SaleAs I was recently shopping in the stock market store  I came across a very interesting business in the aerospace defense industry that I believe is currently on sale   This is a growth business with solid fundamentals and a compelling thesis for continued above average growth   However  since it operates in the defense industry  many investors  mistakenly in my opinion  seem to believe that cuts in defense spending would curtail or eliminate this company s growth potential   Consequently  I believe this quality company is being mispriced by Mr  Market  and is currently significantly undervalued The following slides from their Investor and Analyst Day Conference presentation on September 15  2011 summarizes their businesses and geographic exposure  In addition to offering a balanced business mix by end market  Esterline Technologies  ESL  is not just dependent on the U S  market  as half their business is done outside the United States When reviewing this company based solely on fundamentals we discover that Esterline Technologies  ESL  has generated a 9 2  earnings growth rate over the past 15 years  since calendar year 1997    However  since numbers alone do not always tell the whole story  a quick glance at their earnings record illustrates a sharp acceleration in earnings growth since calendar year 2004 Esterline Technologies  earnings growth rate has accelerated to over 18 6  per annum over the time period 2005 to 2011   Most importantly  this time period includes the great recession of 2008   It s also important to acknowledge modest cyclicality within their operating results where earnings have occasionally flattened and even modestly fell in fiscal year 2009   However  after falling slightly  earnings accelerated once again in 2010 and 2011   A little cyclicality does not bother me  because like Warren Buffett  I am interested in an above average growth rate of 15  or better even if it s a little lumpy  Nevertheless  the voting machine short term market has found cause to price their shares at a significantly discounted PE ratio of only 10 7   A similar reaction by the market during the middle of 2008 to the spring of 2009 resulted in an excellent opportunity to buy this growing business on sale Esterline Technologies   Thesis for GrowthNine analysts reporting to Capital IQ expect Esterline Technologies  ESL  to grow earnings at 15  per annum over the next five years   If they were to achieve those earnings results and the stock was awarded a PE ratio expansion to a PEG ratio PE of 15  then investors could expect to earn in excess of 20  per annum on their investment  The following estimated earnings and return calculator illustrates that potential We believe the consensus estimates of future earnings growth for Esterline Technologies  ESL  are both reasonable and achievable for several reasons  First of all  we expect strong organic growth based on the fact that Esterline s products are attractively positioned to meet the most critical needs of their key customers  This would include fuel efficient consumer and business jets  modern high speed rail lines and advanced surveillance systems  The following four slides from their Investor and Analyst Day Conference on September 11  2011 highlight their opportunity The final thesis behind our confidence in Esterline s ability to achieve their earnings growth are their numerous potential acquisition opportunities   Over the past decade  Esterline has acquired over 30 strategic acquisitions  and their largest acquisition was completed in late July of 2011  They purchased France based Souriau Group for over  700 million in cash and expect this acquisition to increase fiscal 2012 earnings by over   40 a share The following  and final slide  from their investor and analyst day conference provides their guidance on high single digit long term acquisition growth rates  When you combine their guidance for high single digit organic growth with their expected acquisition growth  the consensus estimated earnings growth rate of 15  becomes very plausible ConclusionsWe believe that there are several attractive candidates in the aerospace defense industry   Names would include General Dynamics  GD   Rockwell Collins  COL   Boeing  BA   Lockheed Martin  LMT   United Technologies  UTX   L 3 Communications Holdings  LLL  and many others   However  of this entire sector  it appears that Esterline Technologies  ESL  offers the largest opportunity for future earnings growth based on its well positioned product line up and geographically diverse base  In fact  many of the companies mentioned represent important customers of Esterline Technologies On the other hand  unlike most of the other major players in the aerospace defense industry  Esterline Technologies does not pay a dividend   Instead  the company appears more focused on strategic acquisitions to grow their business and reward shareholders through growth  Therefore  Esterline Technologies  shares are more appropriate for the investors interested in the potential for above average growth at a reasonable price  Finally  Esterline Technologies is offered as an opportunity for the prudent investor to build a long term position in a high quality growing business  and therefore  is not offered as a trading vehicle   Esterline Technologies is presented as a high quality growing business that is currently on sale Disclosure   Long UTX  LLL at the time of writing Disclaimer  The opinions in this document are for

Editorial   Washington Post In a recent briefing to Congress about worldwide threats  FBI Director Robert S  Mueller III said that the danger of cyberattacks will equal or surpass the danger of terrorism  in the foreseeable future   What makes that assessment particularly alarming is that the United States may be as unprepared to defend some of its critical computer systems as it was to protect New York and Washington against al Qaeda before Sept  11  2001  Though the Pentagon has a cybercommand  it does not cover the domestic civilian economy  including vital infrastructure systems such as the electric power grid  water supplies and the financial system  Many of the computers controlling those utilities lack adequate security measures and could be devastated by viruses launched by hostile states or even hackers  As it is  U S  companies  from defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin to e mail carriers such as Google  are under continual assault from China and Russia  which seek to steal industrial or national security secrets and probe for infrastructure weaknesses   Cooperation between the government and private companies is also badly needed to ensure protection of power and water plants  banking networks  and other infrastructure essential to modern society  At least the Senate is finally working on responsible legislation to ensure better cooperation between the Pentagon  Department of Homeland Security and private companies  but we ve once again wasted far too much time and implementation should have occurred years ago Former National Security official Richard A  Clarke wrote an op ed for the Wall Street Journal  talking about Arab Israeli tensions that  have been spilling off the streets and airwaves and onto the region s fiber optic cables  Citizen hackers on both sides have engaged in tit for tat raids on Israeli  Saudi and other regional computer networks  Stock exchanges  airlines  government offices and even hospitals have had their websites defaced or shut down  Credit card numbers and personal emails have been stolen and posted on the Internet  One Israeli official has labeled the escalating cyber hostility  terrorism  and called for it to be dealt with as such  While no one has died  and this is not classic terrorism  Mr  Clarke concludes  The recent hacker exchange should remind us that just as hacking could escalate to the use of conventional force in the Middle East  the reverse is also true  Bombing Iran  for example  could unleash an Iranian government cyber attack  Israelis say they could handle that  despite the recent evidence to the contrary  Unfortunately  much of the critical infrastructure in the U S  is still not ready for a sophisticated nation state cyber attack either  ,2012-02-21,Brian

135796,357311,LMT,Exclusive  Japan interested in joining NATO missile consortium,news,By Tim Kelly and Nobuhiro Kubo TOKYO  Reuters    Japan is interested in joining a NATO missile building consortium that would give Tokyo its first taste of a multinational defense project  a move the U S  Navy is encouraging because it could pave the way for Japan to lead similar partnerships in Asia  sources said  The 12 country NATO consortium oversees development and shares the costs of the SeaSparrow missile  an advanced ship borne weapon designed to destroy anti ship sea skimming missiles and attack aircraft  The missile is made by U S  weapons firms Raytheon  N RTN  and General Dynamics  N GD   In May  Japanese naval officers traveled to a North Atlantic Treaty Organization meeting in The Hague to learn more about the consortium  Japan s navy and a U S  source familiar with the trip told Reuters  Two Japanese sources familiar with the initiative said discussions in Tokyo were at an early stage  although joining the consortium would dovetail with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe s more muscular security agenda  which included the lifting last year of a decades old ban on arms exports   The sources declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak to the media  The consortium  established in 1968 by four countries including the United States  is set to develop an upgraded version of the SeaSparrow in the coming years  Having Japan on board would spread the project s costs  but Washington also sees a role for Japan in leading multinational military industrial partnerships in Asia at a time when China s military modernization and assertiveness is alarming many countries in the region  said the U S  source  Such partnerships  which are rare in Asia  would create a network of security ties beyond formal military alliances that mostly involve Washington and its various regional allies   We think this project will allow Japan to lay the groundwork for further defense export programs in the future   the U S  source said   We would welcome this kind of security cooperation activity by Japan in the region   Asked to comment  a spokesman for the Japanese navy said in an email   The U S  Navy is keeping us informed about the SeaSparrow project  With the aim of improving the procurement efficiency of our ship based surface to air missiles we are gathering information to make the necessary choice    The U S  Navy said it was not immediately able to comment  NATO declined to comment   TOKYO ALREADY BEEFING UP ASIA TIES Japan has one of the most advanced military industrial bases in the world  but companies such as Mitsubishi Heavy Industries  T 7011  have long made weapons only for the Self Defense Forces because of the arms export ban  Since lifting those curbs  Abe has begun boosting security cooperation across Southeast Asia  where several countries with tight budgets are worried by China s creation of man made islands in the disputed South China Sea  In June  Abe agreed with Philippine President Benigno Aquino on an exchange of military technology and hardware  Abe in May also agreed to start talks on transfers of defense equipment and technology with Malaysia  And Australia is considering Japan as the possible builder of its next generation submarines  something U S  naval commanders have publicly encouraged because doing so would deepen ties between two of Washington s closest allies in Asia  None of these initiatives  however  are multinational  SOME CONCERNS IN TOKYO Japan s navy already uses the SeaSparrow missile  which is assembled locally by Mitsubishi Electric  T 6503  under a co production agreement with NATO and the U S  manufacturers   That would make the transition to a full consortium partner easier  said the U S  source   One of the Japanese sources said some concerns had been raised in Tokyo over diminished control over production by being a member  even though sharing of costs would be welcomed   The concern is what it would mean to security by having to rely on other nations   the Japanese source said  referring to the possibility supplies of munitions and equipment from other countries could be disrupted more easily than those made at home  especially during any conflict  It could also become a political issue since Japanese firms that supply parts for the SeaSparrow missiles made in Japan could miss out if Tokyo joined a consortium where work was spread among participating nations  The U S  Navy s desire to see Japan in the consortium comes after a proposal for Mitsubishi Heavy to join  Lockheed Martin  Corp s  N LMT  F 35 stealth fighter program fizzled out last year  Japanese defense bureaucrats had hoped working on the F 35 as a subcontractor to rear fuselage maker BAE Systems of Britain  L BAES  would have given Mitsubishi Heavy exposure to global arms markets  But it proved impossible for Mitsubishi Heavy to compete on pricing of components given the advantage enjoyed by contractors in the initial nine countries due to their governments  funding of specialized tooling for the program   Japan recognizes that it should join these international groups to help amortize purchases and make their industry more competitive   said a U S  executive who works closely with the Japanese government and industry   You re going to see them engaged in more and more bilateral  trilateral and multilateral groups in coming years

135945,357460,LMT,Testing of software adds to urgency in race for driverless cars,news, This version of the March 26 story has been refiled to change carmakers to drivers in the seventh paragraph  By Edward Taylor FRANKFURT  Reuters    In the race to build a self driving car  German automakers are hitting a road block in their efforts to test vehicles so complex they need more than 10 times the amount of software found in a fighter jet  German laws currently place limits on testing on public roads  Automakers fear this is allowing U S  competitor Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  to pull ahead in developing software  specifically programs that will give cars the correct reflexes in real life traffic situations   For years  so called  autonomous vehicles  have been a distant dream but technological advances and a push by Google  with its huge financial resources  to introduce a model in 2012 has kicked the race build them into high gear  Volkswagen Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn told Reuters   We are currently testing at our research facilities  some of them in the United States  The question is  do we only test these cars on public roads in the United States or can we also do it in Germany  Not enough has been done   Mercedes Benz  BMW and Audi already have prototype autonomous vehicles out on German roads but they lack the ability to legally test one of the most difficult parts of the journey   handing control back to a distracted driver   Drivers in Germany are legally not allowed to be distracted during the testing process on public roads  E mailing in a moving car on a public road is forbidden  for example    How much warning does a driver need to take back control of a vehicle after they were e mailing  Is five seconds enough  or do they need 20  These are just some of the issues that need to be resolved   Daimler spokeswoman Katharina Becker said   Mercedes Benz wants cars with highly autonomous functions to be on the road by 2020  OK COMPUTERS The importance of carmakers putting their feet to the pedal on software verification is evident from looking at the aircraft industry  which has 40 years experience of developing vehicles that run on computers    Lockheed Martin   NYSE LMT  s  400 billion F 35 Joint Strike Fighter program  which began in 2001  is still being held up by software glitches  despite the company having more than 500 software engineers   Eric Feron  a professor of Aerospace engineering at Georgia Tech  said the auto industry faces a massive challenge to verify software in autonomous cars   Cars need much more software than aircraft  The environment in the air is easier  there are no obstacles and they are driven by professional pilots  It is much more complicated on the ground   Feron said  The F 35 has between 5 million and 10 million lines of software code  compared with 100 million lines in a modern car  According to auto supplier Bosch  automation in passenger cars started with safety systems that intervened without asking the driver for permission  such as the introduction of anti lock brakes in 1978  followed by traction control in 1986   These systems have since evolved to include

to win a multi billion dollar contract to build Australia s new submarines have rebuffed an invitation to attend a gathering of top Australian naval officials and politicians this week  The no show by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Kawasaki Heavy Industries at an event called Australia s Future Submarine Summit  held amid intensifying competition for the deal  exposes a potential weak link in Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe s more muscular security agenda  Japan Inc  While Abe wants Japanese firms to vie for overseas orders after he lifted a decades old ban on arms exports last year  such companies are showing little appetite for doing business in foreign markets after being restricted to local sales for so long  Japanese defense officials and experts said  That isolation  imposed after Japan s defeat in World War Two  has left the country s industrial heavyweights with few contacts in foreign defense departments and made weapons a small part of their operations  Experts say they also worry about being called  merchants of death  at home  where Japan s wartime role remains a sensitive issue  should they start selling state of the art weapons abroad   Winning deals overseas means having to develop contacts in foreign governments or seek joint ventures  and that is a bit much for them  so they are holding back   said a Japanese Defence Ministry official who declined to be identified  A source involved in organizing the conference in Adelaide said Mitsubishi Heavy and Kawasaki Heavy  makers of the Soryu class stealth submarines  had declined an invitation

submarines would be built at state owned shipbuilder ASC in Adelaide  before back pedaling by signaling that cost and timely delivery were paramount  After Australia and Japan agreed in June to cooperate on military technology  sources said Canberra began leaning towards buying an off the shelf version of the 4 000 tonne Soryu class submarine to replace six ageing Collins class vessels  Abbott s government ruled out an open tender in December  appearing to put Japan in the box seat  But Abbott then came under growing pressure from labor unions and the main opposition party  which both demanded a local build to boost Australia s languishing manufacturing industry  Just before an internal challenge to his leadership in February  which he survived  Abbott promised something closer to an open tender in an attempt to shore up political support  The reluctance of Mitsubishi and Kawasaki to chase Australia s biggest defense deal   they have let the Japanese government play the lead role in talks with Canberra up to now  according to Japanese Defence Ministry officials   is in contrast to Germany s ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems  ThyssenKrupp  along with France s state controlled naval contractor DCNS  have both expressed interest in the tender and said they would build in Australia  Delegations from ThyssenKrupp have visited Canberra in recent months  A ThyssenKrupp spokesman said the company would be represented at the conference  The event s leading corporate sponsor is  Siemens  AG  XETRA SIEGn   which makes electrical engines and fuel cells for ThyssenKrupp s submarines  Abbott has also thrown open the tender  which he has called a  competitive evaluation process   to ASC   The sense I m getting from Australia is that the competitive evaluation is weighted in Japan s favor  but it requires a proactive industrial approach   said a defense industry source who will attend the Adelaide meeting   It s Japan s to lose unless they wake up to the opportunity   MISGIVINGS Dismantled by the United States after World War Two  Japan s defense industry re emerged as a patchwork of manufacturers  At Mitsubishi Heavy  the biggest  defense accounts for just a tenth of revenue   Corporate misgivings were on show at a Defence Ministry seminar in Tokyo in July to explain the end of the arms export ban three months earlier   Defence managers don t have much influence  Risky projects aren t going to make it past the board   one participant told Reuters at the event   No company has defense sales of more than 10 percent of overall revenue  there is a lot of resistance to doing anything new   said another  Such reluctance has already stalled one potential breakthrough export deal  Mitsubishi Heavy at the start of 2014 entered a tentative agreement with Britain s BAE Systems  LONDON BAES  PLC  which is helping build  Lockheed Martin  Corp  NYSE LMT  s F 35 stealth fighter  to supply rear fuselage components   Unwilling to risk losing money on a tightly priced deal Mitsubishi withdrew  sources familiar with the talks told Reuters at the time    We need to get one or two successful deals done   said the Japanese Defence

136041,357556,LMT,Exclusive  Orbital explosion probe said to find debris in engine  sources,news,By Andrea Shalal WASHINGTON  Reuters    Last October s explosion of Orbital ATK Inc s Antares rocket may have been triggered when debris inadvertently left in a fuel tank traveled into the booster s main engine  two people familiar with investigations into the accident told Reuters  The sources said the preliminary findings suggest that a simple assembly mistake by Orbital ATK could have caused the explosion  which destroyed a cargo ship bound for the International Space Station   Orbital initially linked the explosion to a problem with the turbo pump in one of the two Soviet era NK 33 engines that power the rocket  GenCorp Inc s Aerojet Rocketdyne unit refurbishes the old motors and resells them as AJ 26 motors  Orbital ATK on Friday acknowledged that so called  foreign object debris  was one of more than a half dozen credible causes of the explosion  but said it was not  a leading candidate as the most probable cause of the failure   Orbital spokesman Barry Beneski said the company led  accident investigation board   which includes officials from NASA and the Federal Aviation Administration  had not identified any evidence of mishandling of the flight hardware by Orbital  He said Orbital continued to compare data from the October explosion with a May 2014 test stand failure of a different AJ 26 engine  and prior failures involving AJ 26 ground tests in 2009  2011 and 2012   No details have been released on the May 2014 test stand incident  but sources familiar with the earlier investigation said it was likely linked to faulty  workmanship  on the original motor  and additional inspections had been mandated to prevent mishaps with other engines  Orbital also successfully launched one Antares rocket in July 2014  after the May incident  NASA spokeswoman Stephanie Schierholz said NASA was conducting its own internal  lessons learned  review of the accident  but declined to give any details about individual aspects of the investigation  She agreed with Orbital that foreign object debris was always considered as a possible cause in aerospace accidents   If the investigations confirm that debris from the fuel tanks caused the Antares explosion  that could have significant financial and legal effects for Orbital ATK  which was formed by the merger of Orbital Sciences Corp and Alliant Techsystems  The new findings could also open the door for a legal claim against Orbital by GenCorp  which took a  17 5 million loss in October  after Orbital said the accident had prompted it to accelerate plans to switch to a different engine  One source said the Orbital investigation could end without declaring a single  root cause  for the explosion  Probes of past accidents have had similar results  Several sources said it may be difficult to determine conclusively whether the debris entered the engine before the explosion  or as a result of it  Glenn Mahone  spokesman for Aerojet Rocketdyne  declined to comment on the investigations  noting that they were still underway  He also declined to comment on the cause of the May test stand failure  which is part of the investigation  One of the sources familiar with the probe said investigators found particles of a crystallized desiccant  or drying agent  in the turbo pump and other parts of the AJ 26 engine  The crystals could have caused sparks and triggered a fire when they hit the turbo pump in the oxygen rich environment  the source said   Desiccants are often used to control moisture in fuel tanks but need to be removed before takeoff  the sources said  While the NASA investigation had not finalized the root cause of the accident  there were multiple signs that suggested some  foreign object debris  had been ingested into the engine from the fuel tanks  one source said  Antares had four previous successful flights  The Oct  28 explosion was the first accident since NASA began using commercial providers to fly cargo to the space station  Orbital already faces steep bills for damage to the launch site  and the need to buy a different rocket to launch its next cargo ship to the space station   In December  the company said it would buy a booster from United Launch Alliance  a joint venture of Lockheed Martin Corp  NYSE LMT  and Boeing Co  to meet its obligations under a  1 9 billion cargo supply contract with NASA   Orbital is one of two companies NASA hired to fly 40 000 pounds of cargo each to the station following the retirement of the space shuttles in 2011  Privately held Space Exploration Technologies  or SpaceX  has the other contract  valued at  1 6 billion ,2015-02-20,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/general-news/exclusive:-orbital-explosion-probe-said-to-find-debris-in-engine:-sources-328983,328983

136072,357587,LMT,India s ailing air force at risk in tough neighborhood,news,By Siva Govindasamy and Tommy Wilkes BENGALURU  India  Reuters    India s air force risks a major capability gap opening up with China and Pakistan without new western warplanes or if local defense contractors can t produce what the military needs in a timely manner  A 2012 agreement to buy 126 Rafale fighters from France s Dassault Aviation has stalled due to a dispute over the assembly of the aircraft in India   India s first homegrown fighter  the Tejas light combat aircraft  will finally be delivered next month  30 years after it was conceived  But senior air force officers privately said they were unimpressed  with one former officer  an ex fighter pilot  saying the plane was  so late it is obsolete   While the navy is undergoing an accelerated modernization drive  experts said India was vulnerable in the skies because of its reliance on a disparate fleet of aging Russian made MiG and French Mirage fighters  along with more modern Russian Sukhoi Su 30s  Half of India s fighters are due to retire beginning this year until 2024   It could lead to humiliation at the hands of our neighbors   AK Sachdev  a retired air force officer  wrote last year in the Indian Defence Review journal  A coordinated attack by China and arch rival Pakistan could stretch the Indian military  he added  It s a scenario defense strategists in New Delhi have been asked to plan for  Indian air force sources say  although experts say such an event is highly unlikely to happen  India s ties with China are still hamstrung by a dispute over their Himalayan border that led to war in 1962  New Delhi is also wary of China s expanding naval presence in the Indian Ocean and its close relations with Pakistan  MULTIPLE CRASHES India s air force has 34 operational squadrons  down from 39 earlier this decade and below the government approved strength of 42  a parliamentary committee said in December   More than half of India s MiGs have crashed in recent decades  the then defense minister said in 2012  At the same time  China is flying locally built fourth generation J 10 fighters and is testing two fifth generation stealth fighter jets   Pakistan is upgrading its Lockheed Martin  NYSE LMT  F 16 fighters as well as using JF 17 warplanes developed with China  It is also in talks to buy J 10s  according to Pakistani and Chinese industry sources  India would still win a war against Pakistan because of the sheer size of its air force  but the slow modernization means victory would come with heavy casualties  said Richard Aboulafia  Washington D C  based vice president of analysis at the Teal Group  an aerospace and defense think tank  To keep up  India is buying more Su 30s and upgrading other existing fighters   We do need to increase our defense preparedness   Prime Minister Narendra Modi told the opening ceremony of the Aero India airshow in the city of Bengaluru on Wednesday  Criticism of the Tejas was unfounded  said K  Tamilmani  a senior official at the Defence Research and Development Organisation  DRDO   a defense ministry agency which designed and developed the plane    The Tejas has a safety record that is unbeaten   Tamilmani told Reuters by telephone  adding it would provide a platform to develop more advanced fighters in the years ahead  IMPASSE OVER RAFALE JETS The Rafale fighters are expected to replace some of India s MiGs and Mirage jets  But India is insisting Dassault take full responsibility for production of the aircraft at a state run facility in Bengaluru  Indian defense ministry officials have said  France has said it will help Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd stick to delivery schedules  but that it cannot give guarantees for production of the aircraft made at a facility over which it has no administrative or expert control  India would decide on the fate of the deal only after March  when a defense ministry committee delivers a report on the issue  Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar said at the airshow  Cancellation would be  disastrous   said Deba Mohanty  chairman at Indicia Research   Advisory  a New Delhi based defense consulting firm   It s a really tricky situation in which the supplier is unhappy  the bureaucrats are unhappy and the end user is disappointed   said Mohanty  India has successfully introduced Boeing s C 17 cargo plane and P 8 Poseidon anti submarine aircraft and Lockheed Martin s C 130J transport  all bought directly  over the last few years   That shows off the shelf solutions work best  experts said  However  under the Modi administration s  Make in India  program  there is an emphasis on building a domestic defense industrial base to cut dependence on foreign supplies that have made India the world s biggest arms importer  The DRDO for example is working on the Tejas Mark II  a slightly larger plane than the original  which will feature more powerful engines  better radars and upgraded avionics  Local trainer jets  light transport aircraft and helicopter programs are also under way   People who fly planes want the best value for money  which means off the shelf   said Aboulafia   People who want jobs and technology development schemes have different priorities  That s why the two groups don t like each other much

136167,357682,LMT,Exclusive  Lockheed  Pentagon reach  4 billion deal for more F 35 jets,news,"WASHINGTON  Reuters    Lockheed Martin Corp  N LMT  and U S  defense officials have reached agreement on the terms of a contract worth about  4 billion for an eighth batch of 43 F 35 fighter jets  sources familiar with the deal said on Thursday 
The contract will lower the cost of the radar evading warplane by about 3 percent and includes jets to be built for the U S  military  Britain and other U S  allies  according to the sources  who were not authorized to speak publicly 
The cost of the U S  Air Force model of the plane  which accounts for 27 of the 43 aircraft  will go down by nearly 4 percent  said one of the sources 
Both sides had expected to reach a deal in May or June  but the negotiations slowed after a June 23 engine failure on an Air Force jet grounded the entire F 35 fleet for several weeks 
Lockheed Chief Financial Officer Bruce Tanner told analysts on Tuesday that the company was close to reaching a deal with the Pentagon office that runs the  399 billion weapons program  the costliest arms project 
The Pentagon reached an agreement earlier this month with engine maker Pratt   Whitney  a unit of United Technologies Corp  N UTX   that lowered the cost of the engines that will power the seventh batch of jets by 4 5 percent 
Pratt expects to conclude an agreement with similar cost reductions for engines to power the eighth set of jets after the Lockheed deal is finalized 
Lockheed  the Pentagon s No  1 supplier  delivered the first airplane from the sixth lot of jets on Wednesday  It was the 23rd jet to be delivered this year of 36 that are due 
Lockheed has said it has a plan to deliver all 36 jets that were slated for this year  despite the grounding earlier this summer and some flight restrictions that remain in place

136168,357683,LMT,Exclusive  BAE Systems says U S  halted its work on F 16 upgrades for South Korea,news,"By Andrea Shalal WASHINGTON  Reuters    The U S  unit of Britain s BAE Systems Plc on Tuesday said the U S  Air Force has halted some of the company s initial work on a project to upgrade South Korea s F 16 fighter jets amid ongoing talks about the second phase of the project 
 We remain concerned about the lack of progress in the negotiations between the Republic of Korea and the U S  Air Force on the KF 16 upgrade program that has now resulted in a partial stop work order   said BAE spokesman Brian Roehrkasse 
South Korea last week said it could cancel the overall project to upgrade 134 F 16 fighter jets and seek a different contractor  after the U S  Air Force told Seoul the projected cost of 1 75 trillion won   1 7 billion  could rise by 800 billion won 
The U S  unit of BAE Systems beat out Lockheed Martin Corp  which built the jets  to win the South Korean upgrade contract in 2012  the first non original equipment maker to win a competition for F 16 upgrades 
The company has several hundred employees working on an initial  140 million development contract for the upgrades  and had hoped that U S  and South Korean officials would reach agreement about the second phase of the work by year end 
But the deal ran into trouble after the U S  Air Force  which is managing the arms sale for the U S  government  added significant  risk reserves  to proposed costs  according to sources familiar with the matter 
Roehrkasse said BAE remained committed to the terms of the firm fixed price contract initially discussed despite the dispute between the Air Force and South Korea over the cost 
 We have made it clear throughout this process that we remain committed to the firm fixed price contract for the scope of work defined by the U S  government and the Republic of Korea last year   Roehrkasse said in a statement to Reuters 
Vice Admiral Joe Rixey  who heads the Pentagon s Defense Security Cooperation Agency  which oversees foreign arms sales  met with South Korean officials last week to discuss the issue 
South Korea must cancel the contract that BAE is working on before it can sign a contract with Lockheed to do the work  according to U S  industry and government officials 
South Korean officials requested the partial stop work order  and are expected to formally cancel the contract soon  according to sources familiar with the issue 
Pentagon and Air Force officials had no immediate comment on the stop work order or reports in the Korean press that South Korea could sue BAE to recover funds already spent 
 BAE Systems doesn t believe that it would be financially liable in any circumstances regarding this contracting disagreement   said one company official  who asked not to be named since the issue had not yet been resolved 

The official said BAE had not laid off any employees working on the contract as a result of the stop work order

 They helped me see what I m not seeing  simply because I m a guy  and as my wife tells me  an old  white guy   Amos said 
Amos also went to Bentonville  Arkansas to meet with Gisel Ruiz  executive vice president and chief operating officer of Wal Mart Stores Inc  N WMT   and other Wal Mart executives 
When they asked him if he knew about Sandberg and her bestselling book  Lean In  Women  Work and the Will to Lead   Amos says   I had to display my  cave man  prowess and say no  
But he quickly caught up by reading the book  watching Sandberg s 2010 famous talk to the TED group about women in leadership  and finally meeting with her at Facebook s headquarters in Menlo Park  California 
Since then  Sandberg has twice visited the Marines  officer candidate school to meet with future leaders  Amos also asked all 15 three star generals in the Marines  all male  to read Sandberg s book ahead of a meeting with her at the Pentagon 
 She hit it out of the park   he said  as he described the impact of Sandberg s firsthand account of her experiences as one of the very few women at the C level of business 
Facebook declined to comment 
Amos said the outreach to corporate leaders has prompted new discussions among Marine Corps officials about how to encourage women stay in the military even when they decide to have children  and other ways to promote leadership among women 
Several months ago  he convinced a female major who was thinking of quitting to stay in the service by helping her get a transfer together with her husband  who is also a Marine 
 It was a small thing  but it s important   he said  noting that a dearth of young women officers was reducing the size of the  bench  for future leaders 
The Marine Corps has also set up a special office to focus on  talent management  and coordinate a range of diversity efforts under way across the service  It is also reviewing standards for a wide range of jobs as it prepares to comply with the Pentagon s 2013 decision to open combat roles to women 
Bringing in Sandberg has generated important discussions among Marines  one female officer told Reuters 

 You d think our sectors would be very different  but we face a lot of the same challenges  Sheryl told us that when she looks across her company  she looks five lines deep and there is not a woman in sight

136230,357745,LMT,U S  lifts F 35 grounding but skips British air show,news,"By Andrea Shalal  FARNBOROUGH England  Reuters    U S  military officials have approved limited flights of Lockheed Martin s F 35 fighter jets after a nearly month long grounding  but scrapped plans for the new U S  warplane s much anticipated international debut in Britain   The F 35  the world s most expensive weapons project with a price tag of about  400 billion  has been largely grounded since the massive failure of a Pratt   Whitney engine on a U S  Air Force F 35 plane at a Florida air base on June 23   Pentagon spokesman Rear Admiral John Kirby said on Tuesday U S  Air Force and Navy officials had granted the radar evading jet a limited flight clearance that required engine inspections every three hours and various flight restrictions   Later in the day  Kirby told reporters the jet would not be heading to the Farnborough air show    I can confirm that the Department of Defense in concert with our partners in the UK has decided not to send Marine Corps and UK F 35B aircraft across the Atlantic to participate in the Farnborough air show   Kirby said          While we re disappointed that we re not going to be able to participate in the air show  we remain fully committed to the program itself and look forward to future opportunities to showcase its capabilities to allies and to partners    The jet s failure to appear at a big military air show in Britain last week and its absence from the Farnborough event in southern England have been a blow for U S  officials and their international partners  who were hoping to highlight the jet s advanced capabilities before potential buyers   Global orders for the F 35 are expected to exceed 3 000  with Italy  Turkey  Australia and Norway among the U S  allies planning to purchase the plane   It s a black eye and a PR nightmare  but it s not going to change the outcome   said aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia with the Virginia based Teal Group    He said the jet s absence from the British show  which began on Monday  was unlikely to affect buying decisions by foreign military forces but could prompt Canada and Denmark to opt for a competition instead of an outright F 35 purchase   The reactions of Lockheed and Pratt   Whitney were muted    While we were looking forward to the F 35 demonstration at Farnborough  we understand and support the DoD and UK Ministry of Defense s decision   spokeswoman Laura Siebert said   Pratt said it respected the decision  and had worked closely with the military to resume F 35 flights   SAFETY IS PRIORITY  Kirby said that restrictions on the plane s return to flight included limiting its speed to 0 9 Mach and 18 degrees of angle of attack  The front fan section of each engine must be inspected after three hours of flight time    That was a pretty significant limitation in terms of being able to fly them across the Atlantic   he said   The decision was sure to disappoint top executives from the biggest contractors involved in the F 35 program  who had traveled to Britain for the plane s foreign debut  Billboards all over London had heralded the F 35 s grand debut for months   The planes had been slated to follow a route relatively close to the U S  and Canadian coast  up past Greenland before heading to Europe  rather than a direct flight across the Atlantic Ocean  according to sources familiar with the plans   But inspections after every three hours would have expanded the travel time far beyond the seven hours initially planned  The decision to lift the grounding order was made at a high level meeting on Monday and reflected growing evidence the engine failure was a one off event and not due to a systemic or fundamental design flaw  sources familiar with the matter said    Kirby said the engine issue did not appear to be a systemic issue  and the Pentagon expected to restore the jet s full operational capability in the near future   Pentagon acquisition chief Frank Kendall told reporters on Monday that no similar problems had been found on any of the other 98 engines in service and underscored that the program was still in the development stage  when technical problems are meant to be found and fixed   Lockheed shares closed 81 cents higher at  162 62 on the New York Stock Exchange  while shares in United Technologies Corp  the parent of Pratt  were down 4 cents at  114 84

136231,357746,LMT,F 35 engine mishap  UK  no show  rich in lessons learned,news,"By Andrea Shalal FARNBOROUGH England  Reuters    The engine failure that grounded Lockheed Martin s F 35 fighter jets and the warplane s now canceled appearance at two UK air shows provided key  lessons learned  for the companies that build the jets  and the military forces that use them 
While the outcome was disappointing for air show visitors and many people involved in the F 35 program  U S  military and industry officials said both the engine incident and air show planning allowed them to learn a lot about handling future problems and taking the jets overseas 
The  400 billion weapons program is the world s largest single arms project and encompasses three different U S  military services  eight countries that helped fund the plane s development  two other foreign militaries  and a separate Pentagon office  as well as three separate aircraft models 
U S  military officials on Tuesday announced that they had approved limited flights of the F 35 jets but imposed mandatory engine inspections and various flight restrictions  and banned the planned flights to Farnborough air show 
The latest grounding   the program s 12th to date   was not the longest  but it was complicated by the fact that U S  and British jets were due to leave for Britain just days after the Pratt   Whitney F135 engine on an Air Force jet broke apart and caught fire at a Florida Air Force base on June 23 
Strict Air Force protocols for safety investigations   which include quarantining the affected jet   also meant that engineers from the Pentagon and engine maker Pratt did not have access to the affected jets for days  which slowed efforts to get the jets flying again 
Orlando Carvalho  executive vice president of Lockheed s aeronautics division  told Reuters on Wednesday that Lockheed and its key suppliers learned a great deal while preparing for what would have been the F 35 s first foreign deployment  building on the planes  first deployments to the USS Wasp for testing in 2011 and 2013 
He said Lockheed developed detailed plans for transporting and storing spare parts  provided maintenance support and tested international use of the computerized logistics system called ALIS that stores mission plans and maintenance data   and all those systems worked well 
Carvalho said he was less concerned about hashing over what happened in this incident than ensuring improved procedures to deal with any future mishaps  Any changes to procedures would be led by the government in consultation with industry  he said 
 The fundamental question coming out of the last three weeks is  okay  if this were to occur again  how do we do this better   he told Reuters at the Farnborough air show that was supposed to celebrate the new jet s international debut 
He said differentiated plans were needed to deal with incidents that affected each separate model  as well as those that were common to all three 
Air Force Lieutenant General Christopher Bogdan  the Pentagon s F 35 program chief  told reporters earlier this week the program would review and revamp current communications procedures about accidents and other safety concerns 
Marine Lieutenant General Jon Davis  who took over as deputy commandant for aviation on July 1  said the military was used to doing  after action reports  about what went right and wrong on any military operation 
 We are going to get smart about how we do things as a joint program  That will probably be the number one thing that comes out of this   Davis said   I can guarantee that we ll come up with a little bit different construct for the next time around  
Davis said the services  needed to retain the responsibility for investigating accidents and mishaps  but it was critical to do that in a way that allowed sharing of information  at an appropriate level  with affected other operators 
He said the services should also look at ways to ensure quick sharing of data about pilot training and procedures  as well as emergency response procedures  as more and more jets are fielded in a growing number of countries in coming years 
Endre Lunde  F 35 spokesman for Norway s defence ministry  welcomed the effective safety procedures used in this case 
Lunde said the latest incident had  highlighted some challenges in how we handle such incidents in a large multinational program  and we expect that this also will be subject of review in the time going forward  

Paul Adams  president of Pratt   Whitney  said the fact that the program was still doing developmental testing while already producing larger numbers of jets   a practice called concurrency   had actually helped officials get more insight earlier in the performance of the engines and other components 
Far more F 35 jets were in use now for testing and training than is typical at this stage in a normal development program because of concurrency  he said 
Marine Corps Captain Richard Ulsh said cancellation of the F 35 s appearance at the air was unfortunate for show planners and visitors  but provided valuable training for the Marines 
 We learned how to logistically support the F 35 on a different continent and most importantly we safely returned the aircraft to flight in a relatively short amount of time to continue training pilots   he said

136252,357767,LMT,BAE Systems battles Lockheed for  10 billion F 16 upgrade work,news,"By Sarah Young and Andrea Shalal FARNBOROUGH England  Reuters    Europe s largest defense contractor BAE Systems  L BAES  expects to win more than half of the  10 billion market to modernize F 16 fighter jets  saying its cost effective offering could give it an edge in the battle with Lockheed Martin  N LMT  
In 2012  BAE was selected to upgrade over 130 South Korean F 16s  beating Lockheed Martin  the plane s maker  for a contract worth up to  1 3 billion 
Tighter military budgets in the United States and Europe have resulted in a dearth of orders for new jets  forcing weapon makers like BAE and Lockheed to battle it out for upgrade work 
The global market for similar upgrades on F 16 jets is estimated at about  10 billion over the next ten years  according to BAE System s vice president for global fighter programs John Bean 
Bean was optimistic that BAE s  cost effective  proposition would help it win a large share of that market 
 A majority of it is our expectation   Bean said  when asked how much of the total F 16 upgrade work BAE thought it could win 
BAE s strategy of operating without the need for the large  expensive infrastructure of the equipment maker itself  would help it win business  he explained 
 It s the way we structure the business that allows us to be more cost effective   he said 
SINGAPORE  GREECE
Singapore and Greece are amongst the future F 16 modernization opportunities for both companies  while BAE said it had also received interest from Turkey and Chile  plus three to four other countries which Bean said had not gone public 
Bill McHenry  head of business development for Lockheed s F 16 program  said his company was standing ready to support Singapore s upgrade plans  but could not say when a possible order could be finalised 
McHenry also said that with economic conditions improving in Greece  that country  with a long standing interest in a revamp  was once again in talks with possible providers  Greece could firm up its plans in the next six months to a year  he said 
Lockheed suffered a blow this year when the U S  Air Force canceled planned upgrades for a number of F 16s due to budget constraints  but McHenry said the Air Force was now pursuing more modest and limited upgrades to its F 16s that would include a mission computer upgrade and new cockpit avionics 
Lockheed remained on track to complete similar work for Taiwan  McHenry said   That program is on schedule   he told Reuters in an interview at the Royal International Air Tattoo last week 
BAE s Bean said South Korea s F 16s would be fitted with new weapons systems  e scan radar and new mission avionics  adding that BAE s improvement capability offered higher resolution screens and higher speed technologies compared with its rivals 
Up to 3 000 F 16s could eventually need upgrades  Bean said  with interest from countries including Egypt and Morocco a future possibility 

BAE has established a team of 165 in Fort Worth  Texas  to do the work and plans to add another 150 engineers to the team

136313,357828,LMT,EXCLUSIVE Taiwan renews push for modern US F 16 fighters,news,"  Taiwan says its defenses inadequate against China
   Unofficial embassy spells out arms shopping list
   Puts Obama in bind as China opposes US arms sales
 By Jim Wolf
 WASHINGTON  March 14  Reuters    Taiwan has renewed a drive
to buy advanced U S  built F 16 fighter aircraft  confronting
President Barack Obama with a delicate decision 
 Detailing its arms shopping list for the first time since
Obama took office  Taipei s de facto embassy in Washington said
its current fighter force was inadequate to a potential threat
from China across the 110 mile   177 km  wide Taiwan Strait 
 The largest part of Taiwan s air force  F 5 fighters  have
been in service for more than 34 years  said a spokesman for
the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office 
  The planes now are obsolete and spare parts are difficult
to obtain   said spokesman  Vance Chang  in an email response
to questions about Taiwan s arms requests 
  China  which views Taiwan as a rogue province  has built
increasingly advanced fighters  the statement said   therefore
our air superiority capability is at a serious disadvantage  
  Taiwan s determination to defend itself is indisputable  
it added  Taiwan has been trying for 12 years to buy F 16 C D
models built by Lockheed Martin Corp of Bethesda  Maryland 
 The U S  government is required by a 1979 law to provide
self ruled Taiwan sufficient arms to defend itself 
 Successive U S  administrations  both Democratic and
Republican  have managed the weapons flow to minimize fallout
with China    a major trading partner and the biggest foreign
holder of U S  Treasury bonds 
 In its final years  former President George W  Bush s
administration would not even accept a formal request for the
advanced F 16s  said the U S  Taiwan Business Council  which
represents about 100 companies  including Lockheed Martin 
 The United States  has an obligation to assist Taiwan to
maintain a credible defense of its air space  which includes
modern fighters   said council president Rupert
Hammond Chambers 
 Taiwan wants 66 F 16 C Ds valued at up to  4 9 billion to
bolster 150 F 16A B models it bought in 1992 
 The State Department had no immediate comment on the
statement from TECRO  as the unofficial embassy is known 
 Beijing has vowed to bring Taiwan under its rule  by force
if necessary  and opposes U S  arms sales as interference in
its domestic affairs 
 BETTER RELATIONS
 Ties have warmed since Taiwanese President Ma Ying jeou
replaced President Chen Shui bian last May  Chen often angered
Beijing by threatening to formally declare independence 
 In October  the Bush administration notified Congress of
possible arms sales to Taiwan of up to  6 4 billion  including
Patriot  Advanced Capability  antimissile batteries  Apache
attack helicopters and Harpoon anti ship missiles 
  We were eager to achieve a golden mean    a robust package
of arms sales that met Taiwan s immediate defense needs but was
not perceived in Beijing as undermining the progress in cross 
strait relations   said Dennis Wilder  senior director for East
Asian affairs on Bush s White House National Security Council 
  I believe we achieved that goal   he added in an email
response to Reuters 
 TECRO  in its statement to Reuters  made clear Ma s
administration was still seeking UH 60 Black Hawk utility
helicopters built by United Technologies Corp s Sikorsky unit
and design work on modern diesel electric submarines 
 These two items were cleared for release to Taiwan by Bush
as part of a landmark arms offer in April 2001  but left out of
the October notification to Congress  The deals were held up
for years  largely by partisan hurdles to funding in Taiwan 
 Funds to start acquiring the work on submarines  Black Hawk
helicopters and the F 16 C Ds now have been approved by the
Legislative Yuan  Taiwan s parliament  TECRO said 
 Wilder said the Bush administration had told Taiwan that it
was not denying it any of the weapons approved in 2001  but
would leave the decision to Obama 
  We wanted to leave the door open for the next U S 
administration to do its own review in consultation with Taiwan
to decide on future arms sales   he said

136314,357829,LMT,UPDATE 3 France hopeful of sale of 60 Rafale jets to UAE,news,"  France closely following talks on sale of 60 Rafale to UAE
   President Sarkozy pleased with progress of the talks
   Dassault Aviation shares up 1 1 percent
 
  Adds background  details  quotes 
 By Matthias Blamont
 PARIS  June 19  Reuters    France hailed progress on Friday
towards what could be the first sale of Dassault Aviation s
Rafale fighter jets to a foreign buyer after the United Arab
Emirates signalled it was seriously interested in the aircraft 
 Military authorities in the Gulf state have officially told
France the specifications it requires of the plane  marking a
step forward in what would be one of the biggest French defence
contracts in years 
 However  people close to the matter told Reuters that
discussions between the parties could go on for  several months 
before any final decision is taken and the Rafale is likely to
face strong competition from rival U S  bids 
 The Rafale  Dassault Aviation s newest multirole combat
aircraft  has been a flagship programme for France s arms
industry but has had problems in finding export buyers  despite
major efforts by French authorities 
 Friday s move by the UAE was welcomed by the Elysee Palace 
which has seen several potential Rafale deals lost in recent
years and which has been following the UAE talks closely 
 President Nicolas Sarkozy  who opened a French military base
in Abu Dhabi this year and who has set up a special unit at the
Elysee to support the Rafale  said the deal was moving ahead
 significantly  but did not say when he expected a decision 
  It s progressing  they ve given us all the technical
specifications they expect of the Rafale   he told a press
conference in Brussels where he had been attending a European
Union summit   It s a very important subject for France  
 The UAE wish list includes a 20 percent boost in thrust for
the twin engine plane  which competitors say is under powered 
and engine maker Safran has agreed to study this 
 
 COMPETITION
 Analysts calculate that the sale of 60 Rafale aircraft 
which are currently only deployed by the French military  could
be worth between 6 8 billion euros and Dassault Aviation shares
were up 1 1 percent at 395 euros by 1325 GMT 
 Dassault has declined to confirm the figures but has said an
agreement may be reached this year 
 A spokesman said on Friday it was pleased  that the talks
between our company and the Emirates authorities are
progressing  We are attentive to the demands of the client  
 The UAE state news agency said the date of any deal would
 be set based on the results of the financial negotiations   
 According to people familiar with the deal  these
negotiations are likely to be long and complicated and would
also include the possibility of buying back old Mirage combat
jets from the UAE or selling them on to another buyer 
  That s a variable which could change the total price of the
operation  The Dassault teams don t want the face value of the
contract to go down   one source said 
 One other person close to the deal  who spoke on condition
of anonymity  said Dassault would have to expect fierce
competition from its U S  rivals Lockheed Martin and Boeing 
 Despite the upbeat comments  one industry observer said the
French statement could mask some disappointment that a deal had
not been struck in time for the Paris Air Show this week  
  The message is  air show over  see you in Dubai   he said 
referring to the Nov  15 19 Dubai Air Show 
 Beyond the deal itself  France hopes an export win for the
Rafale could lead to other deals  notably in the Gulf  where
Qatar and Kuwait could follow if the UAE takes the first step
