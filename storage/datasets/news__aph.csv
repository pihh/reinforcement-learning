Prepared Remarks 
OperatorHello  and welcome to the Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call for Amphenol Corporation  Following today s presentation  there will be a formal question and answer session   Operator Instructions   I would now like to introduce today s conference host  Mr  Craig Lampo  Sir  you may begin Craig A  Lampo    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerGreat  Thank you  Good afternoon  everyone  This is Craig Lampo  Amphenol s CFO  and I m here together with Adam Norwitt  our CEO  We would like to welcome you to our fourth quarter 2019 conference call Our fourth quarter and full year 2019 results were released this morning  I will provide some financial commentary and then Adam will give an overview of the business as well as current trends  and then we will take questions  As a reminder  we may refer in this call to certain non GAAP financial measures and may make certain forward looking statements  so please refer to the relevant disclosures in our press release for further information The Company closed the fourth quarter with sales of  2 151 billion and with GAAP and adjusted diluted EPS of  1 03 and  0 98  respectively  Sales were down 3  in U S  dollars and 2  in local currency as compared to the fourth quarter of 2018  From an organic standpoint  excluding both acquisitions and currency impacts  sales in the fourth quarter decreased 8   Sequentially  sales were up 2  in both U S  dollars and in local currencies and up 1  organically  Breaking sales down into our two segments  the interconnect business which comprise 95  of our sales was down 3  in both US dollars and in local currencies compared to the fourth quarter of last year Our cable business which comprise the remainder of our sales was down 3  in US dollars and down 1  in local currencies compared to the fourth quarter of last year  For the full year 2019  sales were a record  8 225 billion  which was flat in US dollars  up 2  in local currencies  and down 3  organically compared to 2018 Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes  Adjusted operating income was  430 million for the fourth quarter of  19  adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 20   which compared to 21  in the fourth quarter of 2018  and 19 7  in the third quarter of 2019  From a segment standpoint  in the interconnect segment  margins were 22  in the fourth quarter of 2019  which was down compared to the fourth quarter of  18 at 22 8  This reduction was primarily driven by a normal downside conversion on the organic decline in sales as well as the impact of acquisitions  which are currently operating at profitability levels before the Company    below the Company average  In the cable segment  margins were 10  which was down compared to 11 9  in the fourth quarter of 2018  primarily driven by volume and product mix  For the full year 2019  adjusted operating income was  1 645 billion  down 3  from 2018  We continue to be very proud of the Company s operating margin achievements  which reached 20  for the full year 2019  especially given the demand environment This performance is a direct result of the strength and commitment of the Company s entrepreneurial management team  which continues to foster a high performance action oriented culture and which each individual operating unit is able to appropriately adjust the market conditions and thereby maximize both growth and profitability in any market environment With the careful fostering of this culture and the deployment of our strategies to both existing and acquired companies  our management team has achieved industry leading operating margins and remains fully committed to driving enhanced performance in the future  Interest expense for the quarter was  28 million compares  Phonetic  to  26 million in the fourth quarter of last year The Company s adjusted effective tax rate was 24 5  for the fourth quarter of 2019  compared to 25 5  in the fourth quarter of 2018  The fourth quarter adjusted effective tax rate for both periods excludes the impact of the excess tax benefit associated with stock option exercises In the fourth quarter of 2018  adjusted effective tax rate also excludes the tax effect of acquisition related costs  as well as the finalization of the provisional income tax charge related to the Tax Act  The Company s GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2019 was approximately 20 3  compared to 21  in the fourth quarter of 2018 For the full year  the Company s adjusted effective tax rate was 24 5  compared to 25 5  in 2018  The adjusted effective tax rate excludes the impact of the excess tax benefit associated with stock option exercises as well as the tax effect of both acquisition related costs and refinancing related costs associated with the debt tender offer in the third quarter of 2019 Full year 2018 adjusted effective tax rate also excludes the finalization of the provisional income tax charge related to the Tax Act  The Company s GAAP effective tax rate for 2019 was 22 2  compared to 23 4  in 2018 Adjusted net income was a strong 14  of sales for both the fourth quarter and full year 2019  On a GAAP basis  diluted EPS declined by 6  in the fourth quarter to  1 03 compared to  1 09 in the fourth quarter of 2018  And adjusted diluted EPS declined  0 07 to  0 98 in the fourth quarter of 2019 from  1 05 in the fourth quarter of 2018 For the full year  GAAP diluted EPS was  3 75  a 3  decrease from 2018 GAAP diluted EPS of  3 85 and adjusted diluted EPS was  3 74 for 2019  a 1  decrease from 2018 adjusted diluted EPS of  3 77  Orders for the quarter were  2 200 million which resulted in a book to bill ratio of 1 02 1  The Company continues to be an excellent generator of cash  Cash flow from operations was  424 million in the fourth quarter and a record  1 502 billion for the full year or 140  and 131  of adjusted net income respectively Net of capital spending  our free cash flow for the fourth quarter was  352 million and therefore    and for the full year was a record  1 207 billion or 117  and 105  of adjusted net income respectively  These are excellent cash flow results and reflect the hard work of the management team around the world in carefully managing working capital amid the uncertain economic environment in 2019 From a working capital standpoint  inventory  accounts receivable and accounts payable were  1 3 billion   1 7 billion and  867 million respectively at the end of December And inventory days  days sales outstanding and payable days were 80 days  73 days and 53 days respectively  all within our normal range  The cash flow from operations of  424 million along with proceeds from the exercise of stock options of  100 million and cash  cash equivalents and short term investments on hand of approximately  95 million  net of translation were used primarily to repay  366 million in borrowings under our commercial paper programs and other facilities to fund dividend payments of  74 million  to fund net capital expenditures of  72 million  fund acquisitions of  47 million  repurchase approximately  43 million of the Company s stock and fund acquisitions of and distributions to non controlling interests of  18 million During the quarter  the Company repurchased 400 000 shares of common stock at an average price of  103 under the  2 billion stock repurchase plan  bringing total repurchases for the year to 6 5 million shares or  600 million  At December 31st  cash and short term investments were  909 million  the majority of which is held outside of the U S And at year end  the Company had issued  395 million under its U S  and Euro commercial paper programs  The Company s cash and availability under our credit facilities totaled  3 billion  Total debt at December 31st  was  3 6 billion and net debt was  2 7 billion  The adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter and full year 2019 was  522 million and  2 billion respectively In summary  this is a strong quarter and a full year for the Company financially especially in light of the continued uncertainty across the global markets  And I will now turn it over to Adam  who will provide an overview of the business and comment on current trends R  Adam Norwitt    President and Chief Executive OfficerWell  Craig  thank you very much and welcome to all of you to our first call of the new decade here in 2020 and hope it s not too late for me to wish everybody on the call a Happy New Year  As Craig mentioned  I m going to highlight some of our achievements here in the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2019 I ll then spend a few moments to discuss our trends and progress across our served markets  and then finally  I ll make some comments on our outlook for the first quarter and the full year 2020  and of course  we ll reserve some time at the end for some questions  Our results in the fourth quarter were stronger than expected as we exceeded the high end of our guidance in both sales and adjusted EPS and that s despite an ongoing environment of uncertainty in the global economy Sales were down by 3  in US dollars and 2  in local currencies  but reached  2 151 billion  On an organic basis  as Craig described  sales were down by 8  and that was largely driven by the significant reductions in the mobile devices and mobile networks markets  The Company booked  2 2 billion in orders in the quarter and that represented a strong book to bill of 1 02 1 Despite our decline in sales in the quarter  adjusted operating margins held up very strongly reaching 20   and the Company generated excellent operating cash flow of  424 million in the quarter  really another reflection of the quality of the Company s earnings  I just have to say  I remain very proud of the Amphenol team  Our results this quarter once again reflect the discipline and agility of our entrepreneurial organization as we continue to perform well  amid a very dynamic economic environment  all while driving superior operating performance in the quarter Also very pleased to announce that just in the last several days  we closed the acquisition of EXA Thermometrics  EXA is a provider of high technology temperature sensors  based in Bangalore  India with annual sales of approximately  10 million  And  while EXA is still relatively a small Company  the Company strengthens our overall sensor offering and expands our sensor manufacturing footprint to India EXA represents an excellent complement to our growing portfolio of sensor products which have become a core pillar of Amphenol s overall interconnect offering  As we welcome this outstanding new team to the Amphenol family  we remain very confident that our acquisition program will continue to create great value for Amphenol Our ability to identify and execute upon acquisitions and successfully bring these new companies into our family  remains a core competitive advantage for the Company  Now  let me just make a couple of comments about the full year 2019  and despite the many challenges in the global economy in 2019  it was a successful year for Amphenol Amid significant organic declines in the mobile devices market as well as moderations in demand in several other markets that we discussed earlier last year  we are very pleased to have just surpassed our 2018 sales levels  Our full year operating    full year adjusted operating margins once again reached 20  and this strong level of profitability enabled us to achieve adjusted diluted earnings per share of  3 74 And very importantly  we generated record operating and free cash flow of  1 5 billion and  1 2 billion respectively  both of which are excellent confirmations of the Company s superior execution together with our disciplined working capital management  Our acquisition program created great value for the Company in 2019 with nine new companies added to the Amphenol family in the year  These acquisitions  which included SSI  Aorora  Kopec  Phonetic   Charles Industries  CONEC  Bernd Richter  GJM  Cablescan and finally XGiga expanded our position across a broad array of technologies and markets We re excited that these acquisitions represent expanded platforms for the Company s future performance  in particular  because of the outstanding and talented individuals that have joined the Amphenol organization  These new Amphenolians as we call them  deepen our already strong bench of leaders around the world In addition  in 2019  we deployed further our capital by buying back over 6 5 million shares under our share buyback program  while also increasing our quarterly dividend by 9   Amphenol s long term mission is to be the enabler of the electronics revolution  Through the organic development efforts of Amphenol s entrepreneurial organization  together with the benefits of our acquisition program  we have expanded our relationships with a broadening array of customers across all of our diversified end markets This has resulted in the Company strengthening our position across the many segments of the electronics industry  And while the overall market environment in 2019 was highly uncertain  our agile entrepreneurial management team is very confident that we have built further strength from which we can drive superior performance into the long term Now turning to our trends and progress across our served markets  I would just note that we continue to be very pleased that the Company s balanced and broad end market diversification remains a real high value asset for the Company  No single end market in the year represented more than 20  of our sales  and we believe this diversification mitigates the impact of the volatility of individual end markets  while also exposing us to all of the leading technologies wherever they may arise across the electronics industry Now turning first to the military market  the military market represented 13  of our sales in the fourth quarter and 12  of our sales for the full year 2019  Sales again grew very strongly from prior year  increasing by a greater than expected 30  in the fourth quarter  driven by growth across essentially all segments in the military market  including in particular  military vehicles  rotorcraft and airframe applications On a sequential basis  sales increased by 7   which is a very strong performance given the normal fourth quarter seasonality that we ve typically seen  For the full year 2019  we re very pleased that our military sales grew by an outstanding 23  in US dollars and 22  organically  reflecting broad based strength across virtually all segments of the market Our organization working in the military market has worked so hard for many years to strengthen our broad technology position while increasing our capacity to serve customers across all of the segments of this important market  And I can just tell you that our superior performance in 2019 is a great reflection of the results of their efforts Given the ongoing favorable military spending environment  our team continues to solidify our leadership position by ensuring that we execute on this increased demand by supporting the many next generation technologies that are required for modern military hardware  Looking ahead  we expect sales in the first quarter to decrease slightly from these fourth quarter levels  And for the full year 2020  we expect to achieve mid to high single digit sales growth on top of our already strong sales levels from 2019 Turning to the commercial air market  that market represented 5  of our sales  both in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2019  And sales in the fourth quarter increased by a stronger than anticipated 15  as overall demand from commercial aircraft manufacturers continued to be robust Sequentially  our sales increased by 8  from the third quarter  also a very strong performance  For the full year 2019  we re pleased that our sales grew by 14  as we benefited from broad design ins of our next generation interconnect products on new aircraft  Looking into 2020  we do expect a sequential moderation in sales from these levels in the first quarter  For the full year  we expect sales to remain at roughly 2019 s levels as increased sales on to new jet platforms is offset by some impact from one program s widely reported production delays Regardless of this more muted outlook for 2020  we remain encouraged by the Company s strong technology position across a wide array of aircraft platforms and next generation systems that are integrated into those airplanes  And we look forward to benefiting from that position for many years to come The industrial market represented 19  of our sales in the fourth quarter and 20  of our sales for the full year 2019  Sales in industrial in the fourth quarter grew by a bit stronger than expected 7  from prior year  driven largely by the contributions from our acquisitions completed over the past year On an organic basis  sales actually declined by 3   as growth in instrumentation  alternative energy  and medical was more than offset by moderations in other segments of the industrial market On a sequential basis sales  sales reduced by 2  from the third quarter  reflecting continued moderation in the overall industrial market in particular  in Europe  For the full year 2019  sales in the industrial market grew by 4  in US dollars and were down by 3  organically as growth in medical  factory automation  rail mass transit  and oil and gas were offset by moderations in other segments of the industrial market We remain very pleased with the Company s broad position in the worldwide industrial market  And while the overall environment in 2019 became increasingly uncertain as the year progressed  we added several outstanding acquisitions which strengthened our overall position  Through both our acquisition program as well as our organic innovations  we ve developed a very broad array of products across a diversified range of exciting segments within the global industrial markets We re proud of the success and look forward to realizing the benefits from our efforts in the industrial market for many years to come  Looking into the first quarter 2020  we anticipate a slight decrease in sales from these levels as demand continues to be uncertain  particularly in Europe And for the full year 2020  we expect to realize low single digit sales growth as we continue to benefit from our acquisitions as well as our organic growth efforts  The automotive market represented 18  of our sales in the quarter and 19  of our sales for the full year  Sales were stronger than we had expected  coming into the quarter with revenues growing by 8  in US dollars and 10  in local currency  driven by the contributions from our acquisitions completed earlier in the year On an organic basis  sales were flat from prior year as slowing vehicle volumes offset increased sales of products sold into new vehicle electronics applications  Sequentially  our automotive sales increased by 3  in the fourth quarter as we benefited from several new program launches  For the full year 2019  our sales in the automotive market grew by 3  in US dollars and 6  in local currency  but were down by 2  organically  reflecting the benefits of our acquisitions as well as our broad array of new products into next generation applications  offset by the overall slowing of the worldwide automotive market We continue to benefit from our long term and consistent strategy of expanding our range of interconnect sensor and antenna products  both organically and through acquisitions  to enable a wide array of onboard electronics across a diversified range of vehicles made by auto manufacturers around the world Looking into the first quarter 2020  we expect sales to moderate slightly from these levels and for the full year 2020  we expect a low single digit sales increase for the automotive market  And while the overall market remains uncertain  we are confident that our broadened range of high technology solutions positions us for continued growth in automotive into the future The mobile devices market represented 15  of our sales in the quarter and 13  of our sales for the full year 2019  Sales in the mobile devices market exceeded our expectations coming into the fourth quarter  growing 9  sequentially from the third quarter as our team executed extremely well to satisfy increased demand from customers making both smartphones and tablets  Compared to prior year  sales were down by 35   but which was better than we had expected  especially in light of the very strong fourth quarter  we have had in the fourth quarter of 2018 For the full year 2019  sales in the mobile devices market decreased by 20   and as we discussed extensively at the time of our first quarter earnings release  our reduction in sales for both the fourth quarter and the full year were driven really by changes in available content due to architectural shifts in product designs of certain smartphone models  We re pleased that the team outperformed our previously revised expectations of an approximately 30  reduction for the full year  a great testament to our mobile device team s continued agility in the face of an always volatile market Looking into the first quarter 2020  we anticipate a relatively normal seasonal sequential decline of approximately 25   And for the full year 2020  we expect sales in the mobile device market to be flat with 2019 levels  Although 2019 was a difficult year for this market after our record performance in 2018  I can just tell you that we come into 2020 in a great position to capitalize on any future opportunities for growth that may emerge Our leading array of antennas  Interconnect  and mechanisms  continues to enable a broad range of next generation mobile devices  And while this market will no doubt remain one of the most volatile  our outstanding team working in mobile devices looks forward to continuing to drive value for our customers and for Amphenol into the future The mobile networks market represented 6  of our sales in the quarter and 8  of our sales for the full year 2019  Sales in this market decreased from prior year by a bit more than expected 20  in US dollars and 31  organically  as we were impacted by reduced demand from both OEMs and operators As we discussed extensively back in July  the US government restrictions on sales to certain Chinese entities ultimately resulted in many operator and OEM customers reassessing both their build out plans and inventory levels  leading to lower demand for our products For the full year 2019  our sales were down slightly from prior year  but were down organically by 9  as the benefits of our acquisitions completed earlier in the year were offset by the dynamics I just mentioned  Looking ahead  while we expect sales in the first quarter to increase modestly from these levels  we do expect sales for the full year to be down in the low single digits  as the full year impact from the US government restrictions as well as the associated effects are partially offset by increased demand from operators who are beginning their next generation network build outs Regardless of the challenges that arose in the mobile networks market in 2019  we re confident in the Company s long term position in this important and exciting industry  Our team continues to work aggressively to expand our opportunity with next generation equipment and networks  And as customers plan for their advanced systems  we look forward to benefiting from the increased potential that comes from our unique position with both equipment manufacturers and mobile service providers around the world This creates a significant long term expansion potential for the Company  The information technology and data communications market represented 20  of our sales in the fourth quarter and 19  of our sales for the full year 2019  Sales in the quarter were stronger than expected  rising by 3  in US dollars  but down by 3  organically from prior year  as the contributions from the Charles Industries and XGiga acquisitions together with stronger sales of server related products were offset by lower sales of products incorporated into networking and storage systems Sequentially  our sales in IT datacom grew by a stronger than expected 10  from the third quarter as our team capitalized on stronger demand in servers and storage and to a lesser extent networking products  For the full year 2019  our sales in the IT Datacom market were flat from prior year    prior year in US dollars  and down by 3  organically  A really strong performance by our team  given the impact of the US government restrictions and the associated knock on effects we discussed earlier These results were a direct result of our team s continued efforts at developing industry leading products across a wide array of technologies  including in particular high speed and power products  In addition  our team continues to adapt quickly to the changing market environment including by capitalizing on the expanding importance of web service providers  a group of customers that grew strongly in 2019 Looking ahead  we expect sales in the first quarter to moderate from these levels and for the full year 2020  we anticipate sales to remain flat to 2019 levels as the full year effect from the US government restrictions are offset by continued growth of next generation products sold into a wide array of customers  including those web service providers  We remain very encouraged by the Company s strong technology position in the global IT Datacom market Our customers around the world continue to drive their equipment to ever higher levels of performance in order to manage the dramatic increases in demand for bandwidth and processor power  In turn  our team remains singularly focused on enabling this continuing revolution in IT Datacom through their ongoing development of a wide range of next generation technologies Finally  the broadband market represented 4  of our sales  both in the fourth quarter and the full year  As we had expected  sales decreased by 6  from prior year as spending levels from broadband operators continued to moderate  On a sequential basis  sales decreased by 6   also from the third quarter  There s no question that 2019 was a challenging year in this market as our sales declined by 7  from prior year on reduced levels of operator capital spending Looking ahead  while we expect sales to moderate slightly from these levels in the first quarter  for the full year  we expect our sales in the broadband market to increase in the low double digits as operators begin to ramp up their network upgrades  Despite the challenging conditions in the broadband market last year  we remain encouraged by the Company s continually expanding range of products together with our strong positions with customers around the world We continue to position ourselves as the most flexible supplier  thereby ensuring that the Company can benefit as operators begin to increase network investments  So just in summary  while 2019 was a challenging year in many respects  I come out of the year extremely proud of our team s performance  Amidst the very uncertain market environment and in the face of many unexpected dynamics that develop during the year  the Amphenol organization has clearly continued to execute extraordinarily well Through our dual pronged approach of growing both organically and through our acquisition program  the Company continues to expand our market position while strengthening our financial performance  Amphenol s superior performance is a direct reflection of our distinct competitive advantages Our leading technology  our increasing position with customers in diverse markets  our world wide presence  a lean and flexible cost structure  highly effective acquisition program and most importantly  our agile entrepreneurial management team Now turning to our outlook  and given the continued heightened level of market uncertainty and based of course on constant exchange rates  we now expect for the first quarter and full year 2020 the following  For the first quarter  we expect sales in the range of  1 960 billion to  2 billion and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of  0 85 to  0 87  This represents a sales increase versus prior year of 0  to 2  in US dollars and 1  to 3  in local currency  and a decrease versus prior year adjusted diluted EPS of 2  to 4  For the full year 2020  we expect sales in the range of  8 240 billion to  8 400 billion and adjusted diluted EPS in the range of  3 76 to  3 84  For the full year  this guidance represents both sales growth    represents sales growth of flat to up 2  and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 1  to 3   We re encouraged by the Company s performance in 2019  and all of us at Amphenol look forward to driving renewed strength going forward into 2020  even amid the many dynamics around the world I remain very confident in the ability of our outstanding management team to build upon our results in 2019 and to continue to capitalize on the many future opportunities to grow our market position and expand our profitability  And with that operator  we d be very happy to take any questions Questions and Answers OperatorThe questions and answer period will now begin   Operator Instructions   And the first question is from Amit Daryanani from Evercore  Your line is now open Amit Daryanani    Evercore ISI    AnalystYup  Thanks a lot  Good afternoon  guys  I have a question and a follow up  I guess to start with  you know  when I look at the calendar  20 EPS guide  I think the implication there is that incremental operating margins are around 5   I want to make sure  a  I m getting that math right  but if so  what is the delta versus the historical target that you guys have talked about in the 25  range Craig A  Lampo    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes  Thanks  Amit  I actually don t think your math is right  If you look at the implied guidance  which is the    kind of 1  to 3  on the EPS for the full year growth  and 0  to 2  on the revenue growth  what that would really imply is a little bit under our normal kind of conversion margin going into 2020  and I guess I would kind of stress that    we really think that s an impressive profitability conversion considering that we still do have some drag related to the acquisitions that we have done  and even though we have made some progress there  we do still have some work to do in regards to some of the acquisitions  As you know there    they are done throughout the year  so we re not    there is some time to get those up to the average level of profitability  And you know  but if you take those out  actually we re converting well above our normal range and I would also just reflect the actions that we ve taken that aren t reflected at the cost of which are reflected in 2020 as well as other actions that the Company has really done a great job of to ensure the bottom line profitability  and really these low rates of organic growth that we re guiding to in 2020 So really happy with the conversion and ultimate profitability implied in our guide Amit Daryanani    Evercore ISI    AnalystPerfect  Thank you for that  And I guess Adam on mobile devices  when we think about the flat guide for calendar  20 sales and I realize it s early in the year for you guys  just help me understand the delta between the guide here versus what you guys did last year  guided for last year  Does that essentially reflect that you don t see any negative change to your allocation opportunity in calendar  20  Is that really the message there  Or is there a bigger message in terms which  Phonetic  is in the content will be as up    be as well in calendar  20 R  Adam Norwitt    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Well  thank you  Amit  and I think every year we get into that discussion about our guidance for mobile devices with good reason  It s a very difficult market to guide to  And you ll remember our    my track record over a number of years is not the greatest at being accurate  All that being said  we came into last year with an outlook of being down in the mid to high or high teens  and in fact we ended up  even though we adjusted the guidance down early in the year  but our team ended up really doing a great job in the second half and ended up for the year  down in mobile devices by 20  and in fact 19  in local currency So we were kind of spot on last year  which was the first in a many year period  I think our flat guidance is based on what we see today  I think our team has done an excellent job of positioning ourselves well  making sure that we are present on lots of different new platforms  that we re getting at least our fair share  if not more than our fair share of a variety of allocations and that we re working on lots and lots of different mobile devices And I think that last point is a very important one  People talk a lot about mobile devices in terms of just a phone or a smartphone or something like that  but there is an extraordinary array of devices more and more  which becomes smart devices and ultimately one calls them a mobile device I mean  I was just    as you know out in Las Vegas  1 5  Phonetic  weeks ago at the Consumer Electronics Show and seeing that essentially everything has become smart  You cannot find a category of a thing that one uses in one s life and not find at the Consumer Electronics Show  a smart version thereof  And these smart devices ranging from frying pans to drink mixers  to things you put on your wrist to exercising devices and of course  to smartphones and tablets  laptops  wearables  headphones  all of those things  These continue to create new and wonderful opportunities for our Company to find ways to grow as our products can help our customers make their products better And that remains  and I ll just remind everybody our philosophy in mobile devices  our philosophy remains that we will participate in those products  where we can help our customers add value and just the constant growth of the types of products that are out there  I think creates a good opportunity for us All that being said  it s a very volatile market  it s a very  very hard to predict market and as we sit here today  just in the third week of January of 2020  flat is what we see and you can bet our team will do everything they can to capitalize on any incremental opportunities that may arise OperatorThank you  Our next question is from Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs  Your line is now open Mark Delaney    Goldman Sachs    AnalystYeah  Good afternoon  thanks for taking the question  and I had a question and a follow up as well  I guess first on the macroeconomic environment  Adam you talked about how some of the events that transpired in 2019 around export bans and tariffs caused some challenges in revenue in certain markets  And certainly I understand some of those factors remain in place today  But with the Phase 1 trade agreement being put in place between the US and China  are you seeing that translate into improved order rates in any areas R  Adam Norwitt    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I mean  look  we re very happy if the world s two largest economies can work their way toward a more peaceful coexistence economically  And so I think from that perspective  we applaud that there is this Phase 1 deal in a very macro standpoint All that being said  if you look at really what the Phase 1 deal really means  it does not roll back for example  the vast majority of tariffs and you ll remember well Mark  List 1  List 2  List 3  I mean  those tariffs are all still in place and those are tariffs that our team has done a fabulous job of managing through in 2019  and before and will continue to manage through them going into this year The restrictions that are really part of a national security discussion as opposed to part of a trade discussion  none of those restrictions have really gone away  So I wouldn t say that there are tangible benefits of the Phase 1  but I think there is a huge intangible long term which I very much applaud which is that its progress and hopefully that will lead to more progress  which will lead to really resolving some of the more insidious parts of the trade war that have gone on so far Mark Delaney    Goldman Sachs    AnalystGot it  That s helpful  My follow up question was around the margin integration  a topic that was previously discussed and maybe you can help us understand or remind us how long it typically takes to integrate acquisitions in past situations and then along those lines  I remember in 2019  there were some higher than normal integration spending that was done and Amphenol s credit does not strip that out of non GAAP earnings  but are there any higher than normal integration expenses that are planned in 2020 SG A that s may be a part of that margin conversion rate that was mentioned  Thanks R  Adam Norwitt    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  sure  Actually I ll start off with the just  kind of second part of your question first  I guess I wouldn t  these weren t    these costs that we talked about in the third quarter  really had nothing to do with integration spending related to acquisitions  It really is related to the fact that based on the current demand levels and that we saw coming into the third and fourth quarter that we    our general managers around the world  those that really saw a reduction  these are the things that we ve talked about  really had adjusted their    adjusted their cost levels and there is in some cases this means head count related activities  and then there is cost to that  And that s really what we saw in the third quarter  that isn t recurring neither in the fourth quarter  really of any significance nor in the    in our expectation from a guide perspective in 2020 I mean  I say that with a caveat that that s based on the current demand environment  If there was some sort of an additional dropdown or step down in the current demand environment  of course  we would take quick action and there could be some costs related to that  But certainly that s not our expectation and not included in our guidance In terms of the margins  in regards to acquisitions and how long it takes us to get those margins up to the Company average  I guess I would say that it really is very dependent on the specific acquisitions  Over the course of history  we ve had ones as short as you know  months and three to six months or so as it relates to companies like FCI and others that we ve had  And then we ve had that take    some of them have taken years  and it really just depends  So I wouldn t necessarily say they  Phonetic  would nail down and say it s within one  that there was a median for that or anything of that nature So  but we are    I think we have a pretty good track record in regarding to doing that  The management team is very committed to getting the margins up over some period of time and do    we do have an expectation  With that being said  there will be a bit of a drag on our margin in 2020  albeit not as significant as there was in 2019  and if you look at our 2020 sequential margins kind of going throughout the year  and you know in terms of implied guidance where we start in the first quarter  in terms of where we end up for 2020  you would see that there is expectation of some improvement which is partly from acquisitions and partly from just the underlying actions that we take from an organic perspective OperatorThe next question is from Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America  Your line is now open Wamsi Mohan    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystHi  Yes  thank you  Adam  I appreciate your comments around mobile devices  but just normal seasonality would imply mobile devices would be up quite significantly on a year on year basis  So should we conclude that there is just not enough visibility at this point to make that statement about how those trends are going to be at the back half of the year  or do you actually expect seasonality to be sort of sub seasonal this year  And I have a follow up R  Adam Norwitt    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I mean  I don t know that the normal seasonality  I mean  normal is what in the mobile devices  there    we    I think our guidance would imply that there is still a strong second half pick up in our sales in the mobile devices in 2020  if it is strong as it was this year  no  but I think that if you look this year from Q4 to Q1  we were down by more than 50   And so  every year in mobile devices has a little bit of a different cadence across the quarters depending on how things go We had that extraordinary quarter in the fourth quarter of 2018  We then had a very significant more than half reduction sequentially into Q1 of 2019  This quarter we anticipate a relatively modest sequential reduction in the first quarter  let s call it a more normal sequential reduction in the kind of mid  20s And so I wouldn t say that there is any sort of big categorical difference in terms of how that cadence goes across the year Wamsi Mohan    Bank of America Merrill Lynch    AnalystOkay  Thanks  Adam  And then we ve seen some semiconductor companies talk about a near term bottom in demand in place and wondering if you view any lead time movement indicating anything similar for you or how you would categorize that the broader demand environment as you re entering this year  Thank you R  Adam Norwitt    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I mean  I m not maybe as good at finding where are bottoms and where are tops  And part of that may be because distribution is a relatively small proportion of our sales  and I think there are plenty of companies who have relatively high distribution content  who maybe see that a little bit more clearly on sell throughs and inventory levels and all that s associated with distribution I think the overall demand environment remains very uncertain  I m pleased with how our team did in the fourth quarter  I m especially pleased that we had a positive book to bill in the fourth quarter which gives me  you know  some sense of confidence At the same time  there are a few of our markets where the first half of last year has a very difficult comparison to the first half of this year  and for one  I would point out mobile networks where clearly we will see in the first half of this year because of all the dynamics that we already have discussed a few times  we ll see that market being down relatively significantly in the first half and that has some impact on the overall outlook for the year But are we at a bottom  I think it really depends by market and I think it s not always easy for us sitting where we sit to pick  are we  or are we not at the bottom OperatorThe next question is from Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley  Your line is now open Craig Hettenbach    Morgan Stanley    AnalystYes  Thank you  First question  Adam  just on the automotive market  if you can just touch on kind of from a production perspective  how you are seeing things at the start of this year  And then you mentioned a couple of new programs  so any highlights you d call out from a content perspective that are important for this year R  Adam Norwitt    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I think the auto market clearly as we    as we went through the course of last year  and we talked about this a lot in the middle of the year  We did not see a recovery in the auto market that we had anticipated would have come in the second half and that ultimately kept our performance more muted than we    than we would have liked Now  all that being said  I think that we were in the fourth quarter  as I mentioned flat on an organic basis  for the full year  just down very  very by a very small amount organically and that s in a worldwide automotive market where    you probably know the numbers better than I do  but I think it s like 6   7  volumes down I think there is lots of different forecasts for what the automotive market will be in 2020  But none of them seem to be so rosy in terms of the outlook  I think our team    we don t go about forecasting our business by saying  you know  what is production and what is content  But I think very clearly  with our outlook to grow in the low single digits in 2020  I think that continues to represent gains in content by the Company and as it relates to new programs  I mean we are always working on lots of new programs that in particular are dealing with new electronic systems in the car  things like electric drivetrains  things like new emission system  things like new passenger comfort and infotainment systems And when we looked at our performance in the fourth quarter that was not clearly driven on a sequential basis where we grew 3  on a quarter to quarter basis  That was not driven by auto volumes  That was really driven by some of these new programs that we ve been working hard on for a number of years starting to ramp up  And we would expect to see some of that to continue into 2020 Craig Hettenbach    Morgan Stanley    AnalystGot it  Thank you  And then just a follow up on mobile networks  You talked about just some of the uncertainty  kind of a ripple through effect of the Huawei restrictions  Any signals you re getting from operators in terms of just how they re feeling about the pacing through this year R  Adam Norwitt    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I mean operators don t give you the longest term forecasts  And that s one of the things about being in the service provider market and we know how to work in service provider markets  We ve gotten very good at it over the years and forecasting in a service provider market is not so easy  And I think the operators are    some of them are still of the mind to say  let s wait and see how this whole thing shakes out  vis a vis which vendors  can we use and not use  in particular  in places outside of the US I think in the US  the problem does    isn t related necessarily to that  because that s pretty well  that s pretty well defined  But it s more in the US you continue to have uncertainties around corporate combinations and the sort of  is the equipment ready and is the economics around 5G there to support significant investment increases  And I think those    those are still yet to be seen  But look  we expect in 2020 to see some next generation network build out  not enough to offset the comparisons that I talked about in one of the prior questions  But certainly  we do expect to see that with some of our operator customers around the world  And to the extent that they decide to accelerate those or that the economics become more clearer or the supply base becomes more clearer  we will be right there to support them whenever they need us OperatorThe next question is from Samik Chatterjee from J P  Morgan  Your line is now open Samik Chatterjee    J P  Morgan    AnalystHi  Thanks for taking my question  Happy New Year to you guys as well  If I can just kind of clarify  I think you said industrial segment you expect growth in 2020  Is that an expectation on the organic sales as well  And if so  kind of  which are the geographies you re seeing improving trends  and what s your latest assessment of the inventory situation there R  Adam Norwitt    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  So  I think the answer is yes  We expect some modest amount of organic growth in the year in industrial  I think across which segments  it s a little hard to say that in advance  no doubt about it  I mean  we had good momentum in industrial  finishing the year in instrumentation  alternative energy  and medical  I mean those all seem to have continued outlooks of favorability But it s very hard to forecast which of the many segments of the industrial market are going to ultimately drive the results  Relative to distribution and the sort of stock positions and all of that  I think we did see over the course of the year  in 2019  relatively significant reductions in industrial distribution between the first half and the second half I don t say that we have a big recovery for that embedded into our numbers  I think a lot of distributors are waiting and seeing to see ultimately when is the end demand going to come back in those markets which they serve  All that being said  what we feel very good about in the industrial market beyond just our core position  we ve made some outstanding acquisitions over the course of the last year  which have really built our product offering and our penetration into those various segments of the industrial market in a real significant way And so  our team is working very hard around the world to leverage those new product offerings to make sure that we can continue to become ever more important to our customers and to the extent those customers ultimately have more demand to fulfill  I think that will be a real top choice for them to work with in 2020 and beyond Samik Chatterjee    J P  Morgan    AnalystOkay  And if I can just follow up on the cash flow  Craig  how are you thinking about kind of operating cash flow for 2020  given that you had a sizable improvement here going from 2018 to 2019  Are there more kind of working capital benefits that we should expect in a flat operating profit environment in 2020 Craig A  Lampo    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSure  Thanks  No  I mean  the Company certainly has historically been and continues to have a very strong cash flow generation  And I think in years where the organic growth is a little bit lower such as 2019  we would expect to generate stronger than average cash flow versus those years that we grow really strongly organically such as 2018 where the cash flow is a little bit lower than the average I guess what I would say about the expectation in 2020 is  I wouldn t expect any significant change from kind of the average cash flow conversion that we typically have  So I would expect that same kind of rough    you know  within the range of 100  of net income  free cash flow conversion in the 90s  in mid 90s may be in that range and over 100  coming from an operating cash flow perspective  which basically is what we would expect over the longer term from a cash flow generation perspective  but I would tell you that we re extremely happy about the cash flow generation and in 2019  we certainly deploy that given all the acquisitions that we had and certainly the share repurchases  So I think it s really    really a strategic advantage to the Company  generating this level of cash and I think the 2019 cash flow that we generated was just an example of that and we re really proud of that OperatorThe next question is from Shawn Harrison from Longbow  Your line is now open Shawn M  Harrison    Longbow Research    AnalystAfternoon  everybody  Double digit growth in the broadband business is something I guess I haven t heard for a while  so maybe  Adam  if you could delve into why the operators are finally looking to spend here in 2020 R  Adam Norwitt    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Shawn  sorry  either I misspoke or you misheard  because I said    I think I said low single digit growth in broadband  So I apologize for that if it was my misstatement Shawn M  Harrison    Longbow Research    AnalystOkay  So  low single digit growth  never mind on that R  Adam Norwitt    President and Chief Executive OfficerWhich is still good given the last few years Shawn M  Harrison    Longbow Research    AnalystCorrect  correct  Considering the history  Okay  Then moving on  then to the IT Datacom business  it s flattish organic growth  If you exclude the entity ban impact  where would you expect to see organic growth in that business in 2020 R  Adam Norwitt    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I mean  that s a little bit hard to say  I think we feel very good about our position in the IT Datacom market  Clearly  the first half has a more magnified impact because of the various effects and it s not just the ban itself  but also the knock on effects that we discussed I think pretty extensively back in    back in our second quarter discussion So what would it be organically  I don t know  low single digits  something like that  If I sit where I sit today  which is the very beginning of the year  thinking about a market that is not always the easiest to forecast  maybe something like that around those levels  But no doubt about it  there are parts of that market  where we continue to make great progress irregardless of what s happening in the overall environment And I mentioned our progress that we ve made in web service providers  which had really great growth last year  double digit growth organically in an environment where those customers that part of the IT datacom world is really striving for a real step function increase in bandwidth and processor capability in order to support just all what is being supported  a lot of which is  as you know very well  getting people to watch videos on their phones and tablets and over the top on their TVs at home And that extraordinary increase in video traffic continues to drive just a lot of demand for the next generation higher speed products  So what will that ultimately be  it s hard to say at this stage  I think the guidance that we ve given to be flat for the year is a very good guidance given all the dynamics and obviously our team is going to work very hard to outperform that if they can OperatorThe next question is from Matt Sheerin from Stifel  Your line is now open Matthew Sheerin    Stifel Nicolaus    AnalystYes  Thank you  and hello  Adam and Craig  A question Adam regarding your sensor business  You seem pretty excited about that small acquisition in India  You ve made several acquisitions over the years  and I know there is a mix between both industrial and auto  Could you update us on where you stand there in terms of revenue run rate  the end market mix and also how much are you seeing in terms of traction with doing complete sub systems for customers that include both the sensor and the interconnect technologies R  Adam Norwitt    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Well  thanks very much  Matt  Look  we are very excited about our sensor business  And  yes  it s a very small acquisition  and maybe I sound a little more excited than the scale of it  and I think the reason for that is a few fold  Number one  it is our first acquisition that we ve made in India  of a private company  and it gives us a new base of low cost manufacturing at a time when diversification of low cost seems to be not a bad idea in many respects And I think this    EXA will really be a fabulous space for us to support the world which they do already  And in addition  it gives us really a direct underground access to the Indian market for sensors  which we have not had before  So that s something that s very new and we would really anticipate in the future that  that team will become a beachhead for us in a very  very important market  in particular in the industrial market  but also in automotive  mil aero and otherwise In terms of where do we stand in our scale and sensors  we re a lot bigger than we were before  We don t talk publicly about exactly what the size of our sensors is  but you can piece that together relatively well by looking at the disclosed sizes of all of our acquisitions and knowing that we ve grown our sensor business organically at a relatively robust pace during that time period What do we look forward to in terms of that sort of a value add offering  I can tell you that now that we are six year in to having owned our first sensor Company  which was the GE Advanced sensor acquisition  we see a lot of opportunities with customers to give them a total solution of interconnect and sensor products which ultimately allows them to simplify their approach to their vendor base to have one Company on whom they can rely for that total system and especially a Company that has that harsh environment capabilities that we have had for so many decades  in fact the whole history of Amphenol  And I think that  that proposition  which was originally more of a hypothesis  when we    when we acquired the advanced sensor business  six years ago is clearly a platform for us for long term growth in the sensor and the interconnect market  And we look forward to taking advantage of that for many years to come Matthew Sheerin    Stifel Nicolaus    AnalystOkay  very good  And that s it from me  Thanks a lot R  Adam Norwitt    President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Matt OperatorThe next question is from Will Stein from SunTrust  Your line is now open William Stein    SunTrust Robinson    AnalystGreat  Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the strong Q4 results  including the inventory performance  That said  Adam  I m wondering if you can comment on inventory conditions in the channel  I know you re not a huge user of the channel  but any view into that category s inventory levels  And similarly at your direct customers  any visibility that you could comment on R  Adam Norwitt    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I think the inventory conditions in the channel  again  it s a relatively small proportion of our sales  just 15  of our sales through distribution and we get some visibility across that 15   I d say that the inventory positions are healthy  I would say that they are relative to the end demand of the market So we have a    some proportion of our distribution  which is in the military market where there is very robust demand and where we ve done a great job of satisfying that demand  And so maybe inventories have come a little bit up in that area  And conversely  we ve seen them come a little bit down in areas like the industrial market But I wouldn t point to any significant kind of disruptions that we would see there in the inventory  Relative to our direct customers  there is no question  and we talked about this in the middle of the year that our customers following in particular  after the events of the second quarter between the US and China  a number of our customers looked at their overall inventory position and decided that maybe they had a little too much And I d say that those positions as best as we can tell  because we don t have any visibility  that s a real visibility  But at least the anecdotal evidence is that those positions are working down into a little bit more of a healthy environment William Stein    SunTrust Robinson    AnalystThat s helpful  If I could have one more  I want to revisit the mobile device end market  again  I know this is very difficult to forecast  So you ve provided us with the view that it s flat year over year  but there are some pretty big architectural changes coming this year or at least those are anticipated relative to 5G certainly maybe Wi Fi 6  we ll see more of that as well And these sorts of architectural changes drive potential  the first step function  different content from various companies including Amphenol  I m wondering when we should expect to hear about any sort of update or when does Amphenol have some better visibility into what the content situation looks like  Is that a during Q1 sort of event  during Q2  any clarity on that would help  Thank you R  Adam Norwitt    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I mean look  we always struggle with this here in the first quarter  well  as you know  coming up with a guidance and knowing when we have clarity  I think we usually have decent clarity  at least in our design in positions  sometime into the second quarter  But look  I think the guidance that we ve given is based on a very  very rigorous look at all of our design in positions and the outlooks from the customers obviously taking some with grains of salt In terms of the next generation architectures  I mean the good news about these architectural changes  whether that be 5G  whether that be Wi Fi 6 or something else  the good news about them is they tend to stack on each other as opposed to replace something else  Because if you take 5G as an example  you will not buy a phone if it only works for 5G  You will not buy a tablet if it only works for 5G because the 5G networks are going to be relatively minimalistic up until    for a number of years to come And thus  it has to be an additional functionality in that device  which has then backward compatibility to 4G network  LTE to 3G and you know what  sometimes you re driving through a part of the country and some of those parts of the country seem to even be in Connecticut where you don t even have 3G  you have 2G or EDGE or whatever they have to call it and the phone got to work  You ve got to be able to call 911  you got to be able to make at least a phone call  even if you cannot watch your Netflix movie at the same time And because of that  these devices become more complex  They may add some type of architecture of a 5G whether it s antenna or the whole signal path associated with it  But ultimately  it increases the complexity  which creates opportunities for us  all things being equal  Now I say all things being equal  because every new device has a different cut of how they re going to architected  a different approach and that s why you have to be so flexible and dynamic and innovative as a supplier into that market But I think those are things that our team has really nailed down for many  many years  And so  what that 5G will bring  I think at a minimum  it doesn t make things worse  And can it create opportunities  I think certainly it can  And the same goes with something like a Wi Fi 6 which may be will slowly take over for the higher speeds that it entails and that can create new opportunities for us over the long term OperatorThe next question is from Deepa Raghavan from Wells Fargo Securities  Your line is now open Deepa Raghavan    Wells Fargo Securities   LLC     AnalystHey  good afternoon  Adam and Craig  Adam  question for you  first  Do you    overall  do you feel fundamentally better about the macro environment than you did three or six months ago  And does the guidance contemplate some of the cycle recovery prospects in automotive  industrial or semis  I mean you touched on this earlier  but my question is  does the guidance    does the guide contemplate any sort of recovery expectations  similar to what you might have seen in the prior historical cycle recoveries R  Adam Norwitt    President and Chief Executive OfficerWell  to your first question  do I feel better than three to six months ago  yeah  I mean  six months ago was not the most fun having dealt with everything that we faced in Q2 and relatively sudden impact of the restrictions and the various aspects of the trade war and other knock on effects So yes  I guess I feel fundamentally better than I did at that time  Does our guide contemplate a recovery  I think arithmetically  you can apply some sort of normal seasonalities and see that  yes  I mean our second half is assumed to have some growth compared to the first half Now  that s not so odd for us  We do typically have a second half that s stronger than the first half  We had that in this last year  even without the impact of the acquisition  there was a growth in the second half  But I think that for sure  we have some expectation  Is that a recovery with a capital R or is that a normalization  or is that us also expanding our position on a variety of new programs  I would call it a good combination of all of the above Deepa Raghavan    Wells Fargo Securities   LLC     AnalystGot it  My follow up is with Craig  Craig  does the full year EPS guidance contemplate share buybacks  You ve always talked about a third of free cash flows being deployed toward share buybacks where possible  In the recent past  you ve done 50  or more  the last few years  But you ve got this M A going on  which I understand  but what s embedded in the full year 2020 guide  Thank you Craig A  Lampo    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSure  thanks Deepa  Yeah  so the 2020 guide does    you know  reflect some small level of repurchases that we would expect to do under normal course  I guess I would also say that also what it reflects is that our share price is where it is and not to get into the dynamics of how weighted average shares are calculated  but there is an impact when the share price is higher  that actually increases your weighted average shares  So that does have some offsetting impact to the share repurchases So I guess in terms of how we think about that is that  there is some impact of both of those reflected in our guidance OperatorThe next question is from Joseph Spak from RBC Capital Markets  Your line is now open Joseph Spak    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystThanks for fitting me in here  I just wanted to quickly go back to the guidance  If we look at both the first quarter and the full year revenue guidance at the midpoint  it s about 1   yet  the guidance would imply the margins are a little bit softer in the first quarter than maybe the rest of the year  I know that could be some seasonality or maybe mix related  but is there anything specific we should be thinking about or what gets that higher in the    later in the year R  Adam Norwitt    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  you know  I think the margin in the first quarter I think reflect the fact that we re sequentially    organically reducing by the 7  ish on the high end  the 7  ish sequential quarter  And that does bring with it a little bit higher than normal conversion  On the downside  we talked about that in 2019 where we maybe close to 30  decline and we re kind of in the 25  to 30  sequential decline from a conversion perspective into the first quarter  which just normally brings with it a little bit lower margins I think if you then look at the full year  kind of implied guidance as I mentioned earlier  we do expect some increases there on from that  maybe even a little bit higher than typical going into the rest of the year  which again as I mentioned before reflects work that we re doing in the base business  as well as maybe some progress from an acquisition profitability perspective Joseph Spak    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystThanks  And just as a follow up on Aerospace  you mentioned the 737 MAX  I don t know  I guess technically you were more diplomatic  I guess  so I just mentioned it  But can you just give us some indication of what you re really considering there in your guidance or so as we continue to follow the news and headlines there  track how it should impact your outlook R  Adam Norwitt    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I mean  look  I think  first of all  just for the overall outlook of the Company  there is not a program  including the one you mentioned that is    that is material to our overall outlook  But in that market  commercial air  which did represent for us for the full year  it s 5  of sales  one significant program can have some modest impact on your outlook And that s what it has had here  I mean our overall presumption is consistent with probably what everybody has read publicly in terms of timing and I wouldn t say much more than that OperatorThe next question is from Jim Suva from Citigroup Investment Research  Your line is now open Jim Suva    Citigroup Investment Research    AnalystThank you  and Happy New Year to you and your team  And I have one question that is actually kind of the same question for both Adam and Craig  and that is  as you look at 2020  what s kind of maybe the two or three variables or swing factors or end markets or items that you re really focused on  maybe a  for Adam on the sales side  and then  B for the profitability side for Craig Like for example  does the integration costs really something you re really focused on from a margin perspective or the challenges in the aerospace or mobility for the sales side I m just trying to figure out what s the top couple variables that you re kind of more keen    most keenly focused on for 2020 that could directionally go much better or potentially be some more risk  Thank you R  Adam Norwitt    President and Chief Executive OfficerWell  thank you very much  Jim and Happy New Year to you as well  Look  I mean two variables end markets  I mean  we are focused really on making sure the Company performs regardless of what risks emerge for us  I think we saw in 2019 many things that came about that we did not anticipate And to categorize in advance  well  that could happen or this could happen  that s not how we operate the business  The way we operate the business is we try to be prepared regardless  And so I can tell you that our team fully expects that in 2020 there may be unexpected external things that happen and occasionally in some of those external things that happen  it can have some sort of effect on Amphenol And it s up to our team to really make sure that  that doesn t have any financial harm to the Company and what you see in our results in 2019 is clearly that our team sprung into action quickly  dealt with whatever came our way  managed effectively and ultimately brought the Company out of 2019 in a stronger position than we had come into it  And I think that s the whole mantra for Amphenolians  the worldwide is  we cannot necessarily control the environment  but we can control our agility in the face of that environment And that s true inside of each of our markets  You know  if in military  there were a decline in spending  well  our team would deal with it  We would manage it  And by the way  we would have just outstanding presence with customers who we have pleased so well during the course of this latest expansion  We would do a fabulous job of that  We just talked about Aerospace  I mean in the industrial market  we have such a great position now because of the acquisitions that we ve made and the various new product developments that we are ready for whichever end market goes up and we are ready to deal with it  if there is something that would happen within those segments that would not be as favorable  You know  I could go through each of the markets in that way  I wouldn t say that any of our markets sitting here where we sit has a different kind of risk of something external happening  I would of course say that some of our markets are a little easier to predict than others The mobile devices being the one that s the hardest to predict on one side and maybe the military being the one that is a little bit more ascertain  Phonetic   because of the length of the lead times and the spending patterns  But I didn t answer your question in terms of two variables  but I can tell you that our team is focused on dealing with any variable that would come our way And then maybe Craig  I ll let you talk about the   Craig A  Lampo    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  yeah  No  sure  I guess  you know  there s a lot of things  obviously I m going to be thinking about as we move into 2020  I mean  one of them will continue to be our acquisitions and bringing the profitability level up to the average of the Company  I mean  we did ten acquisitions over the last 13 months here and certainly made more before that  And we are continuing to spend a lot of time to ensure that we re making the right decisions and helping those operations make those decisions to ensure that ultimately we get to that    to get those profitability levels up and that s something that probably we will spend a disproportionate share of my time on  and along with all the other things that we typically do during the year that some of which Adam just mentioned it in his prior comments So anyways  again I apologize for not spending    talking about many  many different things  because we d probably be on the phone for way too long here  but from an M A perspective that will continue to be one of the things I ll spend time on Jim Suva    Citigroup Investment Research    AnalystThank you for the answers  And we hope you all to have a great 2020 R  Adam Norwitt    President and Chief Executive OfficerLikewise  Jim OperatorThe next question is from David Kelley from Jefferies  Your line is now open David Kelley    Jefferies    AnalystHey  good afternoon and thanks for squeezing me in  Just one quick follow up on the earlier automotive discussion  I ll pass it along  With CO2 emissions regulations ramping this year  are you seeing any meaningful change in content opportunity in Europe as customers are shifting their mix to electric vehicles R  Adam Norwitt    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I mean  I think David that the    all these regulations whether they be CO2 emissions regulations  whether they d be like PM2 5 kind of regulations  Euro 6  the China version thereof  I mean  all of these regulations tend to create dislocations  which requires then new technology solutions to meet with those regulations And I think by and large  those are always great inflection points for our organization to take advantage of them with our new enabling technologies  And so  you know  I wouldn t just confine it to that universe of CO2 emissions in Europe  but rather just broadly as we see more regulatory impact in the automotive market  those do create opportunities long term and ones that our team is well positioned to take advantage of We ve done a great job on working in electric drivetrain over around the world  the biggest market for electric drivetrains has been at least so far in China and that s a place where our team has just done a fabulous job of positioning ourselves  So it s really great  Harsh environment  high power interconnect solutions  but that s something we re doing really around the world And so from that sort of micro example of electric drivetrains  we re very well positioned  Each platform  you can t say that universally  it is a positive when something goes from a combustion to an electric drive train  but by and large  technological shifts like this are good because they create those inflection points and opportunities for new technology OperatorThe next question is from Joe Giordano from Cowen  Your line is now open Joseph Giordano    Cowen    AnalystHey guys  good afternoon R  Adam Norwitt    President and Chief Executive OfficerGood afternoon  Joe Joseph Giordano    Cowen    AnalystYeah  Sorry  I m not sure if you watch Curb Your Enthusiasm  but Larry David said it s too late to wish people Happy New Year  you  Phonetic  have three days  he said  so just letting you guys know R  Adam Norwitt    President and Chief Executive Officer Technical Issues   I ll do it until Valentine s Day  Joe Joseph Giordano    Cowen    AnalystJust for me to start  On the Huawei restrictions  is there    how do you view the risk of permanent share loss to like local supply if that was like lifted over the next couple of months  like  is that a market that we should think comes back for you guys or is it just  it s been fulfilled locally and it s unlikely to change again R  Adam Norwitt    President and Chief Executive OfficerLook  I mean I think it s a broader question and it s one that we ve I think talked about in prior calls  which is  not even just specific to one customer  but is there a kind of a nationalistic purchasing that can happen in the world including in China but not exclusive to China because of the nature of the various trade disputes that have happened over the last two  three years  and I think what I ve said consistently and we continue to absolutely maintain is that  it may happen that the world becomes a more local world as opposed to a globalizing world  and our team is ready for that  regardless And I think that s the real essence of how we operate in China  how we operate in India  how we operate in the US or elsewhere  As we do that with local teams who give real localized support for their customers  And because of that  the original restrictions  we were able to work through them and continue to support customers because we re not exporting technology We re complying obviously with every law from the first minute those laws are implemented  but our teams are really developing  supporting  covering the customer  ensuring the quality  doing everything in a local fashion really around the world And so  you know  to the extent that one day  one country decides that they re not going to buy from just American companies  we re still an American Company  but I can tell you that our people are giving local support as if they were a Chinese  an India  a Macedonian  or a German Company as well And that s a real differentiator for our    for our Company  And so as long as we can offer our customers truly special products that ultimately solve their problems and if we do that in a localized way  I m confident that we ll be able to minimize any impacts from any of the geopolitical dynamics that have gone on here during the course of these last few years Joseph Giordano    Cowen    AnalystAnd then    That s helpful  And then last from me on the device  I know we talked about device a lot  I just want to make sure I m clear on something  When you re    when you say you re    you know  it s impossible to figure out like a guide for this  I fully get that  but is your    is your uncertainty at this point in the year around volumes of those phones that might ultimately be produced or whether or not you re on these platforms in the first place  Is that still like in front of you  I know a major company is coming out with something in margin and multiple later in the year  like    do you know if you re on those or is it just we don t know what the volumes is  we have no idea what the volumes are going to be R  Adam Norwitt    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  It can be    at this early in the year  it can be a combination of all of the above  I mean  our team is working on new programs  all the time  but sometimes those programs  they change pretty soon before they are released  You d be surprised how dynamic the designs of consumer products can be And so  you re not fixed until they re really starting to build the things and ship them in volume  And so our team continues to work very hard to maximize what our position is in January  where we sit  it s not so easy to be able to tell exactly what s going to happen  Even if we have a pretty good read on it as good as we can have here in January But look  no doubt about it  our team has demonstrated the flexibility that we re going to go out there and win absolutely everything that we can possibly win  We re going to maximize our allocation given the    our discipline on cost and on price  and we re going to make sure that we can execute on whatever our customers put in front of us OperatorOur last question is from Steven Fox from Cross Research  Your line is now open Steven Fox    Cross Research    AnalystHi  good afternoon  I just had one big picture question  Adam  If I think about the organic sales growth decline you had in the quarter  I would imagine there s a lot of other companies in the fragmented industry getting  Phonetic  in that are doing a lot worse  So on one hand  I guess I m wondering what you think about some of the small companies  how much they re struggling now  if it s temporary or secular and then on the other hand  given that you re looking for a new  Phonetic  growth again in earnings this year  and I understand the broadband comments and the positive trends they re making in the second half  but like when do we start thinking about this market as being in the market  you have to live with and maybe see a change in strategy  Thanks R  Adam Norwitt    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  well  look  I mean  how are other companies doing here in the fourth quarter  smaller companies  I can tell you  if you don t have the diversity of Amphenol  if you don t have the reach of Amphenol  the breadth and the balance of Amphenol  the depth of technology  2019 is not an easy year  There s no doubt about it  So I can imagine that that could have been a tough year for many  much tougher than what we saw I mean  if you look at our whole performance for the year  we were down by 3  organically in the year that is essentially the impact of mobile devices  I mean mobile devices was down 20  for the full year and it was 17  of our sales in 2018  Just the math of it  is that represents just a bit more than 3  organic growth All the other markets sort of balance themselves out  And I think that s a testament to the diversification of the Company  Now look going into 2020  I can t hear you perfectly  Steve  but what I think you said is that we don t have earnings growth this year  but we have guided to 1  to 3  earnings growth and 0  to 2  US dollar growth this year and I think if we go back a year ago  it s not materially different than the guidance that we had coming into 2019 I think it s a prudent guidance  it s a guidance that reflects a still highly uncertain environment and it s one that also reflects great efforts by the team to drive cost improvements  to drive value with our customers and ultimately to drive a strong performance and to the extent that there are opportunities for us to do better than that environment in the year  you can bet for well that everybody around Amphenol  all 74 000 of us are going to jump on those opportunities with full vigor and energy and thereby execute on them So I think it s actually a very strong outlook from that perspective  given the overall environment that we re in and the strong conversion as Craig talked about Steven Fox    Cross Research    AnalystOkay  thank you  Sorry for the bad connection R  Adam Norwitt    President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Thanks so much  Steve  Operator  are there any more questions OperatorWe show no further questions at this time speakers R  Adam Norwitt    President and Chief Executive OfficerThat s wonderful  Well  thank you all very much and again despite Joe s reference  I will once more wish you all a Happy New Year and wish in particular that you have a great start to 2020 and we look forward to speaking with you all

124296,345811,APH,Earnings Preview  Amphenol  APH  Q3 Earnings Expected To Decline,opinion,"Amphenol  APH  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on October 23  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of fiber optic products is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 87 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  12 1  
Revenues are expected to be  1 99 billion  down 6 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Amphenol 
For Amphenol  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Amphenol will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Amphenol would post earnings of  0 93 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 92  delivering a surprise of  1 08  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Amphenol doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/earnings-preview-amphenol-aph-q3-earnings-expected-to-decline-200474083,200474083

124301,345816,APH,Amphenol  APH  Upgraded To Buy  Here s Why,opinion,"Amphenol  APH  could be a solid choice for investors given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   An upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices    has triggered this rating change 
The Zacks rating relies solely on a company s changing earnings picture  It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure    the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors  since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
Therefore  the Zacks rating upgrade for Amphenol basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  and the near term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated  That s partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock 
For Amphenol  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company s underlying business  And investors  appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Amphenol
This maker of fiber optic products is expected to earn  3 66 per share for the fiscal year ending December  2019  which represents a year over year change of  2 9  
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Amphenol  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 2 1  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

124302,345817,APH,Are You Looking For A Top Momentum Pick  Why Amphenol  APH  Is A Great Choice,opinion,"Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock s recent trend in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will be essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   With this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving that way  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks  this can be very tough to define  There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance  The Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Amphenol  APH   a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B  We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions  two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Amphenol currently has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period 
You can see the current list of Zacks  1 Rank Stocks here    
Set to Beat the Market 
In order to see if APH is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this maker of fiber optic products holds up 
Looking at a stock s short term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum  since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For APH  shares are up 0 85  over the past week while the Zacks Electronics   Connectors industry is up 0 42  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 6 34  compares favorably with the industry s 3 61  performance as well 
While any stock can see its price increase  it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market  That is why looking at longer term price metrics    such as performance over the past three months or year    can be useful as well  Shares of Amphenol have increased 16 15  over the past quarter  and have gained 33 58  in the last year  On the other hand  the S P 500 has only moved 8 96  and 31 02   respectively 
Investors should also take note of APH s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  Right now  APH is averaging 869 043 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with APH 
Over the past two months  1 earnings estimate moved higher compared to none lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost APH s consensus estimate  increasing from  3 64 to  3 66 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  1 estimate has moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line
Given these factors  it shouldn t be surprising that APH is a  2  Buy  stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B  If you re looking for a fresh pick that s set to soar in the near term  make sure to keep Amphenol on your short list ",2020-01-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/are-you-looking-for-a-top-momentum-pick-why-amphenol-aph-is-a-great-choice-200495798,200495798
124307,345822,APH,Analysts Estimate Amphenol  APH  To Report A Decline In Earnings  What To Look Out For,opinion,"Amphenol  APH  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 22  2020  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise

This maker of fiber optic products is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 91 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  13 3  
Revenues are expected to be  1 99 billion  down 10 6  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 19  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Amphenol 
For Amphenol  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Amphenol will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Amphenol would post earnings of  0 87 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 95  delivering a surprise of  9 20  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Amphenol doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2020-01-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-amphenol-aph-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200499060,200499060

What s Next for Amphenol 
While Amphenol has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately

The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Amphenol 
For Amphenol  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  2 08  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Amphenol will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Amphenol would post earnings of  0 98 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 05  delivering a surprise of  7 14  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Amphenol appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/amphenol-aph-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200407814,200407814

This maker of fiber optic products has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 4 14  
For the most recent quarter  Amphenol was expected to post earnings of  0 88 per share  but it reported  0 89 per share instead  representing a surprise of 1 14   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  0 98 per share  while it actually produced  1 05 per share  a surprise of 7 14

124398,345913,APH,Amphenol  APH  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Amphenol  NYSE APH  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on January 23  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This maker of fiber optic products is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 98 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  14  
Revenues are expected to be  2 10 billion  up 7 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Amphenol 
For Amphenol  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  1 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Amphenol will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Amphenol would post earnings of  0 94 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 99  delivering a surprise of  5 32  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Amphenol doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/amphenol-aph-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200376244,200376244

You can see 
Strong Buy rated Caterpillar s shares have gained  34 6  year to date  outperforming the Zacks Construction and Mining industry which has increased  32 5  over the same period  Caterpillar s August sales rose 11   driven by improvement in Asia Pacific and construction 
Caterpillar was awarded a five year  663 6 million fixed price contract from the Pentagon to supply commercial construction equipment  Backed by improved order activity  Caterpillar guides revenue in the range of  42  44 billion and earnings per share of  5 00 for 2017  The mid point of the ranges reflects a year over year growth of 12  and 46   respectively 
The Zacks analyst thinks Asia Pacific will continue to be a catalyst for growth  owing to increased infrastructure and residential investment in China  Leading indicators of U S  construction signal robust conditions ahead that bode well for Caterpillar  Efforts to reduce costs will help boost margins 
 You can   
Shares of Buy rated Texas Instruments gained  17 9  year to date  underperforming the Zacks  General Semiconductor industry which has gained  23  over the same period  However  Texas Instruments is one of the largest suppliers of analog integrated circuits 
The Zacks analyst expects margin expansion to continue driven by the secular strength in the auto and industrial markets  a stronger mix of analog and embedded processing products  benefits of restructuring initiatives and more than 300mm capacity coming online  Moreover  the recently announced 24  dividend hike and an additional  6 billion share buyback reflect the company s solid cash flow generation ability and balance sheet strength 
The only negative at this point appears to be intensifying competition particularly for auto chips  given recent market consolidation  There is also the question of negative currency effect and a high debt load 
 You can   
Alphabet s shares have underperformed the Zacks Internet Services in the year to date period  the stock is up  19 6  vs   21  gain for the sector   Alphabet is one of the leading providers of target based advertisements on the web  The company s second quarter earnings exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
The Zacks analyst likes Alphabet s excellent execution  which is helped it to maintain its dominant share in a competitive  fast growing search market  Its focus on innovation  strategic acquisitions and Android OS should continue to generate strong cash flows  Its diversification strategy is also positive  but requires significant investment and involves uncertain payback periods  particularly since these efforts are at the cutting edge of technology  However  increasing litigation issues continues to impact the company s profits

	Chicago  IL  June 02  2017   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog includeSalesforce  NYSE        FedEx  NYSE        Occidental Petroleum  NYSE        Amphenol  NYSE       and Marathon Oil  NYSE       

	Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations     

Here are highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog  

New Research Reports for Friday  CRM  FDX  OXY   More 

	The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team  Today s publication features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including Salesforce  NYSE        FedEx  NYSE      and Occidental Petroleum  NYSE        These research reports have been hand picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today  You can see   

	Before we discuss today s featured analyst reports  a brief comment about this morning s ISM and labor market surveys is in order  These broadly positive readings come ahead of tomorrow s all important government jobs report that will have direct Fed implications 

	The closely watched manufacturing ISM index came in better than expected at 54 9  just a shade above April s 54 8 reading  indicating a steadily improving backdrop for the factory sector  This key gauge of the manufacturing sector s health struggled the last two years  occasionally falling under the  50  level   the dividing line between expansion and contraction  but appears to have broken out to the upside this year  While the domestic economic backdrop has not changed in any meaningful way  notwithstanding expectations of growth friendly policy initiatives from the Trump administration  the international growth outlook has starting improving lately and that appears to be helping this export oriented part of the U S  economy  Stable prices for oil and other commodities lately have also been helpful 

	In other economic data today  the ADP jobs report for May came in very strong  with the  headline  number coming in at 253K vs  consensus expectations of a 170K read  The main use of this report is to serve as a preview for the monthly jobs reading from the government s Bureau of Labor Statistics  which comes out tomorrow morning  Friday  and is expected to show  headline  gains of 185K  Given the proximity of the BLS report s release  we may not see much change in consensus expectations data  But it s reasonable to assume that  whisper expectations  will be north of 200K for tomorrow s report  That said  the ADP report hasn t always closely tracked the BLS reading in the past  though both reports do move in the same direction

Today s Featured Research Reports 

Salesforce shares have handily beat the broader Tech sector this year  with the stock up almost double the Zacks Technology sector s  16 2  gain in the year to date period  Driving this momentum is the company s dominant position in  front office  applications and strong cloud offerings that provide it one of the best growth profiles in the large cap tech space  All of these positive attributes were on display in the company s recent quarterly report when it beat on both the top  and bottom lines  Substantial increase in revenues was backed by growth across all its business segments and the Salesforce ExactTarget Marketing Cloud platform  While stepped up investments on international expansion and data centers could impact near term results  but the company s long term growth outlook remains very compelling   You can  

FedEx  have lagged the broader market this year  FDX is up  6 6  vs   8 1  gain for the S P 500 index YTD   but it has done better than both UPS as well as the Zacks Transportation sector  The company s dominant market share in the package delivery space has made it a proxy for the secular growth in e commerce  But concerns about the seemingly never ending cycle of capital spending that weigh on its ability to generate free cash flows and potential competitive challenges  particularly from Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   remain key headwinds  Uncertainty about integration of the TNT operations remains an another issue  On the positive side  management s bullish comments about the current period at the time of the last earnings release is encouraging  The company reports quarterly results on June 20th and is expected to come out with  3 84 in EPS on  15 5 billion in revenues  up  16 3  and  19 6  from the year earlier period  respectively  The stock has a history of responding strongly to quarterly results  it was up following the last quarterly release on the aforementioned positive outlook even though it missed EPS estimates   You can  

Occidental Petroleum shares have suffered this year  as have shares of all oil producers  to reflect the commodity s price slide and uneven outlook  That said  it has done better than its E P peers  the stock is down  14 7  in the year to date period vs   23  decline for the Zacks E P industry   reflecting Occidental s strong position in the Permian basin and solid balance sheet  The Zacks analyst likes Occidental s plans to sell its low margin assets and focus on higher quality assets  The company s focus on Permian Resources and its initiative to produce more oil will boost its performance in the long term  The highly competitive oil and gas space  operational interruptions and stringent environmental regulations are headwinds   You can
