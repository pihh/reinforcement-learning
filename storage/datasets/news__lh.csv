9537,231052,LH,LH Vs  CNMD  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors with an interest in Medical   Dental Supplies stocks have likely encountered both LabCorp  LH  and Conmed  CNMD   But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now  We ll need to take a closer look 
Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities  but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank  The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits 
LabCorp and Conmed are sporting Zacks Ranks of  2  Buy  and  3  Hold   respectively  right now  This means that LH s earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive  so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook  But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors 
Value investors analyze a variety of traditional  tried and true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics  including the tried and true P E ratio  the P S ratio  earnings yield  and cash flow per share  as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use 
LH currently has a forward P E ratio of 15 52  while CNMD has a forward P E of 34 17  We also note that LH has a PEG ratio of 1 81  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  CNMD currently has a PEG ratio of 2 56 
Another notable valuation metric for LH is its P B ratio of 2 43  The P B ratio pits a stock s market value against its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  CNMD has a P B of 3 48 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to LH s Value grade of B and CNMD s Value grade of C 
LH sticks out from CNMD in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models  so value investors will likely feel that LH is the better option right now ",2019-07-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/lh-vs-cnmd-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200440882,200440882
9538,231053,LH,LabCorp  LH  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  Can The Stock Move Higher ,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year decline in earnings on higher revenues when LabCorp  LH  reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 25  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This medical laboratory operator is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 90 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  2 7  
Revenues are expected to be  2 90 billion  up 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 12  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for LabCorp 
For LabCorp  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  2 69  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  2 
So  this combination indicates that LabCorp will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that LabCorp would post earnings of  2 53 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 62  delivering a surprise of  3 56  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
LabCorp appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/labcorp-lh-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-can-the-stock-move-higher-200441399,200441399

legislative relief from the second round of PAMA  Protecting Access to Medicare Act  price reductions  there is an increasing industry wide awareness about PAMA s true impact  Owing to this  LabCorp

highly optimistic about the Phase II of LaunchPad initiative in Diagnostics  which is expected to deliver  200 million of savings in another three years  This should contribute to the company s operational results in the second quarter itself Within Covance Drug Development  LabCorp is focused on driving profitable growth through expanded solutions and enhanced operational capabilities  The Chiltern integration has significantly strengthened the company s strategic position in clinical development and is accelerating revenues and profit growth within Covance  On this front  the company

Additionally  the company has progressed with the Covance LaunchPad initiative  In the first phase  as expected  the company generated pre tax savings of  20 million  At the exit of first quarter 2019  it remained on track to deliver  150 million of net savings by the end of 2020  The company is also on course to realize  30 million in cost synergies from the consolidation of Chiltern by the end of 2019 This apart  the innovative business swap transaction with Envigo is projected to contribute to the company s top line in the second quarter  The transaction provides Covance with better global non clinical research capabilities while maintaining access to a bigger research models and services through a multi year renewable supply agreement All the above factors should together constantly

overall basis  LabCorp envisions modest growth in total revenues and the adjusted EPS  The company expects another year of approximately  1 billion in free cash flow  These should get reflected in the

reported revenues of  1 76 billion  reflecting a 2 9  dip year over year  This downside was primarily due to a 2 8  headwind from the disposition of businesses and 0 3  lower organic revenues

Our Take
LabCorp exited the first quarter on a mixed note with earnings ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate and revenues lagging the mark  While increasing acquisitions and favorable mix positively contributed to LabCorp s Diagnostics business in the quarter  the disposition of certain businesses and the implementation of PAMA dented growth 
Covance Drug Development also reported a year over year decline  The strength from acquisitions and organic growth were negated by adverse impact of foreign currency translation

Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics  These include the long favored P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company s fair value

9562,231077,LH,Can Covance Business Growth Aid LabCorp  LH  In Q1 Earnings ,opinion,Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings   NYSE LH   also known as LabCorp  is slated to report first quarter 2019 results on Apr 30  before the market opens  In the last reported quarter  the company s adjusted earnings exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 61   The average trailing four quarter beat was 1 11  Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement Factors at PlayLabCorp s underlying core business is currently showing a stable performance  Within Diagnostcs  the company expects to generate revenues in the first quarter of 2019  banking on the following number of facts First  the company already reported that the January volume related to contract changes has been in line with the company s expectations  Second  referral volumes from hospitals and health systems should increase during the first quarter Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Price and EPS Surprise   Third  although the company expects to gain a judicial and legislative relief from the second round of PAMA  Protecting Access to Medicare Act  price reductions  there is an increasing industry wide awareness about PAMA s true impact  Per LabCorp  with this  the company will be offered a string of attractive tuck in lab acquisition opportunities  which would typically deliver significant synergies and high returns on invested capital Fourth  the company is highly optimistic about the Phase II of LaunchPad initiative in Diagnostics  which is expected to deliver  200 million of savings in another three years  This should start contributing to the company s operational results from the first quarter itself This apart  in the first quarter  LabCorp is expected to particularly benefit from its several recent collaborations  Among the company s recent alliances  worth mentioning are the company s tie ups with UnitedHealthcare and Aetna  NYSE AET   which helped LabCorp become a contracted laboratory provider for all major national plans  With the latest agreement  LabCorp will continue to be a national in network laboratory for all UnitedHealthcare plan participants on a long term basis  This apart  starting this January onward  LabCorp also became a national  in network provider of laboratory services for substantially all Aetna members  We expect to see some strong top line contributions from these alliances in the first quarter However  within Diagnostics  the fourth quarter of 2018 witnessed trouble regarding a number of nonoperational items  causing a 400 basis point decline in the reported operating margin   The same has been apprehended for the yet to be reported quarter Within this segment  2019 revenues are expected in the range of a negative 2 4  as compared to 2018  inclusive of a foreign currency translation of approximately negative 30 basis points  This apart  PAMA is expected to trim Diagnostics revenues by approximately 1 6  in 2019 Within Covance Drug Development  LabCorp is focused on driving future profitable growth through expanded solutions and enhanced operational capabilities  Chiltern integration has significantly strengthened the company s strategic position in clinical development and is accelerating revenues and profit growth within Covance  On this front  the company is keeping a good pace with its objective to streamline the drug development process  Significantly  it is winning new awards through its integrated Covance and Chiltern offering Additionally  the company has progressed with the Covance LaunchPad initiative  In the first phase  as expected  the company generated pre tax savings of  20 million   At the exit of fourth quarter 2018  it remains on track to deliver  150 million of net savings from Covance LaunchPad by the end of 2020 and another  30 million of cost synergies from the Chiltern buyout by 2019 end All the above factors should together constantly favor the top line at LabCorp s Covance Drug Development in the yet to be reported quarter  Overall  the company currently expects 2019 Covance Drug Development revenue growth within 5 9  For 2019  on an overall basis  LabCorp expects modest growth in total revenues and the adjusted EPS  The company expects another year of approximately  1 billion in free cash flow  These should get reflected in the first quarter itself What the Quantitative Model SuggestsOur proven Zacks model conclusively shows that a company with a favorable Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  has good chances of beating

9577,231092,LH,LabCorp  LH  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  Should You Buy ,opinion,"LabCorp  LH  is expected to deliver a year over year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 30  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This medical laboratory operator is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 53 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  9  
Revenues are expected to be  2 82 billion  down 0 9  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 31  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for LabCorp 
For LabCorp  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 36  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that LabCorp will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that LabCorp would post earnings of  2 48 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 52  delivering a surprise of  1 61  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
LabCorp appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/labcorp-lh-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-should-you-buy-200409468,200409468

The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
LabCorp shares have added about 11 8  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 9  
What s Next for LabCorp 
While LabCorp has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for LabCorp was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

9582,231097,LH,Should Value Investors Consider Laboratory Corporation  LH  ,opinion,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings   NYSE LH   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Laboratory Corporation has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 13 88  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 17 69  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Laboratory Corporation s current PE level puts it much below its midpoint of 16 05 over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares pretty favorably with the Medical Market s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 20 5  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is much undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Laboratory Corporation has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 13 75  which is lower than the current level  So  it is fair to say that a bit more value oriented path may be ahead for Laboratory Corporation stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Laboratory Corporation has a P S ratio of just 1 37  This is quite lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 22 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this stands below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Laboratory Corporation currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Laboratory Corporation a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Laboratory Corporation is just 1 75  a level that is lower than the industry s average ratio of 2 23  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  LH is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Laboratory Corporation might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has Growth and Momentum Scores of C  This gives LH a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen one upward revision in the past sixty days compared to six downward revisions  while the full year estimate has seen four upward and three downward revisions in the same time period This has had a mixed impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has declined by 5 2  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched up by 0 2   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Price and Consensus   This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term 
Bottom Line
Laboratory Corporation is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Further  a strong industry rank  among Top 31  of more than 250 industries  instils our confidence 
However  with a Zacks Rank  3 it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  Also  over the past two years  the broader industry has underperformed the market at large  as you can see below 

So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick

in mid range of its long term model target of 20  to 30  for the full year 2019  Additionally  gross margin and operating margin are expected to improve throughout 2019 However  it is important to note here that the arbitration decision with SDC Entities requires Align Technology to close Invisalign Stores by Apr 3  2019  This is expected to result in a material charge in the first quarter  Nevertheless  the store closures are likely to have minimal impact on the company s revenues Strong Scanner and Service BusinessAlign Technology has been generating solid revenues from the Scanner and

results on Feb 7  before the market opens  In the last reported quarter  the company s adjusted earnings lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 53   However  average trailing four quarter beat was 1 55  Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement Factors at PlayWithin Diagnostics  the previous reported quarter witnessed trouble related to certain ransomware attack last July and an adverse impact of hurricane Florence  This induced lower than expected organic revenues for that quarter  To counter this effect  LabCorp has come up with its initiative to make certainorganizational changes for strengthening its leadership and operational performance  The company is also on track to launch the next phase of Diagnostics LaunchPad  which will result in multiyear cost savings of a similar magnitude like LaunchPad Phase I  under the drug development business  In the fourth quarter  LabCorp is expected to particularly gain from its collaboration with Walgreens  Per the company  this partnership underpins the LabCorp Walgreens channel  which is uniquely positioned to deliver a wide range of personalized  integrated  consumer facing services over time We are also looking forward to the company s alliance with European provider of clinical laboratory testing  Unilabs  This collaboration has started to broaden the network of laboratories used by biopharmaceutical companies to support companion diagnostic development and commercialization  Per LabCorp  companion diagnostics is a global opportunity and the tie up with Unilabs is the first step toward extending its companion Dx offering worldwide Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Price and EPS Surprise   Overall  from the fourth quarter itself  the company expects to deploy more capital for near  and long term value creation including internal capital investments and strategic acquisitions and partnerships within its Diagnostics wing  However  how much this can contribute to the company s top line in the quarter to be reported is unclear The company currently projects to report LabCorp Diagnostics revenues for the full year in the range of 2 1 2 5   a reduction from the earlier provided band of3 3 5  Within Covance Drug Development  we note that after suffering a dull phase for several quarters  the segment started to gross higher revenues exactly a year ago on the back of Chiltern acquisition and a strong organic growth profile besides a favorable foreign currency translation The Chiltern buyout proved accretive to LabCorp s portfolio with the addition of highly complementary capabilities to the company s offerings including scale expansion in the Asia Pacific region  a broader reach in the rapidly growing emerging and mid tier biopharma customer segments a well as the company s expertise in the oncology drug development Apart from Chiltern  LabCorp continues to add Covance s offerings to its portfolio through targeted tuck in acquisitions and partnerships  The latest on this list is the comprehensive laboratory collaboration with Baptist Health  the largest not for profit system in Kentucky  As part of this association  the company will utilize its fully standardized laboratory solutions  operational expertise and a comprehensive test menu to support the delivery of care across eight hospital based labs  This apart  the company s consolidation of Sciformix Corporation  a scientific process outsourcing company  is projected to cement LabCorp s position in the later phases of drug and device development  particularly for post marketing pharmacovigilance and market access solutions All these factors should together constantly benefit the top line at LabCorp s Covance Drug Development in the yet to be reported quarter The company is also optimistic about the development regarding its multi year project  LaunchPad  LabCorp currently remains on track to deliver  150 million of net savings from Covance LaunchPad by the end of 2020

9596,231111,LH,LabCorp  LH  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on lower revenues when LabCorp  LH  reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 7  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This medical laboratory operator is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 48 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  1 2  
Revenues are expected to be  2 78 billion  down 0 5  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 23  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for LabCorp 
For LabCorp  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that LabCorp will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that LabCorp would post earnings of  2 87 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 74  delivering a surprise of  4 53  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
LabCorp doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/labcorp-lh-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200381939,200381939

9604,231119,LH,Morgan Stanley Calls Labs  Safe Havens   Stocks To Watch,opinion,It takes just one super deal to turn the odds in your favor  Did the clinical laboratory services market just spin the wheel of fortune  Let s see what happened On May 24  Quest Diagnostics announced an expanded long term strategic partnership agreement with UnitedHealthcare  a business of UnitedHealth Group   NYSE UNH    to operate as a preferred national laboratory for all of the company s members starting Jan 1  2019  This expanded agreement will provide in network access to Quest Diagnostics  complete portfolio of laboratory services to more than 48 million eligible members Under the expanded tie up  the companies are going to join forces on a variety of value based programs  At the same time  Laboratory Corporation of Americas Holdings   NYSE LH    popularly known as LabCorp  has been hogging the spotlight on the news of the company losing its exclusive right to serve UnitedHealthcare post Jan 1  Meanwhile  LabCorp announced the extension of its partnership agreement with Aetna   NYSE AET   the next day  Per the expanded agreement  LabCorp will serve as a preferred national laboratory for almost all of the company s members starting next year  The extended agreement will provide in network access to LabCorp s complete portfolio of laboratory services to over 20 million eligible members According to CNBC  Quest Diagnostics will lose its exclusivity to serve as a preferred laboratory partner to Aetna s members Notably  both the diagnostic testing lab stalwarts  stocks have been trading higher than the S P 500 index since May 24 Per Morgan Stanley s analyst Ricky Goldwasser  these deals will result in the elimination of the long time problem of contract overhang and will thereby result in a cognitive environment for pricing in the near term  He also commented      Labs are relative safe havens within the health care services sector  Conforming to this idea  we believe that there are other factors which work as growth drivers for the clinical laboratory services market  Let s delve deeper Here we need to consider MarketsandMarkets data which shows that the global clinical laboratory services market is headed to reach a worth of  146 41 billion by 2022  at a CAGR of 5 2  between 2017 and 2022 Most of the analysts believe an aging demography is primarily acting in favor of this  Per an article commissioned by the National Institute on Aging  part of the National Institutes of Health  8 5  of the global population is aged 65 years and above Strengthening emerging markets are also going to provide impetus to the burgeoning global clinical laboratory services market  According to an article published in Report Buyer  the Asia Pacific  APAC  region will be the largest market for the clinical laboratory services between 2017 and 2022  Growing disposable income among the middle class people along with increasing access to state of the art clinical laboratory technologies will drive the upside According to some analysts  technological advancements in the form of integrated workflow management systems and database management tools are helping the companies expand their sample processing ability every year  Meanwhile  enhancements in laboratory testing technology will continue to boost demand for laboratory services Stocks to Watch Out ForHere we highlight three companies that are striving to cash in on the bountiful opportunities in the clinical laboratory services market Genomic Health  Inc    NASDAQ GHDX    Based in Redwood City  CA

earnings surprise in three of the last four quarters  the average beat being 0 9  PAMA  A DownerLike all other markets  the clinical lab space has its own issues to deal with Changes in governmental regulations may have a significant impact on company operations  In the last couple of years  several reimbursement issues have been hurting revenues  Majority of the companies are concerned about the CMS   Centers for Medicare   Medicaid Services  latest Medicare reimbursement reduction as a result of the implementation of the Protecting Access to Medicare Act  PAMA  This has been a major dampener for testing laboratories  As said by LabCorp earlier  the new PAMA rates published by CMS do not reflect the intent of Congress when it directed CMS to implement market based Medicare rates for lab testing  The statement says   The process CMS followed to determine these rates was fatally flawed and failed to account for significant segments of the lab market by excluding 99 percent of all U S  labs from reporting data and limiting data collection to 1 percent of laboratories  dominated by independent labs  However  per an article on GenomeWeb  companies like Myriad Genetics   NASDAQ MYGN    Veracyte and Luminex Corporation among others  which have their own proprietary tests  will for obvious reasons enjoy an edge and more control over pricing Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside

quarter  the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 28 2   Moreover  the company surpassed estimates in all the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 8 6  Let s see  how things are shaping up for this announcement Key CatalystsResMed is expected to gain from a strong performance on the domestic as well as international front like the previous quarter  In the past few earnings  the company s domestic revenues were driven by solid growth in devices and masks as well as a continued double digit software sales rise  Moreover  the sleep apnea patient volume consistently witnessed steady growth  We expect these trends to find reflection in the impending third quarter results as well Internationally  revenues across Europe  Asia and other markets are likely to register a solid increase  banking on a strong device and masks performance  Within devices  sleep apnea patient volume should continue to expand through the company s marketing efforts and channel partners  In Canada and Latin America  a sturdy uptake of AirSense 10 device platform and the Air Solutions cloud based software platform should further add value to the company s portfolio ResMed Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    In France  the company s receipt of French reimbursement approval for telemonitoring buoys optimism in the stock  The company believes  this reimbursement grant will continue to drive the uptake of Air Solutions ecosystem including the AirSense 10 and the AirCurve 10 device platforms as well as AirView and myAir software platforms in the to be reported quarter  Moreover  the company keeps investing and expanding its footprint in the high growth markets of China  South Korea  India  Brazil and several countries in Eastern Europe Within mask and accessories outside the United States  the company is expected to benefit from nasal and full face categories  namely AirFit N20 and the AirFit F20  respectively Per ResMed  with more than 1 5 billion nights of medical sleep and medical respiratory care data  the company is successfully working on simplifying workflow and improving patient outcomes  This improvement should drive the company s top line performance in the quarter  yet to be reported The Zacks Consensus Estimate of  217 million for international revenues indicates a rise of 19 2  from the year ago quarter Domestically  ResMed is extremely upbeat about the latest tax reform  which sees a transformation into a territorial tax system  This  in fact allows the company to invest its global cash assets without any artificial constraints  Per ResMed  it is now free to invest in three new ways  firstly  growing upon its existing strong U S  manufacturing footprint  secondly  expanding its existing U S  based research and development capability and finally  building upon its existing valuable U S  based intellectual property assets  Effective January  this is expected to remain accretive to the company s operational result in the fiscal third quarter The Zacks Consensus Estimate of  366 million for domestic revenues  including contributions from Brightree  reflects an increase of 10 2  from the year ago quarter Other Factors Likely to Influence ResMed s Q3ResMed continues to progress on the back of its three pronged growth strategy  In this regard  the company diligently aims at growth in the adjacent product and geographic markets including homecare ventilation for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease  COPD   Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis  ALS  and other respiratory disorders as well as the emerging markets of China  India and Brazil  ResMed still considers portable oxygen concentrators  POCs  an important addition to its menu of respiratory care products Moreover  since ResMed s acquisition of Brightree in fiscal 2016  the former has strongly progressed with the latter s software as a service business  latest offerings targeting the home health and hospice market  We expect this upside to further boost ResMed s top line in the third quarter  The Zacks Consensus Estimate of  39 7 million for Brightree revenues marks an increase of 13 4  from the year ago quarter Here s what the quantitative model predicts Per the proven Zacks model  a company with a favorable Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  has good chances of beating estimates if it also has a positive  ResMed has a Zacks Rank  2  which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  an Earnings ESP of  0 00  makes surprise prediction difficult  Thus  the combination does not suggest that the company is likely to beat on earnings

of 6 26  Let s see  how things are shaping up prior to this announcement Key CatalystWithin Diagnostics  Hologic once again expects a stellar performance banking on molecular diagnostics In the United States  the company is likely to gain from an increasing market share as well as utilization of fully automated Panther system along with market expansion by conforming to the testing guidelines Global growth within molecular diagnostics can be attributed to the Panther system  Hologic s fully automated molecular diagnostics instrument and also owing to a frequent utilization of Aptima women s health assays  Notably  Aptima assays have gained a huge customer base in testing for chlamydia and gonorrhea  HPV  human papillomavirus  and trichomonas  We are also hopeful about Hologic s expanded market for sexually transmitted disease testing Hologic  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    Further  we are upbeat about Diagnostics business earning a regulatory clearance for several new products in the United States over the last six quarters  These include the first three respiratory assays on new Fusion platform and three viral load tests for HIV  for human immunodeficiency virus   hepatitis C and hepatitis B  This steady pace of domestic assay innovation strengthens the company s position to consolidate molecular testing on the Panther system  In January  the company again announced the PMA approval for the Aptima HBV Quant Assay for quantitation of hepatitis B viral load on the fully automated Panther system All the above developments are anticipated to contribute significantly to the company s topline in the to be reported quarter The Zacks Consensus Estimate of  155 million for Molecular Diagnostics revenues reflects an increase of 9 2  from the year ago quarter Other few factors likely to influence Hologic s results in the fiscal second quarter are as follows Hologic is optimistic about sustaining a solid earnings trend in 2018 courtesy of gains from the Breast Health segment  Sales from the same have improved on the basis of an established clinical superiority of the segmental products over the last three quarters  The company has witnessed a consistent rise in market share within Breast Health on the back of direct to consumer initiativesand insurance coverage Additionally  the company s adoption of new mammography systems  3Dimensions and 3D Performance  encourages us  These new products have already started to leverage the company s Genius brand and also lured customers to upgrade their existing 2D systems  The company is building a broader portfolio of Breast Health products and services around the core of Genius systems so that it can play an instrumental role in the Breast Health continuum of care  Noteworthy in this regard is the recent PMA approval from the FDA for Clarity HD high resolution 3D imaging and Intelligent 2D imaging technology  These products are now available in the 3Dimensions breast tomosynthesis system The Zacks Consensus Estimate of  293 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 remains 4 3  ahead of the prior year tally On the flip side  Hologic confronted challenges related to unfavorable foreign currency movement over the past few quarters  Escalating operating expenses and an intense competition  particularly in the tomosynthesis market  continue to raise a concern What Our Model SuggestsPer the proven Zacks model  a company with a solid Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  has higher chances of beating estimates if it also has a positive  Hologic has a Zacks Rank

9661,231176,LH,Can LaunchPad Aid LabCorp s  LH  Covance Arm In Q1 Earnings ,opinion,Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings   NYSE LH   also known as LabCorp  is slated to report first quarter 2018 results on Apr 25  before the market opens  Last quarter  the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3 38   It has an average trailing four quarter beat of 2 87  Let s see  how things are shaping up for this announcement Factors at PlayLabCorp is likely to repeat its success trend from the last quarter  The company is expected to gain from a strong LabCorp Diagnostics segment in the period to be reported  banking on a favorable price  mix  tuck in acquisitions and organic volume  Particularly  we are looking forward to the company s partnership with Mount Sinai and the former owners of Pathology Associates Medical Laboratories  PAML   Providence and Catholic Health  Earlier  the company anticipated these three partnerships to benefit from a full year ownership and growth to generate approximately  500 million as incremental profitable revenues in 2018  We expect this likely upside to get reflected in first quarter results itself Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Price and EPS Surprise    Within Covance Drug Development  we note that after a dull show for several quarters  the segment has started to report revenue growth from third quarter 2017 onward on the back of the Chiltern acquisition  strong organic growth and a favorable foreign currency translation  With its buyout  Chiltern proved accretive to LabCorp s portfolio  adding highly complementary capabilities to the company s offerings including scale expansion in the Asia Pacific belt  a broader reach in the fast growing emerging and mid tier biopharma customer segments as well as expertise in the oncology drug development  All these factors should together continue to benefit the top line at LabCorp s Covance Drug Development in the yet to be reported quarter as well Significantly  the company is putting more emphasis on creating new growth opportunities in women s health  medical drug monitoring  genetics and oncology testing apart from critical collaborations such as Walgreens and 23andMe  Within Covance Drug Development  LabCorp expects these efforts to help fortifying its book to bill and net orders  driving its 2018 revenue conversion in the process Also  the multi year project LaunchPad  a business process improvement initiativeof LabCorp looks promising  The company s last year savings already achieved  20 million from the platform and further projects an additional net savings of  130 million through the three year period ending in 2020  thereby substantially expanding the Drug Development margins However  downsides might surface from the ongoing reimbursement issue  As stated by the company  the new PAMA  Protecting Access to Medicare Act  rates published by CMS  Centers for Medicare   Medicaid Services  do not reflect the intent of Congress when it directed CMS to implement the market based Medicare rates for lab testing  The statement reads that  The process CMS followed to determine these rates was fatally flawed and failed to account for significant segments of the lab market by excluding 99 percent of all U S  labs from reporting data and limiting data collection to 1 percent of laboratories  dominated by independent labs  We are therefore quite apprehensive about the entire scenario amid this current uproar  If the latest clinical lab fee schedule draft by CMS finally gets enforced sans amendment in favor of the testing laboratories  the continuation of LaunchPad  the projected growth at Covance  benefits from the Chiltern purchase and that from PAML and Mount Sinai plus the Covance LaunchPad process will all be offset by reduced PAMA rates Per LabCorp s previously provided guidance for 2018  revenue growth is expected to remain in the band of 9 5 11 5  from 2017 including a likely improvement of 60 bps from a positive foreign currency movement  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current year revenues is pegged at  11 48 billion  Adjusted EPS outlook for 2018 has been projected in the  11 30  11 70 range  The consensus mark of  11 55 for the metric falls within the company s forecast What the Quantitative Model SuggestsPer the proven Zacks model  a company with a favorable Zacks Rank  1  Strong

9666,231181,LH,5 Best GARP Stocks Based On Discounted PEG ,opinion,With smart investment becoming the buzzword in today s investment world  millennials are frequently inclining toward hybrid investment patterns rather than traditional pure play theories like value or growth The logic behind this is the effectiveness of a mixed investment strategy as value or growth investing approaches come with their own share of pitfalls  A pure play value investor misses the chance of betting on stocks that have bright long term prospects  The same way  growth investors often end up investing in expensive stocks  In other words  to make a long term investment more effective  the principles of both value and growth strategies need to be combined The quest for a mixed investment strategy led to the introduction of the GARP  growth at a reasonable price  approach  What GARPers look for is whether the stocks are somewhat undervalued and have solid sustainable growth potential  Investopedia  One of the fundamental metrics for finding GARP is the price earnings growth ratio  PEG   Although it is categorized under value investing  this strategy follows the principles of both growth and value investing The PEG ratio is defined as   Price  Earnings  Earnings Growth RateIt relates the stocks P E ratio with future earnings growth rate While P E alone only gives the idea of stocks  which are trading at a discount  PEG while adding the GROWTH element to it  helps to find those stocks that have solid future potential A lower PEG ratio  preferably less than 1  is always better for GARP investors Say for example  if a stock s P E ratio is 10 and expected long term growth rate is 15   the company s PEG will come down to 0 66  a ratio which indicates both undervaluation and future growth potential Unfortunately  this ratio is often neglected due to investors  limitation to calculate the future earnings growth rate of a stock There are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio though  It doesn t consider the very common situation of changing growth rates such as the forecast of the first three years at very high growth rate followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate in the long term Hence  PEG based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration Here are the screening criteria for a winning strategy PEG Ratio less than X Industry MedianP E Ratio  using F1  less than X Industry Median  For more accurate valuation purpose Zacks Rank of 1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   Whether good market conditions or bad  stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  or  2 have a proven history of success  Market Capitalization greater than  1 Billion  This helps us to focus on companies that have strong liquidity  Average 20 Day Volume greater than 50 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable Percentage Change F1 Earnings Estimate Revisions  4 Weeks  greater than 5  Upward estimate revisions add to the optimism  suggesting further bullishness Value Score of less than or equal to B Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  2 or 3  Hold  offer the best upside potential  Here are five of the 17 stocks that qualified the screening Pfizer Inc    NYSE PFE    The company focuses on the development and commercialization of a wide range of products including human and animal biologic as well as small molecule medicines and vaccines  along with consumer health care products  Apart from a Zacks Rank  2

9668,231183,LH,LabCorp   Interpace Team Up  Drive Specialty Diagnostics,opinion,Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings or LabCorp   NYSE LH   has recently entered into a national agreement with Interpace Diagnostics Group  Inc    NASDAQ IDXG   in the field of cytopathology  On one hand  this win win alliance will expand Interpace s nationwide network of cytology providers  supporting its Thyroid molecular business unit  While on the other  it will be helpful in strengthening LabCorp s core specialty diagnostics arm Notably  this is not the first time that LabCorp has partnered with Interpace  In fact  this latest agreement builds upon the original deal inked in 2016  The earlier contract enabled electronic ordering and result reporting via LabCorp for the Interpace s proprietary ThyGenX and ThyraMIR tests  The reports provided more specific diagnostic information about the presence of thyroid cancer in patients  whose initial biopsy fails to indicate if a thyroid nodule is malignant or benign Under the new agreement  Dianon Pathology   a member of the LabCorp Specialty Testing Group   will perform the thyroid biopsy analysis  If the result is indeterminate  then Interpace will perform the molecular tests  This apart  doctors can order an automatic reflex to Interpace s tests from Dianon in the event of an indefinite biopsy assessment  In either case  Dianon will automatically refer those samples to Interpace to perform the company s proprietary assays  ThyGenX and ThyraMIR It is important to note that LabCorp works hard on new innovations with academic institutions as part of its three key strategic plans to capture the growing lab testing market through advanced assays and tools In Diagnostics  the company successfully continues to provide foundation for new collaborations with health systems  large physician groups and managed care partners   It constantly increases its scale and competency levels in clinical laboratory medicine by resorting to acquisitions ranging from routine capabilities to highly esoteric testing Among the company s other recent tie ups  worth mentioning are its two major health systems partnerships namely Mount Sinai Health System and PAML  a Pacific Northwest based market leading reference and outreach laboratory Per LabCorp  these anchor health systems will gradually become research hubs  improving access to trials as well as Covance s site activation and investigator and patient recruitment capabilities LabCorp has also created ample growth opportunities for women s health with medical drug monitoring  genetics and oncology testing as well as effected critical collaborations such as Walgreens and 23andMe  Also  its partnerships with Mount Sinai and PAML s former owners  Providence and Catholic Health  continue to expand Additionally  LabCorp expects the above three transactions to benefit from full year ownership and growth to generate approximately  500 million in incremental profitable revenues for 2018 Share Price Performance Over the past three months  shares of LabCorp have outperformed its   The stock has gained 6 1  compared with the industry s growth of 0 1  Zacks Rank   Key PicksLabCorp carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Two better ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Bio Rad Laboratories   NYSE BIO   and PerkinElmer   NYSE PKI   Bio Rad Laboratories sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see The company has a long term expected earnings growth rate of 20  PerkinElmer has a long term expected earnings growth rate of 12 3   The stock carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as the  1 stock to buy according to Zacks research It s not the one you think ,2018-03-20,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/labcorp--interpace-team-up-drive-specialty-diagnostics-200299717,200299717
9669,231184,LH,Is Laboratory Corporation  LH  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings   NYSE LH   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Laboratory Corporation has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 17 3  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 20 9  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Laboratory Corporation s current PE ratio slightly above its midpoint  which is 15 7  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 18 9  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Laboratory Corporation has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 14 7  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Laboratory Corporation s stock in the near term too    P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Laboratory Corporation has a P S ratio of about 1 7  This is significantly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 4 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is slightly below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms    Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Laboratory Corporation currently has a Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes LH a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Laboratory Corporation is just 1 4  a level that is slightly lower than the industry average of 1 8  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 11 3  which is somewhat better than the industry average of 12 4  Clearly  LH is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Laboratory Corporation might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of A and a Momentum score of B  This gives LH a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current quarter has seen nine estimates go higher in the past sixty days  compared to none lower  while the full year estimate has seen eleven upward and one downward revisions in the same time period This has had a favorable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen about 8 2  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has improved nearly 9 1   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Price and Consensus    The stock holds a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which indicates expectations of in line performance from the company in the near term  However  Laboratory Corporation is enjoying bullish analyst sentiment  as indicated by the positive estimate revisions  and this works in the company s favor Bottom LineLaboratory Corporation is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  bottom 17  out of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past one year  the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below Despite positive estimate revision activity  investors should wait for broader factors and industry trends to turn around first   When they do  this stock could be a compelling value pick Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana Ignited by new referendums and legislation  this

9708,231223,LH,What s In The Cards For LabCorp  LH  This Earnings Season ,opinion,"Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings   NYSE LH    also known as LabCorp  is slated to report third quarter 2017 results  before market opens on Oct 25  Last quarter  the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3 8   It has an average earnings beat of 1 1  for three of the trailing four quarters  Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors at Play
LabCorp s top line performance continues to be affected by softness in its Covance Drug Development business  as was the case in the last reported quarter as well  The weak performance was led by sluggish early development and central lab businesses  which were affected by a slower revenue conversion from backlog and cancellation by sponsors of two large clinical studies in 2016  Also  adverse foreign exchange rates affected the numbers to the tune of 140 basis points  bps  at this segment 
Meanwhile  we are upbeat about the company s expectations of an improvement in the Covance Drug Development arm starting the second half of 2017  This should get reflected in the third quarter performance 
Over the last two years  LabCorp has faced several reimbursement issues that have dented its revenues  The company is concerned about the CMS  Centers for Medicare   Medicaid Services  proposal related to Protecting Access to Medicare Act  PAMA   We believe reimbursement pressure will affect the company s performance in the soon to be reported quarter as well 
Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Price and EPS Surprise
 
 
   Notably  the company are not positive about the latest Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  CMS  publication of proposed 2018 Medicare reimbursement rates for clinical laboratory tests under the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule  CLFS   However  this will most likely have no impact on its third quarter results 
Unfavorable foreign exchange continues to be a pressing concern for the company  Previously  LabCorp had anticipated an approximate 40 bps negative currency impact on 2017 revenues  The company currently expects a 20 bps impact from adverse foreign exchange on net revenue at Covance Drug Development in 2017 
LabCorp has been continuously grappling with the issue of rising operating expenses which has affected its margins in the last reported quarter  Also  the chances of a turnaround in the scenario any time soon are slim 
Meanwhile  on a positive note  LabCorp is focusing on research and development in collaboration with academic institutions in order to gain traction in the growing lab testing market  In July 2017  LabCorp launched ADAMTS13 test to distinguish diseases characterized by life threatening  acute thrombotic microangiopathy  TMA   Also  in May  company expanded its VistaSeq Hereditary Cancer portfolio through the addition of 10 new test panels with focus on the risk of specific hereditary cancer syndromes 
LabCorp recently teamed up with Walgreens Boots Alliance  Inc    NASDAQ WBA   to set up specimen collection service stations at various Walgreens stores across the United States  The company also expanded its reach by closing the acquisition of Mount Sinai Health System Clinical Outreach Laboratories in May 2017  LabCorp s highly differentiated portfolio will be used by the existing customers of Mount Sinai  These developments are expected to boost the top line in the third quarter 
LabCorp s companion diagnostics portfolio  which grew a robust 35  in the last couple of years  should maintain its momentum in 2017 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that LabCorp is likely to beat earnings this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here  as you will see below 
Zacks ESP   LabCorp has an Earnings ESP of  1 84   This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at  2 35 and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at  2 40  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Zacks Rank  LabCorp has a Zacks Rank  2 which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a positive earnings surprise 
Stocks Worth a Look
Here are a few medical stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter 
The Cooper Companies  Inc    NYSE COO   has an Earnings ESP of  0 43  and a Zacks Rank  2  You can see  
Henry Schein  Inc    NASDAQ HSIC   has an Earnings ESP of  0 67  and a Zacks Rank  3

9725,231240,LH,Should Value Investors Pick Laboratory Corporation  LH  Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings   NYSE LH   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Laboratory Corporation has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 16 6  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 20 5  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Laboratory Corporation s current PE ratio slightly above its midpoint  which is 15 3  over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 19 5  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Laboratory Corporation has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 15 7  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Laboratory Corporation s stock in the near term too   P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Laboratory Corporation has a P S ratio of about 1 6  This is substantially lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 2 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is slightly below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Laboratory Corporation currently has a Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes LH a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Laboratory Corporation is just 1 7  a level that is noticeably lower than the industry average of 2 2  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 10 9  which is somewhat better than the industry average of 12 8  Clearly  LH is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Laboratory Corporation might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of B and a Momentum score of B  This gives LH a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen three estimates go higher in the past sixty days and four lower  while the full year estimate has seen ten upward and two downward revisions in the same time period This has had a noticeable impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has fallen about 1 2  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched up 0 2   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Price and Consensus    This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineLaboratory Corporation is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  However  with a sluggish industry rank  bottom 32  out of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past one year  the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates  analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn favorable in this name first  but once that happen  this stock could be a compelling pick Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest Strategies It s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  18 8  from 2016   Q1 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  157 0    128 0    97 8    94 7   and  90 2  respectively And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon  Over the years it has been remarkably consistent  From 2000   Q1 2017  the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over  Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we re

9727,231242,LH,5 MedTech Momentum Picks Investors Will Love,opinion,The MedTech space received a sudden jolt on late night Thursday when White House pulled the plug on Obamacare subsidies that reduce health care costs for Americans with low incomes  This comes as no surprise for the lukewarm response to its replacement  The American Health Care Act  AHCA   has forced Republicans to continue to seek new avenues  In a bid to save its face  the Trump administration attempted a  skinny  repeal bill along with a Graham Cassidy bill  which failed to make any headway in the senate We believe that the impasse is slated to continue as President Trump has always been an outspoken critic of the ACA  Our apprehension comes from the uncertainty regarding the outcome of a slew of events  This includes the possibility of a rate hike by the Fed  a stronger dollar  and the stance of healthcare insurance companies over ACA  These are expected to spark bouts of volatility As of now  plenty of speculation has been made regarding the extent of interest rate hike by the Fed before the end of the year  Though  the Federal Reserve officials remained largely divided over raising interest rates  majority of the bankers vouched in favor of raising rates  The ones debating against increasing rates stated that hiking rates at a time when inflation is lower than the target of 2    an indication of a healthy economy   might cause major setbacks to the U S  economy  However  investors may also feel that  even if Fed decides to increase rate  it will hardly have any impact over the long term Nevertheless  it would be foolish to claim that volatility has vanished from the market  just because the global market has started to recover since yesterday  No doubt  such market uncertainty has made investors increasingly cautious about spending on stocks Interestingly in this phase of massive global sell offs  the MedTech sector has not only held its own  but also maintained a stable uptrend  This is based on some of its powerful long term tailwinds  including mergers   acquisitions  emerging market expansion  positive demographic trends and innovation of new products In fact a closer look at this sector s history will reveal the companies  undaunting spirit to expand their business whatever the market scenario is  Despite political conundrum over Obamacare  we have witnessed some big cross border mergers in recent times like the impending take over of C R  Bard Inc   NYSE BCR   by Becton  Dickinson and Company   NYSE BDX   What s the Rewarding Strategy   We believe investors can earn handsome profits by extrapolating the current bullish trends of the market into the future  Henceforth  seeking refuge in momentum investment strategy is a strategic investment gamble at this moment However  picking the right momentum stocks may baffle seasoned investors  let alone the new ones  who are planning to enter the uncharted world of jam packed trades Here  at Zacks  we use our  to single out stocks which can aid in beating the market The Zacks  indicates when the timing is best to grab a stock and take advantage of its momentum with the highest

   Further  the company expects drug price inflation  product launches and higher utilization to fuel growth  We expect the Pharmacy Services segment to be a stable growth platform 
CVS Health also projects better than expected performance in the to be reported quarter primarily on the back ofscript utilization at retail  The company has projected a 1 5 3 25  rise in consolidated net revenues for the first quarter 
Further  a strong flu season has led to the improved outlook  Overall  for the first quarter of 2018  the company expects to register adjusted operating profit growth in the range of 0 5  to 4 5   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues of  45 82 billion reflects a 2 9  increase year over year 
Although CVS Health s Retail LTC business registered revenue growth after several quarters of a slump in the last reported quarter  there are multiple factors raising concerns  Firstly  the year over year growth was just a marginal 0 3  
Further  continued reimbursement pressure  increasing generic dispensing rate andrecent generic drug introductions have been affecting the business  This apart  marketplace changes that kept CVS Pharmacy from participating in certain networks had a 320 basis point negative impact on same store prescription volumes in the previously reported quarter 
However  CVS Health has been striving to return to growth in the Retail LTC business  Management claims that the company is focused on working with all payers to drive volumes and capture market share  CVS Health is also poised to gain from programs such as Health Tag and ExtraCare Health Card 
The company also expects to witness revenue growth of 4  to 5 5  and operating profit growth in the low to mid single digits range  within the Retail LTC business

average beat being 7 3  Let s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement Key Catalysts IDEXX is expected to continue with its gain momentum in the first quarter  courtesy of a strong global rise in Companion Animal Group  CAG  Diagnostics  revenues  Last time  this upside was driven by consistent strong double digit growth in reference labs and consumables plus owing to a high single digit increase registered in rapid assay sales  Management vouches for this trend to be retained further IDEXX Laboratories  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    We are also upbeat about IDEXX enhancing its commercial capabilities in the United States to maintain recurring revenue growth at CAG Diagnostics  We expect first quarter results to reflect a rise in productivity as new sales representatives establish fresh customer relationships  Also  we anticipate the company to report exceptional customer retention rates for reference labs as well as instrument consumables in the United States and worldwide The Zacks Consensus Estimate of  460 million for CAG Diagnostics revenues represents a 5 9  improvement from the last reported quarter Notably  IDEXX s 13 14 5  revenue growth projection for the quarter to be reported  highlights its organic gains of 9 5 10 5   Overall  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the total quarterly revenues is pegged at  525 million  Other factors predicted to influence IDEXX s first quarter results are We pin considerable hopes on progress in the Water Business  lying on a growth trajectory of late  backed by encouraging test results in the United States as well as benefits drawn from the global go direct initiatives  Moreover  the business witnessed 16  organic growth last quarter  Management also eyes gains from two favorable regulatory developments pertaining to wastewater in the United States and drinking water in Europe  The company earlier stated that it is perfectly on track for a continued high single digit organic revenue boost in this business through 2018  The consensus mark for Water revenues stands at  28 3 million for the yet to be reported quarter IDEXX carries on to expand its global footprint  It has been significantly drawing advantages from the bountiful opportunities in the emerging companion animal diagnostics markets  Further  management s consistent share buybacks underscores its robust free cash flow reserve  We believe the outcome of these endeavors will bear reflection on first quarter conference call On the flip side  foreign currency fluctuation is a major headwind  Another concern is the company s heavy reliance on third party distributors  The purchasing dynamics of distributors leave a significant impact on the company s sales of instrument consumables as well as its rapid assay products  Moreover  IDEXX has been witnessing a rise in operating expenses due to increased head count along with higher investments in portfolio development and expansion in the United States plus internationally Additionally  a competitive landscape in the domestic and overseas markets weighs on IDEXX s performance  Thus  the struggle to gain market traction might be a drag on first

Revenues for the first quarter increased 18  year over year to  2 85 billion  The top line exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 78 billion  The year over year rise in revenues was owing to 13 4  growth from acquisitions  organic growth of 3 2  and a benefit of approximately 150 basis points from foreign currency translation 
Quarter Under Review
LabCorp reports under two operating segments  LabCorp Diagnostics and Covance Drug Development 
In the reported quarter  LabCorp Diagnostics reported revenues of  1 77 billion  up 8  year over year  fueled by tuck in acquisitions  organic volume  measured by requisitions  and a gain from foreign currency translation of roughly 30 basis points  This was partially offset by lower Medicare reimbursement as a result of the implementation of the Protecting Access to Medicare Act  PAMA  and the impact from adverse weather Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

   The company reported a 6 9  rise in total volume  measured by requisition  and a 0 7  increase in revenue per requisition in the concerning quarter 
Covance Drug Development reported a 39 3  rise in revenues to  1 08 billion in the first quarter  This upside was primarily on the back of acquisitions  organic growth and the foreign currency translation benefit of nearly 390 basis points 
Gross margin deteriorated 211 bps to 27 3  in the reported quarter  Adjusted operating income was up 3 3  year over year to  382 million  However  adjusted operating margin contracted 190 bps from the year ago quarter to 13 4  on a 16 3  rise in selling  general and administrative expenses to  397 million 
LabCorp exited the first quarter of 2018 with cash and cash equivalents of  361 8 million compared with  316 7 million at the end of 2017  Operating cash flow at the end of the first quarter was  154 7 million  down 31 5  from  225 9 million in the year ago period  Free cash flow came in at  82 8 million in this period  down 46 5  from the year ago period

Outlook
LabCorp has updated its 2018 guidance considering the adoption of ASC 606 
Revenue growth is expected to remain in the band of 10 12  from 2017  earlier projected band was 9 5 11 5   including a likely improvement of 90 bps  from projection of 60 bps improvement earlier  from a foreign currency translation  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current year revenues is pegged at  11 48 billion 
Adjusted EPS projection for 2018 however  has been kept unchanged in the range of  11 30  11 70  However  this guidance now includes the projected negative impact of 20 cents to 30 cents for the full year 2018 from ASC 606  offset by strong first quarter results and an improved outlook for the remainder of the year  The consensus mark of  11 55 for the metric falls within the guided range 
Free cash flow has been anticipated within  1 1  1 2 billion  growth in the band of 0 9 1  from the prior year  unchanged  
Our Take
LabCorp posted a strong first quarter performance with adjusted earnings and revenues both exceeding the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate  Strong year over year growth in both earnings and revenues were encouraging  LabCorp Diagnostics business was solid on the back of increasing acquisitions  organic volume expansion and a favorable foreign exchange scenario 
Also  after several quarters of dull performance  Covance Drug Development has been reporting sturdy growth over the past few of terms  This uptrend was primarily owing to strategic acquisitions  robust organic growth and a positive foreign currency translation  The 2018 guidance also looks promising 
We believe that with the integration of newer acquisitions  LabCorp is perfectly positioned to drive long term profitable growth through a combination of world class diagnostics  drug development expertise and knowledge services

LabCorp s shares have been consistently trading below the Zacks classified  industry mark since last month  following an unimpressive first quarter 2017 result  The company lost 1 8   compared to a 4 6  gain for the broader industry 

While LabCorp s diagnostics business was strong  its Covance Drug Development provided dull numbers  dampening the overall top line performance  The company s statistics reveal slower revenue conversion from backlog and cancellation of two large clinical studies by sponsors in 2016 to impact the result  This apart  unfavorable foreign exchange remains a drag over the recent past  The reduced guidance for 2017 also fails to indicate chances of respite anytime soon 
There is also apprehension about the tough reimbursement scenario the company is currently going through  During 2016  approximately 12 3  of LabCorp Diagnostics  revenue was reimbursed under the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule  CLFS  and approximately 0 8  was reimbursed under the Physician Fee Schedule  PFS   With changes in government regulations in 2017 and the probability of future net reduction in reimbursement revenue  we expect the scenario to get tougher for LabCorp over time 
Per management  the company has been able to positively compete in a growing addressable market  worth approximately  200 billion  It is expected that the combined revenue growth from a broader platform  increased scale and synergies along with strategic deployment of cash flow will create significant long term shareholders  value 
LabCorp continues to flourish with complementary capabilities via meaningful acquisitions  Management believes that the recent buyout of Sequenom will boost the company s women s health test menu  The inclusion is assumed to expand the company s geographic reach  both domestically and internationally

LabCorp carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   Some better ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Luminex Corporation   NASDAQ LMNX    Inogen  Inc    NASDAQ INGN   and Edwards Lifesciences Corporation   NYSE EW    Both Luminex and Inogen sport a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   while Edwards Lifesciences carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see 
Luminex has an expected long term adjusted earnings growth of almost 16 3   The stock added roughly 8 9  over the last three months 
Inogen has a long term expected earnings growth rate of 17 5   The stock has a solid one year return of roughly 84 2  
Edwards Lifesciences has a long term expected earnings growth rate of 15 2   The stock has roughly added 22  over last three months

Solid Revenue and Profit Growth  NOPAT 
Over the past decade  ICLR has grown after tax profit    by 22  compounded annually to  283 million in 2016  Revenues increased 14  compounded annually to  1 7 billion over the same period  while NOPAT margin increased to 17  in 2016 from 9  in 2006 
Over the past three years  revenue growth has moderated to 8  compounded annually  NOPAT growth  however  accelerated to 37  compounded annually due to more significant profit margin expansion  NOPAT margin increases averaged  3  per year over the last three years compared to the ten year average of  1  per year  The NOPAT margin trend largely reflects prior year investments paying off through operating leverage  as well as the effective implementation of process optimization initiatives

In addition to impressive revenue and NOPAT growth  free cash flow    generation has increased as well  Over the past five years  ICLR has generated  370 million of cumulative free cash flow  9  of current market cap  2016 FCF of  136 million increased from  18 million in 2012 and represented nearly 40  of the five year total  ICLR s current 3   is in line with the average S P 500 stock

Improving ROIC Correlated with Increasing Shareholder Value
Per Figure 3  ROIC explains 76  of the valuation difference between ICLR and a peer group of twelve medical laboratory and research companies  Despite ICLR s 22  ROIC  almost three times the peer median  the stock trades at a discount as shown by its position below the trend line in Figure 3  If ICLR traded at parity with the group  it would be  125 share   39  above the current price  Given ICLR s well above average ROIC  one would think the stock would garner a premium valuation

Leading Profitability Reflects Competitive Advantages
The development process for a single new drug takes 10 15 years and can cost  2 6 billion  according to a  Accelerating the process by even a few months can help reduce costs and deliver additional revenue  Given this economic incentive  biopharmaceutical firms are increasingly outsourcing the R D process to CROs  which do it more efficiently due to specialization and focus  The global CRO market was valued at roughly  25 billion in 2015  has experienced double digit growth over the past decade and is projected to grow 8  annually to  45 billion by 2022  The market is highly concentrated with the top 10 firms controlling over 75  of the market 
Based on TTM data of public firms  ICLR is the fifth largest CRO with  1 7 billion of revenue behind Quintiles Transnational Holdings Inc  NYSE Q    7 7 billion   Laboratory Corporation of America  NYSE LH     9 7 billion   PAREXEL  NASDAQ PRXL   2 4 billion  and Charles River Laboratories  NYSE CRL    1 8 billion   These firms compete on the basis of their capabilities  brand reputation and price 
ICLR offers the full suite of planning  execution and analysis for Phase I to IV trials of the multi national  several thousand patient variety  Most importantly  CROs need a long and successful track record for bio pharma firms to entrust them with a potential multi billion dollar asset  ICLR s solid brand reputation is reflected in the 27 year relationship with Pfizer  NYSE PFE   its largest client 
Per Figure 4  below  ICLR s trailing twelve month  TTM  gross margin of 42  is below the CRO peer group of 53   This makes ICLR s 20  pre tax operating profit margin    even more impressive when compared against CRO peers at 13   reflecting a lean cost structure and better operational efficiency  We utilized NOPBT margin for operational efficiency comparisons given that being domiciled in Ireland represents a clear tax advantage for ICLR  These operational and tax advantages should result in ICLR being better able to absorb competitive pricing pressure or demand swings  while at the same time providing more flexibility to invest for the future without sacrificing its ROIC advantage

Bear Case Risks  Bio Pharma R D Budgets  Customer Concentration
Historically  the main risk to ICLR profitability has been demand swings caused by changes in R D spending rates among global bio pharma firms  This risk was apparent during the 2009 2011 timeframe  when ICLR s revenue growth slowed to 3  compounded annually while continued investment in the firm caused profitability to contract  We think the risk to ICLR s profitability from a global R D slowdown is lower today for several reasons  1  the trends towards R D outsourcing and strategic CRO partnerships were less established  2  ICLR was more dependent on  project by project  vs  long term contracted revenue  and 3  ICLR does not require the same level of investment as before 
Another risk cited against ICLR is customer concentration  ICLR s Top 25 clients accounted for 75  of revenue in 2016  with Pfizer  PFE  accounting for 26   We think the Pfizer  PFE  risk is mitigated by the relationship s 27 year history and a recently renewed 5  to 7 year contract  Further  the company expects to reduce PFE s revenue concentration to 15 17  during 2017  Generating positive revenue growth in 2017   3  consensus  while meaningfully reducing single customer risk would be a long term positive 
Valuation Implies Low Profit Growth Expectations
At the current price of  90 share  ICLR has a price to economic book value ratio    of 1 1  This ratio means the market expects ICLR s NOPAT to grow no more than 10  over the remainder of its corporate life  This expectation seems overly pessimistic for a company that has grown NOPAT by 22  compounded annually over the past decade and whose industry is projected to grow at least 8  annually through 2022 
If ICLR can maintain NOPAT margins of at least 15   below TTM margins of 17   and   the stock is worth  107 today   19  above the current price  This scenario assumes ICLR will grow revenues by consensus in 2017  3   and 2018  5   and 4  compounded annually thereafter  For reference  ICLR has grown revenue  compounded annually  by 8   12  and 14   respectively  over the past three  five and ten year periods 
No Dividend  But Buybacks Yield 6 
Dividends are uncommon among medical laboratory  research stocks and non existent among CROs  Achieving growth rather than becoming a cash cow is the focus of these firms given the market opportunity 
ICLR has had an active repurchase program for the past two years  The company has spent  570 million repurchasing 6 3 million shares  a 10  reduction in outstanding shares  The company had  290 million remaining under its authorization as of its last public filing  12 31 16   The remaining repurchase authorization equates to 3 4 million shares at current prices  6  of outstanding  and 6  of the current market cap  Such repurchase activity would provide a potential buyback yield of 6  if the remaining authorization was executed between now and 12 31 17 
Potential Catalysts  Strategic Partnerships  Acquisitions  Margin Expansion
Strategic partnerships between bio pharma firms and CROs represent an important  emerging trend  Roughly half of all bio pharma firms have entered into such partnerships with a small number of  preferred providers   usually between 1 5 CROs  This trend is expected to drive M A consolidation  bolster the competitive position of market leaders and result in more long term contracted revenue and less  project by project  revenue for CROs  ICLR is well positioned to benefit from this trend due to its strong brand reputation 
The industry s high regulatory burden and high capital investment requirements represent significant barriers to entry and an operational challenge to smaller firms  During 2007 2012  an estimated 45  of small  and mid sized CRO s were acquired or shut down  making small acquisitions and asset purchases by larger firms common  Management has indicated the company will continue to pursue small  synergistic acquisitions supported by cash flows  i e  cash and debt vs  equity issuance   a strategy that appears to have benefited shareholders over the last five years given ICLR s increasing ROIC 
We think ICLR remains positioned to grow revenue faster than expenses given the ongoing maturation of past investments and the likelihood that ICLR will continue to win its share of new business coming from increased outsourcing  Biopharma firms spent an estimated  145 billion on R D in 2016  while the CRO viable portion is estimated at  75 billion  The actual 2016 CRO market approximated  30 billion while the TTM revenue of the five largest publicly traded CROs  per Figure 4  was approximately  23 billion  With over half of the viable market currently unaddressed by CROs  the growth outlook for strong brands looks bright 
We are comfortable assuming that a combination of the three factors outlined above will drive revenue and profit growth above the low expectations currently embedded in the valuation  resulting in a favorable risk reward trade off 
Executive Comp Likely Could be More Shareholder Aligned
As a  foreign private issuer   ICLR is not required to provide a  say on pay  shareholder resolution in the annual proxy statement and details on incentive targets are unavailable  The most recent annual report indicated executive comp is targeted based on other healthcare bio pharma CRO firms of similar market cap  adjusted for individual performance  experience and level of responsibility  This plan could be better aligned with shareholders by tying management compensation directly to ROIC 
We know from Figure 3 above  and   that ROIC is   Use of ROIC to measure performance ensures executives  interests are aligned with shareholder s interests  In the case of ICLR  there has been no profiting from misleading metrics while shareholder value is destroyed  Over the past 10 years   have grown from  13 million to  212 million  32  annually   a clear indication of shareholder value creation 
Insider Trading and Short Interest
There is little insight to be gained from recent insiders or short seller trends  Insiders own 4 0  of the company but have not engaged in any material insider buying or selling over the past 90 days  There are currently 2 2 million shares sold short equating to 4  of shares outstanding and 4 days to cover  Short interest is up 12   roughly 235 000 shares  since year end but is only up 8   162 000 shares  from a year ago

9750,231265,LH,LabCorp  LH  Q2 Earnings  Is Disappointment In The Cards ,opinion,"Laboratory Corp  of America Holdings   NYSE LH    or LabCorp  is scheduled to report second quarter 2017 results before the market opens on Jul 26 
Last quarter  the company reported a positive earnings surprise of 1 37  with an average beat of 0 36  for the trailing four quarters  Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement 
Factors at Play 
The last reported first quarter 2017 dented LabCorp s overall top line performance  heavily on dull numbers registered in Covance Drug Development business  This was due to sluggish early development and central lab businesses  affected by a slower revenue conversion from backlog and cancellation by sponsors of two large clinical studies in 2016 Abbott Laboratories  NYSE ABT  Price and EPS Surprise

   Right now  although the company is trying to execute its strategy to focus more on higher value therapeutic areas such as oncology and CNS  central nervous system  disorders  this procedure is tied to complex studies which will take time to generate revenue  We believe  the Covance Drug Development will continue to remain a drag for LabCorp s overall business 
Earlier  the company noted that from a timing perspective  both Covance Drug Development s revenue and margins will be down on a year over year basis in the second quarter of 2017  before showing favorable growth in the second half of 2017 
This apart  unfavorable foreign exchange remains a bother  Previously  the company viewed that it expects an impact of approximately 40 basis points of negative currency on 2017 revenues  Covance Drug Development s net revenue is estimated to feel the impact of approximately 130 basis points of negative currency while the LabCorp Diagnostics segment will be affected approximately 10 basis points of negative currency in 2017  This should be reflected in the numbers of the quarter yet to be reported We are also highly disappointed with the CMS proposal related to the Protecting Access to Medicare Act 
On a positive note  we are upbeat about the company s ongoing cost reduction initiatives related to project LaunchPad  which currently has over 100 projects at various stages of implementation  Recently  the company has expanded the LaunchPad initiative to now include Covance Drug Development  This initiative will be a three year program for Covance that consists of two phases  The company has already initiated the first phase to  right size  Covance Drug Development s resources  primarily head count and facility footprint 
This phase is projected to generate pre tax savings of approximately  20 million in 2017 and approximately  45 million on an annualized basis thereafter  The pre tax cost to achieve these savings is estimated to be approximately  30 million in 2017  of which  around  20 million is presumed to be cash expenditures This should get reflected in the second quarter results as well 
The company s companion diagnostics portfolio  which grew a robust 35  in the last couple of years  should also maintain its momentum in 2017  Notably  within immuno oncology drug development  it doubled the number of study awards from 2015 to 2016 and also performed a number of PD L1 tests through Diagnostic and Drug Development segments 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that LabCorp is likely to beat on earnings this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here  as you will see below 
Zacks ESP   LabCorp has an Earnings ESP of 0 00   This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at  2 38  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Zacks Rank  LabCorp has a Zacks Rank  4 which lowers the predictive power of ESP  Note that we caution against the Sell rated stocks   4 or 5  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Stocks to Consider
Here are a few companies you may want to consider  as our proven model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter   
Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc    NYSE TMO   has an Earnings ESP of  0 44  and a Zacks Rank  2  You can see  
Dextera Surgical Inc    NASDAQ DXTR   has an Earnings ESP of  9 09  and a Zacks Rank  2 
Telefex Inc    NYSE TFX   has an Earnings ESP of  1 06  and a Zacks Rank  2

billion Strong growth in LabCorp Diagnostics  solid acquisition related growth as well as organic volume growth contributed to the year over year top line improvement  However  this was partially offset by poor show in Covance Drug Development  Also  while adverse foreign exchange movement hampered the quarterly top line number to the tune of 60 basis points  bps   the year over year comparison to a Leap Year and the timing of the Easter holiday hindered the reported quarter s growth by 1  Organic revenue growth  net revenue growth minus revenue from acquisitions excluding the

Diagnostics and Covance Drug Development In the reported quarter  LabCorp Diagnostics reported net revenue of  1 80 billion  up 8 4  year over year  fueled by price  mix  tuck in acquisitions and organic volume  measured by requisitions excluding requisitions from acquisitions for the first 12 months after the close of each acquisition   The company reported 5  increase in total volume  measured by requisition  and a 3 6  increase in revenue per requisition in the quarter Covance Drug Development reported a 3 1  drop in net revenue to  699 7 million in the second quarter  This was due to the impact of cancellation by sponsors of two large clinical studies in late 2016   for which  Covance Drug Development used to provide central laboratory services   and a negative impact of 140 bps from foreign currency translation  At Constant Exchange Rate  CER   net revenue declined 1 7  year over year Gross margin contracted 22 bps to 34 5  in the quarter  Adjusted operating income

share repurchases and currently has  489 5 million of authorization  remaining under its existing share repurchase plan OutlookDespite a dull show within Covance Drug Development  the company increased its earlier provided 2017 outlook Net revenue growth is now expected to remain in the band of 5 6 5  year over year  ahead of the earlier range of 3 5 5 5   This includes a 10 bps impact  earlier the projection was 40 bps impact  from an unfavorable foreign exchange headwind  The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at  9 86 billion Adjusted EPS guidance for 2017 has also been increased to the range of  9 30  9 65  previous range   9 20  9 60   The current Zacks Consensus Estimate of  9 42 falls within the guided range However  free cash flow expectation remains unchanged in the band of  925  975 million  up 3 9  from the prior year  Our TakeLabCorp posted a better than expected quarter with second quarter earnings and revenues  both topping the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate  While LabCorp Diagnostics business was strong  Covance Drug Development provided dull numbers  Per the company  the impact of the cancellation by sponsors of two large clinical studies in late 2016 affected the results  This apart  an unfavorable foreign exchange continues to hamper the company s overall results  However  an increased guidance for 2017 boosts investors  confidence indicating chances of respite anytime soon Nonetheless  we believe that with the integration of newer acquisitions  LabCorp is perfectly positioned to drive long term profitable

9765,231280,LH,LabCorp s Takeover Of Sequenom Wins Antitrust Clearance,opinion,"Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings   NYSE LH   or LabCorp recently got the antitrust review clearance for its previously announced acquisition of Sequenom  Inc    NASDAQ SQNM    a major player in the field of non invasive prenatal testing  NIPT  for reproductive health  According to the company  the waiting period under the HSR Act  Hart Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976  has just got over fulfilling one of the essential criterias for the completion of this impending buyout 
Notably  following the takeover announcement  LabCorp formed an acquisition subsidiary  Savoy Acquisition Corp  which had commenced a tender offer on Aug 9  2016 to purchase all outstanding shares of Sequenom for  2 40 per share  This tender offer will expire on Sep 7  2016 unless extended further 
The deal was inked for an equity value of  302 million representing total enterprise value of  371 million  The acquisition is expected to get completed by the end of 2016 and is still subject to other customary closing conditions 
According to LabCorp  this buyout will be a strategic fit for the company  business as Sequenom s NIPT and genetic testing capabilities will further advance LabCorp s extensive women s health test menu  The inclusion will also increase LabCorp s geographic reach both domestically and internationally  particularly EU and the Asia Pacific region  
We take a note that  traditionally  LabCorp has successfully outgrown itself through organic means like acquisitions and alliances  With the momentous buyout of Covance  LabCorp is vigorously trying to expand the company s range of diagnostic offerings and create a new industry leader in both laboratory testing and CRO spaces  At the same time act as a leading provider of medical testing  besides operating as a premier full service drug development organization 
Apart from huge buyouts like Covance  LabCorp continues to add complementary capabilities through targeted tuck in acquisitions  the latest in the league being Sequenom  Besides  in Mar 2016  the company acquired full service independent women s health laboratory  Pathology  Inc   including the patient service centers used to conduct the latter s medical testing and services business 
Prior to that  in October  it had bought Safe Foods International Holdings  a food safety laboratory  the inclusion of which extended LabCorp s size and reach in the fast growing global food safety market  All these acquisitions are consistent with the company s effort to reinforce its foothold in the personalized diagnostics testing market

9784,231299,LH,What Awaits Boston Scientific  BSX  In Q2 Earnings ,opinion,"Boston Scientific Corporation   NYSE BSX   is scheduled to report its second quarter 2016 results before the opening bell on Jul 28  Last quarter  the company had posted a positive earnings surprise of 16 67   The four quarter trailing average beat is pegged at 7 45   Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement 
Factors at Play
Pricing pressure has continued for Boston Scientific over the past several quarters  The last reported first quarter s adjusted gross margin was significantly impacted by the pricing headwind  However  on an encouraging note  the company anticipates this headwind reversing gradually on the back of improved price management  primarily through market segmentation  tiered offerings and standard cost reduction programs  This benefit is likely to be reflected in the second quarter 
With regard to adjusted operating margin  Boston Scientific s seven successive quarters of improvement and a raised operating margin guidance have encouraged us to expect another quarter of strong sequential growth with more noticeable improvement in the Rhythm Management segment 
Moreover  the plant network optimization program completed at the end of 2015  transferred a portion of the company s EP manufacturing to lower cost locations  is expected to contribute to the adjusted operating margin improvement BOSTON SCIENTIF Price and EPS Surprise
   We are also optimistic about the company s gradually improving performance in Interventional Cardiology  led by an innovative portfolio and robust commercial teams globally  The company is consistently gaining share in a number of cardiovascular segments and DES  as a differentiated platform of premier and synergy  continues to build momentum and gain share globally 
Meanwhile  MedSurg is expected to demonstrate consistent performance  led by endoscopy  Urology and Women s Health are also estimated to grow beyond market levels driven by investment strategies in key international geographies 
However  Boston Scientific facing severe currency headwinds over the recent past  remains a concern  We note that  with the company recording 47  of its sales from the international market  it remains highly exposed to currency fluctuations  In the first quarter of 2015  foreign exchange headwind affected the company s adjusted earnings by 10 cents a share 
Considering this impact  for 2016  Boston Scientific expects currency headwinds to the tune of approximately  100 million on revenues or  0 05  0 06 per share on adjusted earnings relative to the year ago quarter 
Further  sluggish CRM sales over the recent past continue to weigh on the stock  At the beginning of 2015  Boston Scientific predicted a slowdown in worldwide CRM sales for the entire year due to replacement cycle headwinds and competitive launches in the U S  Although the company is currently expecting a rebound in its CRM performance in the second quarter and second half 2016  we remain on the sidelines based on the challenges the company is still facing in this business  especially in the U S 
On an overall basis  Boston Scientific has provided its second quarter 2016 guidance  The company projects adjusted earnings in the band of 25 27 cents per share on revenues of  2 01  2 06 billion 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Boston Scientific is likely to beat earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here  as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Boston Scientific s Earnings ESP is 0 00   since both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 27 cents 
Zacks Rank  Boston Scientific has a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  a breakeven ESP makes surprise prediction difficult 
Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions

9786,231301,LH,Will LabCorp  LH  Beat Earnings Estimates In Q2 ,opinion,"We expect Laboratory Corp  of America Holdings   NYSE LH    or LabCorp to beat expectations when it reports second quarter 2016 results before the opening bell on Jul 27  Last quarter  the company had reported a positive earnings surprise of 3 06  with the four quarter trailing average beat pegged at 1 38   Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement 
Why a Likely Positive Surprise 
Our proven model shows that LabCorp is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key components 
Zacks ESP  LabCorp s  is  0 87   since the Most Accurate estimate stands at  2 31 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at  2 29  A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise  
Zacks Rank  LabCorp currently has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank  1  2 or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates  Conversely  Sell rated stocks   4 or 5  should never be considered going into an earnings announcement 
The combination of LabCorp s Zacks Rank  2 and  0 87  ESP makes us reasonably confident of a positive earnings beat LABORATORY CP Price and EPS Surprise
    
What s Driving the Better than Expected Earnings 
The last year was marked by LabCorp as one of solid growth  driven by the successful execution of the company s three pronged strategy viz  delivering world class diagnostics  bringing innovative medicines to patients faster  and changing the way of patient care  The company strongly anticipates 2016 to be no different and the first quarter itself bears testimony to that fact
In the second quarter as well  we expect to see LabCorp gain from organic growth by introducing new tests to its existing as well as new customers  channels and markets  In this regard we note the nationwide launch of Zika virus testing using the RealStar Zika Virus RT PCR Kit U S  from altona Diagnostics GmbH  The test had received Emergency Use Authorization from the U S  Food and Drug Administration for the qualitative detection of Zika virus RNA in serum or urine  collected alongside a patient matched serum specimen  
Moreover  the recent launch of a new application for the companion diagnostic associated with the use of Tarceva for the treatment of patients with non small cell lung cancer is another significant addition to the company s world class test menu  We expect both these tests to help strengthen LabCorp s companion diagnostics testing business with solid return from the second quarter itself 
In the field of test menu expansion  we observed that  last year the company successfully introduced 75 new assays and accelerated next generation sequencing capabilities  Looking ahead we are encouraged by the company s potential scope for test menu enhancement and geographic footprint expansion 
Complimentary capabilities were enriched through targeted tuck in acquisitions  As a major improvement  the company s companion diagnostic franchise achieved double digit growth in 2015  and LabCorp is confident about delivering  100 million in incremental revenue in companion diagnostics through 2018 
In fact  the acquisition of Covance  which is operational under the label Covance Drug Development  is the primary reason for LabCorp s steep growth trend from last year  Earlier  LabCorp had set a goal of  150 million in incremental revenues by the end of 2018 
In the first quarter  the acquisition of Covance contributed  687 3 million to the company s revenue  driving 23 7  year over year growth  The company is currently on track to achieve the incremental revenue synergy target  Furthermore  LabCorp expects to achieve annual cost synergies in excess of  100 million to be fully realized within three years of closing  The company is currently working on reducing cost and improving customer experience  Project LaunchPad is an active part of this initiative

9787,231302,LH,Edwards Lifesciences  EW  Q2 Earnings  Will It Be A Miss ,opinion,"Edwards Lifesciences Corp    NYSE EW   is scheduled to report its second quarter 2016 earnings on Jul 26  after the closing bell 
Last quarter  the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 7 58   Encouragingly  Edwards  earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the past four quarters  with an average beat of 8 06   Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement 
Factors at Play
For the second quarter of 2016  Edwards expects total sales of  700  740 million and adjusted earnings per share  EPS  in the range of 67 73 cents  The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues and EPS are  722 million and 70 cents  respectively  which is within the company s guided range EDWARDS LIFESCI Price and EPS Surprise
    
For the entirety of second quarter  Edwards remained in the MedTech headlines  owing to the release of a handful of significant study results in favor of its transcatheter heart valves  THVs  
The company opened its account in early Apr 2016  with the successive release of two sets of data from the Partner II clinical trial  These data which demonstrated the superiority of Edwards  Sapien XT and Sapien 3 valves over open heart surgery in treating severe  symptomatic aortic stenosis  AS  patients  who were at intermediate risk for surgery 
In the next month  Edwards revealed positive data from the Source 3 Registry of its Sapien 3 THV  at the EuroPCR 2016  The trial outcome exhibited the highest ever reported survival rate and a low stroke rate for AS patients enrolled in the Source family of registries 
We believe that the outcome from the aforementioned study results emphasize the advantages of Edwards  Sapien family of valves for patients suffering from severe symptomatic AS  This  in turn  should lead to greater adoption of these valves  which will boost Edwards  THV business segment sales  We expect this to get reflected in the yet to be released second quarter results 
In the very same month  a federal jury returned a verdict in favor of Edwards  CardiAQ mitral valve platform  in a lawsuit filed against a former service provider  Neovasc  The jury also awarded damages of  70 million to Edwards for trade secret misappropriation  which is expected to get reflected in the company s second quarter s operating results 
On the flip side  as per management s estimate Edwards grew at a slower rate compared to its peers in the recent past  owing to market share decrease as competitors continue to expand their product offerings  With other major players effectively competing to capture larger shares in the MedTech industry space  this remains a major issue of concern for Edwards  investors 
Moreover  significant reimbursement cuts have been taking a toll on the operating results of medical device manufacturers like Edwards  as is apparent from the company s rising operating expenses in recent times 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Edwards is likely to beat earnings this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP   Edwards has a negative earnings ESP of  1 43  That is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 69 cents while the the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at 70 cents 
Zacks Rank  Edwards has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   which along with a negative ESP of  1 43  makes surprise prediction difficult 
We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions

Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the upcoming quarter

9797,231312,LH,Bet On These 5 Stocks Registering Strong Sales Growth ,opinion,"With ever changing market dynamics  investors are often beguiled into undertaking complex investment strategies  However  this sometimes may not yield the desired results  Hence  using conventional strategies  which are based on key fundamentals  to choose stocks is always a safe and sound approach for making profits Among several rational and down to earth investment strategies  we picked one that is focused on the sales growth of a company A steady sales growth is the key to survival for a business in today s highly competitive environment  Companies have stepped up marketing initiatives over digital platforms and have become more professional about sales management to drive their top line Flat or declining sales growth indicates obstacles at the company  which will limit scope for sustained growth  Stagnant companies may generate profits for a short period  but they do not ensure enough growth to attract new investors Notably  revenues are often more closely monitored than earnings when assessing the growth of a business  It s worth keeping in mind that in cases when companies incur a loss  albeit transitorily  they are valued on their revenues  as top line growth  or decline  is usually an indicator of a company s future earnings performance  Hence  the Price to Sales  P S  ratio can turn out to be an appropriate metric for stock valuation  Notably  this metric s importance further lies in the fact that management has limited opportunities to manipulate revenues unlike earnings Focusing solely on sales growth is  however  not enough  A consideration of a company s cash position along with its sales number can be a more dependable strategy  Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and investments The Right StrategyA careful selection of stocks considering certain factors should help investors to not only build wealth but beat the market as well In order to shortlist stocks that have impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance  we added 5 Year Historical Sales Growth     greater than X Industry and Cash Flow greater than  500 million as our primary screening parameters However  sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks  So  we added a few other factors to arrive at a winning strategy Price to Sales  P S  Ratio less than X Industry  This metric measures the value placed on each dollar of a company s revenues  The lower the ratio  the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales   Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions  4 Weeks  greater than X Industry  Northward estimate revision has often been observed to trigger an increase in the stock price Operating Margin  Average Last 5 years  greater than 5   Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company s sales translates into profits  A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs  an optimal situation for the company Return on Equity  ROE  greater than 5   This metric will ensure that sales growth is being translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash  High ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable Zacks

On a reported basis  LabCorp s net earnings came in at  198 2 million or  1 91 per share against  169 8 million or  1 66 per share a year ago 
Net revenue for the second quarter increased 7 4  year over year to  2 38 billion  ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 33 billion  Strong organic volume growth and tuck in acquisitions contributed to the topline growth  However  these positives were partially offset by adverse currency exchange movement LABORATORY CP Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
   Quarter under Review
Currently  LabCorp reports under two operating segments  LabCorp Diagnostics  LabCorp s legacy business  except for its clinical trial services business  which is now part of Covance Drug Development  and includes the nutritional chemistry and food safety business  previously part of Covance   and Covance Drug Development  Covance s legacy business  except for its nutritional chemistry and food safety business  which is now part of LabCorp Diagnostics  and includes LabCorp s legacy clinical trial services business  
In the reported quarter  LabCorp Diagnostics reported net revenue of  1 66 billion  up 5 4  year over year  fueled by organic volume growth of 1 2   measured by requisitions   price  mix and tuck in acquisitions  partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation of 0 3   The company reported a 3 5  increase in revenue per requisition in the quarter 
Covance Drug Development reported a 12 2  rise in net revenue to  722 4 million in the second quarter of 2016 driven by broad based demand  partially offset by the 70 basis points  bps  negative impact due to foreign currency translation  At Constant Exchange Rate  CER  and excluding the impact of the expiration of the Sanofi  PA SASY  site support agreement  net revenue increased 16 4  year over year on increased demand 
Gross margin fell 4 bps to 34  in the quarter  Adjusted operating income surged 9 6  year over year to  418 8 million  Accordingly  adjusted operating margin expanded 39 bps from the year ago quarter to 17 2  despite a 4 5  rise in selling  general and administrative expenses to  408 million

Update on Sequenom Deal
In a separate press release  LabCorp announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Sequenom  Inc    NASDAQ SQNM    a prominent name in non invasive prenatal testing  NIPT  for reproductive health  The deal has been inked for an equity value of  302 million representing total enterprise value of  371 million The acquisition is expected to get completed by the end of 2016 subject to customary closing conditions 
According to LabCorp  this acquisition will be strategically fit for the company  business as Sequenom s NIPT and genetic testing capabilities will further advance LabCorp s aim to deliver advanced diagnostic solutions  The inclusion will also expand LabCorp s geographic reach both domestically and internationally 
Outlook
LabCorp updated its 2016 financial outlook  Taking into consideration the foreign exchange rates effective as of Jun 30  2016  the lower end of the net revenue growth expectation has been raised to a new range of  9 5  to 10 5  over 2015  from the earlier expectation of 8 5  to 10 5    This includes a 50 bps impact from unfavorable foreign exchange headwind  earlier expectation was 40 bps  resulting from the strengthening of the dollar  The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at  9 34 billion 
Adjusted EPS guidance for 2016 has also been raised to the range of  8 60  8 95  earlier  8 55  8 95   The current Zacks Consensus Estimate of  8 79 falls above the mid point of the guided range 
Free cash flow is expected in the band of  900  950 million  up 24  31  over the prior year   unchanged  
Our Take
LabCorp s consolidated second quarter earnings and revenues managed to exceed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate  This has been a strong quarter with respect to organic volume growth in LabCorp Diagnostics  accelerated revenue growth in Covance Drug Development and operating leverage  We believe that with the integration of Covance  LabCorp is perfectly positioned to drive long term profitable growth through a combination of world class diagnostics  drug development expertise and knowledge services  Although the strengthening of the dollar continues to weigh on the company s year over year performance  the raised 2016 outlook is a firm indication that the scenario is going to rebound down the line 
Zacks Rank
LabCorp currently carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Two other well ranked stocks in the sector are CR Bard Inc    NYSE BCR   and The Cooper Companies Inc    NYSE COO    Both the stocks hold the same Zacks Rank as LabCorp ",2016-07-27,Zacks Investment Research,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/labcorp-(lh)-tops-q2-earnings,-view-up,-to-buy-sequenom-200144372",200144372

9800,231315,LH,SPX  7 Healthcare Growth Stocks   Part 2 ,opinion,"Introduction
The S P 500 index is commonly used as a benchmark that investors use to measure the performance of their individual portfolios against  However  the S P 500 is comprised of a very diverse group of companies  Just about every classification of company you can imagine can be found in the S P 500  Furthermore  it is also comprised of all of the major industry sectors  With this series of articles  I have been examining the S P 500 constituents in the healthcare sector  In part 1  I presented what I consider to be attractively valued dividend growth stocks in the S P 500 healthcare sector  In this part 2  I will continue to examine S P 500 healthcare stocks  however  with this article I will focus on fairly valued non dividend paying growth oriented S P 500 healthcare constituents 
Passive Vs  Active Investing
Choosing passive versus active stock portfolios is one of the most hotly debated subjects regarding investing in stocks  Passive investing implies investing in an index fund while active investing means carefully handpicking specific stocks that meet your own goals  objectives and risk tolerances  Personally  I have always preferred what Wall Street calls active investing  However  I take exception with that designation  My personal investment philosophy is to invest in attractively valued businesses with the objective of holding for the long term  Consequently  my investment process could hardly be called active because there is little turnover in my portfolios 
Therefore  I reject the designations active versus passive in favor of selective versus non selective  It is my preference to carefully select my investments based on sound valuation and sound fundamental attributes  And more importantly  I prefer to select my investments based on their precise characteristics that meet my specific goals  objectives and risk tolerances 
For example  my current personal investment objectives are to seek fairly valued high quality dividend growth stocks with a history of increasing their dividends each year  Therefore  my goal is not simply maximum current income  I am also keenly focused on constructing a portfolio with the opportunity for that income to grow each year  In this regard  I consider long term capital gain a secondary objective  To be clear  I do expect to generate a reasonable level of capital gains with my dividend growth stocks  Investing in them when they are attractively valued gives me confidence that I can generate capital appreciation commensurate with each company s earnings growth  However  I am not concerned with outperforming the market on a total return basis  but I am concerned with outperforming the market on a total dividend income basis over the long term 
This leads me to pointing out additional reasons why I reject passive   also known as index investing  For example  the S P 500 is often used by investors as the primary benchmark to judge their performance against  However  that judgment is always based on total return calculations  I also often utilize the S P 500 as a benchmark to judge my own portfolio against  However  relative to my current income oriented investment philosophy  my measurement for performance is based on how much dividend income my portfolio generates versus the S P 500  Moreover  I also measure how fast that dividend income is growing compared to the S P 500 
In this dividend income regard  the S P 500 is at a great disadvantage  I took a rough count and found that approximately 85 of the S P 500 companies pay no dividends at all  and another 58 yield 1  or less  Using round numbers  more than 25  of the S P 500 constituents offer none or very little in the way of dividends  Since my objective is a growing dividend income stream  I see no logical reason to own the index when so many of the constituents do not meet my specific objectives 
Additionally  there are many S P 500 constituents that I would never invest in on my own volition  Therefore  I see no reason why I would want to invest in them by purchasing the index when I would never invest in them by my own selection process  Moreover  my recent examination of the S P 500 index constituents also discovered that the majority of the blue chip dividend growth companies I would typically be attracted to are currently overvalued  Once again  if I am not willing to invest in them today because they are overvalued  therefore  I would not want to invest in them today via the index 
However  with all that said  I also recognize and accept the reality that not everyone has the same investment objectives as I do  There are many prudent strategies that investors can choose to employ and there are many different kinds of individual stocks that can be selected for common stock portfolios  To me  the key is to clearly identify your personal objectives and risk tolerances  and then choose appropriate investments that are compatible with those goals  Investing is not a one size fits all process 
Attractive Healthcare Growth Stocks in the S P 500 for the Total Return Investor
Therefore  even though I personally favor dividend growth stocks  there are also valid reasons and return opportunities available through investing in non dividend paying but growing companies  As I pointed out in part 1 of this series found here I have recently been examining the healthcare sector of the S P 500 looking for attractively valued stocks  Consequently  in addition to the fairly valued dividend growth stocks I reported on in part 1  I also came across a few intriguing growth stock opportunities in the healthcare sector of the S P 500 
As a result  I felt compelled to share these findings with those who are interested in investing for growth or total return  The following  Portfolio Review  via FAST Graphs lists the seven S P 500 healthcare growth stock constituents that I felt were worth taking a closer look at  There are various reasons why I chose to highlight these specific examples  In all cases  I felt that valuations were fair  and in a few cases    even compelling  On the other hand  for the few that I found compelling  there are reasons why valuations are so low  Consequently  I highly recommend conducting your own thorough due diligence and research  Nevertheless  as an old associate of mine used to like to say  the problems appear to be already in the price  Therefore  I will provide a brief commentary on each selection indicating why I chose to feature it in this article 

Allergan  NYSE AGN pa  plc  AGN 
Below is a short business description courtesy of Morningstar 
 Allergan PLC is a specialty pharmaceutical company  The Company is engaged in developing  manufacturing and distributing generic  brand and biosimilar products  
I was attracted to Allergan based on its high and relatively consistent earnings growth since 2008  However  I was also struck by the fact that the market has valued Allergan s high earnings growth achievements at a market  average  valuation  I find this interesting  because it is very rare to find a company with such a high rate of earnings growth available at such a reasonable valuation  As evidenced by the blue normal P E ratio line on the graph  the market has recently valued this stock at a 16 P E ratio more or less  To me  that is a low valuation for a company that has grown earnings at 29  per annum 

Cash Flow Per Share  cflps   Free Cash Flow Per Share  fcflps 
I was further intrigued by Allergan when I examined the company s cash flow and free cash flow per share  Both of these metrics suggest that the business is quite healthy on an operating basis 

Judging by its historical earnings growth rate  I was not surprised to see that the consensus estimates of analysts expect this company to continue growing at mid double digit rates  I was also not surprised to see that expected earnings growth was lower than historical norms considering the company s already approaching a  100 billion market cap 

Gross Profit Margin  GPM   Net Profit Margin  NPM   Return On Equity  ROE 
When I first examined gross and net profit margin  I was shocked to see that net margins virtually disappeared from 2012 through 2014  However  there were legitimate reasons why this happened  to include acquisition costs  failed mergers and other theoretically nonrecurring events 

As a result  when I looked at diluted earnings  GAAP  I saw a completely different perspective compared to what I saw when I looked at operating earnings and cash flows  Although I always like to examine GAAP results  I differ from many people regarding their importance or relevance as a valuation tool  When valuing a stock for potential investment  I am more concerned with how the business is performing as an operating company  Nevertheless  I felt it was important to point these issues out on this research candidate 

Endo International plc  NASDAQ ENDP 
Below is a short business description courtesy of Morningstar 
 Endo International PLC is a specialty healthcare company  The Company is engaged in developing  manufacturing  marketing and distribution of branded pharmaceutical and generic products as well as medical devices  
What struck me about Endo International was its extremely low valuation  Earnings have clearly flattened in recent years  but I believe the stock price reaction seems way overdone  Consequently  I included this research candidate as a compelling valuation and potential recovery candidate  Therefore  I was not surprised to see the stock surge yesterday based on an impressive second quarter earnings report  Nevertheless  I offer this as an interesting speculation based on compelling low valuation  However  as I looked deeper into additional important fundamental metrics  the speculative nature of this particular research candidate is important to note

Express Scripts Holding  NASDAQ ESRX 
Below is a short business description courtesy of Morningstar 
 Express Scripts Holding Co offers healthcare management   administration services such as managed care organizations  health insurers  workers  compensation plans   government health programs  
To me  there was very little not to like about Express Scripts and its consistently strong earnings growth rate history  But what I liked most was its compelling valuation  As I indicated earlier  it s hard to find a company with this type of earnings growth record trading at such a low valuation

Below is a short business description courtesy of Morningstar 
 HCA Holdings Inc is a health care services company  It operates general acute care hospitals  psychiatric hospitals  and rehabilitation hospitals  It also operates freestanding surgery centers  
I was attracted to HCA Holdings  current valuation in light of the moderately high overvaluation that the stock traded at through the summer of 2015  The stock price correction since then has potentially created a buying opportunity  My one caveat is the company s high debt to capital ratio  However  the company does have strong cash flows  and I ve read reports where management is focused on improving their debt situation

9806,231321,LH,VWR Corp s Balanced Growth Partly Offset By Weak Margins,opinion,"On Jun 8  we issued an updated research report on Radnor  PA based VWR Corporation   NASDAQ VWR    The company offers laboratory products  services and solutions and currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  
VWR had a remarkable start to 2016  with its first quarter financial numbers beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both the top and bottom line  Segment wise  management witnessed strong sales in both Americas as well as the EMEA APAC region  accompanied by exceptionally strong growth in equipment and instrumentation 
Per management  robust growth in biotech  medical devices and sales to CRO customers drove the better than expected performance of the biopharma business in the Americas during the first quarter  Moreover  the strategic shift from the company s North American regional go to market strategy to a customer segment specific approach has started to add value  Going ahead  VWR expects to witness continued solid business momentum in the Americas segment in the second quarter as well 
In the EMEA APAC region  the company witnessed a reduced impact of currency translation on segment sales in the first quarter  which in turn significantly boosted its performance  From a product perspective  sales of chemicals grew in the low single digits  consumables rose mid single digits while capital goods increased low single digits 
The company s stable cash balance position as well as its huge customer base added to the optimism 
On the flip side  the company continues to face gross margin pressure  Escalating cost of production has been a major factor behind this lackluster outcome  Moreover  as VWR offers products from a wide range of suppliers  its ability to sustain its gross margin has been  and will continue to be  dependent partly upon its ability to obtain favorable terms from its suppliers 
Unfavorable currency fluctuation continued to impact the company s overall sales in the first quarter and management expects no respite from the same in the near term  Intensifying competition is also a headwind for the stock

9808,231323,LH,5 Stocks To Buy On Stronger GDP Data,opinion,"The U S  economy expanded at a faster pace in the first quarter than earlier estimated  according to data released on Tuesday  As the country entered its eighth year of economic expansion  other indicators such as housing and retail sales also remained promising  However  underlying fears exist about whether growth is robust enough to withstand the fallout of a recent Brexit 
The most significant upward revisions which stand out are the extent of spending on software  research and development  In the backdrop of falling expenditure on equipment and weak gains made by several services it may be a good idea to bet on stocks from these categories 
Final Q1 Estimate Revised Upward
The  third  estimate from the Bureau of Economic Analysis showed that first quarter output of goods and services increased at an annual rate of 1 1   higher than the consensus estimate of a 1  increase  Further  first quarter GDP data was revised upward from the previously estimated 0 8  rise 
However  first quarter GDP growth was much lower than the rate of 1 4  recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015  Business spending declined for the second consecutive quarter  Also  consumer expenditure growth was revised downward from 1 9  to 1 5   This was primarily due to low spending levels on services  primarily recreation and transportation 
Ultimately  there were two major reasons for the upward revision in the estimate for first quarter GDP  Firstly  exports increased by 0 3   contrary to the earlier estimate of a decline of 2   More importantly  business expenditure on software  research and development increased by 4 4  versus the earlier estimate of a 0 1  decline   
Are Brexit Fears for Real 
The shock result of the recent British referendum has led several economists and market watchers to believe that the fallout could weigh on GDP growth over the upcoming six quarters  Most of this is likely to be due to lower business expenditure  Rising uncertainty could result in several companies pushing back or reducing the scale of new projects 
However  the Fed is unlikely to raise rates as a result of such worries  A weak interest rate regime should outweigh the impact of such global turmoil  Additionally  the U S  economy usually picks up pace over the second quarter  rebounding during spring and summer  Car sales remain strong and existing home sales hit a nine year peak in May 
Our Choices
Despite some factors weighing on GDP during the first quarter  final estimates have experienced an upward revision  The likelihood of a pickup in growth during the second quarter remains strong 
Expenditure on software  research and development has contributed significantly to the increase in the first quarter GDP  Adding these stocks to your portfolio would be a good option at this point  At the same time  it is important to pick winning stocks   
This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM score

9820,231335,LH,5 Medtech Stocks To Watch Out For In 2H16,opinion,"With the Q2 earnings season almost here  investors seek stocks that not only hedge losses but promise handsome returns  The recent rebound in the major stock markets following the Brexit tremors has also instilled a new level of confidence among investors 
Evidently  both the S P 500 index and tech heavy Nasdaq Composite witnessed a 3 9  rise last week  while the Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJI  was up 4  
However  the global economy continues to be fragile as many investors are still apprehensive of the long term effects of Brexit  Moreover  there remain uncertainties related to the Fed s decision on a hike in interest rates as the Brexit event has surely faded any chance of such hike any time soon 
In such a scenario  it is probably best to focus on defensive sectors  One such space is the Medtech industry  given that it has been historically immune to market slumps 
Why the Medtech Industry 
Even as the majority of the primary sectors of the S P 500 cohort have been seen to falter in recent past  Medical was among the very few that stood strong  Interestingly  MedTech  one of the largest industries under this sector  exhibits similar characteristics  such as strong returns on capital  strict government enforced restrictions on competition  stable revenues and high margins 
Again  a comparative analysis of Medtech s achievement with that of the major market indices reflects the industry s above market performance  The 1 year return from the S P 500 index reached 1 65   while that from the DJI was 1 5   Meanwhile  the S P 500 Healthcare Equipment Index returned around 9 3  over the same period 
What s Driving the Medtech Industry 
There are a number of factors that keep the Medtech industry afloat even in the most challenging circumstances  These include a growing aging population  rapid growth in healthcare spending as a percentage of GDP in the recent years and adoption of next generation medical devices 
In addition  the recent change in consumer demand and market dynamics led to a dramatic transformation in the healthcare system  as evident from the growing prevalence of minimally invasive surgeries  rising demand for liquid biopsy tests  strategic mergers between industry giants  increasing research and development  R D  cost at major companies  use of IT for ensuring quick and improved patient care and the shift of the payment system to a value based model among others 
What to Expect Next 
As far as the Q2 earnings results are concerned  Medical is one of the 6 Zacks sectors  comprising a total of 16 sectors  that is expected to record earnings growth  while the S P 500 itself is projected to witness a decline  Moreover  as per EvaluateMedTech s latest report  the global Medtech industry is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4 1  from 2014 to reach a sales value of  477 5 billion in 2020 
How to Pick 
Given the above discussion  well ranked stocks in the MedTech industry grab a lot of attention  particularly if they are witnessing a surge in share prices and have a decent long term earnings growth potential 
To find such stocks  we use the Zacks Rank and  as criteria  Stocks with a VGM Score of  A  or  B  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  promise better returns  on an average  than the individual components  as it considers three times as many items that are correlated to future stock returns 
Our Choices
Here we have picked 5 MedTech stocks with a year to date price change of more than 2  and long term earnings growth of more than 5   which also boast a favorable Zacks Rank and a VGM Style Score of  A  or  B

9822,231337,LH,5 Strong Sales Growth Stocks To Power Your Portfolio ,opinion,"A healthy business with steady sales growth is the key to survival in today s fast changing and highly competitive business environment  However  when it comes to picking stocks  investors often fail to consider sales growth as a dependable metric  This might be because of investors  preconceived notion that a company s stock price is typically sensitive to its earnings momentum Nevertheless  it s worth keeping in mind that in cases when companies incur a loss  albeit transitorily  they are valued on their revenues  as top line growth  or decline  is usually an indicator of a company s future earnings performance  Further  a company can improve earnings by resorting to cost control measures while maintaining stable revenues  However  a sustainable bottom line growth invariably requires superior revenues Hence  the Price to Sales  P S  ratio can turn out to be an appropriate metric for stock valuation  Notably  this metric s importance further lies in the fact that management has limited opportunities to manipulate revenues unlike earnings While sales growth provides investors an insight into product demand and pricing power  it doesn t indicate whether the company is operating efficiently  A huge sales number does not necessarily convert into profits Therefore  a consideration of a company s cash position along with its sales number can be a more dependable strategy  Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and investments A Strategy to Bet OnA careful selection of stocks considering certain factors should help investors to not only build wealth but beat the market as well In order to shortlist stocks that have impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance  we added 5 Year Historical Sales Growth     greater than X Industry and Cash Flow greater than  500 million as our primary screening parameters However  sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks  So  we added a few other factors to arrive at a winning strategy Price to Sales  P S  Ratio less than X Industry  This metric measures the value placed on each dollar of a company s revenues  The lower the ratio  the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales   Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions  4 Weeks  greater than X Industry  Northward estimate revision has often been observed to trigger an increase in the stock price Operating Margin  Average Last 5 years  greater than 5   Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company s sales translates into profits  A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs  an optimal situation for the company Return on Equity  ROE  greater than 5   This metric will ensure that sales growth is being translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash  High ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2

9826,231341,LH,Is LabCorp  LH  A Great Stock For Value Investors  ,opinion,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings   NYSE LH    or LabCorp stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  LabCorp has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14 6   as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 17 42x  If we focus on the long term PE trend  LabCorp s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the broader industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 17 58  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that LabCorp has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 14 32  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for LabCorp stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  LabCorp has a P S ratio of about 1 44  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 12x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  LH is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  LabCorp currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20   of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes LabCorp a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though LabCorp might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of D and a Momentum Score of A  This gives LH a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been downbeat  The current quarter has seen three estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to six lower  while the full year estimate has seen no up and ten down in the same time period This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has decreased by 2 1  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has declined by 1 6   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Price and Consensus

9829,231344,LH,My Top 10 Fairly Valued Fast Growing Stocks ,opinion,IntroductionThis is part two of a series on investing for growth  part one can be found here One of my primary objectives for preparing this series is to dispel some of the common myths that many investors hold regarding investing for growth  For example  many believe that growth stocks are  by definition  riskier than dividend paying stocks  Although there is some truth to this  I believe this concept is overblown  One commonly measured metric for measuring risk is beta  At its core  beta is a measure of volatility which is also referred to as systematic risk  More simply stated  it is a measurement designed to reflect whether or not a given stock is more volatile than the general market  A baseline beta of one reflects the market  Therefore  a stock with a beta less than one indicates that it is less volatile than the market  and a stock with a beta greater than one would indicate that it is more volatile than the market  More volatility is assumed to be synonymous with more risk  and many investors are led to believe that growth stocks have higher betas than dividend paying stocks  In truth  there are many growth stocks that have betas lower than the general market  and conversely  some that have betas higher than the general market  I will list the betas of each of the 10 examples that I will be presenting in this article next to their title  The results may surprise many readers There is another myth  or at least a great over generalization  that dividend paying stocks outperform non dividend paying stocks  Once again  the true answer is that it really depends on the individual stocks  Some non dividend companies  stocks  are really terrible businesses  which is why they don t pay dividends in the first place  On the other hand  there are many true growth stocks that don t pay a dividend but are excellent businesses  and therefore  excellent investments as well  I will be reviewing 10 excellent true growth non dividend paying stocks in this article  To put it bluntly  a true growth stock will generally create a significantly higher total return than most dividend paying stocks  even if dividends are reinvested  Of course  the true growth stock has to be purchased at a reasonable valuation for this to happen  However  it is quite common that true growth stocks will be priced far above their earnings justified valuations by the market  Therefore  investors need to be careful to avoid the hype and focus on true value instead This leads me to a few words about another myth relating to growth stocks  Many investors believe that high growth stocks simultaneously carry high PEs  and again  higher risk  This particular myth does have some truth based on the fact that companies that are growing at rates that are much faster than the market  are logically worth more than the average company due to the power of compounding  This is why I believe that the PE equal to the growth rate formula for valuing growth stocks  companies with above 15  earnings growth  is an appropriate gauge for fair value Consequently  a P E ratio that is equal to the company s earnings growth rate would indicate fair value  even though it may be higher than the market multiple  This higher valuation is due to the fact that companies that are growing earnings at rates that are multiples of the rates that the general market is growing at will generate significantly more future earnings than the average company  again  thanks to the power of compounding  Therefore  in the long run  wise investors who are investing in these high growth stocks are often buying future earnings much cheaper than the future earnings of average companies with lower entry level PEs This article will review 10 established above average growing businesses that I believe are also fairly valued today  or very close to becoming fairly valued  if there were any correction in the market at all  None of these stocks pay dividends  however  they all have achieved significantly above average historical growth  and most importantly  they are all expected to produce significantly above average future growth  at least over the next five years  Consequently  investors interested in earning above average long term returns might want to dig deeper into these selections 10 Fairly Valued High Growth StocksIn order to make my top 10 list of high growth stocks  each candidate had to meet several logical criteria  First and foremost  I searched for companies with historical earnings growth rates that were exceeding 15  to 20  per annum  In addition to the velocity of the company s earnings growth  I also looked for a high degree of consistency  and the ability to continue growing regardless of the economic environment  including during recessions  I was willing to accept some minor weakness during recessionary times  but not complete earnings collapses The following portfolio review lists my top 10 fairly valued growth stocks listed in alphabetical order  Although each of these selections appears to be an attractive long term investment capable of generating above average returns  a few of these examples are fully valued to moderately overvalued currently  On the other hand  based on the possibility that current estimates may also be conservative  I included them in my top 10 list  In other words  I would either be looking for a minor pullback or for their high earnings growth to exceed current estimates  and therefore  justify current valuation  More simply stated  I think these are all candidates worth looking further into A Detailed Look At The Top 10 Growth List By The NumbersAs usual I will rely on F A S T  Graphs   the fundamentals analyzer software tool  to provide  essential fundamentals at a glance  on each of my top 10 selections  Please keep in mind that each of these selections are offered as candidates for a more comprehensive research and due diligence process  However  I will provide brief commentary on each  based solely on what their respective F A S T  Graph  reveals  Also  as I previously stated  I have presented the beta on each selection along with their introduction  all beta figures taken from Google Finance  AutoZone  Inc  AZO   Beta  32 Below MarketAutoZone has produced a very consistent record of earnings growth averaging over 21  per annum  Nevertheless  it is also a fact revealed by the earnings and price correlated graph below  that the market has historically valued this company at a discount to its earnings growth  The reader should also note that the company carries a lot of debt  but does generate substantial cash flows to mitigate this risk Even though AutoZone has been historically priced at a discount to its earnings growth rate  its total annualized rate of return of 19 4  per annum closely correlates to its earnings growth  Consequently  this business  with its powerful record of consistent growth  has substantially outperformed the S P 500 The consensus of 22 analysts reporting to Standard   Poor s Capital IQ  expect AutoZone to grow earnings at 14 8  per annum over the next five years  Catamaran Corp  CTRX   Beta  54 Below MarketRemarkably  even though Catamaran Corp has produced a powerful record of earnings growth averaging over 40  per annum  the company s beta is only  54  Catamaran Corp did experience a drop in earnings during the great recession  however  the company did remain highly profitable  Furthermore  post recession earnings growth has been nothing short of spectacular as it accelerated to over 60  per annum growth since fiscal 2009  Nevertheless  the company s current P E ratio at 42 3 is in alignment with their historical earnings growth Since going public at the end of June 2006  Catamaran shareholders have enjoyed an annualized rate of return of 52 2   which correlates to the company s earnings growth rate enhanced by modest undervaluation existing when the company first went public The consensus of 22 analysts reporting to Standard   Poor s Capital IQ forecast Catamaran to grow earnings at 25  per annum over the next five years  Consequently  even though the company is reasonably priced based on its historical earnings growth  it would appear to be moderately overvalued based on expected future growth  However  due to the power of compounding  the 25  per annum future growth rate would still offer prospective investors a strong annualized rate of return  On the other hand  over the shorter run  there is the risk of a temporary price drop  Even if that were to occur  if you apply a growth rate multiple of 25 to the consensus  1 86 for fiscal 2013 earnings per share  you would get a fair value of  46 50  This is only moderately below the company s current quotation  My point being that fair valuation can be more generously thought of when dealing with very fast growing companies Cognizant Tech  CTSH   Beta 1 12 Moderately Above Market NeutralCognizant Technology Solutions has one of the most consistent long term records of earnings growth of any company you would ever find  Moreover  the company has no debt and appears to be significantly undervalued based on its long term historical record of earnings growth Thanks to operating earnings growth exceeding 38  per annum  long term shareholders in Cognizant have been rewarded with an annualized rate of return of 31 5   It s important to recognize that this long term rate of return has little or nothing to do with either the return of the stock market during this time  nor the economic growth of the United States and or the rest of the world  Perhaps this is a clue as to why Warren Buffett and others encourage us to ignore political and economic forecasts Since the F A S T  Graphs  research tool is a dynamic tool  I thought it would be revealing to look at Cognizant since calendar year 2008  the great recession   Earnings growth  although still significantly above average  has slowed to just over 22  per annum  This explains why the company appears so undervalued when looked at on the earnings and price correlated graph going back to 1999  Based on more recent history  Cognizant still appears to be undervalued  but nowhere near as much as it does on the longer term graph  To further illustrate  and perhaps more greatly appreciate the power of earnings growth  shareholder returns since the beginning of calendar year 2008 for Cognizant have still been superior to the overall market The consensus of 13 analysts reporting to Standard   Poor s Capital IQ forecast Cognizant to grow earnings at 18  per annum  Although I consider this forecast to be conservative  it nevertheless justifies today s current valuation Express Scripts Holding Co  ESRX   Beta 1 05 Market NeutralExpress Scripts Holding Co  among other things  is a pharmacy benefit management company  with a long record of above average earnings growth exceeding 30  per annum  The drop in earnings for fiscal 2012 is attributed to a one time   67 nonrecurring charge  Excluding the one time charge  operating earnings growth would have been approximately 12   Also  operating cash flow was very strong in fiscal 2012  Express Scripts Holdings Co represents another example of a company with powerful growth that produced returns for shareholders that far exceeded either economic growth and or the returns on the average stock as represented by the S P 500  In other words  the level of the stock market has had little to nothing to do with investing in Express Scripts Holding Company The consensus of 23 analysts reporting to Standard   Poor s Capital IQ forecast Express Scripts  five year earnings growth rate at 15  per annum  However  based on their historical record and the powerful demographics underpinning their core businesses  I believe these estimates could prove to be very conservative  However  if they were proven to be true  then this company would be moderately overvalued today  On the other hand  thanks to the power of compounding long term potential returns could still be substantial  Once again  it may prove beneficial to be somewhat liberal with valuation on a company with significantly above average prospects for growth Fossil Inc  FOSL   Beta 1 81 HighFossil Inc has generated a very strong long term record of earnings growth averaging 18 9  per annum  However  due to the nature of their business  an occasional cyclicality with their earnings does manifest  On the other hand  there are some very interesting lessons in valuation that I believe this company s price history reflects  You can see a strong negative reaction during the great recession which caused the price to drop significantly below its earnings justified valuation  the orange line   However  we also see how it quickly recovered But perhaps the most interesting aspects of their price history are the large spikes of overvaluation that occurred in 2011 and 2012  In both cases  price quickly reverted back to earnings justified levels  providing clear evidence of market inefficiency on both occasions However  in spite of some pretty scary bouts of price volatility  long term shareholders in Fossil Inc were rewarded in almost perfect correlation with the company s long term record of earnings growth  Another piece of evidence that earnings determine market price in the long run The consensus estimates of 14 analysts reporting to Standard   Poor s Capital IQ expect more of the same for Fossil Inc with a five year estimated earnings growth rate estimated at 17 5  per annum  This number is consistent with the company s historical results  and justifies today s current valuation  if proven to be true Hibbett Sports Inc  HIBB   Beta 1 06 Market NeutralHibbett Sports Inc represents a quintessential example of a long term earnings and price relationship  Monthly closing stock prices  the black line on the graph   have clearly tracked the company s earnings growth over time  During the few cases where the price disconnected either above or below the earnings justified valuation  the orange line   it quickly moves back into alignment  Once again  we see that operating earnings growth and shareholder returns are highly correlated  But as we ve also seen with our other examples  there is very little correlation between Hibbett Sports Inc shareholder returns relative to the overall market returns  as represented by the S P 500  over the same timeframe The consensus of 13 analysts reporting to Standard   Poor s Capital IQ forecast Hibbett Sports to grow at 16  per annum  Consequently  the stock appears to be moderately overpriced on that basis  However  due to the high rate of expected growth  Hibbett Sports would still be a good investment at these levels  On the other hand  it might be prudent to wait for a better entry level Laboratory CP of America  LH   Beta  62 LowLaboratory Corp of America is currently trading at a below market PE ratio  yet it possesses above market historical earnings growth averaging over 19  per annum  However  if I were to present a six year graph as I did with CTSH above  LH would appear fairly valued  In spite of Laboratory Corp s current low valuation  long term shareholders were richly rewarded with a total annual return of 25 9  versus 3 1  for the S P 500  Once again  we see the power of above average earnings growth generating significantly above average returns Laborabory Corp of America is the only example in this group with forecast earnigns growth below 15  per annum  AZO is forecast at 14 8  rounded to 15    However  I do believe that these estimates could be consertative  LKQ Corp  LKQ   Beta  86 Neutral to LowLKQ Corp represents a quiessental example of what I look for in a growth stock  Notice how earnings continued to advance prior to  during and after the great recession  Also  notice how over the long term stock price has tracked the company s long term eanrings record As a result of LKQ Corp s consistent and strong record of earnings growth  long term shareholders were rewarded orders of magnitude better than shareholders in a passive index fund would have been  This is a classic example of how a powerful  fast growing  non dividend paying stock will greatly outperform even the best dividend growth stock and the general market at large The consensus of 12 analysts reporting to Standard   Poor s Capital IQ forecast LKQ to grow earnings at 20  per annum over the next five years  Consequently  the shares appear moderately overvalued based on current forecasts  However  considering their impeccable long term record  the consensus forecast may prove conservative Middleby Corp  MIDD   Beta 1 64 HighMiddleby Corp has produced a solid record of historical earnings growth averaging over 31  per annum since 1999  Although the company did have a modest hiccup during the great recession  earnings recovery since has been back on its normal track Long term shareholders in Middleby Corp were rewarded with an annualized rate of return that highly correlated to the company s long term record of earnings growth  Once again we see an example of a fast growing business rewarding shareholders far in excess of economic growth or stock market averages The consensus of 7 analysts reporting to Standard   Poor s Capital IQ forecast Middleby to grow earnings in excess of 19  over the next five years  Consequently  Middleby shares appear within the fair value corridor defined by the five orange lines on the graph Priceline com  PCLN  Beta 1 28 Moderately HighThe long term earrings and price correlated graph on Priceline provides an interesting insight into the dangers of investing too early in a hyped IPO  As you should see from the monthly closing stock price line  the black line on the graph  Priceline s price spiked initially after their IPO release before collapsing over the next year and a half back to its earnings justified level  This further validates my belief in waiting nine months to a year or more before investing in a hot IPO no matter how much I believe in the company s long term future Here is a classic example of how overpaying for even the best of companies can destroy potential returns  Even though Priceline grew earnings in excess of 63  per annum  the massive overvaluation during the initial IPO reduced returns to mere average numbers This next graph reviews Priceline after its initial overvalaution moved into better alignment with the company s operating potential  The operating eanrings growth rate on this company remained the same as we saw with the 15 year graph  however  as we will soon see  the effect of better valuation on long term returns is extrodinary By simply waiting for Priceline shares to move into better alignment with the company s earnings potential  long term shareholder returns went from average to extraordinary  However  it should also be interesting to note that Priceline did not generate any real earnings until 2002  Consequently  even in calendar years 2001 and 2002  Priceline was actually overvalued  however  due to the incredible power of compounding  long term shareholders would have achieved an annualized return of 44 8  per annum  The consensus of 28 analysts reporting to Standard   Poor s Capital IQ forecast Priceline to grow earnings at 20  per annum over the next five years  Consequently  Priceline appears reasonably valued at today s levels Summary and ConclusionsWhen reviewing very fast growing companies  the rules of fair valuation still apply  However  due to the power of compounding  very fast growing businesses will generate significantly higher levels of future earnings than slower growth businesses  As a consequence  investors can actually pay slightly more than earnings justify for a very fast growing company and still generate an attractive long term rate of return  The reason this is important  is because it is difficult to find very fast growing companies that can be bought at the strictest definitions of fair value It should also be pointed out that as companies get bigger  their earnings growth rates are likely to slow down a bit  Therefore  the reader should have noticed that most forecasts for this group of stocks were lower than the company s historical achievements  Future purchases should be based with a greater emphasis placed on the future than on the past  However  I believe a lot of credit should be given to a company with a long history of above average earnings growth  Therefore  I believe there is room for high quality fast growing companies to be included in portfolios designed to fund retirement during the accumulation phase Nevertheless  there are limits to how much overvaluation a prudent prospective investor should be willing to take  Of the 10 sample companies reviewed in this article  3 or 4 of them could be  under the strictest definitions of fair value  considered moderately overvalued  However  none of the samples in this article are what I would consider dangerously overvalued  However  this does present a dilemma of sorts  Do you take the risk of waiting for a better valuation to manifest  only to be left out of the upside   Or do you go ahead and purchase them now  with a commitment to buy more if the price does happen to fall short term I believe these are questions that only each individual investor can answer for themselves  On the other hand  I believe that very fast growth is a rare and precious attribute  and therefore  worthy of some moderate overvaluation  But again  there are limits  In the next and final part three of this series on growth stocks  I will present examples where I believe dangerous overvaluation is manifest  In honor of my Mother  after all  last Sunday was Mother s Day  I always try to honor her rule of not saying anything if I can t say something nice  However  since I am so adamantly averse to overvaluation  I feel it is my responsibility to provide insight into its dangers to my readers Disclosure   Long

9830,231345,LH,A Dove Takes Flight  Economic Outlook Risks Tilt Downward,opinion,"A dove takes flight and lifts others There is a risk that the intensification of international cross currents could weigh more heavily on U S  demand directly  or that the anticipation of a sharper divergence in U S  policy could impose restraint through additional tightening of financial conditions  For these reasons  I view the risks to the economic outlook as tilted to the downside  The downside risks make a strong case for continuing to carefully nurture the U S  recovery  and argue against prematurely taking away the support that has been so critical to its vitality 

 and top Fed birdwatcher  Jon Hilsenrath  publishes his notes  The chances of a Federal Reserve interest rate increase in 2015 are diminishing amid new signs of anemic economic activity  a disappointing development for central bank officials who have been hoping to move this year after a prolonged period of easy money policies  Lackluster readings on consumer spending  inflation and jobs have virtually eliminated the chances of a move this month  Already  two Fed governors expressed doubts this week about whether the timing will be right this year  and the recent trove of data hasn t reassured top officials about the economic outlook

 Tim Duy even drops his binoculars  This is the most exciting speech I have read in forever  Not necessarily for the content  But for the politics  Evans and Kocherlakota are no longer the lunatic fringe  This could be a real game changer that shifts the Fed toward the Evans view of the world  with no rate hike until mid 2016  Brainard muddied further the already murky December waters

The market is thankful for the release of the Fed doves  because Q3 earnings have not been a positive  And there have been several significant banana peels for some of the S P 500 stocks 
S P 500 traded sideways this week as dovish comments by two Fed officials trumped disappointing macro data and 3Q company results  Retail sales and manufacturing surveys missed expectations  while year year core CPI registered 1 9   Uncertainty around the Fed liftoff increased as Governors Brainard and Tarullo separately argued for holding rates constant through year end  The first major week of 3Q earnings reports was disappointing with negative results and guidance from companies including Netflix  O NFLX  and Wal Mart  N WMT  
 Goldman Sachs  N GS  


Digging through some of the earnings related commentary I found the following data points 

The most notable earnings comment came from Wal Mart  which crushed its own stock price  along with many other retailers  with their comments about higher wages and plans to lower prices 

 Operating income is expected to be impacted by approximately  1 5 billion from the second phase of our previously announced investments in wages and training as well as our commitment to further developing a seamless customer experience  As a result of these investments  we expect earnings per share to decline between 6 and 12 percent in fiscal year 2017  


Delta Airlines  N DAL  made a specific comment about airplane prices that led to a selloff in Boeing  N BA  and Airbus  OTC EADSY  

 We re seeing a huge bubble in excess wide body airplanes around the world   we do think that the aircraft market is going to be ripe for Delta over the course of the next 12 to 36 months and we think that that weakness and that aircraft bubble in wide bodies is going to spread to narrow bodies and that there will be some huge buying opportunities  Because low interest rates really have created a huge wide body bubble in the world  


Hugo Boss  OTC BOSSY  blamed weakness on China slowdown and fewer tourists visiting their U S  stores 

 While performance in Europe remained strong and in line with original expectations  momentum in Asia and the Americas deteriorated considerably towards the end of the period  

the group said in a statement on Thursday evening 

 This was due to sales declines in China  as well as a negative development in the Group s U S  own retail and wholesale businesses  Weaker demand from tourists contributed to the slowdown in the U S  


Burberry  OTC BURBY  saw similar high end retail impacts  Carol Fairweather  finance director  said sales from stores open at least a year fell 4 per cent in the second quarter  compared with a 6 per cent increase in the first  She blamed the deceleration on waning demand from Chinese consumers   We believe the slowdown is macro   she said  However Burberry said demand was also  uneven  in the US  and weaker among local shoppers in London  Ms Fairweather said the group believed the problems were not specific to Burberry   We have been quite clear that we believe that in this quarter it has been a challenging market for luxury consumers all over the world  This has been slightly amplified by our geographic mix   she said

Staying at the high end  is Del Frisco s Restaurant Group  O DFRG  facing more competition  or is the environment changing 

 Del Frisco s Double Eagle faced customer count challenges at several locations  driven significantly by fewer private dining events  and experienced softer sales during shoulder periods  


Digging into the core industrials  Fastenal  O FAST  is still seeing a slowdown 

 The industrial environment is in a recession   I don t care what anybody says  because nobody knows that market better than we do  


Blackstone  N BX  has a big portfolio of private companies so listen closely 

 From our perspective  we do not see a recession  but we are seeing slowing in certain regions and sectors with some excess coming out of markets  


Back to Wal Mart  how will their labor and price pressures not ripple through to the rest of retail  Wal Mart Stores  N WMT  is part of the Hypermarkets and Super Centers sub industry  As a result of the guidance from Wal Mart  this sub industry is now projected to report a decline in earnings in CY 2016 of 5 5   compared to an expectation of earnings growth of 3 1  last Friday  Given the earnings decline now expected for the Hypermarkets and Super Centers sub industry in CY 2016 due to the guidance from Wal Mart  have analysts revised their earnings outlook for other retail sub industries for next year  Do analysts believe the reasons for the lower guidance from Wal Mart Stores are unique to Wal Mart  or do they believe they are reflective of broader issues in the retail space

Fund managers with more than  100 million under management are required to file a 13F within 45 days of the previous quarter s close 
So  four times a year  the average investor has the invaluable opportunity to see where the  smart money  is deploying their capital

Just a Little Pin Prick 
Laboratory Corp  of America Holdings  N LH  is the second largest clinical lab company in the United States  Founded in 1971 and better known as LabCorp  the company performs a wide range of diagnostic and disease treatment services 
LabCorp operates 39 primary laboratories and approximately 1 750 patient service centers around the world 
Over the last 20 years  the stock has been a standout performer against the market  Since 1996  the stock gained 422  versus the S P s gain of just 197  
Since 2010  LabCorp grew revenue by an average of 11   It s driven earnings of 4 9  during that time  more than triple the rate of chief competitor Quest Diagnostics Inc  N DGX  
Last year  LabCorp completed a  6 2 billion purchase of pharmaceutical R D giant Covance Inc  The purchase will contribute heavily to the company s top line growth as well as reduce testing costs 
However  the firm struggled as several unrelated biotech scandals rocked the industry as a whole 
Valeant Pharmaceutical International Inc  s  N VRX  questionable financial reports 
The uproar over Turing Pharmaceuticals  1 000  Daraprim price hike 
Laboratory upstart Theranos Inc  came under fire late last year for the accuracy of its testing equipment 
From its 52 week high in July to its 52 week low just a few months later  the S P Biotechnology Index fell 25  on these concerns 
These external struggles have helped drive down LabCorp s valuation in a big way 
The Funds Come Marching In
By the fourth quarter  LabCorp s price to earnings ratio dropped to 17   a discount to the market and the industry  The company s price to book ratio fell to a 10 year low of 2 2 
And that s when  smart money  made its move 
Glenview Capital Management LLC added to its existing position by 1 32   purchasing 791 223 shares  The institution now owns 8 6  of LabCorp

9833,231348,LH,7 Best Stocks To Attract You With Sales Growth,opinion,"Sales growth is an important metric for any company  as it is a vital part of growth projections and instrumental in strategic decision making  By monitoring this key metric over multiple time periods  one can clearly understand a company s growth trend 
Sales growth is essential to justify the fixed and variable expenses incurred to operate a business  Low revenues lead to an unprofitable business and negative financial results  Stagnant companies may generate near term profit  but can t rev up enough growth to attract new investors 
Moreover  in a growing economy  a lack of sales growth most likely denotes that the company is not gaining market share over its competitors  In simple terms  some sustained sales growth is necessary to support the bottom line 
Focusing solely on sales growth is not enough though  A healthy sales growth rate is certainly a positive indicator for picking good stocks  but it does not ensure profits  Therefore  taking into consideration a company s cash position along with its sales number can prove to be a more dependable strategy 
Substantial cash on hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and potential investments  Cash also enables a company to endure market downturns  Most importantly  a sufficient cash position indicates that revenues are being channelized in the right direction 
The Winning Strategy
In order to shortlist stocks that have impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance  we added 5 Year Historical Sales Growth     greater than X Industry and Cash Flow greater than  500 million as our primary screening parameters 
However  sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks  So  we added a few other factors to arrive at a winning strategy 
Price to Sales  P S  Ratio less than X Industry  This metric measures the value placed on each dollar of a company s revenues  The lower the ratio  the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales 
  Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions  4 Weeks  greater than X Industry  Northward estimate revision has often been observed to trigger an increase in the stock price 
Operating Margin  Average Last 5 years  greater than 5   Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company s sales translates into profits  A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs  which is the optimal situation for the company 
Return on equity  ROE  greater than 5   This metric will ensure that the sales growth is getting translated into profits and the company is not sitting idle on hoards of cash  High ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable 
Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2 Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment 
Here are 7 of the 13 stocks that qualified the screening 
Laboratory Corp  of America Holdings    NYSE LH

9859,231374,LH,LH Vs  XRAY  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors interested in stocks from the Medical   Dental Supplies sector have probably already heard of LabCorp  LH  and Dentsply International  XRAY   But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now  Let s take a closer look 
There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks  but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns  The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits 
LabCorp and Dentsply International are both sporting a Zacks Rank of   2  Buy  right now  Investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook since the Zacks Rank favors companies that have witnessed positive analyst estimate revisions  But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in 
Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried and true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels 
The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics  These include the long favored P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company s fair value 
LH currently has a forward P E ratio of 14 85  while XRAY has a forward P E of 24 33  We also note that LH has a PEG ratio of 1 73  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  XRAY currently has a PEG ratio of 2 12 
Another notable valuation metric for LH is its P B ratio of 2 32  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  XRAY has a P B of 2 61 
Based on these metrics and many more  LH holds a Value grade of B  while XRAY has a Value grade of C 
Both LH and XRAY are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks  but based on these valuation figures  we feel that LH is the superior value option right now ",2019-06-10,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/lh-vs-xray-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200430507,200430507
9860,231375,LH,Robust Sales Growth Makes These 5 Stocks Worth Buying Now,opinion,Strong sales growth is one of the most important characteristics of potential winners in the stock market  The companies that put more emphasis on sales management have a competitive advantage  as solid sales generally get converted into growth Revenues are often more closely monitored than earnings when assessing growth of a business  This is because investors want to make sure whether a business has the capability of generating more sales over time to cater to an expanding customer base Flat or declining sales rise indicates obstacles at the company and offers limited scope for sustained growth  Stagnant companies may generate near term profit  but do not ensure enough growth to attract new investors Without robust top line growth  bottom line improvement may not be sustainable over the long term  While a company can show earnings strength by reducing expenses  a sustainable bottom line recovery usually requires strong sales growth Nonetheless  sales growth in isolation doesn t indicate much about a company s future performance  Though it provides investors an insight into product demand and pricing power  a huge sales number is not necessarily translated into profits So  taking into consideration a company s cash position along with its sales number can prove to be a more dependable strategy  Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and potential investments  Most importantly  an adequate cash position suggests that revenues are being channelized in the right direction Selecting the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance  we have selected 5 Year Historical Sales Growth     greater than X Industry and Cash Flow more than  500 million as our main screening parameters But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks  So  we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy P S Ratio less than X Industry  This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company s revenues  The lower the ratio  the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales   Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions  four weeks  greater than X Industry  Estimate revisions  better than the industry  are often seen to trigger an increase in stock price Operating Margin  average last five years  greater than 5   Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company s sales translates into profits  A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs   an optimal situation for it Return on Equity  ROE  greater than 5   This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash  A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment  You can see the

most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Laboratory Corporation has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15 6  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 17 85  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Laboratory Corporation s current PE level puts it below its midpoint of 16 07 over the past five years  Moreover  the current level stands well below the highs for the stock  suggesting that it can be a solid entry point Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Medical sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 20 59  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Laboratory Corporation has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 14 81  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Laboratory Corporation stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Laboratory Corporation has a P S ratio of about 1 48  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 15x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Laboratory Corporation currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Laboratory Corporation a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Laboratory Corporation is just 1 53  a level that is far lower than the industry average of 1 85  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  LH is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Laboratory Corporation might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and a Momentum Score of B  This gives LH a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been sturdy at best  The current year has seen five estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to two lower  while the next year estimate has seen four up and three down in the same time period This has had a positive impact on the consensus estimate though as the current year consensus estimate has risen by 0 09  in the past two months  while the next year estimate has inched lower by 0 3   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Price and Consensus   Apart from this somewhat robust trend  the stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  which is why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineLaboratory Corporation is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Further  a strong industry rank  among Top 29  of more than 250 industries  instills our confidence  However  over the past two years  the Zacks Medical   Dental Supplies industry has clearly underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick It s Illegal in 42 States  But Investors Will

9883,231398,LH,LabCorp  LH  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"LabCorp  LH  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on October 24  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This medical laboratory operator is expected to post quarterly earnings of  2 84 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  3 7  
Revenues are expected to be  2 91 billion  up 2 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 04  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for LabCorp 
For LabCorp  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 16  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that LabCorp will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that LabCorp would post earnings of  2 90 per share when it actually produced earnings of  2 93  delivering a surprise of  1 03  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
LabCorp doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-10-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/labcorp-lh-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200474771,200474771
9885,231400,LH,What s In The Offing For LabCorp s  LH  Earnings In Q3 ,opinion,Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings   NYSE LH   also known as LabCorp is slated to report third quarter 2019 results on Oct 24  before the market opens In the last reported quarter  the company s adjusted earnings exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1 03   the average trailing four quarter beat being 0 42  Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement Factors at PlayIn the last few quarters  LabCorp s underlying core business put up a stable performance  Within Diagnostics  the company is likely to have generated strong revenue growth in the third quarter of 2019  banking on the following facts First  in 2019  the company officially collaborated with Horizon  NJ based UnitedHealthcare and Aetna  NYSE AET   placing LabCorp in network under all major national plans  Ever since  the company has been registering consistent organic growth on the back of these partnerships  The upside is likely to get reflected in the company s third quarter results Second  the company is expected to have advanced its companion diagnostics and oncology capabilities in the third quarter  backed by the introduction of two new companion diagnostic tests  namely PIK3CA for breast cancer and FGFR for bladder cancer  This  in turn  might have contributed to the company s upcoming earnings release Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Price and EPS Surprise   Third  in the last reported quarter  PAMA  Protecting Access to Medicare Act  had a negative impact of 90 basis points on organic revenues  The company is currently working to overcome the inequitable Medicare price reductions imposed by the flawed implementation of PAMA  To this end  it is considering the lately introduced Laboratory Access for Beneficiaries Act as a significant step to reform PAMA for producing a market based Medicare fee schedule  However  with near term visibility seeming bleak at the moment  we anticipate PAMA to once again dent the third quarter top line Third  the company is highly optimistic about the Phase II of LaunchPad initiative in Diagnostics  which is expected to deliver  200 million of savings in another three years  Good news is that this program is already likely to have boosted the company s operational efficiency in the third quarter Within Covance Drug Development  LabCorp is focused on driving profitable growth through expanded solutions and enhanced operational capabilities  The Chiltern integration has significantly strengthened the company s strategic position in clinical development and is accelerating revenues and profit growth within Covance  On this front  the company is keeping a good pace with its objective to streamline the drug development process  This steady effort should get reflected in the company s impending results Additionally  the company has progressed with the Covance LaunchPad initiative  In the first phase  as expected  the company achieved a cost synergy of  30 million from the acquisition of Chiltern  At the exit of second quarter 2019  it remained on track to deliver  150 million of net savings by the end of 2020  This momentum is mostly likely to have been maintained through the company s third quarter  strengthening LabCorp s bottom line This apart  the innovative business swap transaction with Envigo is expected to have favored the company s top line in the third quarter  The transaction provides Covance with better global non clinical research capabilities while sustaining access to bigger research models and services through a multi year renewable supply agreement For 2019  on an overall basis  management envisions modest growth in total revenues as well as the adjusted EPS  The company expects another year of approximately  1 billion in free cash flow  All these are likely to get reflected in third quarter performance Which Way Are Estimates Trending The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third quarter earnings of  2 84 indicates a 3 7  rise from the year ago reported figure  The consensus estimate for revenues is pegged at  2 91 billion  suggesting a 2 8  increase from the prior year reported number What the Quantitative Model SuggestsPer our proven model  a stock needs to have a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  to deliver a positive

110485,332000,LH,Special Report  Scientists describe problems in Philip Morris e cigarette experiments,news,By Tom Lasseter  Paritosh Bansal  Thomas Wilson  Ami Miyazaki Duff Wilson and Aditya Kalra TOKYO NEUCHATEL  Switzerland  Reuters    The U S  Food and Drug Administration is weighing whether to approve a potentially path breaking smoking device by Philip Morris International Inc  N PM   With a decision expected next year  former employees and contractors have described to Reuters a number of irregularities involving clinical trials that underpin the tobacco giant s application to the agency  By heating tobacco instead of burning it  the company says the device  known as iQOS  avoids subjecting smokers to the same levels of carcinogens and other toxic substances found in a regular cigarette  The company has spent more than  3 billion developing new smoking platforms like iQOS  As part of that initiative  Philip Morris has published extensive scientific findings  based in part on clinical studies  Tamara Koval  who worked at the company from 2012 to 2014 and helped coordinate clinical trials for the device  questioned the quality of some of the researchers and sites contracted to carry out those experiments  Koval was a co author of the company s protocol used to run the studies globally  When she highlighted an irregularity in one of the studies  Koval said  Philip Morris excluded her from meetings  Reuters also found irregularities during interviews with some of the principal investigators contracted to conduct the trials for the company  One principal investigator said he knew nothing about tobacco  Philip Morris had to jettison the experiment that investigator performed after it emerged he hadn t followed a basic procedure for obtaining informed consent from participants during clinical trials  A second investigator submitted urine samples that exceeded what a human being is capable of  according to two former company employees  and then initially refused to acknowledge there was a problem  A third said he doesn t hold such company sponsored clinical trials in high regard  describing them as  dirty  because their purpose is more commercial than scientific  After reviewing Reuters  findings  Philip Morris said in a statement that  all studies were conducted by suitably qualified and trained Principal Investigators   The company said it understands that  FDA inspectors have already audited some facilities  involved in the trials  Philip Morris also said it had taken steps to address  any reported irregularity in our studies    Our policies encourage speaking up about suspected violations of law or our policies and we do not tolerate retaliation against those who speak up   the company said  In addition to former Philip Morris employees involved with the iQOS program  Reuters interviewed six of the 11 principal investigators who were responsible for five of eight clinical trials the company submitted to the FDA  Reuters also reviewed hundreds of pages of publicly available Philip Morris study reports and FDA filings  That reporting identified shortcomings in the training and professionalism of some of the lead investigators  as well as their knowledge of the study results  A group of tobacco research and policy experts reviewed detailed summaries of Reuters  reporting and Philip Morris  response  The experts  including a former head of the FDA and two former scientific advisers for the agency  said those findings raise concerns about Philip Morris  clinical trial program   Taken as a whole  it s clear they do not have the sophistication to carry out adequate and well controlled clinical trials   said David Kessler  the FDA s commissioner from 1990 to 1997  referring to the company   I am not inferring any malicious intent here  just that they lack sophistication  because this is not their bread and butter   If the FDA has already audited some of the trial sites used by Philip Morris  the agency  should carefully review its audits and possibly expand them   said Kessler  a former dean of the medical school at Yale University   THE FDA SHOULD AUDIT  Tom Eissenberg  who served on the FDA s tobacco products scientific advisory committee until earlier this year  said   The FDA should audit   Reuters did not find any evidence that the outcome of the experiments presented by the company to the FDA was manipulated or falsified   The new insights into the company s clinical trial program for iQOS come at a crucial time for Philip Morris  The world s largest publicly traded tobacco company by market value and maker of Marlboro cigarettes has applied to the U S  FDA to be able to sell iQOS in America  and also for permission to market it as a modified risk tobacco product  That designation could mean that Philip Morris is allowed to market iQOS as presenting less harm or risk of disease to users than traditional tobacco  For now  the FDA is evaluating the company s studies  Reuters outlined its findings about the iQOS trials to the agency  The FDA said it cannot comment on a pending application  Philip Morris says the device  which heats small tobacco inserts  is meant for smokers who would not otherwise quit  Its chief executive officer  Andre Calantzopoulos  has told investors and media alike that he intends to one day replace cigarettes with products like iQOS  So far  iQOS makes up a fraction of the company s  75 billion revenues and Philip Morris continues to market conventional cigarettes across the globe  Internal Philip Morris documents reviewed by Reuters show the significance of iQOS goes beyond its profit potential  The device is now sold in more than two dozen nations after it was first launched in Japan and Italy during late 2014  The company has a 10 year plan for what it calls  normalization  of the tobacco industry  according to a 2014 strategy document  The industry has been shunned over the past two decades for producing and marketing products that kill people and previously lying about it  Under a section on  strategies and actions  to achieve that goal  the document lists  among other things  new smoking devices such as iQOS and the scientific research involved in developing them  Told about that document  Philip Morris said   The suggestion that the purpose of our development of IQOS and our scientific research program is to  normalize  the tobacco industry is false   That previously undisclosed document and others can be found in a searchable repository published by Reuters  The Philip Morris Files      I JUST DON T READ THEM  As part of its submission to the U S  FDA  the company said the results of its research showed the device significantly reduced the level of certain harmful substances that users were exposed to compared with cigarettes  and satisfied their nicotine cravings   In fact the level of reduction is so considerable  it approaches 95  of the levels measured in smokers who quit altogether   the company said in a statement to Reuters  Taken along with the company s laboratory studies  Philip Morris said  the research program  in its entirety demonstrates that IQOS is likely to reduce the risk of smoking related diseases   Philip Morris is responsible for the majority of the science that has been published about iQOS   Those who criticize us should probably look at our science   said Tommaso Di Giovanni  a company spokesman  during a tour of Philip Morris  research and development headquarters in March  The eight clinical experiments that Philip Morris submitted to the FDA were conducted between 2013 and 2015  For one study  scientists in Texas and Florida did not respond to messages left by Reuters  Other scientists  in Belfast and Tokyo  declined to talk  Half of the eight studies were done in Japan  FDA guidelines for conducting clinical studies say a trial should adhere to standards such as Good Clinical Practice  That best practices document says investigators  should be qualified by training and experience and should have adequate resources  to properly conduct a trial  Masayuki Sugimoto  the principal investigator who oversaw testing at one facility used by Philip Morris to conduct a trial  said his Tokyo clinic is  heavily in the red   Sugimoto said he generally has little confidence that all the participants in experiments like the one he ran for Philip Morris on nicotine tell the truth about their smoking history   that is  whether they smoke  Speaking about the final study report from the Philip Morris trial  Sugimoto said in an interview that he generally doesn t have time to read such things in detail  He said he probably signed a document indicating he had received the final report  Sugimoto gestured with his thumb and forefinger to indicate a thick document   I just don t read them   Philip Morris said that it  did not receive any such comments or statements from the PI   or principal investigator  Sugimoto s study  it said  was completed  without any issues   The company said the study data was reviewed and discussed with the investigator throughout the trial  The Japanese company hired to monitor studies in the country   CMIC Holdings  Co Ltd  T 2309   said in a statement that researchers confirmed that trial participants were smokers by using urine tests  Asked about the tests  Sugimoto said he thought they would prevent non smokers from joining the trial but added   I don t know whether they were done that rigorously   Told of Sugimoto s doubts about the honesty of study participants  Eissenberg  who served on the FDA s tobacco products scientific advisory committee from 2011 to 2017  said  it raises a great deal of concern   A principal investigator  is required to make sure that the participants meet the inclusion exclusion criteria that are in the protocol   said Eissenberg  He was referring to the fact that clinical trial subjects  backgrounds   such as whether they are smokers   should meet the parameters of the experiment for the data to be valid   And a PI should have confidence in that   he said  DATA DISCARDED At another laboratory in Japan  issues with how the study was carried out were so acute that data from 56 participants was thrown out  raising questions about the competence of the principal investigator  Philip Morris halted the study at that location  In the company s study documentation released by the FDA  Philip Morris recorded the reason for discarding the data as non compliance with good clinical practices  specifically  failure of the site to meet sample collection procedures and data recording procedures   Kishor Lad  who was Philip Morris  data manager on the study  said the site crossed a line of what s allowed during such trials  It collected samples before getting informed consent forms signed by the volunteers   Completely a no no in the GCP world   Lad said  using the acronym for good clinical practice  Philip Morris confirmed to Reuters that  informed consent was not obtained prior to execution of a study procedure    specifically  the collection of urine samples  The problem was identified by CMIC  the contract research group  during a routine monitoring visit  Philip Morris said  A subsequent round of audits  it added   led to prompt discontinuation of the study at the Seishukai Clinic   The incident  the company said  was properly logged in the study report and the submission to the FDA   It suggests the investigator had no idea  did not understand or just didn t care what his responsibilities were in conducting the study   said Greg Koski  a former director of the U S  federal Office for Human Research Protections  which advocates for research subjects   This is such a flagrant violation  that investigator shouldn t be doing clinical studies   Mamoru Oki was the principal investigator at the time at the facility  the Seishukai Clinic in Tokyo  Reached by phone  Oki said   My specialty is urology and I don t know anything about tobacco  so I cannot talk   Told of that remark  Philip Morris said   Dr  Oki was qualified and trained specifically on the product   Dorothy Hatsukami  a member of the FDA s tobacco products scientific advisory committee from 2010 to 2013  said a principal investigator s professed lack of knowledge about tobacco is not ideal   For any tobacco related clinical trial  an investigator with a background in tobacco product research would have better qualifications to evaluate the study results than a novice   she said  The study continued at a parallel site  the Tokyo Heart Center   During an interview at the center  principal investigator Masahiro Endo said repeatedly that he had no idea what the results were from his study   We did medically safe and accurate blood samples  but were not told the results  So even if we are asked questions  we won t be able to answer   he said   We were paid  it ended there   But in a statement signed last year and submitted by Philip Morris to the FDA  Endo said he had read the clinical study report from the company and confirmed  that to the best of my knowledge it accurately describes the conduct and results of the study   Principal investigators in all of the Philip Morris clinical trials signed the same statement  A day after speaking with Reuters  Endo sent an email clarifying that after checking his records he saw that he d signed a receipt saying he received a report on the results and acknowledging that he d be listed as the principal investigator  He had spoken during the interview  with a fuzzy memory   Endo said   LESSER OF TWO EVILS  Clinical trial experts interviewed by Reuters said it s not uncommon for principal investigators to be unaware of test results sent to a third party specialty laboratory for analysis  But they also emphasized that if companies want better science  they need the investigators to be more involved with all aspects of a study   It seems like the investigator here is in the role of a technician  not as a principal investigator   said Kessler  the former FDA commissioner  Kessler said it s hard to understand how such investigators could have signed off on the clinical study report  when they clearly were not versed in the study results   Other principal investigators described their work differently  Fumimasa Nobuoka  a principal investigator on one of the trials in Japan  said he read the Philip Morris study report   I thought it was well done  well written   James Borders  who was the principal investigator for a study held in Lexington  Kentucky  said the experiments in his trial were done ethically and followed sound scientific practice  Borders  who became chief medical officer at the Baptist Health Lexington hospital  said such studies help consumers make an informed decision  His decision to be involved with the study  he said  hinged on the proposition that a device like iQOS could be the  lesser of two evils   Philip Morris said that while it sponsored the clinical trials  the experiments were  performed by reputable research facilities  and monitored by contract research organizations   companies used to oversee such studies  It hired U S  based Covance Inc to serve as its global contract research organization  according to an internal Philip Morris 2013 assessment plan  Covance  a unit of Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings  N LH   declined to comment  CMIC  the company hired to monitor the Japan studies  said in a statement   All the clinical trials you referred to were conducted in accordance with GCP guidelines    good clinical practices    and we believe that the results of the trials are scientifically trustworthy   As part of her job coordinating between Philip Morris and those contracted to run its clinical trials  Koval  the former company scientist  conducted medical safety training across the world for principal investigators and others involved with the iQOS studies  During one study training session in Tokyo  Koval said  she realized some of the researchers could not speak English well and she was unable to communicate with them  Koval said she does not speak Japanese and there was no interpreter present   I was like  Jesus  what are we doing here   she said  At dinner later  Koval said  she saw two of the men  and they were unable to describe in English what their jobs were  When asked about Koval s session  Philip Morris said it was a meeting with its contract research organization and others  It added that  all PIs and team members with active roles in the study were fluent in English   But Sugimoto  one of the Japanese principal investigators  told Reuters in an interview   I can t speak English   And Endo  another of the lead researchers  said that when Philip Morris executives visited his site someone was present who helped translate  questions like whether to cut the crusts off bread  when giving food to study subjects  CMIC said   All the principal investigators received adequate training in Japanese before the trial began   URINE SAMPLES In Poland  some urine samples collected as part of one Philip Morris clinical study exceeded the limits of what a human being is capable of producing in a single day  according to Koval and Lad  the former clinical data manager  Lad  who worked at Philip Morris from 2012 to 2015  said he didn t think anything  malicious  had happened  Maybe urine samples were swapped or there was a mistake with the containers used to collect the urine  he said  But when the principal investigator for the Polish site was asked about the results  she would not admit there was a problem  Lad and Koval said  Instead  they said  the scientist explained that the test subjects were large Polish men  Philip Morris said that  a few participants  in an early stage of the trial  produced unusually large volumes of urine   Because medical tests showed no problems with the subjects  the company said  the investigator did not initially consider the samples to be  adverse events   After discussion with the medical monitors of the study as well as Philip Morris  the investigator  ultimately decided to mark these incidences as adverse events   the company said  An investigation at the site confirmed that researchers had followed study protocol and good clinical practices  the company said  The principal investigator running the study in Poland for Philip Morris  Katarzyna Jarus Dziedzic  declined to discuss what happened with the urine case at her site  citing confidentiality   Koval said that after she raised concerns about the Polish study with Philip Morris executives in Switzerland she was excluded from meetings  Philip Morris said in a statement that Koval was  part of the team  that followed up on the urine samples  In fact  the company said  she was  an active member  of the group that finalized the data set from the studies for further analysis  Koval confirmed that she was part of the team and involved with the data set  But she stood by her account that she was shut out of conversations and meetings about the urine samples  In 2014  Philip Morris terminated her contract  Koval said  She said she returned to the pharmaceutical industry a few months later and now works for Swiss drugs giant  Novartis  AG  S NOVN   After leaving Philip Morris  Koval was given a certificate of service that said   Tamara drove clinical program development activities   It said she had demonstrated  professionalism  and  unwavering commitment  in her work
