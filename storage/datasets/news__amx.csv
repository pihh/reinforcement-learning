206050,427566,AMX,Only One Sector Has A Rising ROIC,opinion,"Only one sector  the Telecom sector  has a rising ROIC  The Telecom sector   and specifically BCE  NYSE BCE    is this week s Long Idea 
Improving Returns in Telecoms
Not only does the Telecom sector have a rising ROIC over the TTM period  its ROIC has risen every year since 2015  as shown in Figure 1  The sector also generates consistently positive economic earnings due to the fact that its ROIC is higher than its weighted average cost of capital  WACC  
Figure 1  Telecom ROIC vs  WACC  2015 TTM 1 







Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings  
Improving margins are driving the rising ROIC for this sector  The aggregate NOPAT margin for the sector rose from 10 2  in 2015 to 12 6  TTM  Invested capital turns have fallen from 0 46 to 0 42 over the same times  Firms in this industry have become less efficient at turning capital into revenue  but they ve become much more efficient at cutting costs and turning more revenue into profit 
Appendix II shows NOPAT margin and invested capital turns for all 11 sectors going back to 1998 
While the Telecom sector is profitable overall  profitability is highly concentrated  Just four companies   Verizon  NYSE VZ   Nippon Telegraph and Telephone  NTTYY   BCE Inc   BCE   and  America Movil   NYSE AMX    earned  19 billion in economic earnings over the TTM period  The remaining 33 companies we cover in the sector combined for  14 billion in economic losses 
This high level of concentration proves diligence remains important  The Telecom sector may be Very Attractive overall  but there are still plenty of risky stocks in the sector that investors should avoid 
One Stock to Buy in the Telecom Sector
Investors looking to find value in the Telecom sector should start by looking at the four most profitable companies in the industry per above  
BCE is another one of our top picks in the sector  The Canadian telecom giant shares many of the same traits that make us bullish on Verizon  including 

The fastest network in its market  which allows it to grow its market share while also increasing its average revenue per user


Growth potential over the next several years due to the upcoming deployment of 5G technology


A cheap valuation and high dividend yield  which is supported by ample free cash flow

From 2015 2018  BCE grew its after tax operating profit  NOPAT  by 4  compounded annually while maintaining a consistent ROIC of  8   Over the TTM period  NOPAT is up 3  year over year while ROIC remains steady 
Meanwhile  BCE s stock has been almost flat  up just 2  over the past five years  It appears that the market does not recognize the value of this company s cash flows 
At its current valuation of  48 share  BCE has a price to economic book value  PEBV  of 0 8  This ratio means the market expects BCE s NOPAT to permanently decline by 20   For a company with BCE s track record of consistent profit growth  this expectation seems overly pessimistic 
If BCE can maintain its 2018 NOPAT margin of 18  and grow NOPAT by 2  compounded annually for the next decade  the stock is worth  70 share today  a 46  upside to the current stock price  See the math behind this dynamic DCF scenario 
BCE also offers a 5  dividend yield  which is well supported by the cumulative  9 billion  22  of market cap  in free cash flow it earned from 2015 2018  Investors in BCE get both a steady income and the opportunity for capital appreciation ",2019-12-05,Sam McBride,https://www.investing.com/analysis/only-one-sector-has-a-rising-roic-200490277,200490277

206084,427600,AMX,Mexico s 2 5 GHZ Wireless Spectrum Auction In Q1 ,opinion,Mexico s telecom regulatory authority  the Federal Telecommunications Institute  IFT   recently confirmed that it will start the auction process of the 2 5 GHz  2500 2690 MHz  wireless frequency band before March 2018 The auction process was deferred thrice due to the bidding schedule for 4G LTE shared wireless network  using 90 MHz of spectrum within the 700 MHz band  Notably  wireless spectrums of 2 5 GHz band are highly suitable for the deployment of 4G LTE networks The IFT has decided to auction a total of 120MHz spectrums on the 2 5GHz band in six blocks of 20MHz each  This includes four for FDD LTE services and two for TDD LTE  The concessions will be for 20 years and the minimum value of each block will be MXN 350 million  Moreover  another 10 MHz will be reserved as  guard band  spectrum Meanwhile  Mexican telecom behemoth America Movil SAB   NYSE AMX   is aggressively being resisted by its rivals from taking part in the upcoming 2 5 GHz wireless spectrum auction  Notably  in July 2017  America Movil  the undisputed leader of the Mexican telecom market  purchased 60 MHz of wireless spectrum in the 2 5 GHz band from Grupo MVS  For the last couple of years  America Movil has been systematically enriching its spectrum portfolio In June 2016  the IFT granted concessions for the 1710 1780 MHz 2110 2180 MHz AWS frequency bands to America Movil and AT T Inc    NYSE T    On Feb 15  2016  the IFT opened an auction for 80 MHz of wireless spectrum across various Advanced Wireless Services  AWS  bands  America Movil and AT T emerged winners of the spectrum auction Given this scenario  America Movil s rivals  namely  Telefonica SA   NYSE T    AT T  Totalplay  Cablevision  NYSE CVC  and Axtel have pointed out to the IFT that the company should be banned from taking part in the 2 5 GHz spectrum auction  or it will lead to excessive spectrum going into the hands of a particular wireless operator which controls almost 70  of the Mexican wireless space In 2014  the government of Mexico introduced some major reforms within its telecom sector  Per the IFT norms  the maximum hold of a company in any specific market has been restricted to 50   However  about 68  and 70  of telecom space is controlled by America Movil s wireline and wireless divisions  respectively  This has induced IFT to identify the company as a dominant player and has imposed stringent regulations on it Another incumbent telecom operator  Telefonica  holds nearly 20  market share  In 2015  U S  telecom behemoth AT T entered the Mexican telecom industry after acquiring Grupo Iusacell and Nextel de Mexico  Additionally  Mexican cable MSO  multi service operator  Grupo Televisa S A    NYSE T    has also received a go ahead from the IFT to enter the wireless space  However  the company is yet to take any decision in this regard Mexico is the largest economy in the Latin American region  with a growing middle class population that is eager to spend more on high speed wireless networks for optimal use of smartphones and tablets  Also the wireless penetration rate is relatively lower in the country compared with that in the United States  We  therefore  expect increased competition in this market AT T  Telefonica and Televisa currently carry a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   while America Movil carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as the  1 stock to buy according to Zacks research It s not the one you think ,2017-12-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/mexicos-25-ghz-wireless-spectrum-auction-in-q1-200272848,200272848

206095,427611,AMX,Here s Why Investors Should Buy America Movil  AMX  Stock ,opinion,"On Sep 14  we issued an updated research report on Mexican telecom behemoth  America Movil SAB   NYSE AMX   
The price performance of the company has been encouraging for the last six months  The stock price increased 38 8  compared with the  s gain of 3 7  over the same time period 
 

 
This Zacks Rank  2  Buy  company  recently received regulatory approval from Argentina s National Communications Agency  Enacom  to enter into the pay TV market of that country  Notably  the company has established both wireless and wireline operators in Argentina 
Furthermore  America Movil has been steadily enriching its spectrum portfolio for the last couple of years  Lately  it acquired 60 MHz of wireless spectrum  airwave  in the 2 5 GHz band from Grupo MVS  In May  Mexican telecom regulator  Federal Telecommunications Institute  approved this deal  However  the financial terms are yet to be disclosed  Going forward  we believe this buyout will enhance the company s high speed data service 
Meanwhile  this telecom behemoth s continuous participation in spectrum auctions for the deployment of 4G LTE services and expansion of 3G footprints looks impressive  It launched also fourth generation mobile services in 11 cities across Mexico and introduced LTE services in Brazil where it currently covers 18 cities 
Moreover  America Movil s wireless wing Telcel entered into a wireless roaming agreement with AT T Inc    NYSE T   for its Mexican users lately  It should be note that Telcel is the undisputed leader in the Mexican wireless market with substantial market share

206113,427629,AMX,Why Should You Dump America Movil  AMX  From Your Portfolio ,opinion,"On Jul 18  2017  Mexican telecom behemoth  America Movil SAB   NYSE AMX   was downgraded to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  
The company follows an aggressive promotional strategy  which includes discounts and subsidized offers to increase its smartphone sales figures  which is driving down margins  The expansion of low margin businesses like PayTV and TracFone remains detrimental to its growth 
America Movil s Brazilian operation  Claro  faces competitive threat from Vivo  owned by Telefonica  MC TEF  Brazil SA  VIV   Also  U S  telecom giant  AT T Inc  s   NYSE T   entry into the Mexican telecom industry with the acquisition of Gurpo Iusacell and Nextel de Mexico was a major setback for the company  Moreover  AT T has climbed to the highest position in the U S  pay TV market with the acquisition of satellite TV operator DIRECTV  This may impact America Movil s market position as DIRECTV is an existing competitor of the company in Mexico and other Latin American countries 
The recent imposition of antitrust rules against the company by the Mexican telecom regulatory authority  the Federal Telecommunications Institute  IFT   was a major setback  The IFT wants America Movil to detach a large part of its fixed line infrastructure  Notably  the company has both wireline  Telmex  and wireless  Telcel  operations  If regulatory concerns and competition continue to mount  its top and bottom lines could be dented further 
Also  America Movil s cash and liquidity position seems to be a major concern  Its accumulating debt and decreasing cash flows may pose problems for credit ratings going ahead  However  the company s focus on shifting its base from Mexico to Brazil in the wake of declining profits is viable 
Price Performance
Despite such negatives  the price performance of America Movil was impressive over the past six months  The stock has gained 33 0   outshining the Zacks categorized industry s increase of 4 3  over the same time frame

206114,427630,AMX,Will Telefonica Brasil  VIV  Disappoint In Q2 Earnings ,opinion,"Brazilian telecom carrier  Telefonica  MC TEF  Brasil SA   NYSE VIV   is expected to report second quarter 2017 financial numbers on Jul 26  before market opens 
Last quarter  the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 5 00   Moreover  earnings failed to surpass the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters  with an average negative surprise of 13 04  
The price performance of Telefonica Brasil was depressing for the last six months  The stock witnessed a loss of 1 9  as opposed to the 4 5  growth of its  

Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors at Play
Telefonica Brasil continues to face numerous hurdles in its fixed line voice and wireless businesses  The fixed line voice business is facing competition from alternative service offerings like wireless telephony  VoIP  voice over Internet Protocol  and cable services  voice  video and broadband  
Customers in the wireless segment are opting for discounted calling rates offered by national wireless operators  The company is also experiencing revenue loss  especially in Pay TV and Fixed access business units  It is caused by a rise in MMDS  Multichannel Multipoint Distribution Service  customer churn following spectrum acquisition by 4G operators 
Furthermore  the telecom carrier shares competitive space with the likes of America Movil SAB   NYSE AMX   in Brazil  U S  telecom giant  AT T Inc    NYSE T    may also enter the Brazilian market in the future and intensify competition   Moreover  the combined company operates in a highly regulated industry and is subject to changes in regulatory measures 
However  Telefonica Brasil continues to rule the Brazilian wireless market following the establishment of Vivo as a commercial brand for all services  The company s increased investments in technology upgrades and broadband network infrastructure has helped it to sustain in a competitive and rapidly changing market  It continues to fortify its leadership in data and post paid segments through attractive data plans and intends to launch more such schemes in the near future 
The company s efforts have been attracting customers  leading to subscriber growth and higher data usage 
Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Telefonica Brasil is likely to beat on earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here  as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Telefonica Brasil has an Earnings ESP of 0 00   This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 23 cents  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Zacks Rank  Telefonica Brasil has a Zacks Rank  3  which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  the company s 0 00  ESP makes surprise prediction difficult 
We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Stock to ConsiderTelefonica Brasil S A  Price and EPS Surprise   Atmos Energy Corporation   NYSE ATO   from the broader  has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat when it reports third quarter 2017 results on Aug 02  The company has an Earnings ESP of  4 55  and a Zacks Rank  2  You can see

206115,427631,AMX,Here s Why Investors Should Hold America Movil Amid Risks,opinion,"On Aug 14  Mexican telecom behemoth  America Movil SAB   NYSE AMX   was upgraded to Zacks Rank  3  Hold  
The price performance of the company has been encouraging for the last six months  While the stock price increased 37 8   the  gained 7 3  over the same time period 

In fact  America Movil has been systematically enriching its spectrum portfolio for the last couple of years  Evidently  it acquired 60 MHz of wireless spectrum  airwave  in the 2 5 GHz band from Grupo MVS  recently  In May  Mexican telecom regulator  Federal Telecommunications Institute  IFT   approved this deal  However  the financial terms are yet to be disclosed  Going forward  we believe this buyout will enhance the company s high speed data service 
According to a recent report by the Competitive Intelligence Unit  America Movil s wireless division  Telcel  is dominating mobile number porting in the Mexican region 
Meanwhile  the company s continuous participation in spectrum auctions for the deployment of 4G LTE services and expansion of 3G footprints looks impressive  Also  it launched fourth generation  4G  mobile services in 11 cities across Mexico 
Furthermore  America Movil introduced LTE services in Brazil where it currently covers 18 cities 
However  this telecom behemoth s aggressive promotional strategy that includes discounts and subsidized offers continues to hurt its margins  Moreover  the company s Brazilian operation  Claro  faces competitive threat from Vivo  owned by Telefonica  MC TEF  Brazil SA   NYSE VIV    In addition  U S  telecom giant AT T Inc  s   NYSE T   entry into the Mexican telecom industry with the acquisition of Gurpo Iusacell and Nextel de Mexico  was a major setback for the company

Notably  the company s exclusive tablet s key feature is  TV Mode  which allows the customer to access their favorite pre installed video apps like DIRECTV and DirecTV Now  in a touch or swipe  
Also  it embraces features like high quality HD video  dual front facing speakers with Dolby audio  10 inch Full HD screen  dual Bluetooth media streamsand long lasting battery  Moreover  Primetime supports Android for Work and Enterprise Mobility Management services 
In fact  AT T Unlimited Plus or AT T Unlimited Choice customers can include Primetime in their package by paying an additional  20 for a month  Otherwise customers can avail the tablet for either  10 a month for 20 months or for  30  within a two year contract 
Meanwhile  we note that the launch of the AT T s entertainment focused tablet is a step forward to expand beyond its core telecom business into digital media and advertising as it is interested in generating cross platform advertising revenues 
In line with its efforts to develop its digital media business AT T recently agreed to acquire media giant  Time Warner Inc    NYSE TWX    worth a  85 4 billion cash and stock deal  If the proposed merger finally goes through  the combined entity will become a major player in the consolidated telecom media space 
We believe the merger with Time Warner might provide AT T a portfolio of lucrative contents as it will give the company an ownership of Warner Bros  Pictures  HBO and Turner networks such as CNN  TBS and TNT  The combined entity is also likely to pose challenges to the leading cable MSO  multi service operator  and media and entertainment firm  Comcast Corp    NASDAQ CMCSA    which acquired NBC Universal in 2011

206119,427635,AMX,Telecom Italia to go ahead with bid for Vivendi s GVT,news,"By Stefano Rebaudo  Stephen Jewkes and Pamela Barbaglia
MILAN  Reuters    Telecom Italia  MI TLIT  will make a bid valued at roughly 7 billion euros   9 2 billion  for Vivendi s Brazilian broadband unit GVT  PA VIV   which would leave Vivendi with a 15 to 20 percent stake in the Italian group  said four people familiar with the matter 
Telecom Italia is competing with Spain s Telefonica  MC TEF  for control of GVT  which sells high end broadband and pay TV packages to consumers in Brazil 
Telefonica  Telecom Italia s biggest shareholder  offered Vivendi  PA VIV  around 4 billion euros in cash for GVT plus a 12 percent stake in the newly combined group 
Brazil is crucial for both Telefonica and Telecom Italia  because its market still has growth potential  especially in broadband and pay TV  compared with the more mature market in Europe 
They already control the two largest mobile operators there  Telefonica s Vivo  SA VIVT3  and Telecom Italia s Tim Brasil  SA TIMP3  
Acquiring GVT would be especially important for Telecom Italia since it is the only Brazilian mobile operator without a fixed line network and has a market share of less than 1 percent in broadband 
Telefonica had an 18 4 percent broadband market share at the end of the first quarter  behind America Movil  MX AMXL  and Oi  SA OIBR3   while GVT had 12 7 percent 
Telecom Italia s offer  set to be discussed at a board meeting on Wednesday  is structured around a merger of GVT with TIM Brasil 
Vivendi would be paid with a 15 to 20 percent stake in Telecom Italia via a reserved capital increase and would also get a small amount of cash  the sources said  without elaborating on the amount  It would also retain a roughly 12 percent stake in the Tim Brasil GVT combined entity  one person close to the deal said 
VIVENDI TO CONSIDER
It remains to be seen how Vivendi will respond to the dueling bids for GVT  The board of Vivendi is expected to discuss the situation at a meeting before second quarter results are published on Thursday 
The Paris based group has sold two of its three telecoms businesses in the past two years in an effort to refocus on its media activities  which include Universal Music Group and French pay TV operator Canal Plus 
A sale of GVT  its last telecoms asset and smallest business  would fit that pattern  although Vivendi said in early August after Telefonica s bid that none of its units were for sale 
A spokesman for Vivendi said on Tuesday that any offers it received for GVT would be reviewed by the board 
Telefonica and Telecom Italia declined to comment 
Telecom Italia has less balance sheet flexibility than Telefonica  and the cash portion of its offer is expected to be lower than the rival bid  the sources said 
But Telecom Italia is pinning its hopes on the fact that Vivendi does not need cash after agreeing this spring to sell its largest unit  French telco SFR  for roughly 17 billion euros and that its powerful chairman and largest shareholder  Vincent Bollore  could be keen to expand in Italy  one of the sources said 
 Vivendi is not all that interested in cash  since it s got plenty already  but wants a strategic deal where it can sell its content   a person close to the Italian company said 
To that end  Telecom Italia is casting its offer as providing a way for Vivendi to distribute its music and television content in Italy  the source said 
Telecom Italia is also hoping personal ties will tip the balance in its favor 
French tycoon Bollore owns 7 percent of Mediobanca  MI MDBI   the investment bank that has long been at the heart of Italy s high finance  according to the bank s website  Mediobanca is also one of Telecom Italia s advisers on the GVT deal 
Telefonica too has included a clause in its GVT bid that would allow Vivendi a way to distribute more of its television content  a source said on Aug  18 
Italian newspapers said on Tuesday Telefonica could increase its overall offer for GVT to as much as 8 billion euros and that Bollore was meeting with Telefonica Chief Executive Cesar Alierta

206120,427636,AMX,Brazil telecom battle heats up as Oi tries to buy  split TIM,news,"By Luciana Bruno and Leila Abboud  RIO DE JANEIRO PARIS  Reuters    Brazil s Grupo Oi SA unveiled plans on Wednesday to take over Telecom Italia s local mobile unit  in a move sources said was aimed at breaking up the country s second biggest wireless carrier and upstaging merger bids by foreign rivals   Oi said on Wednesday that it hired Brazilian investment bank and shareholder Grupo BTG Pactual SA to explore alternatives to acquire Telecom Italia SpA s 67 percent stake in TIM Participa  es SA  the country s second biggest wireless carrier   Oi s plan is to bring in Mexico s America Movil SAB de CV and Spain s Telefonica SA in a deal to split TIM three ways  easing the financial and regulatory burdens of consolidation  according to two sources who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the deal   The move adds a new twist to the bidding war for Vivendi SA s Brazilian broadband unit GVT  which both Telecom Italia and Spain s Telefonica SA are pursuing to bolster their mobile businesses in the country   Telecom Italia said in a statement that it knew nothing about the move  was not involved in the plans  and saw TIM as a  strategic asset     Telecom giants are jostling for position in Brazil as they struggle to add customers  invest in high speed networks and protect profits in a stagnant economy  Those pressures have added to growing expectations of potential mergers  following a trend sweeping markets from Austria to Ireland   Oi has been sidelined in the consolidation  stuck with a fourth place wireless carrier and 46 billion reais   20 billion  in debt after a rocky merger with Portugal Telecom SGPS SA   To overcome financial and regulatory hurdles  Oi turned to BTG Pactual  a deep pocketed shareholder that put up 2 billion reais to make sure the Portugal Telecom deal went through  two sources with knowledge of the deal said   Oi asked BTG Pactual to act as  merchant commissioner   creating a special investment vehicle of the kind that has been used to break up companies among multiple buyers   The Telecom Italia board  which met for nearly nine hours on the GVT bid on Wednesday  commented on Oi s move afterwards  saying Telecom Italia  is completely extraneous to the Oi SA initiative about which it knows nothing     A separate statement detailing its offer for GVT is expected on Thursday morning   Telefonica was also set to meet on Wednesday to discuss its bid  The deals are estimated to be worth 7 billion euros   9 billion   Vivendi is expected to hold a board meeting on Thursday    Oi  Telefonica and America Movil  Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim s telecom giant  have been discussing a potential joint bid for TIM since late last year  according to several sources  America Movil owns Brazil s No  3 wireless carrier and its biggest broadband operator     We would expect Telefonica and America Movil to join Oi  as BTG Pactual works as the intermediary and figures out a way for them to buy TIM   said Mauricio Fernandes  an analyst with Bank of America Merrill Lynch   Breaking up TIM would likely reduce the financial burden for rivals and facilitate regulatory approval  said Antonio Espirito Santo  an analyst with Banco Espirito Santo in Sao Paulo  That scenario would also trigger significant cost savings for Oi  with an acquisition in the region of 35 percent helping save about 12 billion reais  he added    Any move to consolidate Brazil s mobile market will face close scrutiny from antitrust regulators  who have expressed concern that fewer players will weaken competition   Capital spending increases and diminishing returns have driven telecom mergers around the world but in Brazil  issues surrounding Oi s merger with Portugal Telecom and the bidding war for GVT have muddied the waters    Preferred shares of Oi soared more than 5 percent in Sao Paulo  while the price for the company s 5 75 percent bond due in February 2022 dropped 2 5 cents on the U S  dollar to 94 75 cents   indicating that investors expect Oi to fund any deal with more debt    BOARD MEETINGS  Oi s move shook up a key day for its European rivals   Sources told Reuters Telecom Italia s bid for GVT would value the company at roughly 7 billion euros and leave Vivendi with a 15 to 20 percent stake in the Italian group   Telefonica s board was also set to meet on Wednesday to discuss improving its bid for GVT as it seeks to head off Telecom Italia  according to a person familiar with the matter     It will be higher than  Telefonica s original  6 7 billion euros  but it won t be as much as 8 billion euros   the source said  referring to a figure cited in newspaper reports   Telefonica declined comment  Vivendi is expected to discuss the GVT offers at a meeting before it publishes second quarter results on Thursday   Telecom Italia shares were up 3 2 percent at the end of Wednesday  while Vivendi s were up 1 2 percent  Telefonica was up 0 04 percent   Telecom Italia executives have said Brazil was core to its strategy but it would examine any bids it received for TIM    This places Telecom Italia under even more pressure in Brazil  as the company is apparently mulling the possibility of a counteroffer on GVT and is now faced with a bid on its local subsidiary   Espirito Santo said   The current mobile pecking order in Brazil has Telefonica with a 28 7 percent market share at the end of the first quarter  Telecom Italia s TIM with 27 percent  America Movil with 25 1 percent and Oi with 18 5 percent   In broadband  America Movil held 30 percent of the market  Oi 27 7 percent  Telefonica 18 4 percent  and GVT had 12 7 percent  Telecom Italia s lack of a fixed network has left it with less than one percent share

206122,427638,AMX,Downsized Nextel operator is not giving up the fight in Brazil,news,"By Brad Haynes and Guillermo Parra Bernal SAO PAULO  Reuters    Nextel operator NII Holdings Inc  O NIHD  is hanging on to its Brazilian unit even though the welterweight mobile carrier has filed for bankruptcy protection in the United States and sold off other Latin American operations 
To pull off a turnaround in Brazil  the carrier is counting on regulations and broadcast spectrum that  because of its razor thin market share  could give it competitive advantages unavailable to major rivals 
Such advantages would disappear if Nextel Brazil merges with a bigger carrier  one reason takeover talks never got off the ground despite a wave of mergers in the Brazilian market  according to two sources with direct knowledge of the situation 
NII Holdings  which has already sold its Chile and Peru operations and is looking to exit Argentina  will restructure its business around core markets in Mexico and Brazil  the first of those sources said 
 In Brazil  the goal is not to pursue a quick fix and sell it   that source noted  Both sources requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the bankruptcy proceedings 
After seeking protection from creditors in a New York bankruptcy court on Monday  Reston  Virginia based NII Holdings said its subsidiaries in Brazil  Mexico and Argentina would continue with  business as usual  and not take part in the process 
NII Holdings  which posted its ninth straight quarterly loss in the second quarter  declined to comment further  Its shares  which fell 37 percent to an all time low on Monday  were up nearly 4 percent at 8 6 cents in Nasdaq trading on Tuesday 
UNDERDOG ADVANTAGES
Nextel Brazil said in a statement on Monday that it  is confident in its growth outlook and reaffirms its commitment to carrying out its activities in the country  
The company had few other options  Brazil s top four carriers and a number of private equity firms had a chance to look over Nextel s numbers  but none ended up making a binding offer  the second source said 
With Nextel left out of the industry s consolidation  Grupo Oi SA  SA OIBR3  and America Movil SAB de CV  MX AMXL  should remain focused on their talks to break up rival TIM Participa  es SA  SA TIMP3   which is controlled by Telecom Italia SpA  MI TLIT   Telefonica Brasil SA  SA VIVT4  could also take part in a joint bid for TIM  sources have told Reuters 
Oi  America Movil  TIM and Telefonica each control between 19 percent and 29 percent of Brazil s wireless market  while Nextel is languishing in fifth place with about 1 percent 
Nextel has gotten help from Brazilian regulators  which exempt smaller carriers from paying interconnection fees  allowing them to offer more competitive plans to subscribers  It is also building its fourth generation  4G  cellular network in Brazil s biggest cities on leftover spectrum that bigger players cannot use without exceeding regulatory limits 
To expand its 3G coverage  Nextel struck a five year network sharing agreement with Telefonica in May  The deal gave Nextel nationwide reach with the stroke of a pen  but its own 3G and 4G infrastructure is still limited 
The Nextel network has not appealed to potential buyers because much of it is still dedicated to a decades old technology that lets customers use their cell phones like walkie talkies  Smartphones now have an array of instant messaging options that have made the push to talk function obsolete for most users 
By transitioning to a network built for modern smartphones  Nextel has begun to attract more subscribers for its 3G plans in Brazil  including 234 000 net sign ups in the second quarter  But much of that growth has come from its push to talk subscriber base  which still makes up 3 1 million of its total 4 2 million users in the country 
In Rio de Janeiro  Brazil s second biggest market  where Nextel began rolling out its 4G network in June  the company has added 70 000 subscribers for its top speed service  increasing its share of the surrounding state s postpaid market to 19 percent

America Movil  owned by billionaire Carlos Slim  in 2013 made a bid to take over all of the Dutch telecoms group but failed  when an independent foundation tasked with protecting KPN s stakeholders acquired a near 50 percent share 
The Mexican group has since reduced its stake in KPN to 21 4 percent from about 30 percent at the peak  and analysts are divided on the future of America Movil s involvement

206125,427641,AMX,AT T s Mexico deal a cheap foothold outside saturated U S  market,news,"By Marina Lopes and Christine Murray WASHINGTON MEXICO CITY  Reuters    AT T s  1 7 billion agreement to buy Iusacell  Mexico s No  3 cellular operator  puts it in the unfamiliar position of market underdog  owning an asset that may require billions in investment to catch up to the market s two larger players 
But analysts and investors say the deal could be a cheap way to get a foothold in Latin America s second largest economy and learn the market s contours before plotting more ambitious acquisitions 
To be sure  extending AT T s high speed service across the border will require significant investment in Iusacell s patchy network  marketing and new retail stores 
That growth will put AT T in direct competition with former ally Carlos Slim s America Movil  whose shares have fallen some 3 percent since news of the deal 
The acquisition comes on the eve of two back to back auctions for airwaves in the United States and follows AT T s  48 5 billion bid for satellite operator DirecTV earlier this year 
 The motive here is to continue to look for new growth opportunities  You have a very mature market in the U S   and it is apparent that they are looking to shift south   said Angelo Zino  analyst at S P Capital IQ 
Mexico has welcomed AT T with open arms 
 The announcement     confirms the confidence of foreign investors to invest in the country  a direct result of the reforms adopted by the current administration   Mexico s telecommunications and transport ministry  SCT  said 
President Enrique Pena Nieto has spearheaded an effort to shake up the telecom sector  which is dominated by America Movil 
In response to the new rules  America Movil has said it will spin off assets and reduce its market share to below the required 50 percent threshold  implying the sale of at least 19 million subscribers 
Those assets are up for grabs and AT T is a prime contender 
But AT T has other options  Smaller players like Nextel  owned by bankrupt NII Holdings  has 2 8 million subscribers  and analysts say it could be a smart next step for AT T 

The company is also likely to leverage its stake in satellite operator Sky  which has more than 6 million subscribers in Mexico  to bundle television and wireless offerings

Shares of Level 3 Communications have underperformed the Zacks categorized  industry s gain over the past six months  The stock price inched up 0 9  but failed to beat the industry s gain of 8  over the same time span 

Level 3 Communications operates in a highly competitive enterprise communications market  The company has to compete with telecom giants like Verizon Communications Inc    NYSE VZ   and AT T Inc    NYSE T   in North America and Telefonica  MC TEF   Orange   NYSE ORAN    BT Group  LON BT  and America Movil SAB   NYSE AMX   in Europe and Latin America   
The company is a facilities based provider of a range of integrated communications services  The fluctuations in the global macro economy might have an adverse effect on Level 3 Communications  business  results of operations as well as financial condition  This is because the demand for its products and services depends substantially upon the continued development and expansion of the internet  The internet serves as a communications medium and marketplace for the distribution and consumption of data and video by large enterprises and government organizations 
Customer concentration is a major concern for Level 3 Communications  The company s top 10 customers account for the majority of its total revenue  Thus  the loss of any of these customers or consolidation among them will have a significant material impact on the company s top line 
Foreign currency exchange rate risks also act as major dampeners for the company s growth prospects  As Level 3 Communications conducts a portion of its business in currencies other than the U S  dollar  its operating results could be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate volatility relative to the U S  dollar

206137,427653,AMX,What s In Store For America Movil  AMX  In Q2 Earnings ,opinion,"Mexican telecom behemoth  America Movil SAB   NYSE AMX    is slated to report second quarter 2017 results  after market close on Jul 18 
Last quarter  America Movil delivered a positive earnings surprise of 65 62   However  the company s earnings lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the previous four quarters  with an average miss of 46 89  
Despite such negatives  the price performance of America Movil was impressive over the past three months  The stock has gained 15 57   outshining the Zacks categorized  industry s increase of 3 12  over the same time frame 

Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors at Play
America Movil s aggressive promotional strategy which includes discounts and subsidized offers continues to hurt its margins  Also  the company s Brazilian operation  Claro  faces competitive threat from Vivo  owned by Telefonica  MC TEF  Brazil SA   NYSE VIV    Meanwhile  U S  telecom giant AT T Inc  s   NYSE T   entry into the Mexican telecom industry with the acquisition of Gurpo Iusacell and Nextel de Mexico was a major setback for the company 
America Movil is focused on shifting its base from Mexico to Brazil through the purchase of Oi S A  in the wake of declining profits  America Movil s cash and liquidity position are causes of concern 
The recent imposition of antitrust rules against the company by the Mexican telecom regulatory authority  the Federal Telecommunications Institute  IFT   was a major setback  The IFT wants America Movil to detach a large part of its fixed line infrastructure  Notably  America Movil has both wireline  Telmex  and wireless  Telcel  operations  If regulatory concerns and competition continue to mount  the company s top and bottom lines could be dented further 
On the other side  America Movil s continuous participation in spectrum auctions for the deployment of 4G LTE services and expansion of 3G footprint looks good  Meanwhile  the company s decision to reduce its fixed line to mobile call rates in a phased manner reflects its efforts to comply with regulations 
The company s iPhone offering has enabled it to counter competition effectively  This has boosted customer adoption of 3G services and stimulated ARPU  average revenue per user  growth  The company launched fourth generation  4G  mobile services in 11 cities across Mexico 
Furthermore  the company has introduced LTE services in Brazil where it currently covers 18 cities  We expect the company to perform well in Brazil and Mexico in the to be reported quarter as it showed continued focus on winning more contract subscribers  which in turn will minimize churn 
America Movil s agreement with its closest rival Telefonica SA to offer nationwide mobile roaming services looks good  The company currently commands more than 66  of Mexico s wireless market while Telefonica follows with over 20  share 
Earnings Whispers 
Our proven model does not conclusively show that America Movil is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  Unfortunately  that is not the case here as elaborated below 
Zacks ESP  America Movil has an Earnings ESP of 0 00   This is because the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 32 cents  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Zacks Rank  America Movil has a Zacks Rank  3 which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  the company s 0 00  ESP makes surprise prediction difficult 
We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions America Movil  S A B  de C V  Price and EPS Surprise
   Key Picks
MSCI Inc    NYSE MSCI   from the Zacks categorized broader  sector  which houses America Movil  has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in its second quarter 2017 results on Aug 3  2017  MSCI has an Earnings ESP of  2 22  and a Zacks Rank  1  You can see  
Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the previous four quarters  with an average beat of 6 32  
Today s Stocks from Zacks  Hottest Strategies 
It s hard to believe  even for us at Zacks  But while the market gained  18 8  from 2016   Q1 2017  our top stock picking screens have returned  157 0    128 0    97 8    94 7   and  90 2 respectively

206138,427654,AMX,SCENARIOS Alternative tie ups if MTN Bharti exclusivity ends,news,"By Georgina Prodhan
 LONDON  Sept 29  Reuters    A proposed  24 billion tie up
between telecoms groups MTN and Bharti Airtel faces more
regulatory uncertainty as a self imposed deadline for the
exclusivity of talks between the groups expires on Sept  30 
 Last week  India s market regulator unexpectedly altered the
country s takeover rules  meaning that South Africa s MTN might
be required to make an offer for an additional 20 percent stake
in India s Bharti 
 South Africa  eager to retain MTN s national character has
also approached Indian authorities to consider a dual listed
structure  which is not allowed under existing Indian laws 
 The parties have already twice extended deadlines for the
talks aimed at creating an emerging markets giant with more than
200 million customers across India  Africa and the Middle East 
 The deal is now believed to be in the hands of politicians 
who are broadly supportive of the proposal  as it is in line
with a trilateral economic development initiative between South
Africa  India and Brazil 
 If it falls through  the parties may well look at other
potential partners  Following is a look at some alternatives 
 
 MTN ZAIN
 MTN s Chief Executive Phuthuma Nhleko said last month MTN
could buy all or parts of Kuwaiti firm Zain s African operations
if the deal with Bharti were called off 
 But he called the possibility  very hypothetical  and his
remarks were widely interpreted as a signal to Bharti of his
frustration at the repeated delays  rather than any serious
intention to bid for parts of Zain 
 Zain s African operations are estimated to be worth about
 10 billion  MTN and Zain have five markets in common  including
Nigeria  MTN would gain from Zain s Middle Eastern presence and
Zain from MTN s strength in west and central Africa 
 But Zain s original plan to sell off its African assets may
be abandoned if a proposed sale of a controlling stake to a
consortium of telcos and investors goes ahead 
 
 MTN RELIANCE COMMUNICATIONS
 Reliance  India s second biggest mobile operator  held
exclusive talks with MTN in 2008 but called them off due to a
feud between Reliance s chairman and his estranged brother that
makes stake swap deals unlikely in the near future 
 Despite saying in December it would focus on organic growth 
Reliance has snapped up a few small emerging markets assets and
is believed to be considering more 
 The company lost to Vodafone in bidding for Hutch Essar in
2007  then the fourth largest mobile operator in India 
 
 MTN CHINA MOBILE
 China Mobile  the world s biggest mobile carrier by
subscribers  is under pressure at home from an expensive
buildout of a new  untested third generation network that it may
seek to expand to developing markets such as Africa 
 The company s chief executive told the Mobile World Congress
fair in February that economic conditions presented an
opportunity for buyers of telecom assets but the group remained
cautious about further international expansion 
 China Mobile has a patchy record on international mergers
and acquisitions  It might be more likely to look for partners
to bid for licences in developing markets instead 
 China has become Africa s top trading partner    a tenfold
increase this decade took the continent s trade with China to
 107 billion last year  overtaking trade with the United States 
 
 MTN VODAFONE
Vodafone  the world s biggest mobile group by revenue  has
pleased investors recently by repeatedly saying it favours
in market consolidation over ambitious emerging market buys 
 The British company already owns a majority stake in Vodacom
  South Africa s biggest mobile operator  and would be unlikely
to be allowed to acquire MTN s South African assets 
 But it has expressed an interest in Nigeria  a key MTN
market  Both companies operate in Ghana but have no other
significant overlap on the continent 
 
 MTN AMERICA MOVIL
 Latin American giant America Movil was considered a possible
target for MTN after its talks with Reliance broke down last
year  and before MTN and Bharti resumed talks 
 The Mexican carrier  Latin America s biggest cellphone
operator  is active in 18 countries in North  Central and South
America and the Caribbean  including Brazil  and could be a
politically popular choice of partner for MTN 
 The region s previously robust growth has been slowed by
recession but still outpaces that of more mature markets 
America Movil posted an 11 percent increase in second quarter
revenue and a roughly 2 percent rise in subscribers 
 
 BHARTI ZAIN
Although it is one of the few companies whose name has not
been linked with Zain    perhaps because of its ongoing
entanglement with MTN    Bharti could expand into several
African markets with a stake in Zain or its African operations 
 Fast growing Zain operates in 24 countries including Saudi
Arabia and Nigeria and  until a recent strategic review 
expressed an ambition to become a top 10 global telecom player 
 Its so called One Network strategy  under which it has
abolished roaming charges for users across 12 African countries 
could make it a good fit for Bharti  which is pursuing a  mobile
lite  approach in which it outsources many central functions

 MEXICO CITY  April 1  Reuters    Latin American stocks rose
to their highest level since the start of the year on Friday 
but a rally may be tapped out as investors await further signs
that global growth will back up strong gains 
 The MSCI Latin American stocks index  rose
1 25 percent  extending this week s rally to 4 percent after a
more than 3 percent gain in the prior week 
 The region s stock indexes broke through key technical
barriers this week  fanning hopes that equities could begin the
second quarter strong after a disappointing start to the year 
 U S  employment notched a second straight month of solid
gains  underscoring a decisive shift in the labor market that
should help bolster consumer demand in the United States  a key
trading partner for Latin America 
 But the lack of important data next week to back up the
optimism could leave stocks open to some profit taking 
  We have seen two weeks of very good gains   said Jaime
Aguilera  a stock strategist at HSBC in Mexico City   Next week
has little data  and I think we could see markets move sideways
with some profit taking  
 Brazil s benchmark Bovespa stock index  rose 0 99
percent to close at its strongest in more than two months  The
Bovespa broke through a resistance level at 68 000 on Thursday
and its short term resistance level is now at 70 000  said
Rossano Oltramari  an analyst with the brokerage XP
Investimentos 
 Brazilian stocks were given a boost this week by signs that
the central bank may be drawing an interest rate hike cycle to
a close 
 Investors shifted investments from emerging markets to
developed economies this year as recoveries in those nations
gained steam while growth in economies like Brazil and Chile
were seen slowing due to higher interest rates 
 But in the second quarter  Latin American markets may see
fresh funds heading their way  as some see a rapid rise in U S 
stocks as having gone too far  too fast 
  There is still a lot of cash on the sidelines  and U S 
markets have already had a good rally  so you could see some
people putting money back into emerging markets   said Rogelio
Gallegos  who helps manage  750 million in equity investments
at Actinver in Mexico City 
 Financial stocks led the Bovespa s gain  Exchange operator
BM FBovespa  rose 3 71 percent  credit card operator
Cielo  gained 3 32 percent 
 Mexico s IPC stock index  rose 0 89 percent to a
two month high  The United States is Mexico s top trading
partner and U S  data has a big influence south of the border 
 The index has broken out of a descending channel on its
chart  suggesting the IPC may be stabilizing after a steady
downtrend since January that has cost the gauge nearly 3
percent during the first quarter 
 America Movil  was the index s biggest weighted
gainer  Shares in Latin America s largest cell phone provider
jumped 0 9 percent 
 Mexican conglomerate Alfa  gained 3 41 percent
after it said late Thursday it would open a car parts plant in
India later this year

 SAO PAULO  April 13  Reuters    Latin American stocks
traded mixed on Wednesday as a boost to investor confidence
from JPMorgan Chase s strong earnings came up against downbeat
technical indicators and worries about Brazilian inflation 
 The MSCI Latin American stocks index  edged
up 0 15 percent after recording its biggest one day loss in

 Brazil s benchmark Bovespa index  traded largely
sideways  spending time in and out of negative territory 
 A slew of technical indicators  such as a bearish moving
average convergence divergence  or MACD  pointed to downward
momentum for the Bovespa in coming sessions  Recently the index
has fallen below several simple moving averages  including its
14   50   100  and 200 session averages 
  For me  this drop is because of the inflation outlook and
the fear that the central bank is falling behind the curve  
said Rodrigo Mello  a partner at Oren Investimentos 
 Brazilian policymakers meet next week to consider raising
the benchmark interest rate beyond its current 11 75 percent as
inflation speeds near the top of a government ceiling

206143,427659,AMX,Am rica M vil Ponders Its Post AT T Future,news,"By  MEXICO CITY    As consumers  government regulators and Wall Street grapple with the proposed megadeal between AT T Inc  NYSE T   and DirecTV  NASDAQ DTV  AT T s longtime partner in Latin America is trying to make sense of a future without the U S  based telecom giant  
America Movil  MX AMXL   Latin America s largest phone company and Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim s flagship company  was AT T s partner until recently  but it s suddenly become one of its competitors  Now  Slim s company is scrambling to figure out what to do with the  6 billion stake that AT T will have to relinquish of as result of its DirecTV merger  To avoid regulatory conflict  AT T has to sell its stake in Am rica M vil  which amounts to 8 4 percent of the company s shares 
 AMX acknowledges AT T s intention of eventually disposing of its stakeholding in AMX   Am rica M vil said in a statement to the Mexico City Stock Exchange on Monday evening  The statement also announced the resignation of two AT T officials who had been appointed to Am rica M vil s board 
Hours after the news broke on Monday  Am rica M vil s shares dropped 3 5 percent on the New York Stock Exchange  However  analysts predict that the hole left by AT T will not negatively impact the company 
 AT T leaving does not leave Am rica M vil at risk   Homero Ruiz  an analyst at Signum Research  said   It should not alter the strategy of the company  
Am rica M vil has three options  according to the research firm  find a new investor for the shares  buy those shares itself or sell them in a public offering 
Finding a new investor might be difficult  For the last decade  Am rica M vil has invested in such foreign companies as Austria Telekom  Mobli and Shazam  But it s been years since a foreign company announced any intention to buy shares from Am rica M vil  and analysts are unsure if that will change now 
 There are a few red flags around Am rica M vil   analyst Robert Armstrong wrote   It had a couple of investment faux pas in the recent past  like the KPN debacle  
Armstrong was referring to Am rica M vil s  9 7 billion bid for Dutch phone company KPN  which was announced in August 2013 and withdrawn two months later over price disagreements   It makes investors wonder if Slim is losing his touch   Armstrong added 

Another threat to Am rica M vil s future is political  Mexican President Enrique Pe a Nieto s proposed telecom reform  which includes anti monopoly provisions and mandates diversification among TV and phone providers  is directly aimed at breaking Slim s 80 percent share of the telecom market in Mexico  which accounts for 27 percent of Am rica M vil s profits 
If no company makes a move  Am rica M vil could sell those shares in a public offering  The company s share price is currently valued at  19 70 on the New York Stock Exchange  after dropping  0 73 on Monday  According to Signum Research  it would take the company 3 76 months to allocate all of the AT T shares if share transactions perform at their current pace 
Signum Research s advice to Slim  however  would be to buy off AT T s  6 billion stake 
 Our recommendation would be to keep those shares within the company  and buy them while the prices are low   Ruiz said 
Am rica M vil has approximately 12 months to make a decision  when the AT T DirecTV merger is expected to be finalized ",2014-05-20,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/américa-móvil-ponders-its-post-at-t-future-285471,285471
206152,427668,AMX,America Movil To Offer Mobile Roaming To Telefonica Mexico,opinion,"Mexican telecom behemoth America Movil SAB   NYSE AMX   has entered into an agreement with its closest rival Telefonica  MC TEF  SA   NYSE T   to offer nationwide mobile roaming service to the latter  Notably  America Movil currently commands more than 66  share of Mexico s wireless market while Telefonica comes second with over 20  market share 
On Sep 2015  Telefonica announced that its Mexican unit  Movistar  is open to enter into a wireless network sharing agreement with its rival operators  Moreover  Telefonica has decided to access wireless towers of Telesites  which was spun off by America Movil  in a bid to strengthen its Mexico business 
Importantly  the regulatory body in the country  the Federal Telecommunications Institute  popularly known as IFT  seeks to restrict the maximum hold of a company in the market to 50   Last year  leading U S  telecom operator AT T Inc    NYSE T   entered the Mexican telecom industry with the acquisition of Gurpo Iusacell and Nextel de Mexico 
In addition  Mexican cable MSO  multi service operator  Grupo Televisa S A    NYSE T   has also received a go ahead from the IFT to foray into the wireless space  However  Grupo Televisa is yet to take any decision in this regard 
Notably  Telefonica did not take part in Mexico s auction of 80 MHz of spectrum in the AWS band  1 7 2 1 GHz  earlier this year  The driving reason behind Telefonica s decision to opt out of the auction is Mexican telecom regulator  the IFT s instruction that these spectrum bands will not be operational for the next two years 
In Dec 2015  the IFT had approved the swapping of frequency blocks and a spectrum rental deal between AT T and Telefonica valued at  168 million  Per the deal  AT T will use spectrum in the range of frequencies in the 1 7 2 1 GHz band in some regions  while Telefonica will use frequencies of the 1 9 GHz band 
Mexico is the largest economy in the Latin American region with a growing middle class population that is eager to spend more on high speed mobile networks for optimal use of smartphones and tablets  Further  the wireless penetration rate is still relatively low in the country  Considering the opportunities  business agreements with formidable rivals like America Movil and AT T are likely to bode well for Telefonica before the market saturates 
Both America Movil and Telefonica currently carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  
Price Performance of America Movil and Telefonica

So far  2016 remains unimpressive for the Zacks categorized Non US Wireless Service Provider Industry  Year to date  this industry has registered a negative growth of 6 68   Importantly  both America Movil and Telefonica have performed even worse in the same time frame  Year to date  the stock price of America Movil lost 14 72  while Telefonica lost 25 14  
Nevertheless  Mexico s telecom industry is currently enjoying a bull run  This sector has witnessed 13 3  growth in revenues year over year in the third quarter of 2016  This growth rate is highest among all the other sectors of the economy  Remarkably  the telecom sector s growth rate is more than six times higher than the 2 04  overall growth rate of Mexico s GDP in the same time frame 
Moreover  Mexico has been witnessing massive investment in its telecom sector  In Jun 2016  the country s Secretariat of Communications and Transport  SCT  declared that a total of more than  6 5 billion has been invested in the last three years  Additionally  around  13 5 billion has been invested recently in the telecom sector  Furthermore  the upcoming nationwide shared broadband network will further attract around  7 billion worth of investment 
All these developments will bode well with large incumbent firms like America Movil and Telefonica  We believe this is the primary reason that both stocks are currently carrying a Zacks Rank  3

206153,427669,AMX,Mexico s Telecommunications Industry s Bull Run Continues,opinion,"According to a recent report by The Competitive Intelligence Unit  CIU   Mexico s telecom sector witnessed 10 9  growth in revenues year over year in 2016  This growth rate is highest among all other sectors of the economy  Remarkably  the telecom sector s growth rate is more than four times higher than the 2 3  overall growth rate of Mexico s GDP in the same time frame 
Interestingly  Mexico s telecom regulatory authority  the Federal Telecommunications Institute  IFT  initiated major reforms within its telecommunications sector to instil competition in its telecommunication sector in 2014  Those reform initiatives have started bearing the desired results 
For 2016  overall revenues of the country s telecom sector were MXN 454 6 billion  up 3 3  year over year  This figure was better than CIU s previous estimate of MXN 445 3 billion  Of the total  mobile telephony revenues were MXN 250 billion  up 0 3  year over year   constituting 55  of the total telecom sector revenue 
Fixed telephony revenues  27  of the total telecom sector revenue  were MXN 123 billion  up 1 0  year over year   Pay TV revenues came in at MXN 81 4 billion  up 18 5  year over year  generating 17 9  of the total telecom sector revenue 
Widespread implementation of flat rate plans resulted in a whopping 28 5  decline in mobile telephony prices year over year  Nevertheless  CIU is optimistic about future growth prospect of this industry  According to the research firm  Mexico s overall telecom revenues are forecasted to grow around 4  to MXN 463 3 billion in 2017  Mobile telephony  fixed telephony and pay TV segments are anticipated to grow by 1 3   1 1  and 17 3   respectively  in 2017 
At present  there are three nationwide telecom operators in Mexico  Mexican telecom behemoth America Movil SAB   NYSE AMX   and Spanish telecom giant Telefonica SA   NYSE T   are the two incumbents  In 2015  the U S  telecom behemoth AT T Inc    NYSE T   entered the fray with the acquisition of Grupo Iusacell and Nextel de Mexico  Telefonica  America Movil and AT T currently carry a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy    2  Buy  and  3  Hold   respectively  You can see  
Furthermore  AT T acquired U S  satellite TV giant DIRECTV  which had a strong Latin American presence including Mexico  Moreover  the IFT has permitted the Mexican TV broadcasting giant Grupo Televisa SA   NYSE T   to enter the country s telecom market  However  the company is yet to take any decision in this regard 
In Mar 2016  Mexico established the Telecommunications Investment Promotion Agency through a presidential decree  The agency is responsible for the installation of the government s proposed 4G LTE shared network and provision of telecommunications services  The federal government will provide the resources to the agency that will be managed by a board of directors  headed by the Minister of Communications and Transport while the IFT will regulate it

Quarterly net income was  779 million  approximately  830 million  compared with a net income of  548 million  approximately  857 million  from the year ago period   First quarter earnings per ADR  American Depositary Receipt  came in at 19 cents  up a whopping 216 7  year over year 
Telefonica recorded total revenue of  13 132 million  roughly  13 993 million  in the reported quarter  up 5  year over year 
We believe that the impressive financial results came on the back of Telefonica s business strategies which included the launch of video services in several Latin American markets  widespread adoption of broadband and data services  pricing revision  network enhancement  strategic collaborations and continued focus on organic growth and portfolio optimization 
The company continues to capitalize on opportunities in the digital world through several expansion strategies  The acquisition of E Plus boosts Telefonica s position as the largest mobile service provider in Germany in terms of subscriber count 
In spite of such ideas and their implementation  the company has a debt heavy balance sheet  Telefonica ended the first quarter of 2017 with cash and cash equivalents of  7 391 million  around  7 875 8 million  compared with  3 736 million  roughly  4 034 9 million  at 2016 end  The company exited the reported quarter with total debt of about  48 766 million  about  51 965 million  compared with  74 554 million   80 518 million  
Accumulating debt and decreasing cash flows posed problems for its credit ratings  The fallout of the company s IPO  initial public offering  plans was a major setback as these were attempted to generate cash and reduce its debt burden  To this end  the company has decided to sell 40  of its global telecommunications infrastructure unit Telxius Telecom to KKR Group to optimize its asset portfolio while allocating its capital and reduce debt 
Further  the company continues to face tough competition in its domestic market  In Brazil  Telefonica operates through its subsidiary Telefonica Brasil SA   NYSE VIV    Also  in the Latin American markets  Telefonica competes with large global telecom operators like AT T Inc    NYSE T   and America Movil SAB   NYSE AMX

206170,427686,AMX,Mexico To Complete Switchover Of TV Signals By 2016 End,opinion,"Mexican telecom regulator    Federal Telecommunications Institute  IFT     recently reaffirmed that the conversion of analog TV signals to digital signals across the nation  will be completed by the end of this year  The process will come to a conclusive end when a total of 460 low power TV stations will switch off their signal  The regulator said 303 of the stations   mostly regional  educational and social TV operators   will cease broadcasting on Dec  15  followed by the rest on Dec  31 
The IFT had planned to complete TV digitization by the end of 2015  However  in Dec 2015  Mexican senators voted in favor of extending the deadline of the conversion of TV signals from analog to digital by the end of 2016  The decision was taken on the grounds that an attempt to meet the Dec 31  2015 deadline would leave millions of viewers across the nation without TV access 
The switchover to the digital format will free up important 700 MHz spectrums which the government of Mexico intends to use for installing a nationwide wholesale wireless network  Mexico s Ministry of Communications and Transport  SCT  has conducted an auction for the 700 MHz shared broadband network 
In 2014  the government had undertaken this massive project to instil healthy competition in the highly monopolistic telecom industry  Small scale telecom operators can use this state owned network for their wireless coverage instead of installing their own network which is a highly capital intensive process  In Mar 2015  the SCT offered tender inviting participation in the project 
In May 2015  the Mexican government slashed its planned expenditure from  10 billion to  7 billion for the proposed deployment of nationwide wholesale mobile network over the next 20 years  The primary factor responsible for the cut in planned outlay was the government s changed belief that 12 000 mobile towers will be sufficient for installing this network as against 20 000 estimated earlier 
Meanwhile  Mexican wireless market is currently controlled by America Movil SAB   NYSE AMX    AT T Inc    NYSE T   and Telefonica SA   NYSE T    All three stocks currently carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see   In addition  Grupo Televisa SA   NYSE T   received IFT s permission to enter into the fray although management is yet to take any decision regarding it 
Mexico is the largest economy in the Latin American region with a growing middle class population eager to spend more on high speed wireless networks for optimal use of smartphones and tablets  Further  the wireless penetration rate is relatively lower in this country  Consequently  an investment in the nation with these positives is likely to bode well for telecom operators

In Mar 2016  Mexico established the Telecommunications Investment Promotion Agency through a presidential decree  The agency is responsible for the installation of the government s proposed 4G LTE shared network and provision of telecommunications services  The federal government will provide the resources to the agency that will be managed by a board of directors  headed by the Minister of Communications and Transport while the IFT will regulate it

206184,427700,AMX,Telefonica  TEF  Initiates Telxius IPO Amidst Difficulties,opinion,"Spanish telecom behemoth Telefonica  MC TEF  SA   NYSE T   recently filed an IPO  initial public offering  prospectus for its infrastructure division Telxius  to the Spanish stock market regulator  the Comisi n Nacional del Mercado de Valores  CNMV   In May 2016  Bloomberg reports stated that Telefonica is mulling over an IPO for Telxius and O2 wireless division in the UK  In the meantime  the company has been grappling with issues such as the Brexit  Britain s vote to leave the European Union  which delayed the process 
Telefonica has decided to sell a 36 36  stake in Telxius comprising 90 9 million shares  The figure may go up to 40  if the market response remains strong  The shares will be offered to qualified investors in a bookbuilding process running from Sep 20 to Sep  29  Pricing of the IPO is likely to be settled on Sep  29 and trading of Telxius in stock exchanges will start from Oct  3  
Telefonica set an indicative price range of  12   15 per share  This implies gross proceeds of  1 09 1 36 billion for Telefonica which may go up to   1 48 billion if the company sells 40  stake of Telxius  Consequently  the infrastructure division will be valued at a range of  3    3 75 billion  This figure is well below Telefonica s initial target of  4    5 billion  At the end of Jun 2016  Telxius had an order backlog worth  4 7 billion  It will pay an annual dividend of  70 million in 2017 and to pay out at least 40  of recurring cash flow to shareholders in future 
According to Bloomberg  the reason for lower valuation is the investors  concern regarding the proper method to value the submarine cable assets of Telxius  At present  the division oversees about 16 000 wireless towers and an international submarine cable network covering 31 000 kilometers  19 000 miles   More assets are likely to be assigned to the unit over time  In 2015  around 60  of the division s revenues and EBITDA came from submarine cable network 
The Telxius IPO is of utmost importance to Telefonica after the European Union telecom regulator blocked the proposed sale of its O2 unit in the U K  to 3UK of Hutchison Whampoa  The deal was worth around  14 9 billion  Telefonica s debt currently stands at approximately  52 2 billion  around  58 billion   The company had planned to reduce its debt burden through the divestment of its O2 division  However  the plan fell through as the transaction failed to materialize  Telefonica is now reportedly planning an IPO for its O2 division also 
The spin off of an infrastructure unit is not new in the global telecom space  Earlier  America Movil SAB   NYSE AMX   had spun off its Telesite infrastructure division and Telecom Italia SpA   NYSE T   also followed suit  As of Jun 30  2016  total customer access lines of Telefonica were approximately 341 9223 million  down 1 8  year over year  Notably  in the Latin American markets  Telefonica competes with large global telecom operators like AT T Inc    NYSE T   and America Movil 
According to some industry watchers  Telefonica may now be compelled to vend some of its core assets in order to raise cash and pay off debt  Otherwise its debt rating may be badly affected   Nevertheless  management expects free cash flow and operating income before depreciation and amortization to be higher in 2017 than in 2016  At this juncture  proceeds from the Telxius IPO can help Telefonica clear part of its outstanding debt 
Telefonica currently carries a Zacks Rank   3  Hold   You can see  TELEFONICA S A  Price

206232,427748,AMX,Mexico  Investing In The Forgotten Emerging Market,opinion,Mexico gets no love  It s not quite a developed market  but being next door to the United States it s not quite remote or exotic enough to be an alluring emerging market either  And starting with the letter  M   it doesn t fit into any popular acronyms  Lest you think I am joking  the four countries that comprise the  BRIC  Brazil  Russia  India and China have nothing in common other than the fact that their first letters make a word that sounds good in marketing literature  Mexico  Turkey  and Indonesia would all have been better choices than Russia all three are promising emerging markets whereas Russia is a decrepit petrostate on the decline but it s hard to form an acronym with their first letters  Go ahead  Try  I m waiting  Investors who overlook Mexico do so to their own detriment  In addition to being an attractive market in its own right and the second largest in Latin America after Brazil Mexico is also a large investor in other Latin American markets  and some of its multinational companies have a truly global scope  The Mexican stock market has also been a star performer in 2012  At time of writing  the Mexican IPC Stock Index was up over 10 percent  making it one of the better performing markets in the Americas  Mexico s economy is tied closely to that of the United States  El Coloso del Norte  accounts for more than 70  of Mexico s substantial exports so a relapse into recession by the United States would severely crimp growth south of the border  I am not expecting a U S  recession  however  and instead expect the U S  economy to muddle through with positive  if modest  growth  The drug related violence in northern Mexico is also disconcerting and bad for cross border commerce and tourism though I don t see it being a deal breaker for investors in Mexican stocks  If I were the CEO of a U S  manufacturing firm  I might think twice about setting up a new factory in Mexico  But as a portfolio manager looking for access to rising Mexican consumer incomes  the risks are tolerable  Investors wanting exposure to Mexico can buy shares of the popular iShares MSCI Mexico ETF  EWW   But today  I m going to recommend three solid Mexican multinationals I expect will outperform the broader index  I ll start with America Movil  AMX   the international cellular service juggernaut controlled by billionaire Carlos Slim  America Movil is the chief competitor in Latin America of long time Sizemore Investment Letter recommendation Telefonica     America Movil is dominant in the lucrative Mexican market  and it is a force to be reckoned with in most of South America  Mobile phones are ubiquitous in Latin America  but the market is still far from saturated  And the upgrade cycle to higher margin smart phones is just beginning  America Movil is a fine way to invest in the emerging market consumer  The next pick is Mexican media giant Grupo Televisa  TV   one of the largest in the Spanish speaking world  Televisa is best known in the United States for the soccer games  colorful game shows and  truly awful  telenovela soap operas broadcast by its Univision segment  but the company s operations include paid television and print media as well  Like America Movil  Televisa is a play on rising incomes in Latin America and rising incomes and influence among the U S  Spanish speaking population  As Latin consumers climb the income scale  the returns to advertising to them rise as well  which benefits media companies  Mexican and South American consumers are also embracing paid TV in higher numbers  which was the rationale for my recommendation of DirecTV  DTV  in the Sizemore Investment Letter  This is a long term trend that should have multiple years to fully play out  The last pick will be a little more controversial  Mexican cement giant Cemex  CX   Cemex is one of the largest cement and construction materials companies in the world  Not surprisingly  Cemex got absolutely hammered during the Great Recession  as new building projects ground to a halt in many countries  Cemex also fell victim to crises of its own doing  The company borrowed heavily to finance its international expansion  and when the Mexican peso plunged in value during the 2008 meltdown the company fell into financial distress due in part to its use of derivatives  Cemex s share price lost more than 90  of its value in the aftermath  but since then the company has stabilized  The share price has more than doubled in the past year  and more gains are likely if conditions in the global construction industry at least remain stable  Disclosures  Sizemore Capital is long DTV and TEF ,2012-08-21,Charles Sizemore,https://www.investing.com/analysis/mexico:-investing-in-the-forgotten-emerging-market-133619,133619
