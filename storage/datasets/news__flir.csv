9323,230838,FLIR,Will Newport News Drive Huntington Ingalls  HII  Q2 Earnings ,opinion,Huntington Ingalls Industries  Inc    NYSE HII   is set to report second quarter 2019 results on Aug 1  before market open  In three of the trailing four quarters  this military shipbuilder has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate  the average positive surprise being 13 56   The company s Newport News segment is likely to reflect rising demand for aircraft carriers and submarine support services in the quarter to be reported  Yet  costs related to the incident that caused its drydock damage may mar earnings growth  Let s discuss the factors influencing Huntington Ingalls  second quarter results  Newport News Segment   A Key CatalystHuntington Ingalls  Newport News is the nation s sole designer  builder and refueler of nuclear powered aircraft carriers  It generates more than 50  of the company s total revenues  We expect higher sales volumes for aircraft carriers along with increased revenues on account of navy nuclear support services to consistently boost this division s top line  which should get reflected in the upcoming quarterly result In line with this  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for second quarter revenues at Newport News is pegged at  1 224 million  implying a 3 5  improvement from the year ago quarter s reported figure Huntington Ingalls Industries  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    Ingalls Division   Another Growth Driver Huntington Ingalls has been making strategic investments in its Ingalls business division  which has secured certain key contracts over the past few quarters  These  in turn  should boost revenues at this unit  However  in the first quarter  some contract adjustments in relation to the DDG program impacted the Ingalls division  With the company making efforts to resolve this issue  we may expect its impact to no longer weigh on Ingalls  performance in the second quarter  Thus  we may expect this division to reflect solid revenue growth in the upcoming quarterly results driven by higher volumes in the LPD  LHA and DDG programs In line with this  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for second quarter revenues at the company s Ingalls division is pegged at  637 million  indicating a 1 3  improvement from the figure reported in the year ago quarter Other Factors at Play A steady inflow of orders from the Pentagon has continued to provide significant impetus to this shipbuilder  Such key contracts strongly position the company to witness steady revenue growth in the to be reported quarter  In sync with this  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company s second quarter revenues stands at  2 12 billion  suggesting an increase of 5 1  from the year earlier quarter s reported figure  However  Huntington Ingalls is expected to incur significant expenses in relation to the incident that occurred this March while delivering the new floating drydock  The incident involved damage of its DDG 119 Delbert D  Black ship as well as its generated testing barge and the new drydock  Additional costs associated with the launch and subsequent delivery of SSN 791 Delaware along with the aforementioned incident may weigh on Huntington Ingalls  bottom line in the to be reported quarter  Considering these  the consensus mark for second quarter earnings is pegged at  3 56  calling for a decline of 34 1  from the figure reported in the year ago period  What the Zacks Model Unveils Huntington Ingalls does not possess the right combination of two key ingredients   a positive  and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or higher   that increases the odds of an earnings beat in the second quarter  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Huntington Ingalls has an Earnings ESP of 0 00  and a Zacks Rank  3  You can see   Conversely  we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into an earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions

9339,230854,FLIR,All You Need To Know About Flir Systems  FLIR  Rating Upgrade To Strong Buy,opinion,"Flir Systems  FLIR  could be a solid choice for investors given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   An upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices    has triggered this rating change 
The Zacks rating relies solely on a company s changing earnings picture  It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure    the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near term stock price movements  the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors  They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
As such  the Zacks rating upgrade for Flir Systems is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  has proven to be strongly correlated with the near term price movement of its stock  That s partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock 
Fundamentally speaking  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Flir Systems imply an improvement in the company s underlying business  Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Flir Systems
For the fiscal year ending December  2019  this imaging and surveillance systems company is expected to earn  2 37 per share  which is a change of 6 8  from the year ago reported number 
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Flir Systems  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 1  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

Amazon s shares have outperformed the broader market in the past year  the stock is up  10 8  vs  the  7 4  increase for the S P 500 as a whole   The Zacks analyst thinks Amazon continues to ride on its aggressive retail strategies  distribution strength and robust Prime program  Moreover  rapid adoption of Prime driven by customer benefits and strengthening grocery services is aiding its top line  Expanding content portfolio of Prime remains a tailwind  
Further  strengthening AWS services portfolio  rising number of availability zones and growing adoption are aiding Amazon s dominance in the cloud space  Improving Alexa skills and growing advertisement business remain major positives  
However  intensifying competition in the cloud computing market from the likes of Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT  Azure and Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  cloud is a significant headwind  Heavy investment in fulfillment centers remains a concern

Shares of UnitedHealth have lost  2 8  in the past year  underperforming the Zacks Medical Insurance industry  which has declined  1 4  over the same period  The Zacks analyst likes its strong operating performance  favorable business profile and disciplined enterprise risk management  It stands apart in the industry by virtue of healthcare services  technology and innovations offered by its unit  Optum  
Numerous acquisitions made by the company have broadened its business profile and provide benefits of diversification  Its solid balance sheet and consistent cash flow generation has enabled higher investment in business which will drive long term growth  
Capital management by dividend payment and share buyback is another positive  However  slowdown of growth in international operations and underperformance in Medicaid business are concerns  An increase in leverage and interest burden raises financial risk

AbbVie s shares have declined  21 3  year to date  underperforming the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry s increase of  4 7   The Zacks analyst thinks AbbVie s key drug  Humira is performing well based on strong demand trends despite new competition  Imbruvica has multibillion dollar potential  
AbbVie has been successful in expanding approvals for its cancer drugs  Imbruvica and Venclexta  Moreover  AbbVie has an impressive late stage pipeline comprising several products with multibillion dollar potential expected to be launched in the near term  The acquisition of Allergan  NYSE AGN   if successful  will add the former s blockbuster Botox to AbbVie s portfolio  
Sales erosion due to direct biosimilar competition to Humira in international markets will be a major headwind in 2019  Estimates have gone down ahead of Q2 earnings  However  AbbVie has a positive record of earnings surprises in the recent quarters

9345,230860,FLIR,Flir Systems  FLIR  Q2 Earnings Preview  What s In The Cards ,opinion,"Wall Street expects flat earnings compared to the year ago quarter on higher revenues when Flir Systems  FLIR  reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 24  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This imaging and surveillance systems company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 55 per share in its upcoming report  which represents no change from the year ago quarter 
Revenues are expected to be  480 17 million  up 6 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Flir Systems 
For Flir Systems  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  1 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Flir Systems will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Flir Systems would post earnings of  0 48 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 53  delivering a surprise of  10 42  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Flir Systems doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/flir-systems-flir-q2-earnings-preview-whats-in-the-cards-200440693,200440693

9354,230869,FLIR,Israeli start up building thermal cameras for self driving cars,news,"By Alexandria Sage
SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters    An Israeli start up believes it can solve some of the tricky problems faced by self driving cars by employing thermal cameras to detect heat from pedestrians  animals and objects  the latest technology being tested in the fast growing industry 
Start up AdaSky announced on Monday that it had developed a far infrared  FIR  thermal camera that works with computer vision algorithms to detect people or objects on the road  The camera is designed to help in so called  edge cases  in autonomous driving  where other sensors might fail 
Automakers and their suppliers working on self driving cars have been experimenting in recent years with forward facing cameras  radar  and Lidar  which uses light pulses to  see  the road  Each has its strengths and weaknesses  and all elements must communicate with each other 
 The  automakers  are now beginning to understand it s not enough   Eyal Madar  AdaSky s chief technology officer  told Reuters   They need a new sensor     to help them with edge cases  
Thermal cameras are a mature technology initially developed for military use  Madar said AdaSky is focused purely on applications for autonomous vehicles  unlike much larger competitor FLIR Systems  NASDAQ FLIR   which is more broadly focused 
 In the last four to five years the technology has become more available and cheaper   Madar said  adding that AdaSky s price at mass production could be a few hundred dollars   Thanks to that  it has become possible to think about the camera for autonomous driving  
Global automakers and top suppliers were validating AdaSky s system  said Madar  He declined to name the companies 
A full self driving prototype of AdaSky s system would be ready within a year  with mass production two to three years away  he said 
The company says a thermal camera can outperform a traditional camera at challenging times such as at night  in fog or rain  or at sunset or sunrise 
Another difficulty for self driving cars are their inability to differentiate between images and the real thing  For example  the image of a bear in an advertisement plastered across the back of a truck may be viewed by the car following the truck as a real bear  causing the car to brake 
In detecting the differences in temperatures emitted by living objects and inanimate objects  however  the thermal camera would help avoid this scenario 
AdaSky s technology can determine whether an object is a pedestrian at 200 meters  219 yards   and from further away for larger objects like cars  Madar said ",2017-09-11,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/technology-news/israeli-startup-building-thermal-cameras-for-selfdriving-cars-527596,527596

9360,230875,FLIR,In rare bipartisan display  Democrats back Trump on China trade probe,news,"By David Lawder and Lesley Wroughton WASHINGTON  Reuters    Three top Democratic senators  in a rare show of bipartisanship  on Wednesday urged U S  President Donald Trump to stand up to China as he prepares to launch an inquiry into Beijing s intellectual property and trade practices in coming days  Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer pressed the Republican president to skip the investigation and go straight to trade action against China    We should certainly go after them   said Schumer in a statement  Senators Ron Wyden of Oregon and Sherrod Brown of Ohio also urged Trump to rein in China  Tensions between Washington and Beijing have escalated in recent months as Trump has pressed China to cut steel production to ease global oversupply and rein in North Korea s missile program  Sources familiar with the current discussions said Trump was expected to issue a presidential memorandum in coming days  citing Chinese theft of intellectual property as a problem  The European Union  Japan  Germany and Canada have all expressed concern over China s behavior on intellectual property theft   U S  Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer would then initiate an investigation under the Trade Act of 1974 s Section 301  which allows the president to unilaterally impose tariffs or other trade restrictions to protect U S  industries  the sources said   It is unclear whether such a probe would result in trade sanctions against China  which Beijing would almost certainly challenge before the World Trade Organization  The Chinese Embassy in Washington said in a statement to Reuters that China  opposes unilateral actions and trade protectionism in any form   LEVERAGE FOR NEGOTIATIONS U S  Section 301 investigations have not led to trade sanctions since the WTO was launched in 1995  In the 1980s  Section 301 tariffs were levied against Japanese motorcycles  steel and other products   This could merely be leverage for bilateral negotiations   James Bacchus  a former WTO chief judge and USTR official  said of a China intellectual property probe  Some trade lawyers said that WTO does not have jurisdiction over investment rules such as China s requirements that foreign companies transfer technology to their joint venture partners  allowing sanctions to proceed outside the WTO s dispute settlement system  But Bacchus argued the United States has an obligation to turn first to the Geneva based institution to resolve trade disputes  adding   There is an obligation in WTO to enforce intellectual property rights that is not fully explored   Lighthizer and Trump s Commerce Secretary  Wilbur Ross  have complained the WTO is slow to resolve disputes and biased against the United States  The threat comes at a time when Trump has become increasingly frustrated with the level of support from Beijing to pressure Pyongyang to give up its nuclear and missile program  Trump has said in the past that China would get better treatment on trade with the United States if it acted more forcefully against Pyongyang  Beijing has said its influence on North Korea is limited  China counters that trade between the two nations benefits both sides  and that Beijing is willing to improve trade ties  A senior Chinese official said on Monday there was no link between North Korea s nuclear program and China U S  trade  Wyden  the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee  wrote to Lighthizer urging action to stop China from pressuring U S  tech companies into giving up intellectual property rights

surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 75 by 8 6  Excluding one time items  the company reported GAAP earnings of  1 89 per share  up 25  from  1 52 registered in the year ago quarter The year over year upside in the bottom line can be attributed to higher operating income  lower interest expenses and a lower tax rate as well as a lower share count For 2018  the company generated adjusted earnings of  6 37 per share  which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  6 23 by 2 2  Operational PerformanceIn the quarter under review  the company s total sales of  648 6 million increased 6

PerformanceCommercial Industrial  Sales at this segment rose 2  year over year to 304 8million  Higher sales of valves on the Virginia class submarine program  increased OEM sales of sensors and controls products as well as surface treatment services along with solid demand for industrial valves contributed to this upside While operating income fell 1  to  51 7 million  operating margin declined 40 basis points  bps  to 15 4   The margin contraction was on account of tariff impacts and restructuring charges Defense  Sales at this segment declined 13  year over year to  150 9 million  This downturn can be attributed to lower sales of flight test equipment on fighter jet and bomber programs  embedded computing equipment on unmanned aerial vehicle  UAV  platforms  embedded computing and aircraft handling equipment on various naval defense platforms as well as avionics and electronics equipment on various domestic and international platforms Operating income declined 16  to  36 5 million  while operating margin contracted 100 bps to 24 2   The downside can be attributed to lower sales  and higher research and development expenses Power  Sales at this segment surged 37  year over year to  192 9 million on account of solid CVN 80 aircraft carrier and DRG service center revenues  Moreover  higher revenues generated from the China Direct AP1000 program and robust growth in domestic aftermarket sales supporting currently operating nuclear reactors led to this upside Operating income increased 51  to  36 1 million  while operating margin expanded 170 bps to 18 7   Both the upsides can be attributed to higher naval defense and power generation revenues  favorable overhead absorption and increased profitability on the China Direct AP1000 program Financial

9376,230891,FLIR,Flir Systems  FLIR  Earnings Expected To Grow  What To Know Ahead Of Next Week s Release,opinion,"Flir Systems  FLIR  is expected to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company s earnings picture  but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 24  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This imaging and surveillance systems company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 49 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  2 1  
Revenues are expected to be  438 95 million  down 0 2  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Flir Systems 
For Flir Systems  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Flir Systems will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Flir Systems would post earnings of  0 60 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 62  delivering a surprise of  3 33  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Flir Systems doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/flir-systems-flir-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200407776,200407776

9383,230898,FLIR,L3 s growth strategy guided by credit rating risk,news,"By Mike Stone WASHINGTON  Reuters    For L3 Technologies Inc  it s not a case of if but when the maker of everything from airport scanners to night vision equipment for the military will get bigger through acquisitions  The path that recently minted Chairman and CEO Chris Kubasik takes to deliver that growth to investors  however  is the big question  Bankers and industry executives are watching closely to see if L3 risks its investment grade credit rating with a major deal that could dwarf its acquisitions in the past  Kubasik  who took the helm at the sensor and communications company in January was named chairman earlier this month  is not shy about being on the prowl   He told Reuters in an interview that he has looked at several deals recently  but has taken a pass  because we haven t found anything that makes sense to us    Kubasik said the firm could buy a company as large as  3 billion dollars using a mix of cash and debt  Wall Street power brokers familiar with Kubasik s plan told Reuters he would love to bulk up the company quickly  However  acquisitions of technologically sophisticated  high profit margin companies remain either too small to be significant or too large for the  15 6 billion market cap company to afford  The bankers said infrared camera maker FLIR Systems Inc  NASDAQ FLIR   which has a  7 4 billion market capitalization  or  Textron Inc   NYSE TXT  with its  17 1 billion market capitalization  are examples of the deals Kubasik is interested in but are not within reach because of credit risk and cost  The investment bankers and a credit analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity said even a  3 billion deal could endanger L3 s investment grade credit which hovers one notch above junk  One way L3 could preserve its credit rating with such a deal is if L3 promised to aggressively pay down debt in conjunction with a big deal announcement  the debt analyst said   Kubasik told Reuters it was important to preserve the company s investment grade credit rating  for now   FLIR and Textron declined to comment  A representative for L3 did not comment  LET S MAKE A DEAL Dealmaking is part of the culture at L3  Since going public in 1997  the company has made over 130 acquisitions in building a business that now gets 70 percent of its revenue from the Pentagon and the remaining 30 from commercial and international customers  Last year  while Kubasik was chief operating officer at L3  he told investors that he was eyeing 28 potential deals  Since then  he said half were ruled out and Heidi Wood   the head of L3 s internal mergers and acquisitions team   added four to L3 s current target list of 18 companies   In early May  Kubasik boosted L3 s acquisition war chest to more than  1 billion of cash by selling Vertex  a division that provided services for aviation to American Industrial Partners  a private equity firm for  540 million  Kubasik told Reuters there is nothing big in the market tempting him now  and added that if he could not find  1 or  2 billion dollar deals  he aims to double the size of L3 over five years organically and through tuck in   or smaller   acquisitions  The goal for Kubasik is to ultimately be  the 6th prime   meaning L3 will compete with the largest defense companies which have cultivated prized relationships with generals and admirals at the Department of Defense  Bigger competitors like  Northrop Grumman  Corp  NYSE NOC   or General Dynamics Corp  NYSE GD  enjoy many of these direct contact relationships and Kubasik wants to increase L3 s share  To achieve this  Kubasik wants more government contracts that name L3 as the  prime  contractor  putting the company in direct contact the main customer  the Pentagon   He said L3 would never make jets or planes  but unmanned under water systems and other smaller format defense equipment like night vision equipment and protected communications can provide the access Kubasik thinks will pay off  Kubasik is confident that the company would increase its dividend as it has over the last 13 years  but his priority is to make a deal

9388,230903,FLIR,Flir Systems  FLIR  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"The market expects Flir Systems  FLIR  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 13  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This imaging and surveillance systems company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 60 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  3 5  
Revenues are expected to be  466 67 million  down 5 7  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 48  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Flir Systems 
For Flir Systems  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 84  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Flir Systems will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Flir Systems would post earnings of  0 57 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 57  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss

What s Next for Flir Systems 
While Flir Systems has outperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Flir Systems was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

9412,230927,FLIR,Lord Abbett LVOAX Fund s Holdings Should Give Investors Pause,opinion,"Lord Abbett Value Opportunities  LVOAX  LVOCX  LVOVX  is a Mid Cap Blend fund investors should avoid  The fund s poor holdings 1  and high fees diminish the likelihood that the fund will outperform moving forward  The contrast between the fund s Morningstar rating and its poor holdings lands LVOAX in the Danger Zone this week 
Traditional Research Overrates this Fund
Per Figure 1  LVOVX receives a 4 Star rating from Morningstar while LVOCX and LVOAX receive a 3 Star rating  When viewed through our Predictive Risk Reward Fund Rating methodology  all four classes earn an Unattractive or worse rating  with LVOAX earning a Very Unattractive rating

Holdings Quality Research Reveals Flaws 
The only justification for a mutual fund to charge higher fees than its ETF benchmark is  active  management that leads to out performance  A fund is most likely to outperform if it has higher quality holdings than its benchmark  To make this determination on holdings quality  we leverage our Robo Analyst technology 2  to drill down and analyze the individual stocks in every fund we cover 
Figure 2  Lord Abbett Value Opportunities Asset Allocation vs  Benchmark

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings
Per Figure 2  Lord Abbett Value Opportunities Fund s asset allocation poses greater downside risk than its benchmark  iShares Russell Mid Cap  NYSE IWR   LVOAX allocates only 7  of its portfolio to Attractive or better rated stocks compared to 18  for IWR  Exposure to Unattractive or worse rated stocks is much higher for LVOAX  48  of portfolio  than for IWR  37  of portfolio  
Six of the mutual fund s top 10 holdings receive an Unattractive or worse rating and make up 12  of its portfolio  In total  all of the top 10 holdings receive a Neutral or worse rating and make up 20  of LVOAX s portfolio 
Given the unfavorable distribution of Attractive vs  Very Unattractive allocations relative to the benchmark  Lord Abbett Value Opportunities appears poorly positioned to generate the outperformance required to justify its fees 
Not Seeing Much  Value  In This Value Fund
Figure 3 contains our detailed rating for LVOAX  which includes each of the criteria we use to rate all funds under coverage and shows the fund s poor portfolio management  These criteria are the same for our Stock Rating Methodology  because the performance of a fund s holdings equals the performance of a fund after fees 
Figure 3  Lord Abbett Value Opportunities Fund  LVOAX  Rating Breakdown

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings
As Figure 3 shows  LVOAX s holdings are worse than IWR and SPY in all five of the criteria that make up our holdings analysis  Specifically 

LVOAX s holdings earn a Neutral economic earnings GAAP earnings rating while IWR and SPY earn an Attractive rating 
The return on invested capital  ROIC  for LVOAX s holdings is 9   which is below the 10  earned by companies held by IWR and half the 18  earned by SPY holdings 
The  3  free cash flow yield of LVOAX s holdings is less than the 1  earned by IWR stocks and the 2  earned by SPY stocks 
The price to economic book value  PEBV  ratio for LVOAX is 3 5 compared to 3 1 for IWR and 3 2 for SPY 
Our discounted cash flow analysis reveals an average market implied growth appreciation period  GAP  of 40 years for LVOAX holdings compared to 35 years for IWR and 32 years for SPY 

This analysis reveals that  ultimately  the companies held by LVOAX earn inferior cash flows  as measured by economic earnings and ROIC  but are valued at a premium  as measured by FCF yield  PEBV  and GAP  when compared to the benchmark 
FLIR Systems  NASDAQ FLIR  is one of LVOAX s top holdings and earns an Unattractive rating  Since 2010  FLIR s after tax profit  NOPAT  fell 2  compounded annually  Over the same time  its ROIC fell from 22  to 10  TTM and its NOPAT margin declined from 19  in 2010 to 12  TTM  Despite the deterioration in fundamentals  shares remain significantly overvalued 
To justify its current price of  55 share  FLIR must achieve 14  margins  vs 12  TTM  and grow NOPAT by 10  compounded annually for the next 10 years  See the math behind this dynamic DCF scenario here  This scenario seems unlikely given FLIR s declining margins and inability to grow NOPAT since 2010 
Even if we assume FLIR can achieve a 14  NOPAT margin and grow NOPAT by 5  compounded annually for the next decade  the stock is worth only  38 share today   a 31  downside  See the math behind this dynamic DCF scenario here 
Excessive Fees Make the Fund Even More Risky
At 3 79   LVOAX s total annual costs  TAC  are higher than 95  of the 408 Mid Cap Blend style funds under coverage  For comparison  the average TAC of all Mid Cap Blend mutual funds under coverage is 1 82   the weighted average is 1 31   and the benchmark ETF  IWR  has total annual costs of 0 20  
Per Figure 4  Lord Abbett Value Opportunities Fund s expense ratios understate the true costs of investing in this fund  Our TAC metric accounts for more than just expense ratios  We take into account the impact of front end loads  back end loads  redemption fees  and transaction costs 
Figure 4  Lord Abbett Value Opportunities Fund s Real Costs

Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings 
To justify its higher fees  each class of the fund must outperform its benchmark by the following over three years 

LVOAX must outperform by an average of 3 56  annually 
LVOCX must outperform by an average of 2 19  annually 
LVOVX must outperform by an average of 0 94  annually 

An in depth analysis of LVOAX s TAC is on page 2 here 
Underperformance Looks Likely to Continue
Over the past one  three  five  and ten year periods  LVOAX has not surpassed the 3 56  per year outperformance required to justify its higher fees  Per Figure 5  LVOAX  LVOCX  and LVOVX has underperformed  measured by growth of  10K  its benchmark over the past five years 
Figure 5  Lord Abbett Value Opportunities vs  IWR  Growth of 10K


Sources  New Constructs  LLC and company filings 
Given that 48  of assets are allocated to stocks with Unattractive or worse ratings  LVOAX looks likely to underperform moving forward 
The Importance of Holdings Based Fund Analysis
The analysis above shows that while the Mid Cap Blend style receives a Neutral rating in our 2Q18 Style Ratings for ETFs   Mutual Funds report  it still contains risky funds  With so many ETFs and mutual funds in the style  428   picking the right one can be difficult  Smart fund investing means analyzing the holdings of each fund  which is impossible for the average investor to perform 
Our machine learning and Robo Analyst technology helps investors navigate this investment style by sifting through the holdings of all 428 Mid Cap Blend ETFs and mutual funds  This diligence allows us to identify potentially dangerous funds that traditional backward looking fund research may overlook 
Each quarter we rank the 11 sectors in our Sector Ratings for ETF   Mutual Funds and the 12 investment styles in our Style Ratings For ETFs   Mutual Funds report  This analysis allows us to find funds that investors using traditional fund research may view as quality investments while deeper analysis reveals otherwise  such as Lord Abbett Value Opportunities Fund  Rather than putting money into LVOAX  investors would be better suited with one of the 61 Attractive or better rated ETFs and mutual funds in the Mid Cap Blend style

9413,230928,FLIR,25 Popular Funds To Sell  5 To Buy Instead  For 7 2  Dividends  ,opinion,"The average yield among the 25 largest dividend exchange traded funds is a meager 2 7  right now  That means if you plunked a  1 million on ETFs dedicated to dividend stocks  you d only make  27 000 every year 
That s barely higher than the 2018 federal poverty level for a family of four   25 100  
But you and I can do better   by double  even triple  I m talking about turning these lame 2 7  payouts into fat dividends of 7 2  or more 
Serious yield hunters gravitate toward closed end funds  where it s common to find distributions of 7 2  or even higher  A retirement income of  72 000  after all  is a lot cushier than scraping by on  27 000 annually 
But it s staggering just how few investors have discovered the income power of CEFs 
Consider this  The top 10 closed end funds by assets under management command  27 4 billion in AUM   versus  1 trillion for the 10 top exchange traded funds  The largest ETF   the SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY    alone accounts for roughly  270 billion in assets  or 10x the top 10 CEFs 
Some investors are turned off by CEFs  high expenses  but in many cases  savvy management more than compensates investors with superior total returns  But most investors simply haven t come across closed end funds  the media under covers them  and their providers have smaller advertising budgets than the ETF world s big boys 
Plus  all of the fat yields I m going to quote you are net of fees  Investors who get scared away by these expenses are missing the point  We need the expertise these money managers are providing us  because they are minting money in these niche markets  and showering us with oversized yields as a result  
Here are five  portfolio replacement  CEFs that at a minimum double  but offer 3x  4x   even 6x   the income potential of uber popular ETFs that many investors have   including the granddaddy of them all  the SPY 
Templeton Emerging Markets Closed Fund  NYSE EMF   Distribution Rate  7 5  Expenses  1 37  Replaces  Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets  NYSE VWO   2 6  Yield
When you think of emerging markets  you think of growth  not income  After all  the Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF  VWO    one of the 10 largest ETFs on Wall Street   yields a paltry 2 6  
But Templeton Emerging Markets  EMF  is a way to tap countries such as China  Russia and South Korea for income  too 
Templeton s EMF is a portfolio of roughly 90 holdings across more than a dozen emerging markets  Like most emerging markets funds  China makes up the biggest allocation  at 23 4   of the fund  South Korea  16    Taiwan  10 4   and Russia  9 6   are other significant holdings  The companies in the portfolio should be familiar to most EM investors  too  The likes of Korean electronics giant Samsung  KS 005930   South African multinational internet company Naspers Ltd ADR  OTC NPSNY  and chip foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing  NYSE TSM  
VWO might look like the better investment at a quick glance  It has a much wider portfolio and a cheaper expense ratio  But Templeton Emerging Markets is able to squeeze a lot more blood from the developing world  resulting in slightly more volatile but ultimately better returns 
Templeton Emerging Markets  A  Total  EM Solution 
Royce Global Value Trust Inc  NYSE RGT  Distribution Rate  7 6  Expenses  0 54  Replaces  iShares Russell 2000  NYSE IWM   1 2  Yield
Just like you don t expect dividends from emerging markets  you probably don t expect to squeeze much income out of small cap stocks  The iShares Russell 2000 ETF  IWM   for instance  is synonymous with growth  and for an obvious reason   the lure of small companies is their ability to quickly double in value  taking their stocks with them  That s because most small caps pour every cent of cash into building the business   not repaying shareholders 
You wouldn t know it  though  to look at the distribution on the Royce Value Closed Fund  NYSE RVT  closed end fund  which at 7 6  is more than 6x the yield on the IWM 
Royce Value Trust isn t investing in secret high yielding small caps that the Russell 2000 somehow hasn t discovered  As loyal CEF followers know  distributions aren t the same thing as dividends   they include dividends  but also return of capital  short term and long term gains  In fact  the lion s share of Royce Value Trust s distribution every year is made up of long term gains  which means the distribution can vary from year to year 
Still  the RVT and its roughly 370 small cap holdings   including FLIR Systems  NASDAQ FLIR   Heico Corporation  NYSE HEI  and Quaker Chemical Corporation  NYSE KWR    dole out sizable distributions most years  Better yet  this closed end fund has the long term performance edge over the IWM since 1986 inception  at 10 16  9 76  annually 
BlackRock Credit Allocation Income Trust  NYSE BTZ  Distribution Rate  6 6  Expenses  1 23  Replaces  iShares iBoxx   Investment Grade Corporate Bond  NYSE LQD   Yield 3 3 
The iShares iBoxx   Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF  LQD   in addition to being a mouthful  is the largest investment grade corporate debt ETF in the game  at  34 3 billion in assets  But as I ve pointed out before  we can do better by targeting smart bond managers who know how to identify values that index funds  rules exclude them from participating in 
Ironically enough  a worthy competitor to LQD comes from within 
BlackRock  BLK   which provides ETFs under the iShares moniker  also is a player in the CEF game  and offers an acceptable  albeit not perfectly faithful  replacement in the BlackRock Credit Allocation  BTZ  closed end fund 
BTZ s small team of portfolio managers include Jeff Cucunato  who has been head of investment grade credit at BlackRock since 2006  And the fund primarily plays to his strength  with 51  of the fund dedicated to investment grade corporates  Unlike LQD  however  this is a blended CEF  with another 25  in high yield bonds  13 8  in non U S  developed market credit and small amounts in securitized products and emerging market debt  among other allocations 
About two thirds of the fund s credit is investment grade  and roughly the same amount is dedicated to debt with short  and medium term maturities  Nonetheless  the CEF yields an ample 6 6   in some part thanks to the use of leverage   22  at the moment  
Investors do see more downside when corporates stumble  but management has kept the fund well ahead of the LQD over the past five years  It s not a perfect 1 for 1 replacement for LQD  but it s still a significant upgrade 
BlackRock Credit Allocation  BTZ  Wipes the Floor With Its ETF Cousin 
Columbia Seligman Premium Technology Growth Closed Fund  NYSE STK  Distribution Rate  8 4  Expenses  1 16  Replaces  Technology Select Sector SPDR  NYSE XLK   1 3  Yield
The technology sector has a reputation for being chintzy  and that s reflected in the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund s  XLK  laughable 1 3  yield  But make no mistake  You can find decent income in the sector   International Business Machines  NYSE IBM   Nokia  HE NOKIA  Corp ADR  NYSE NOK  and Seagate Technology  NASDAQ STX  are just a few highly recognizable names that yield more than 4  
Of course  the Columbia Seligman Premium Tech Growth  STK  closed end fund puts all those yields to shame  delivering more than 8  in annual distributions 
The portfolio is a mix of a lot of prominent tech stocks you ll find atop traditional index funds such as XLK  as well as a few that are much further down the totem pole  STK holds the likes of Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  and Broadcom  NASDAQ AVGO   but also semiconductor equipment company Lam Research  NASDAQ LRCX  and electronic design automation firm Synopsys Inc  NASDAQ SNPS  
But Columbia s tech fund has actually lagged tech funds such as the XLK and Vanguard Information Technology  NYSE VGT  and provides an example of how CEFs can backfire in the wrong situation  Per CEF expert Michael Foster 
 A big reason for STK s lower return is the bigger dividend in order to sustain that big income stream for investors  STK had to take more money out of the tech market to keep payments to shareholders  Inevitably  the profit taking to sustain dividends resulted in lower profits over the long term  resulting in STK s underperformance  
Lesson learned  Not EVERY closed end fund is a winner  Selection is key 
Adams Diversified Equity Closed Fund  NYSE ADX Distribution Rate  6   Expenses  0 56  Replaces  SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   1 8  Yield
The SPDR S P 500 ETF celebrated its 25th birthday this year at the top of the mountain   it s the largest exchange traded fund by assets under management  and it s not even close 
But it s a toddler compared to the Adams Diversified Equity Fund  ADX  
Adams Diversified Equity has been producing returns for investors since 1929   which means it has survived 13 American recessions and the Great Depression  Despite its longevity  it s a relative minnow compared to the SPY at just  1 8 billion in assets under management  Still  it s worth a closer look 
The ADX  like SPY  is a blended U S  large cap fund  with its stocks sporting an average weighted market cap of about  125 billion  read  they re blue chips   And like the SPY  ADX is heavy in information technology stocks  25 8    especially at the top  Apple  Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN   Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT   Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL  and Facebook  NASDAQ FB  are top five holdings of each fund  In fact  each of ADX s sector weightings are within about a percentage point of SPDR s S P 500 ETF  Perhaps the biggest difference is in breadth  Adams has a more concentrated portfolio of just 86 holdings 
And while a screener might tell you that ADX yields less than 2   that s not quite the case  The CEF is committed to a minimum 6  distribution rate  the lion s share of it tends to come at the end of the year  powered mostly by capital gains 
Adams Diversified Equity  ADX  Can Go Toe to Toe With the Best 
When you factor in that hefty distribution  Adams Diversified Equity at least looks like a worthy competitor to the world s largest fund 
But you and I can do even better

9418,230933,FLIR,Flir Systems  FLIR  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"The market expects Flir Systems  FLIR  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on October 31  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This imaging and surveillance systems company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 58 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  1 8  
Revenues are expected to be  486 01 million  up 11 8  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 51  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Flir Systems 
For Flir Systems  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  2 01  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Flir Systems will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Flir Systems would post earnings of  0 55 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 56  delivering a surprise of  1 82  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss

9427,230942,FLIR,Huntington Ingalls   HII  Stable Finances To Aid Q4 Earnings ,opinion,Huntington Ingalls Industries  Inc    NYSE HII   is set to report fourth quarter 2017 results on Feb 15  before the market opens While the company s stable financial position is expected to drive fourth quarter results  doubt remains whether its Newport News segment will continue to remain on a growth trajectory Last quarter  this military shipbuilder delivered a positive earnings surprise of 17 63  Let s discuss the factors influencing Huntington Ingalls  quarterly results  in brief Stable Financials   A Key CatalystA stable financial position backed by a strong cash generation capacity enables Huntington Ingalls to follow a disciplined capital spending program  In addition  the company focuses on maximizing shareholder value  through both share repurchases and increased dividend payouts  In November 2017  the company raised quarterly dividend to 72 cents per share  up 20  from the previous payout  Management  along with the dividend hike  increased the company s share repurchase program from  1 2 billion to  2 2 billion  During the first nine months of 2017  Huntington Ingalls repurchased common stock worth  152 million  These moves show the company s confidence in consistent free cash flow generation Notably  the company s net cash from operating activities at the end of third quarter 2017 was  380 million  while its free cash flow was  5 million  Considering  the dividend hike as well as raised share repurchase program announced by management during the fourth quarter  we expect the company s upcoming results to show similar solid financial stability as well Will Newport News Segment Continue to Tread on Growth Path  Huntington Ingalls  Newport News is the nation s sole designer  builder and refueler of nuclear powered aircraft carriers  This division  which generates more than 50  of the company s total revenues  has been underperforming for the last few years  Interestingly  in the third quarter  this segment s top line rebounded and registered year over year growth of 7 7   However  as per management  the macro trend at Newport News is that it is on the front end of a bunch of new programs across all its product lines  The team is currently engaged in the transition on its aircraft carrier and submarines programs  So there remains a cause of concern because it may take time for demand to wind up for these new programs  which in turn may dent the segment s top line in the near term  In line with this  the Zacks Consensus estimate of revenues for Newport News unit stands at  1 053 million for the fourth quarter  reflecting an annual decline of 5 9  Dearth of Order in Q4  A Killjoy  A steady inflow of orders from Pentagon has always provided an impetus to Huntington Ingalls  results  However  in the fourth quarter the company did not win any notable contract  Nevertheless  considering solid contributions from Camber acquisition along with robust sales volume  overall sales growth for Huntington Ingalls  fourth quarter remains positive  Notably  our consensus estimate for revenues is estimated at  2 01 billion  implying a 4 3  year over year increase Moreover  the corporate friendly tax reform adopted by the U S  government will most likely boost the company s earnings that will get reflected in the yet to be reported quarter s results Huntington Ingalls Industries  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise   Here s What Our Quantitative Model PredictsHuntington Ingalls currently has the right combination of two main

9475,230990,FLIR,Buy 7 Stocks With Impressive Interest Coverage Ratio,opinion,We often judge a company on the basis of its sales and earnings numbers  These  however  may not be enough  Sometimes  a stock gets a boost if these numbers climb year over year or surpass estimates in a particular quarter  This will definitely be a great opportunity for a short horizon investor to cash in on  But if you seek long term returns  investments backed only by sales and earnings numbers may not yield the desired results A critical analysis of a company s financial background is a prerequisite for an informed investment decision  Here  coverage ratios that determine whether a company is sound enough to meet its financial obligations play a crucial role  The higher the ratio  the better it is  The focus of this article is on  Interest Coverage   which is one such ratio Interest Coverage Ratio   Earnings before Interest   Taxes  EBIT  divided by Interest Expense Why Interest Coverage Ratio Interest Coverage Ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charges on its debt Debt  which is crucial for most of the companies to finance operations  comes at a cost called interest  Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company and its creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets interest obligations  Therefore  Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision Interest Coverage Ratio suggests the number of times the interest could be paid from earnings and also gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest An interest coverage ratio lower than 1 0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt  A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardships  Definitely  one should also track the company s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time The Winning StrategyApart from having an Interest Coverage Ratio that is more than the industry average  adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a  of  A  or  B  to your search criteria should lead to better results Interest Coverage Ratio greater than X Industry MedianPrice greater than or equal to 5  The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher 5 Year Historical EPS Growth     greater than X Industry Median  Stocks that have a strong EPS growth history Projected EPS Growth     greater than X Industry Median  This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years  This shows that the stock has near term earnings growth potential Average 20 Day Volume greater than 100 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market

9478,230993,FLIR,Will FLIR Systems  FLIR  Disappoint Again In Q1 Earnings ,opinion,"FLIR Systems Inc    NASDAQ FLIR   is slated to report first quarter 2017 results  before the opening bell on Apr 26 
The last reported quarter marked the company s seventh back to back earnings miss as it posted a negative surprise of 5 5   Consequently  FLIR Systems has an average negative surprise of 4 2  over the trailing four quarters 
Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to Consider
FLIR Systems  well diversified business portfolio  in terms of geographies  products and markets  proved to be a major catalyst in recent times  In addition  the company s business streamlining efforts  which have been undertaken for half a decade now  bolstered its growth  In the past few quarters  key metrics like revenue  operating income  operating margin and adjusted EPS have materially benefitted from such actions  The  trend is likely to continue for the soon to be reported quarter 
Moreover  the company s strategic product launches  to expand its customer base and foothold in new markets  are likely to supplement the first quarter top line performance  During the to be reported quarter  FLIR Systems introduced three new Exx Series advanced thermal imaging cameras and improved its M Series marine thermal cameras 
We believe that market traction of these and other popular offerings  such as Helios  Prometheus Q14 thermal imagers and Griffin G465 mobile gas mass spectrometer  will drive the first quarter 2017 sales  Moreover  FLIR Systems  previously completed buyouts  namely  DVTEL and Armasight  are also likely to supplement the company s commercial product revenues  The company s CDMQ model is also expected to act as a growth driver for the government business   
Despite these positives  litanies of factors including product mix changes  manufacturing cost absorption  adjustments in inventory and rise in competitive pressure in security retail channels are likely to dampen margins  Also  higher expenditure in fixing the faulty units of its SkyWatch surveillance towers is likely to hurt margins  
Moreover  increasing competition in its retail channels and escalating operating expenses in the Security segment can also play spoilsport for the upcoming results  In addition  depressed client spending and sluggish macroeconomic environment are most likely to weigh down on the company s financials  Increased budget uncertainty  particularly in the U S  under the new Trump administration  poses a significant risk 
Earnings Whisper
Our proven model does not conclusively show that FLIR Systems will beat earnings estimates in this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  But that is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP for the company is currently pegged at 0 00   This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 36 cents  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  FLIR Systems  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise
 

   Zacks Rank  FLIR Systems has a Zacks Rank  3  Though Zacks Rank  1  2 and 3 increase the predictive power of the ESP  the company s ESP of 0 00  makes surprise prediction difficult 
Note that we caution against Sell rated stocks  Zacks Rank  4 or 5  going into an earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions 
Stocks That Warrant a Look
Here are some companies that you may want to consider  as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter

On the July 27th 2016  FLIR will publish the new quarterly figures  If we take a look at the weekly chart  we can see a very young uptrend that is currently starting a new movement from out of the green correction zone  If the numbers turn out positive  the trend will probably continue  However  if the expectations are not met  the price will most likely fall back considerably  
Daily chart The danger of a setback becomes very clear in the daily chart  Here we see a very young downtrend that currently finds itself in the middle of its correction zone  If one applies the principles of Charles Dow  then this area here is what is called the accumulation phase  in which experienced traders start to join in

9497,231012,FLIR,Can FLIR Systems  FLIR  Pull A Surprise In Q2 Earnings  ,opinion,"FLIR Systems Inc    NASDAQ FLIR   is slated to report second quarter 2016 results  before the opening bell on Jul 27 
Last quarter  the company posted a negative surprise of 6 3   Also  the company has missed estimates in each of the last four quarters  resulting in an average negative surprise of 4 6  
Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to Consider
FLIR Systems  diversified portfolio is one of its biggest strengths  allowing it to offset weaknesses in any single market  Additionally  the company s restructuring initiatives  which was undertaken in 2013  have boosted its key metrics like revenue  operating income  operating margin  adjusted net income and adjusted EPS  We believe the company s diligent restructuring activities will continue to bolster the top and the bottom in the second quarter 
In addition  FLIR Systems has devised a Commercially Developed  Military Qualified   CDMQ   model which has been boosting the company s government business over the past few quarters  During the first quarter of 2016  government sales increased 20   thanks to the CDMQ model  Also  the DVTEL  Inc  buyout has fortified the company s hold in end to end security systems and is expected to act as a growth driver in the soon to be reported quarter 
In addition  impressive market traction of the company s newly launched products based on Infrared Guided Measurement and Lepton thermal camera core technologies are likely to boost the top line in the quarter to be reported  Some of the notable products launched during the second quarter include high performance uncooled thermal camera Boson  FLIR K33 and FLIR K53 handheld cameras  the FLIR KF6 camera for fire engines and two FLIR Aerial First Responder Kits  These products are expected to boost sales in the second quarter 
Despite these positives  FLIR Systems  financials have been severely marred by waning consumer spending and capital investments over the past few quarters  Sluggish economic growth in many of its key markets is expected to add to FLIR Systems  challenges 
Previously  the company had announced that its gross profit is expected to remain under pressure in the first half of 2016  A host of factors including product mix changes  manufacturing cost absorption  adjustments in inventory and rise in competitive pressure in security retail channels are putting profits under pressure  Also  unfavorable product mix is expected to hurt the operating margin in second quarter 2016 at the Surveillance segment  We believe that these short term headwinds will limit the company s profits during the second quarter 
This apart  currency volatility poses a major concern for FLIR Systems as it derives a major portion of its sales from outside Europe  Over the past couple of quarters  currency fluctuations have severely maligned the company s Maritime Segment and Instruments  During the first quarter of 2016  Maritime segment s Building   Predictive Maintenance product lines were worst hit by currency fluctuations  In addition  stringent competitive environment may compound FLIR Systems  challenges during the quarter FLIR SYSTEMS Price and EPS Surprise
   Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that FLIR Systems will beat earnings this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive   and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP for the company is currently 0 00   This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 35 cents 
Zacks Rank  FLIR Systems carries a Zacks Rank  3 which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  the company s 0 00  ESP makes surprise predictions difficult 
Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions

9501,231016,FLIR,FLIR Systems   FLIR  Q3 Earnings  What s In The Cards ,opinion,FLIR Systems Inc    NASDAQ FLIR   is slated to report third quarter 2016 results  before the opening bell on Oct 26 Last quarter  the company had posted a negative surprise of 2 9   Also  the company has missed estimates in each of the last four quarters  resulting in an average negative surprise of 4 0  Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement Factors to ConsiderFLIR Systems  third quarter results are likely to benefit from the company s diversified portfolio and diligent restructuring actions  Over the past three years  the company has systematically streamlined its businesses by shutting non profitable units  These actions have had a positive impact on its key metrics like revenue  operating income  operating margin  adjusted net income and adjusted EPS  We believe that such restructuring initiatives will likely improve the company s operating efficiency and cost structure  This  in turn  will prove conducive to margin growth for the soon to be reported quarter In addition  increased adoption of thermal imaging in a broad spectrum of applications  ranging from military to personal hand held cameras and Smartphones  have been fuelling the growth of FLIR Systems  imaging   threat detection technologies  Especially  products based on Infrared Guided Measurement and Lepton thermal camera core technologies have been witnessing impressive market traction  driving top line growth During third quarter 2016  FLIR Systems introduced thermal fire sensor  FLIR RSX F and an

segment s IGM test and measurement product  DM284 and OEM   Emerging segment s popular Vue series of thermal cameras  These products are anticipated to propel revenues for the third quarter This apart  FLIR Systems  impressive government business and strategic acquisitions are also expected to drive third quarter financials  The company has fortified its hold in the full spectrum end to end security system domain post DVTEL buyout  Also  the acquisitions of sporting and tactical scopes firm   Armasight   and security hardware and software solutions provider   Innovative Security Designs   are estimated to boost the company s top line for the quarter Despite these positives  volatile macroeconomic environment has been playing a major spoilsport for the company  Precipitous decline in client spending and capital investments over the past few quarters are likely to hurt the company s financials for the quarter to be reported  During second quarter 2016  delays in licensing processes for international customers have pushed approximately  20 million of revenues into the second half of the year  Persistent weakness may further affect revenues This apart  multiple factors including product mix changes  manufacturing cost absorption  adjustments in inventory and rise in competitive pressure in security retail channels are putting profits under pressure  Also  unfavorable product mix may prove to be a drag on the operating margin  Furthermore  as a major portion of FLIR Systems  sales originates outside the U S   the company remains vulnerable to currency fluctuations  In addition  strong competition  volatility of primary markets and vagaries of the spending by key clients are also likely to compound the company s problems for the soon to be reported quarter Earnings

9508,231023,FLIR,Markets Lower as Greece Fails to Implement Austerity Measures,opinion,Equity markets and high yielding currencies moved lower overnight on news stories that European finance ministers failed to pass its latest loan tranche of 130 billion Euros due to the lack of commitment in Greece to implement austerity measures   The Euro was lower against the Dollar  but the bear move was limited and the EUR USD still trades above 1 3250 at time of writing In other central bank news the Reserve Bank of Australia lowered its inflation forecast for the remainder of 2012  which is somewhat at odds with the bank s latest decision not to lower its base interest rates from 4 25    Any further downward revisions to the inflation forecast will lead analysts to call for additional rate decreases before the first half of the year is finished In the UK  FTSE 100 futures are trading slightly lower  maintaining the modest risk off trend we are seeing as we close the week  and today the main macro data will be the Producer Price Index  PPI    We will also see some significant corporate earnings in the financial sector from Barclays  and this will be followed by releases from Skywest Airlines and Zenergy Power In the US  S P 500 futures are showing a flat to slightly lower open  with the index currently down 8 points   Today s volatility will come with the release of the January Trade Balance figures and the month s Michigan Consumer Sentiment survey   Corporate releases are mostly second tier  with only PPL Corp  and FLIR Systems scheduled to report today   With the lack of guidance from earnings figures  the trading tone is likely to be guided by the latest headlines out of Europe  as we are currently seeing political obstacles derailing the ability of the Greek government to secure additional loan funding Yesterday s big equities mover was LinkedIn  which posted an 8 9 percent rally in the aftermarket session Thursday on improved earnings results for the fourth quarter and released an upwardly revised forecast for the first part of 2012   Whole Foods and Visa were also higher on the day after producing similar earnings results   Less positive  however  were the Expedia earnings  which missed market expectations and sent the stock 3 7 lower during the New York session Overall  we expect a mostly quiet session to close the week as there is little to induce fresh volatility other than some major headlines out of Europe   German and Swiss CPI will be released but this is unlikely to have anything other than a short term effect on trading sentiment   Position squaring into the close could be the overriding factor and sent equities markets drifting  H4  title  EUR GBP H4  width  760  height  394    The EUR GBP is once again caught within a clearly defined and prominent range on the 4H charts   Prices are currently pressuring the top end of the range  which is now seen at 0 84 but the oversold readings on the shorter term charts could be what prevents the pair from trading much higher   The longer term trend is clearly downward  however  so this puts us in the bear camp for a medium term trade  given the elevated levels on the shorter time frames The FTSE 100 is pressuring some significant resistance above 5860 but prices have been stalling in this area and are now vulnerable to a downside move given the inability for the index to post a daily close above these levels   Because of this  risk to reward favors sell positions here but stops should be triggered if we see a daily close above 5875 ,2012-02-12,Spread Betting,https://www.investing.com/analysis/markets-lower-as-greece-fails-to-implement-austerity-measures-113734,113734

9515,231030,FLIR,Top 5 Stocks Boasting Earnings Acceleration,opinion,"As we are in the thick of the first quarter earnings season  investors should search for stocks that are ready to make a big move  Significant earnings growth generally leads to a jump in share price  but earnings acceleration works even better in boosting the stock price 
Earnings acceleration is basically incrementally growing EPS of a company  In other words  if the rate of a company s quarter over quarter earnings growth increases over a considerable period  it is termed as earnings acceleration   
If you pick a stock just by focusing on the company s earnings growth then you are paying for something that has already been reflected in the stock price  Earnings acceleration  on the other hand  considers both direction and magnitude of growth rates  This helps you in betting on a stock that is yet to see significant attention of investors  and consequently a solid price increase 
Increasing percentage of earnings growth means that the company is fundamentally sound and has been on the right track for a considerable period of time  Sideways percentage of earnings growth indicates a period of consolidation or slowdown  while a decelerating percentage of earnings growth may at times drag prices down 
Hence  earnings acceleration should be viewed as a key metric for share price outperformance 
Screening Parameters 
Let s look for stocks for which last two quarter over quarter percentage EPS growth rates are more than the growth rates of the previous periods  The projected quarter over quarter percentage EPS growth rate is also expected to be higher than the previous periods  growth rates 
EPS   Projected Growth  Q1   Q0  greater than EPS   Growth  Q0   Q 1   The projected growth rate for the current quarter  Q1  over the completed quarter  Q0  has to be greater than the growth rate from the completed quarter  Q0  over one quarter ago  Q 1  
EPS   Growth  Q0   Q 1  greater than EPS   Growth  Q 1   Q 2   The growth rate for the completed quarter  Q0  over one quarter ago  Q 1  has to be greater than the growth rate from one quarter ago  Q 1  over two quarters ago  Q 2  
EPS   Growth  Q 1   Q 2  greater than EPS   Growth  Q 2   Q 3  The growth rate from one quarter ago  Q 1  over two quarters ago  Q 2  has to be greater than the growth rate from two quarters ago  Q 2  over three quarters ago  Q 3
