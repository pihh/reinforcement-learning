217128,438644,TEVA,Why Teva Pharmaceutical Is Rallying 10  Today,news,"What happened
Following fourth quarter financial results that outpaced industry watchers  estimates  shares in Teva Pharmaceutical  NYSE TEVA  are up nearly 10  at noon on Wednesday 
So what
Teva Pharmaceutical is in the midst of restructuring its business to reduce expenses and reinvigorate sales in the face of headwinds associated with generic competition to its top selling multiple sclerosis drug  Copaxone  In Q4  it appears its turnaround may be taking hold  

The healthcare company reported today that revenue ticked up 1 1  year over year to  4 47 billion in Q4  Non GAAP  adjusted  earnings per share clocked in at  0 62  Those results bested Wall Street estimates by  120 million and  0 01 per share  respectively  For the full year  revenue fell 8  year over year to  16 9 billion 
Although Copaxone revenue in North America fell 26  year over year  to  264 million  last quarter because of generic alternatives  Teva still delivered modest fourth quarter sales growth because of strong sales of Austedo  a tardive dyskinesia treatment  and Ajovy  a migraine treatment  Austedo and Ajovy sales were  136 million and  25 million  respectively  in the quarter  
Bottom line performance was driven by lower operating costs compared to the same quarter a year ago  Non GAAP research and development costs fell to 5 3  of sales from 6 5  of sales  selling and marketing expenses dropped to 14 9  of sales from 17 4  of sales  and general and administrative costs decreased to 6 9  of sales from 7 5  of sales  As a result  non GAAP operating income was  1 06 billion  up 12  from Q4 2018  and non GAAP diluted EPS was  0 62  up from  0 53 the year prior 
Teva also reported its free cash flow improved to  974 million in the quarter from  522 million last year  and that it eliminated  2 billion in debt last year 
Now what
The quarterly performance is encouraging  but more work remains  Despite paying down a lot of debt  the company still finished the year owing  26 9 billion  and Copaxone sales are forecast to fall to  1 2 billion in 2020 from  1 5 billion last year 
Fortunately  the company s more recently launched drugs  including Austedo and Ajovy  should offset the Copaxone drag  Teva is guiding for revenue of  16 6 billion to  17 billion this year  about in line with last year  It expects Austedo and Ajovy sales to improve to  650 million and  250 million from  412 million and  96 million in 2019  respectively 
Teva is also projecting bottom line benefits associated with its cost cutting to carry over into 2020  Because the company has eliminated  3 billion in annual expenses  it expects EPS between  2 30 and  2 55 this year  compared to  2 40 in 2019  Investors may want to watch quarterly results throughout 2020 to make sure that early signs of a recovery in its business improve further before buying ",2020-02-13,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pubgf,2083178

session that will follow the presentation  Please note that today s call will run approximately one hour And with that  I will now turn the call over to Kare Schultz  Kare  if you would  please Kare Schultz    President   Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Kevin  Good morning  everybody  and thanks for calling in  It s a great pleasure to talk to you about our strong results for 2019  On the financial side  it s worth noting that we met all the components of our 2019 guidance  Revenues came in at  16 9 billion  and here  you should of course note that we ve changed the way we report the distribution sales that we have in Israel  the SLE Company in Israel from a gross basis to a net basis And we ve done a revisions to restate the numbers  so that you can see the numbers for  17   18   19  This has no impact on the earnings numbers or cash flow numbers  it s simply whether you record that revenue from distribution in Israel as well as the net  So  we met that target of revenues  We met the target for EBITDA with  4 7 billion and the non GAAP EPS of  2 40  We re also very pleased that the cash flow came in above  2 billion Now  the key drivers for this was some good business performance  AUSTEDO  as I m sure you noticed  kept on its rapid growth and has of course big continued potential  We launched AJOVY in the EU and got reimbursement in the first countries  very excited about that Also very excited about the fact that we just got the Autoinjector approval in U S  We have it in Europe already  so that looks very good also for the future  And then we are very pleased with the way we manage to    managed the decline of COPAXONE in both U S  and actually also in Europe  So  we saw stable COPAXONE sales at the end of 2019 and we expect to see a modest decline in 2020 In generics  we had many  many launches around the world  Alone in the U S   we had nearly 50 launches including our first big biosimilar launch in the U S  TRUXIMA  And we re also very happy about the results so far of that launch  We also published our first ever Global Economic Impact report And just a couple of highlights  our products actually helped the U S  healthcare system save  41 9 billion on a yearly basis  and out of that number   6 billion was patients savings  where they save on out of pocket costs  So  we think we contribute very well in the U S  also with direct and indirect 57 000 jobs Now  if we move to the next slide  then you probably all remember that in 2017  so a bit more than two years ago  2 5 years ago  we had a pretty dramatic situation  We had a debt of  34 billion and we had COPAXONE going off patent worldwide  So  we were under a lot of pressure looking at a revenue loss over a couple of years  of close to  5 billion  The way to handle that was a restructuring plan that was meant to reduce our spend base by  3 billion  thereby securing cash flow to handle the debt and securing our future earnings I m happy to report that we have executed the restructuring plan exactly as we laid it out 2 5 years ago  It has not been  you could say  easy on the organization  We ve had to close down or divest some 23 manufacturing sites  Some of those are still in process of the final closures and we ve had to close more than 40 offices and laboratories around the world and say good bye to more than 13 000 employees Now  we managed to do this without hurting our operational capacity in anyway  We are still fully operational on all the many  many products we do  30 000 different products  many  many billions of SKUs per year And to give you a feel for how complex the restructuring has been  the next Slide shows you a map of the world and you can see that we ve been closing down a lot of sites all over in North America  South America  Europe  Middle East  Southeast Asia  Japan  So  this is really  truly been a great effort and I d like to thank everybody in the organization for the fantastic job they ve done keeping everything going in a nice way  high quality  while reducing the spend base Now  one of the reasons why we had to do this was to handle our debt situation  And on the next slide  you can see that we started out  when I started in the company back in the end of 2017 with around  34 billion of debt  I m happy to report now that we just come at just below  25 billion   24 9 billion  So  it s definitely going in the right direction and you should  of course  expect that this trend will continue in the coming years Now  talking about the debt  we ve also had to do a refinancing and we ve done that very successfully in the fourth quarter  And as a consequence of the refinancing  we now have liquidity and projected cash flow to cover the bond repayments due in the next three years  At the same time  we have a situation where our EBITDA is stabilizing  as we said it would  Before I said that the trough year for earnings would be 2019  So that s the bottom of the trough so to speak and we ve seen that stabilization happening So  when you stabilize your EBITDA and you keep on reducing your debt  then slowly your ratio  your debt ratio EBITDA to    net debt to EBITDA will be declining and that s what we ve seeing  it peaked in Q2 of  19 at 5 72 and it s been declining and has now come down to 5 32 at the end of 2019 and this ratio will keep on improving  meaning that it will keep declining in the coming years Talking about the debt and we have a slide here showing the debt structure  and what you can see here is that the next three years  we have debt stacks of around  2 billion  which basically means  as I said before  that we can handle these with the liquidity we have on hand right now and with the cash flow and we expect to be generating  The debt stack in  23 will call for some refinancing  so sometime in  22  you should expect that we will do a refinancing  similar to the one that we just executed to handle that situation Now  you could say the restructuring is now over and done with  And so  what s next  So  the next phase will be dominated by two elements  one is a continued improvement of our manufacturing cost  the gross margin    improving the gross margin and the other is secured growth in the top line  growth in revenues And  if we move to the next slide  then I d like to address the gross margin improvement program that we just initiated and that we ll be running over the coming years  Now  the program has five key levers and these are not new for manufacturing optimization  But they are all levers  where we have not taken the full advantage of these levers in the past and that s what we re going to do in the coming years So  due to the fact that we have a very widespread manufacturing network and very many products  we can still improve on our procurement cost excellence and this is what we re going to be doing by consolidating things  getting better overview of the situation and making sure that we get all the procurement benefits around the world Now  we can also still improve our network  We had around 80 manufacturing sites when I started  Technical Issues  and you will see this happening in the future year by year  but there is another way to optimize and just consolidate manufacturing sites and that is to optimize each and every site on their own  basically making sure that the manufacturing volumes should have financial  Phonetic  capabilities that you utilize your manpower  your equipment through the fall  And in the restructuring  we really focused a lot on sort of optimizing the network footprint  closing sites and moving things so that we could consolidate our volumes Now in the coming years  we will also be very focused on optimizing each and every manufacturing site for better efficiency  better ratio between output and costs and we are very convinced that this is something we can do successfully Then  given the fact that we still have around 60 manufacturing sites worldwide and we sell billions of products every year  30 000 different products  Then of course  the whole supply chain optimization is very important and we are working hard to reach a situation where we have global systems that cover our entire supply chain and that will be the basis for continuous optimization of the supply chain And then last but not least  we need to have an agile operating model and organization and I m happy to inform you that the new Head of our Manufacturing Organization Eric Drape  has yesterday reorganized his organization to have a more technology focused setup where we ensure that all the best practices can be implemented in a fast and consistent way across the world Now some of you who are thinking more about the investment in Teva might say  OK  this is very nice  all textbook stuff about optimizing manufacturing  but what does it really means to the P L  And if you look at the next slide  you can see here  the operating margin expansion that we are projecting and you will notice that the target is 28  in non GAAP operating margin at the end of 2023 Now  there s really nothing new to this because this is our long term financial target that we already communicated in 2018  So  what we re doing now is part of the plan from the beginning  And the reason why it s not the 27  you heard in 2018 is simply that the change of the reporting from gross to net on the Israeli distribution lifts off mathematically this percentage by a 0 9 percentage points  So  that s why we revised the target from 27  to 28   So  this is our commitment that we will aim at reaching 28  operating margin at the end of 2023  So  that s on the cost side  you will see Then on the revenue side  I just explained that we need some strong growth and we need some strong growth drivers  So  here we have two key products that are very important  One is AUSTEDO and the other one is AJOVY  and I ll talk a little bit about both of those  If we move to AUSTEDO first  then before I get into the sort of new things that we are looking at in our clinical development  I d just like to say that we are very  very pleased about the performance of AUSTEDO in 2019 We keep on accumulating patient basis and that of course helps a lot of patients  It is also a good contribution to our revenue growth  Right now we have around 9 000 patients on a daily basis using AUSTEDO and if you think about the growth potential you will know that in tardive dyskinesia there is only AUSTEDO and one other competing product that has been approved in the last couple of years  It s the first products ever for this indication So  for the first time ever  there is a way to treat tardive dyskinesia  It s our estimates that there is around 500 000 patients suffering from tardive dyskinesia in the United States alone  And that of course puts into perspective the fact that we have so far gotten to 9 000 patients on AUSTEDO and it just indicates that we believe that this product can keep growing for many years to come On top of the current indication  in Huntington s disease and in tardive dyskinesia  we are also working on two new indications  One is very imminent  That s Tourette syndrome  where we have conducted a Phase III trial and the results will be reported in the coming months  So  that s very  very close to being reported  Of course  we hope there ll be a positive outcome  we don t know  It s too early to say  but it will be really good for patients  if we saw a positive outcome of this trial We are also doing a Phase III trial treating dyskinesia in cerebral palsy  There is no drug really approved for that  So it will be a first  if it s possible to show a good clinical effect  These data we will see sometime in 2021 but both these new indications are very exciting and hopefully they succeed to the benefit of patients  But of course also to the benefit of the growth of AUSTEDO sales If we move to AJOVY  then we have a lot of regulatory approval activities ongoing  We are in the middle of launching in Europe  We ll be launching our Autoinjector soon in Europe  It has been approved  And talking about the Autoinjector  we are also very pleased that we ve had the Autoinjector approved in the United States  and we will also in the coming months  be launching the Autoinjector in United States We hope in the migraine indication  that we will get back to a capture rate of around 25  based on the fact that we now have a competitive device and we have a very  very competitive clinical profile  We re  of course  also working on bringing AJOVY to the rest of the world For instance in Japan  where we just had really good clinical results together with our partner Otsuka for    the partner for Japan  And then in many other market  So  you will see a lot of launches of AJOVY in 2020 In terms of clinical development  if we move to that  and of course  we re also working on expanding the clinical indications for AJOVY and we are doing some Phase II trials where we are expecting results in 2021  One is in post traumatic headache  a very serious and quite widespread problem for many patients in the U S  And of course  we hope to be able to show effect there  And the other one in fibromyalgia  which is also a disease that has a big patient population in the U S  and a disease where there is really no real good treatment Now talking about the different lifecycle managements we are doing on AUSTEDO and AJOVY  Eli is going to talk about our total specialty pipeline  And we ve not disclosed this before  but we are very happy about our pipeline  As you know  we have a strategy where we want to be leaders in generics and we want to aim for a leading position in biopharmaceuticals  And if you look at the pipeline  you will see that we have a high number of biosimilars in development and we had one imminent launch in biosimilars In Novel Biologics  we have a lot of different things going on  The most exciting short term is Fasinumab that we are developing together with Regeneron and where we hope to see data this year from the Phase III trials and we re very excited about that and we we ll see a big potential if it succeeds in clinical development On the small molecule side  we re really not doing a lot of  say new molecules  but we are doing some exciting long acting products in different CNS indications and of course  we do have the lifecycle management that we re doing on AUSTEDO  And then we have a brand new thing  which is I would say  potentially revolutionary in the respiratory field and we have developed and gotten approval for some very  very sophisticated    Digihaler is basically respiratory inhalers to treat asthma  And we are working now on launching these products sometime during this year and we are very excited about that If we move on to generics  And we are the world leaders in generics  And in order to maintain that position of course  you need to do a lot of generic projects and we do so  more than a 1 000 generic products are currently under development  And you ll see here that the big numbers are quite favorable  Between 2020 and 2030  there are some  210 billion  Phonetic  in originator sales that go off patent And you will see that that fits very well with our business where we have around  4 billion in revenue in North America and we are loading in some  400 million   500 million of new sales every year  which is basically if you think about the math  it s the  210 billion split out over 10 years  We get some 10  to 12  of that and that s a price discount of some 80  for the generics compared to the originators on average  and that ends you up with the  400 million to  500 million that we load into the market of new sales every year We of course also have a strong pipeline of generics in Europe and international markets  And overall  we are very confident of maintaining our leadership and also maintaining a good profitability going forward Now  talking about profitability leads me to the long term financial targets  And as I ve already showed you  we have a target  by the end of  23 to have a 28  operating income margin  We have a target already today to be above 80  in the cash earnings and we have a target to get our net debt to EBITDA below three times  which we still aim at doing at the end of 2023 And now to talk about the financials  I would like to hand over to our new CFO  Eli  who will take you through the financials  Over to you  Eli Eli Kalif    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you  Kare  and good morning and afternoon to everyone  I would like to start by saying that I m extremely pleased to be here today as part of Teva team  I will start with a review of our financial results and then we ll follow that with the first look to our 2020 guidance as well as some of the major assumptions behind it Beginning on Slide 20  we start with a review of our GAAP performance  In Q4  2019  we recorded a GAAP operating income of  148 million  a GAAP net income to Teva shareholders of  110 million and a GAAP earnings per share of  0 10  This compares to Q4 2018  when we recorded a GAAP operating loss of  3 2 billion and GAAP net loss to Teva s shareholders of  2 9 billion and a GAAP loss per share of  2 85  The year over year improvement in the quarterly result was mainly driven by the impact of non recurring items which had as much greater negative effect in Q4 2018 compared to Q4 2019 Turning to Slide number 21  We see impairment provision of  477 million for intangibles in Q4 2019  of which  259 million in the U S  intangible assets related to the acquisitions of Actavis Generics  This compares to  2 7 billion of goodwill and  1 billion of intangibles in Q4 2018  Phonetic   Amortization was  290 million for the fourth quarter and we expect 2020 run rate should be at the average of  250 million and  260 million per quarter  Lastly  restructuring charge of  59 million in the quarter were consistent with the ongoing activities throughout 2019 As we turn to Slide 22  we review our non GAAP performance  Quarterly revenue were  4 5 billion  up slightly compared to Q4 2018  Revenue were mainly affected by higher revenue from AUSTEDO  AJOVY  TRUXIMA  QVAR  ProAir and ANDA in the U S  as well as Europe generics  new product launch and Russia offset by generic competition to COPAXONE as well as decline in revenue from BENDEKA and TREANDA  Israel and Japan Compared to Q4 2018  we experienced a negative FX impact of  470 million  Net of FX  revenue in Q4 2019 increased by  96 million or 2   Gross margin for the quarter was 60 6  compared to 52 7  in Q4  18  The change in gross margin was mainly driven by a declining share and profit of COPAXONE in the U S  as an increasingly less profitable distribution business  partially offset by the ramp of AUSTEDO and AJOVY as well as an increase in profitability of API and other activities Operating profit in Q4  2019 was  1 1 billion  a 12  increase compared to Q4 2018  The increase was mainly due to the ongoing cost reduction program  higher revenue for AUSTEDO and the ProAir family  partially offset by a decline in COPAXONE and other specialty brands  mainly BENDEKA TREANDA  Compared to Q4 2018  we experienced a negative FX impact of  29 million  thus operating income increased by  144 million or 50  net of FX  We ended the quarter with a non GAAP EPS of  0 62  18  or  0 09 higher than Q4 2018  Mostly due to higher operating profit and lower finance expenses  partially offset by higher debt Before going further with my review of the quarter  I would like to take a few minutes to discuss the revision of previously reported consolidated financial statements related to our Israeli distribution business SLE  This business is part of the International Markets reporting segment  which facilitates distribution of Teva and third party products to pharmacies  hospitals and other organization in Israel In connection with the preparation of Teva consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31st  2019  Teva determined that in the full years and interim periods of fiscal years 2017 and 2018 and the first three quarters of fiscal year 2019 is an immaterial error in the presentation of the distribution revenues from its Israeli distribution business The Company evaluate the cumulative impact of this item on its previously issued annual financial statements for 2017 and 2019 and interim financial statement for 2017 and 2018 in its first three quarters of 2018  Phonetic   It concluded that the revisions were not material individually or in aggregate to any of its previously issued interim or annual financial statements Teva has revised its presentation of the net revenue and cost of sale in the historical consolidated financial statement to reflect this item  The impact of this revision is a decrease in the net revenue with an offsetting decrease in the cost of sales  There is no impact on the gross profit  operating income or earnings per share  In addition  there is no impact on Teva s balance sheet or statement of cash flows for the related periods On Slide 24  you can see a very detailed illustration of what s changed and what did not due to the revision I just described  Throughout the presentation  we have noted the revisions in some cases like we have done here that presented results both prior to and after the revision in order to assist you in your analysis Now  turning to Slide 25  We can see that the fourth quarter was especially strong one for free cash flow  Teva free cash flow in Q4 2019 was  974 million  an increase of  452 million or 87  compared to Q4 2018 and more than  2 billion for the full year 2019  exceeding our annual guidance  The difference compared to Q4 2018 was mainly due to the higher net income  focused working capital management  as well as a few one items most notably SLE sale and leaseback deal As it relates to the working capital in 2020  I would note that we expect working capital to be neutral to positive source of cash  Generating free cash flow is our greatest focus in order to successfully continue reducing our debt load  an effort which is highlighted in Slide 26 We ended the year with a net debt of just under  25 billion and a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 5 32 times  the second consecutive quarter decline  Our expectation is that by the end of 2020  our net debt to EBITDA ratio will be below five times  As Kare mentioned in his remarks  following our successful financing in November  our liquidity and expected cash flow will cover bond repayments for the next three years Now  let s look at the development of 2019 results versus our guidance here on Slide 27  We present the full year 2019 performance compared to the original guidance issued at the start of 2019  as well as the revised guidance from November will serve us to bring up the bottom end of all of the ranges Please note that as it s related to revenue  the guidance range are the original range and do not reflect the revision of SLE  To add in your analysis representing the 2019 sales prior and after the revision  And as I mentioned earlier  there is no further impact on the other metric that you see here including cash flow We are very pleased with the overall performance throughout the year  which allow us to meet all of our financial guidance target  We believe this results provide a strong foundation for us to begin growing from 2020 and beyond Turning to Slide 28  I would like to give you a brief overview of some of the main assumption for our 2020 financial guidance  which can also be found in this morning s press release  The most notable assumption is our global COPAXONE revenue  which we expect to decline by approximately  300 million versus the full year 2019 The majority of this decline is expected to come mainly in the U S  but the decline will be offset by the ongoing growth of AUSTEDO and AJOVY  We expect continued momentum of AUSTEDO in both tardive dyskinesia and Huntington disease and expected sales to grow to  650 million in 2020 Furthermore  AJOVY is expected to benefit from continued patient growth in both U S  and Europe where we continue ramp up our initial launch in Germany  Global sales of AJOVY are expected to be approximately  250 million I would like to add that we expect both North America and U S  generics to be relatively stable compared to 2019  benefiting from new launches  which help us to offset regular price erosion or losses of exclusivities  In fact  the only real pressure we see is in our international generic where Japan continues to be a drag on our other regions  due to their National Health Insurance price revision A few more items to highlight in our assumptions  foreign exchange rate movements are expected to have a moderate negative impact on revenue and operating profit versus 2019  Looking at tax  in 2019 our tax was 18   As we guided last November  you will recall that our 2019 tax was higher than previous years due to the interest expense disallowance resulting from U S  tax reform and other changes to the tax provisions  As we look at 2020  we expect our tax to remain in the 17  to 18  range So now  turning to our financial outlook for 2020 on Slide 29  Based on the assumption I just reviewed as well as the SLE revenue revision  we expect total 2020 revenues to be between  16 6 billion to  17 billion  Non GAAP operating income is expected to be between  4 billion and  4 4 billion  while EBITDA is expected to be between  4 7 billion  Phonetic  to  4 9 billion  Using a share count of approximately 1 1 billion shares  we expect earnings per share to be in the range of  2 30 to  2 55  Lastly  2020  Phonetic  free cash flow is expected to be in at range of  1 8 billion to  2 2 billion And this concludes my review for the fourth quarter results and 2020 financial guidance  We will now open up the call for questions and answers  Operator  would you please open the call for questions Questions and Answers OperatorThank you very much   Operator Instructions  The first question we have today comes from the line of Gregg Gilbert from SunTrust  Please go ahead Gregg Gilbert    SunTrust Robinson Humphry    AnalystThank you  First  Kare  I was hoping you could provide whatever update you can about progress on the settlement framework you laid out a few months ago  given its importance to cash flow and debt etc  in the coming years And my follow ups for Brendan  How can we best think about U S  generics sales in 2020 and can you provide the obligatory update on important products like generic Forteo and NuvaRing and whether they re factored in for this year  Thank you Kare Schultz    President   Chief Executive OfficerThanks for those two questions  So I ll address the first one  and Brendan will to do the second  The framework that we negotiated last year is still being worked on  And the AGs are active and we are active in this  And so is the other participants in the framework  the three distributors and Johnson   Johnson  And I m still cautiously optimistic that this will result in an actual settlement and this will be  I think  positive for the U S  population It will be positive for those  the people in the U S  suffering from substance abuse  So  I m optimistic that it will come to fruition  There is of course the New York trial coming up around 20th of March and it would of course be beneficial if the settlement could materialize before that date  so that we wouldn t have to go through that trial  But it remains to be seen  There is nothing firm on it  but I ll just repeat that I m optimistic about the changes of the framework resulting in a firm settlement  Brendan Brendan O Grady    Executive Vice President  North America CommercialGood morning and thanks for the question  So  in regards to the North American generic business  we see this year 2020  much like we did 2019  It is around a  4 billion business and should continue to be right around that range  We get a lot of questions around the products and with some of the big product launches here  Of course Restasis  we continue to work with the FDA and have positive discussions there as well as NuvaRing  So  they are in the 2019 plan  Of course  they re properly risk adjusted TRUVADA is there as well in Q4  And of course  we ve already launched the biosimilar TRUXIMA  which is the Rituxan biosimilar which is going quite well and we ll launch HERZUMA in the March timeframe  So  all in all we see this year shaping up very similar to last year as far as the U S     or the North American generic business  which is stabilized for us quite nicely Kare Schultz    President   Chief Executive OfficerThank you Brendan  Next question OperatorThank you very much  The next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal from Bernstein  Please go ahead Ronny Gal    Sanford C  Bernstein   Co   LLC    AnalystGood morning  everybody  and thank you for taking my question  First question is for Eli around cash flows  I m kind of looking at your cash flow year over year and you re basically pointing us to essentially flattish free cash flow  You had a lot of impairment charges in 2019 that probably should not recur in 2020 associated with elimination of staff and so forth  Is there anything in the free cash flow in 2020 that we should be aware of  Is there    did you put some additional reserves for settlements and so forth or is this essentially the earning power of the business And the follow up is around the biosimilar business  If I understand what Brendan told us  you guys are putting the biosimilar revenue in the U S  into the generic business  I was wondering if you can tell us a little bit about the relative contribution here  the margins  And I noticed that you ve got TVB going into    in the clinical already  but I couldn t find it in ClinicalTrials gov  Can you share with us what that product might be Kare Schultz    President   Chief Executive OfficerSo Eli will take the first one and then Brendan will take the second part Eli Kalif    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerHello  Thanks for the questions  So  if you look on 2019 in terms of cash flow  We have kind of several one items  One of them  as I mentioned in my prepared remarks is the SLE lease back  This one equivalent around  120 million and we have some significant reduction in our working capital  mainly associated with inventories of around  200 million for Q3 to Q4 as well year over year of around  300 million So  if you    actually  it still goes to too many items  you will end around  1 7 billion   1 8 billion working now on the midpoint of around  2 billion for next year  and this is associated with what we re doing now in terms of operations and margin and again more positive I would say elements on working capital Ronny Gal    Sanford C  Bernstein   Co   LLC    AnalystSo  this is really the earning power of the company in terms of cash flow  That s a good    it s a good base to start the improvement for the following years  Thank you Brendan O Grady    Executive Vice President  North America CommercialYeah  correct  So Ronny  in regards to the biosimilar  so as you know we launched TRUXIMA in the fourth quarter and we were fairly pleased with the uptake of TRUXIMA in the fourth quarter  We achieved double digit market share and you can see the market share kind of    it s been bopping around between 12  and 15   We think we can grow that and we re pleased with the growth seen as well We re not going to get actually into the margin  you can probably back into that a little bit  but as you know  we have a profit share with Celltrion  So  it s something that we don t really disclose  But we are reporting TRUXIMA as well as HERZUMA in the generic business  And I missed the last part of your question Ronny Gal    Sanford C  Bernstein   Co   LLC    AnalystYou ve got in your pipeline a product supposedly in Phase 1  a new biosimilar that you re developing on your own in Phase 1 and it s not on ClinicalTrials gov  I wonder if you can share with us what that is and should we see it there soon Brendan O Grady    Executive Vice President  North America CommercialRonny  I would actually prefer not to comment on anything that early in the pipeline  So  we ll share more information with you that is appropriate at the right time Ronny Gal    Sanford C  Bernstein   Co   LLC    AnalystThank you Kare Schultz    President   Chief Executive OfficerThank you  next question OperatorThank you very much   Operator Instructions  The next question we have comes from the line of Louise Chen from Cantor  Please go ahead Louise Chen    Cantor Fitzgerald    AnalystHi  thanks for taking my questions here  So  my first question here is  if you could elaborate more on some of the pushes and pulls that actually get you to a sales and EBITDA growth in your guidance for 2020  And then my follow up here is  can you elaborate also a little bit more on the outlook for the European and the rest of the world generic market  Thank you Kare Schultz    President   Chief Executive OfficerThank you  I ll take those  So  if you take the push and pulls  then of course you got the main push and pulls regarding the main assumptions  So  there is a pull coming from the global COPAXONE where we are saying that we did  1 5 billion in  19 and we expect to do  1 2 billion in 2020  that s roughly around  700 million in U S    400 million in EU and a  100 million in international markets  So  that s a pull of  300 million And then we have AUSTEDO and AJOVY growing and altogether they grow up to  900 million that s a plus of  400 million  So  that of course net positive of  100 million  Then once you get into the details and of course there is a lot of details  Eli mentioned that we have price erosion on some of the key products in Japan linked to the reimbursement system of the Japanese government  So  there is a decline there We have other elements where we have increases  So  a lot of smaller moving parts  If we look and sort of sliding to the second part of your question about the generic business in Europe and in international markets  then we are expecting and we said this before as well  we are expecting low single digit growth of the generic market in Europe and also in international markets  If you exclude the price pressure that we re seeing on the long listed products in Japan  So a low single digit growth of generic and OTC for that matter in those markets  Thank you  Next question please OperatorThank you  The next question comes from the line of Esther Rajavelu from Oppenheimer  Please go ahead Esther Rajavelu    Oppenheimer   Co     AnalystGood morning  Thank you for taking my questions  Kare a quick one for you  if I may  You ve talked about 2019 as a trough year for earnings  yet the low end of your earnings guidance is below 2019 results  Can you walk us through some of the considerations that went into setting that lower end of the guidance range Kare Schultz    President   Chief Executive OfficerSo  when you set your guidance range  you will always have some kind of needed flexibility because you don t know what s going to happen  And I have not missed the guidance of the company I ve been working at for 62 quarters in a row  I m not planning to start doing that now  So  that means that in your guidance  you always need a certain flexibility for having some unforeseen events happening and you can never sort of say to investors that there won t be bad surprises  right So therefore  of course the guidance includes a certain level of flexibility to handle bad surprises  That s just the way it is and that s also the way it should be because with the breadth of our business globally  we cannot foresee anything that might happen during a full year  So therefore  you re right at the low end  But low end is of course on what we are aiming for  that will never be the case  but it reflects the fact that there s always uncertainty in any business Esther Rajavelu    Oppenheimer   Co     AnalystThank you  And then a quick follow up on AJOVY  How are you thinking about the U S   OUS split in that  250 million guidance and do you think an oral CGRP for prevention in the U S  could disrupt the market for meds meaningfully either on pricing or patient preferences Kare Schultz    President   Chief Executive OfficerYeah  So  a quick answer to this roughly  200 million in the U S  and roughly  50 million outside the U S  with some variation of course depending on the launch speed outside of the U S  and we don t think that the acute therapies that are coming to the market will have any meaningful effect on the preventive therapies that we re talking about here Next question please OperatorThank you very much  The next question comes from the line of Amy Fadia from SVP Leerink  Please go ahead Ami Fadia    Leerink Partners    AnalystHi  good morning  Thanks for taking my question  Can you talk about some of the dynamics with regards to AJOVY in the U S  market  now that you have an Autoinjector  Would you be more aggressive with regards to contracting and getting formulary access there to drive further growth  And if you can talk about how that dynamic might play out in the context of some new entrants in the market there  And then I have a follow up Kare Schultz    President   Chief Executive OfficerThank you very much  Brendan will answer your question Brendan O Grady    Executive Vice President  North America CommercialSo yeah  I mean  when you look at the  the preventative CGRP market in the U S  and we knew that as we went through  19 there were going to be ebbs and flows as to how things went with AJOVY  But in general  we have the payer coverage that we need to hit our targets  we re about 70  preferred coverage across U S  Of course  there are gaps that we continue to work on and we continue to have conversations with payers  but it s certainly a balance as you look at your gross to net as to how aggressive that you like to be and you need to be We think now that we have the Autoinjector approved as we    as we prepare for launch which we ll do here in the next couple of months  We will have an offering that is really unmatched in the CGRP market  will have the prefilled syringe  will have the auto injector  will have the ability for medical    on the medical side as well as on the self administer patient side  And of course we have the quarterly dosing which continues to increase  So  the quarterly dosing now is up to about 17 1   We continue to see that grow and that s really indicative of AJOVY being the longest acting CGRP preventative therapy  So  we re quite optimistic about the continued growth of AJOVY and our competitive place in the market Ami Fadia    Leerink Partners    AnalystOkay  thank you  Can you also talk about the market opportunity in Tourette syndrome for AUSTEDO and then maybe if possible  give us an update on the Forteo application  Thank you Kare Schultz    President   Chief Executive OfficerYeah  So on Tourette  of course  we haven t seen the final Phase III data  So  it s a bit too early  But it is quite clear that if we were to see positive outcome of the Phase III trial  And following that  if we were to get an approval from FDA  this is a very clear medical need for thousands of patients  So  there is definitely a very meaningful use of the product in that indication and there is a very meaningful market for the product in that indication  And then on your    I guess your third question on Forteo  Brendan Brendan O Grady    Executive Vice President  North America CommercialYeah  I ll just give you a quick update on Forteo  We continue to work with the FDA on Forteo  as you know  And if we re successful this year  it would be late this year or could slide into 2021  We ll wait and see that we re continuing to work with the FDA on it Kare Schultz    President   Chief Executive OfficerThanks Brendan  next question OperatorThank you  The next question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore  Please go ahead Umer Raffat    Evercore ISI    AnalystHi  Since everyone is asking 1 3 questions  I ll do the same  First  Kare on the 2020 guidance  I noticed you re guiding ahead of consensus on the AJOVY and AUSTEDO and a little bit on COPAXONE too and yet the overall guidance is not ahead of consensus  It almost makes me ask  is that delta entirely explained by the revision in ANDA distribution ex U S  or are you guiding slightly below consensus on generics as well  That s first Second  the Tourette s trial you re flagging as a catalyst  it s my understanding that trial has been concluded since November and I would have thought we should have results by now  And the fact that we don t makes me wonder maybe we shouldn t be setting high expectations but you flagged it very prominent  So I m curious where you guys shake out and what are you expecting from that trial  especially knowing Neurocrine did not work there And finally  the operating margin target of 28  that you are setting out  can you give us a little more color on that as it relates to whether it assumes additional SG A  R D declines or do you have to assume at least  2 billion in new revenues to get to those margin targets  Thank you Kare Schultz    President   Chief Executive OfficerOkay  Yeah  like you said  three integrated questions and let me try and answer all three of them relatively briefly  So  first of all  the dynamics I mentioned on the revenue  they are really sort of reflecting a marginal increase in revenue  which is also what the guidance is reflecting  if you look at it  We re not seeing a dramatic increase in revenue and of course  it will accelerate in the coming years  simply due to the math that as we ve talked about before  the drag from COPAXONE is getting less and less as you can see and the contribution from AUSTEDO and AJOVY is getting bigger and bigger In terms of North American generics  we are also maintaining the guidance we ve had for the past  I would say two years  which is the North American generics around  4 billion  which means  1 25 billion  It can be up and down  it can be between  900 million and  1 1 billion  But that s really how we see it also for the year as the common rate  yeah On Tourette  you re absolutely correct  We don t know  You know the way it works with trials is of course that they are completely blinded  they get  you end them  you clean the data  you do the analysis  and until you sort of have the final conclusions  you don t inform anybody about it other than the team that s working on it  So  I have no knowledge about it just like you have no knowledge about it So  it s anybody s guess  you re absolutely right  Other products has failed in these trials  I have no reason to believe different than anybody else  So that basically means that in a situation like this there is  you know  a big chance of success and a big chance of failure  That s the way it is with any Phase III trial In terms of the 28  margin then what I tried to explain it presentation was that we are now intensively working on a gross margin improvement project  As you know our gross margin is around 50   which means that the biggest cost elements in our entire P L is our manufacturing costs and that also means if you want to see a meaningful improvement in your total margin then you really need to try and improve that element and that s really what we re driving for now  doing a lot of things at the same time  ending a very consistent gross margin improvement program Now  that also means that what you should expect will be done in order to reach the 28   It s a combination of improving the gross margin  modest growth in the top line  no dramatic changes to the R D and the commercial cost pattern Next question please Umer Raffat    Evercore ISI    AnalystThank you OperatorThank you very much  The next question comes from Randall Stanicky from RBC Capital Markets  Please go ahead Randall Stanicky    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystThanks  Kare  looking at your net leverage target of just under 3 times by 2023  If we take the current net debt and apply roughly  2 billion in free cash flow pay down through that time period  the implied EBITDA growth or the applied EBITDA is closer to  6 billion  That seems like a big jump  And even if we take a higher free cash flow assumption  we still get pretty robust EBITDA growth  So the question is  what is your confidence in that current leverage target for 2023 And then the follow up is  you ve been talking more recently about China  than you have in the past  the revenue opportunity there for our products like TREANDA and AUSTEDO  Can you talk about how important China is over the next three to five years and how much revenue contribution you think you can get from that region  Thanks Kare Schultz    President   Chief Executive OfficerYeah  let me answer both of them  Let me start by China and saying it s not a significant contribution over the next three to five years  but it s a ramp up from basically close to zero and that means it s meaningful in the outer years  Of course  five to 10 years out  you will see that the strong percentage growth per year means the absolute number starts to be meaningful sort of five to 10 years out And China is a slow moving market where you need to launch your products and then they survive for long time  and they keep growing for long time  I ve done that in my previous two companies very successful and I think we can do exactly the same here with products such as TREANDA  AUSTEDO and so on  So  it s a more long term play than it s a short term factor I am very firm on the target of going below 3 times  I ll give you the simple math  just like you just laid out  let s say  we had just below  25 billion right now  At the end of  23 we ll probably be  let s just say very simplistic math at least  8 billion lower right  hopefully a little bit more because we ll do  2 billion plus a year That takes us to somewhere between    below  17 billion  Now  if you then say  hey what is 17 divided by three  That s just below six  So that means we need to grow EBITDA somewhere between  5 5 billion and  5 8 billion  And I think that s very realistic  So you re absolutely spot on with the math  But it s very doable and it s our plans to do it Randall Stanicky    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystGreat  that s helpful  Thank you Kare Schultz    President   Chief Executive OfficerNext question please OperatorThank you  The next question comes from Balaji Prasad from Barclays  Please go ahead Balaji Prasad    Barclays    AnalystHi  good morning and thanks for taking the questions  Firstly on biosimilars  can you throw some more color on the TRUXIMA market dynamics  Your competitor has come in with a strong discount and IMS shows you have a strong Q4  Can we expect this run rate to be maintained with a surprisingly aggressive discount Kare Schultz    President   Chief Executive OfficerSo  yes  when you look at the biosimilar  I assume that you re    when you re talking about discount  you mean there reduction of WAC price relative to the innovator  yes  So  we were 10  under  They came in at 23   24  under  But of course  there is more gross to net that happen in the overall channel  So  I think you have to take a look at how you balance that between the GPOs  between the payers  certainly have to take ASP into consideration and physician reimbursement So  all of those things are part of our competitive offering and I will tell you that we certainly want to maximize the value of the biosimilar launch  But at the same time  we intend to be competitive on pricing and make sure that    make sure that everybody in the value chain realign that appropriately to be successful Balaji Prasad    Barclays    AnalystGot it  That s helpful  Just secondly on  Celltrion announced its 2030 plans  Do you see an opportunity for you to enhance your current partnership which is just limited to 2 biosimilars  Could you take it up higher Kare Schultz    President   Chief Executive OfficerPotentially  I mean  we re certainly open to having those conversations and we have a good partnership going right now with the first two  We re very optimistic about the launch of TRUXIMA  So we ll see where it goes Balaji Prasad    Barclays    AnalystThank you Kare Schultz    President   Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Next question please OperatorThank you  The next question comes from the line of Soo Romanoff from Morningstar  Please go ahead Soo Romanoff    Morningstar  Inc     AnalystHi  Just a great quarter  In the generic side  I know you have TRUXIMA as a positive  but I think you had 50 launches on the generics  I mean is there    is that kind of offsetting any pricing or is the pricing stabilized Kare Schultz    President   Chief Executive OfficerSo  the pricing for us is somewhat stabilized  And I think it depends upon your portfolio and your mix  What you have launched that s new  what goes into transition  and what your basis  But for us  we ve seen the pricing stabilize for us  It doesn t mean that on the base business that we don t have consists in RFPs and price challenges and everything else because you do continue to see erosion there But new launches is certainly important  and it s not necessarily    because that s how you refill the bucket which you are losing on the base business  And it s not always necessarily the number of new launches  it s    you can have fewer launches but higher value launches  So  it kind of depends on the mix We had between 40 and 50  as you point out last year  depending upon what you count as the new launch  We probably will do fewer launches this year but we may have some higher value launches  So overall  that s kind of the ebb and flow of the generic business Eli Kalif    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah  I guess to repeat the overall numbers  We have a North American generic business of just around  4 billion and we see  you could say  price erosion every year stabilizing probably at around  400 million so like 10   But then we see new launches also of around  400 million  It could be  500 hundred  could be  400 million  it goes a little bit up and down But in the big picture  we see this as a very stable business going forward  And the same goes for Europe  where we see this modest single digit percentage growth of the business and the only real challenge you could say on the pricing we have right now is in Japan where the price reforms means that the long listed products are coming down in value and some of the generics are coming down in value  So overall  our generics business is in very good shape Soo Romanoff    Morningstar  Inc     AnalystYeah  that s super helpful  especially since you re kind of fighting off the COPAXONE and then the generic pricing  So  yeah  and great    great stuff on the specialty side also  Thank you Eli Kalif    Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThank you Kare Schultz    President   Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Next question please OperatorThank you  The next question comes from the line of Elliot Wilbur from Raymond James  Please go ahead Elliot Wilbur    Raymond James    AnalystThanks  good morning  Kare  just want to go back to the AJOVY opportunity in Europe  Could you reframe for us  once again  how you see that opportunity relative to the U S  in dollar terms  And then what you think your ultimate capture could be of that market  I know you ve talked about hoping to get back to 25  in the U S   but how are you thinking about the relative European or ex U S  opportunity  I should say And then  I also want to go back to  you ve talked about the operating margin target quite a bit already  but wanted to just drill down on that a little bit more  If I think about 350 basis points of improvement headed into 2023  I mean  that translates into incremental operating profit of around  630 million Relative to your total COGS line currently  it seems to be a very small number and I would have expected  just giving some of the more aggressive restructuring or manufacturing optimization initiatives that the ultimate savings there would be far greater than what we re seeing  which obviously also includes some element of growth in the business overall So  just if you could maybe provide a little bit more granularity in terms of what the actual dollar amount that could come out of the COGS line over the next couple of years versus growth in the business that would be helpful  Thanks Kare Schultz    President   Chief Executive OfficerSure  So  let me take those two questions  So first  we have the question about AJOVY outside of the U S  and if we look at Europe first  then one thing which is interesting  actually  given today s debate about some super pricing in the U S  is that the pricing level  we are seeing in Europe so far and that we expect to see going forward including different government rebates and so on  the net pricing is very similar between U S  and Europe So  we don t have this situation where Europe is priced lower and the frequency of chronic migraine and the treatment of chronic migraine is at the same level in Europe as in U S  basically meaning and you have a slightly bigger patient pool in Europe than you have in U S There is traditionally a slower penetration in Europe than in the U S  for couple of reasons  One of the reasons is that you have 35 countries  each with their own healthcare systems and reimbursement systems  So  it takes a while to do the negotiations and get on reimbursement country by country  We re doing quite well  We got a lot of the big countries  But we re still working on others  And that means that your ramp up curve in terms of the market penetration is slower Our expectation is that we can commence the same share  basically a 25  share  We believe we have a clinical profile  which is actually the best in the market  It s longer acting than your products  it s both quarterly dosing and monthly dosing and now  we have a really  really good Autoinjector that matches the competition  So  we believe that 25  is a realistic target for this market On top of Europe  you could say there is a lot of small countries  but there is also Japan  where we have outlicensed the product to a very good partner Otsuka  that I know  for many years  And they just concluded very successfully the local trial in collaboration with us with excellent clinical outcome  once again As you ll notice AJOVY has    only had excellent clinical outcomes in all trials short  long whatever and now also in Japan  So  we re also optimistic about the opportunity in Japan  So  long term but now we re talking maybe five years out  you probably see the same potential for AJOVY in U S  as in the rest of the world Now addressing your second question  then 2023 is not the end of the optimization of our manufacturing operations  But what we are doing now is a long term program that we ll continue most likely for the next 10 years where you optimize on a sustainable basis more and more by integrating your manufacturing more and more  Let s remember we come from a situation the company was created out of 20 mergers  manufacturing sites all over world  not really consolidated IT systems  not consolidated manufacturing planning And we are improving all of that as we speak and we think the target we gave you for 28  in 2023 is very realistic  And then after that  of course  we will continue to work on optimizations  but it doesn t happen that fast in manufacturing  So  I m sure you know regulatory requirements  approvals  stability programs  all the things you need to do when you consolidate and optimize your manufacturing is something that takes time  And therefore  I think it s a realistic target we have  but it s also a cost of development and it s of course something we will keep on doing also after 2023  Yeah  last Kevin C  Mannix    Senior Vice President  Investor RelationsI think so  do we have any more OperatorNo Kevin C  Mannix    Senior Vice President  Investor RelationsSo thank you

217130,438646,TEVA,Teva Pharmaceutical Reports a Step Back in 2019,news,"Teva Pharmaceutical Industries  NYSE TEVA  reported its results from the end of 2019 on Wednesday  and the big story was the headwinds it faced  Generic competition for Copaxone  declining generic drug prices  and a big debt load continued to pester the giant drugmaker  but it looks like all three of those issues are receding 
The worst is over 
In 2019  total revenue declined 8  to  16 9 billion  but rising sales of some newer drugs more than offset the falling sales of Copaxone during the last three months of the year  

Fourth quarter sales of Austedo  a treatment that prevents involuntary muscle movement  rose 98  to  136 million  Sales of Ajovy  a new monthly injection for the prevention of migraine headaches  reached  25 million  and could climb much higher if it becomes popular among the millions of Americans who suffer from those debilitating headaches at least a few times each month 
As a result  fourth quarter sales rose 1  to  4 5 billion  and revenues will probably continue rising as Copaxone s slide flattens out in 2020  The aging multiple sclerosis treatment was responsible for just 11  of Teva s North American revenue during the last three months of 2019 
Paying down debt
This year  Teva Pharmaceuticals expects revenue to remain flat or dip slightly to a range between  16 6 billion and  17 billion  Global Copaxone sales that reached  1 5 billion in 2019 are expected to slip to  1 2 billion in 2020 
On the bottom line  the company thinks free cash flow could decline slightly and land in the  1 8 billion to  2 2 billion range  That s would still be enough to allow it to put another big dent in its debt  which finished 2019 at 5 3 times earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization  EBITDA   In 2020  Teva expects to bring its debt load below 5 0 times EBITDA ",2020-02-13,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pudqy,2083403
217166,438682,TEVA,Teva Pharm nudges up earnings forecast  names new CFO,news,"JERUSALEM  Reuters    Teva Pharmaceutical Industries  TA TEVA  nudged up its full year earnings guidance on Thursday  after reporting a drop in third quarter profit that broadly met expectations 
The world s largest generic drugmaker earned 58 cents per diluted share excluding one time items in the July September period  down from 68 cents a year earlier 
It cited higher tax expenses and lower operating profit  which were partially offset by lower finance expenses 
Revenue fell 6  to  4 26 billion due to generic competition for its multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone and declines in sales in the United States  Russia and Japan  although it posted gains in some of its newly launched drugs 
Analysts had forecast Israel based Teva  N TEVA  would earn 59 cents a share ex items on revenue of  4 24 billion  according to I B E S data from Refinitiv 
Revenue in North America dipped 9  to  2 05 billion  with North American sales of Copaxone down 41    to  271 million  Its new migraine drug Ajovy had revenue of  25 million  while sales of Huntington s treatment Austedo rose to  105 million from  62 million 
Teva is looking to Ajovy and Austedo to boost revenue and help it pay down its huge debt load 
Chief  E xecutive Kare Schultz said Teva remained on track to achieve a two year restructuring target of  3 billion in spending reductions 
Teva said it had legal settlements of  468 million in the third quarter  mainly in connection with opioid cases in the United States 
Its debt load had fallen to  26 9 billion at the end of September from  28 7 billion three months earlier 
For 2019  the company raised its forecast for adjusted earnings per share  EPS  to  2 30  2 50 from  2 20  2 50 and revenue to  17 2  17 4 billion from  17 0  17 4 billion

217255,438771,TEVA,Toxin at heart of drug recall shows holes in medical safety net,news,"By Alexandra Harney and Ben Hirschler SHANGHAI LONDON  Reuters    A toxin inadvertently produced in the manufacture of a widely prescribed medicine but not spotted for years raises questions about regulators  ability to detect risks in a sprawling global drug supply chain increasingly reliant on factories in China  China s Zhejiang Huahai Pharmaceutical  SS 600521   which produces bulk ingredients for drugmakers  told its customers in late June it had found NDMA in its valsartan  an off patent blood pressure drug originally developed by  Novartis   S NOVN   The discovery means that some of the 10 billion pills containing valsartan sold worldwide last year to prevent heart attacks and strokes had traces of N nitrosodimethylamine  NDMA   classified as a probable human carcinogen  No one has been reported as sickened by the toxin  once used in the production of liquid rocket fuel  Regulators and industry experts say the toxin almost certainly was introduced when Huahai changed the way it produced valsartan in 2012   a modification that was signed off on by the European body that sets standards  Subsequent inspections by European  U S  and Chinese regulators also found no problem   Everyone failed   the company  the inspectors  the FDA  U S  Food and Drug Administration   the Europeans  the Chinese   said Philippe Andr   an independent pharmaceutical auditor who inspected two Huahai facilities last August and found no critical concerns   It s a system failure   Reuters was unable to determine how Huahai first discovered the problem  In a July 7 statement released through the Shanghai Stock Exchange  it said it detected the toxin during the  optimization and evaluation  of its manufacturing process  A Novartis spokesman told Reuters that its generic drugs arm  Sandoz  spotted the NDMA in the course of intensive testing to prepare for expanding its purchases of valsartan  He declined to comment further  including on the identity of the manufacturer or when the tests took place  Two other smaller bulk suppliers   Zhejiang Tianyu Pharmaceutical  SZ 300702  and a unit of India s Hetero Drugs   have since also discovered traces of NDMA in some of their valsartan   The three companies declined to comment to comment about the case   For a graphic on heart drug widely used  click  REDUCE WASTE Huahai said in a document released through the Shanghai Stock Exchange it changed the production process to reduce waste and improve yields    The NDMA impurity was produced in trace amounts during the normal manufacturing process according to the company s current registered process   it said in a statement on July 24   All changes in the company s valsartan manufacturing process have been approved by each country s drug regulator  and the company manufactures in compliance with legal and regulatory standards   The European Medicines Agency  EMA  regulator  which first publicly raised the alarm in a statement on July 5  told valsartan suppliers in a subsequent memo dated July 16 that the NDMA may have been connected to the combined use of the solvent dimethylformamide and sodium nitrite  The FDA is also going on that hypothesis  said Janet Woodcock  director of its Center for Drug Evaluation and Research  She stressed the investigation was still going on   This  NDMA  was not what you look for in an inspection   Woodcock said in an interview   If you don t test for this you re not going to have an idea that it s in there  and you re not going to see it on an inspection   The European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines  EDQM   responsible for setting manufacturing standards  told Reuters it was aware the solvent was being used when it approved the changed process  but that NDMA as a by product was unexpected and not tested for   Detecting NDMA would have required gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry  a very sensitive level of testing  an EDQM spokeswoman said   These techniques are not normally used routinely to test pharmaceutical products   she said  RECALLS Built by Novartis into the  6 billion a year brand Diovan  valsartan s European and U S  patents expired in 2011 and 2012  Global sales totaled 10 4 billion pills last year  including combination products  healthcare data consultancy IQVIA estimates  People with high blood pressure typically take one pill daily and heart failure patients two   More than 50 companies around the world making finished tablets from the tainted valsartan have recalled products in recent weeks  according a Reuters analysis of national medicines agencies  records  They include major generic drug manufacturers such as Teva Pharmaceutical  NYSE TEVA  Industries  TA TEVA   Ranbaxy Laboratories and Sandoz   Based on the average NDMA impurity detected at Huahai of 60 parts per million  ppm   the EMA says there could be one additional case of cancer in every 5 000 people taking the highest dose for seven years  The contamination puts a spotlight on manufacturers in China and India  which supply more than two thirds of all active pharmaceutical ingredients used in medicines  industry executives estimate  China accounts for the lion s share   Huahai  founded in 1989 and listed in Shanghai in 2003  was one of the first Chinese companies to get drugs approved in the U S  market   The FDA has inspected the site that made the contaminated valsartan three times since 2010  its records show  European inspectors also visited regularly  The provincial branch of the Chinese FDA  CFDA  also inspected Huahai facilities 10 times in connection with new drug applications between January 2016 and June 2018  the national online database shows  SCRUTINY U S  and European regulators have increased scrutiny of Chinese and Indian drug factories after the adulteration of the blood thinner heparin sickened hundreds and caused the deaths of at least 81 Americans in 2007 and 2008  The CFDA is also on alert   Last month  it revealed that Changsheng Bio technology  SZ 002680   a vaccine maker  had fabricated data and sold ineffective vaccines for children  It also found that a diphtheria  tetanus and pertussis vaccine sold by the state owned Wuhan Institute of Biological Products was substandard  The fact that international inspections do not appear to have detected the NDMA contamination alarms Anders Fuglsang  a former European medicines regulator who runs a pharmaceutical consultancy in Denmark  
 We need to ask ourselves how it is possible   despite pharmacopoeias and agency guidelines  inspection programs with coordination across continents  a system of public quality control  and companies complying with all rules   that a nasty carcinogen can find its way into our drugs and be there for years without anyone noticing   he said ",2018-08-22,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/toxin-at-heart-of-drug-recall-shows-holes-in-medical-safety-net-1583102,1583102

217299,438815,TEVA,5 Low Price to Book Stocks To Buy In November,opinion,In value stock analysis  most investors use the P E ratio to search for lucrative stocks but there are other ratios that an investor can consider like price to sales ratio  P S  and price to book  P B  ratio  The P S ratio is simply price divided by sales  One of the reasons price to sales ratio is a better choice is because it looks at sales rather than earnings  However  the price to book ratio  P B ratio   though used less often  is also an easy to use valuation tool for identifying low priced stocks with great returns The P B ratio is calculated as below P B ratio   market price per share book value of equity per shareWhat is Book Value Book value is the total value that would be left over  according to the company s balance sheet  if it goes bankrupt immediately  In other words  this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company  In most cases  this equates to common stockholders  equity on the balance sheet  However  depending on the company s balance sheet  intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value Understanding P B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price  we get an idea of whether a company is under  or overpriced  However  like P E or P S ratio  it is always better to compare P B ratios within industries  A P B ratio less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value  or the stock is undervalued and therefore a good buy  Conversely  a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive For example  a stock with a P B ratio of 2 means that we pay  2 for every  1 of book value  Thus  the higher the P B  the more expensive the stock But there is a caveat  A P B ratio less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets  or that the assets are overstated  in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value  Conversely  the stock s price may be significantly high   thereby pushing the P B ratio to more than one   in the likely case that it has become a takeover target  a good enough reason to own the stock Moreover  the P B ratio isn t without limitations  It is useful for businesses   like finance  investments  insurance and banking or manufacturing companies   with many liquid tangible assets on the books  However  it can be misleading for firms with significant R D expenditure  high debt  service companies or those with negative earnings In any case  the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number  One should analyze other ratios like P E  P S and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision Screening ParametersPrice to Book  common Equity  less than X Industry Median  A lower P B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain Price to Sales less than X Industry Median  The P S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company s sales revenues   a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive Price to Earnings using F 1  estimate less than X Industry Median  The P E ratio  F1  values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share   a lower ratio than the industry is considered better PEG less than 1  PEG ratio links the P E ratio to the future growth rate of the company  PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P E ratio  A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has bright earnings growth prospects Current Price greater than or equal to  5  They must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher Average 20 Day

217339,438855,TEVA,Teva s Q2 Earnings May Show Litigation Complicating Growth Revival,opinion,"Reports Q2 2019 results on Wednesday  Aug  7  before the open


Revenue expectation   4 25 billion


EPS expectation   0 57

The drastic plunge in Teva Pharma  NYSE TEVA  shares this year shows that the worst is far from over for the world s largest generic drug maker  And there s little chance its second quarter earnings tomorrow will help build the case for a quick revival 
Since the company announced its Q1 earnings in May  investors  focus has shifted from CEO Kare Schultz s turnaround efforts to a new antitrust litigation by U S  states that puts Teva at the center of an alleged price fixing conspiracy 
The lawsuit  filed by more than 40 states in early May  accuses Teva of colluding with a core group of competitors to follow each other s price increases  During a 19 month period from 2013 to 2015  Teva significantly raised prices on about 112 generic drugs and colluded with its competitors on at least 86 medicines  the states said 
According to Morgan Stanley  Teva is one of the large drug makers which face heightened  litigation risks  related to its involvement in the U S  opioid crisis and state governments  actions against drug makers and distributors 





The risks of regulatory action and the possibility of a large fine mean Teva shares could remain depressed even if the turnaround efforts of Schultz begin to show results  After losing half of their value in the past three months  Teva shares were trading at  7 84 on Monday  having sunk 0 3  through the session 
Deep Slump
Teva is trying to recover from a deep slump  started in the summer of 2015  that sent its shares tumbling as the company invested heavily to grow its copycat medicines business  That happened at a time when margins began to shrink in the U S  amid fierce competition from other pharma producers 
The biggest setback came when Teva lost its monopoly on Copaxone  a blockbuster multiple sclerosis injection that at one point generated half of Teva s profits  That setback pushed Teva into a debt trap  raising doubts about its ability to repay its massive loans 
Analysts  consensus forecast for profit and sales for the Q2 shows that deceleration in revenue hasn t reached its bottom  During tomorrow s release  Teva is likely to report its profit fell to  0 57 a share from  0 78 a share from the year ago period  while sales to shrank 10  to  4 25 billion  according to analysts  average estimate 
Despite the outlook clouded by the litigation  there are signs that Schultz is on track to hit some of his restructuring targets  Teva has cut  2 5 billion of costs since Schultz took over  closing in on the target he set for the company for the end of the year  And at the same time the market for knockoff medicines is stabilizing after years of declines in profit margins 
Teva s robust pipeline of new drugs is another bright spot  The recent approval of its next generation migraine medication  Ajovy  has so far not created much excitement  but this drug has a great future and could bring in a significant new revenue stream in the next two to three years 
Teva s Huntington s disease medicine  Austedo  could also prove another big revenue generator  which would help the drugmaker arrest the slide in its sales  Austedo s peak sales are forecast to reach as high as  1 3 billion within the next three years 
Bottom Line
Teva is still very much a risky turnaround bet for those who have the patience to hold its stock through this highly challenging operating environment and its future outlook has become murkier after the new antitrust lawsuit  Any sign of improvement in the company s top line growth and the success of cost cutting efforts could produce a relief rally now that the shares have taken such a massive beating ",2019-08-06,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/tevas-q2-earnings-may-show-litigation-complicating-growth-revival-200451147,200451147

217341,438857,TEVA,Should Value Investors Pick Teva Pharmaceutical  TEVA  Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited   NYSE TEVA   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Teva Pharmaceutical has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 2 64  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 17 53  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Teva Pharmaceutical s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  Further  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Medical sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 20 01  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers   We should also point out that Teva Pharmaceutical has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 2 65  which is tad higher than the current level  So it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near term P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings  Right now  Teva Pharmaceutical has a P S ratio of about 0 38  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 11 right now   Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years   If anything  TEVA is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms  Broad Value Outlook In aggregate  Teva Pharmaceutical currently has a Zacks Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Teva Pharmaceutical a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too   For example  the P CF ratio comes in at 1 36  which is lower than the industry average of 3 63  Clearly  TEVA is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall  Though Teva Pharmaceutical might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of F and a Momentum Score of B  This gives TEVA a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores    Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been disappointing  The current year has seen four estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to six lower  while the full year 2020 estimate has seen three upward revision compared to six downward in the same time period This has had a negative impact on the consensus estimate though as the current year consensus estimate has decreased by 0 4  in the past two months  while the full year 2020 estimate has inched down by 1 6   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd  Price and Consensus    Despite the bearish analyst sentiments  the stock holds a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Thus  we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom Line  Teva Pharmaceutical is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible line up of statistics on this front  A strong industry rank  among top 24  of more than 250 industries  further instils our confidence However  a Zacks Rank  3 makes it hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks Medical   Generic Drugs industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below  So  value investors might want to wait for estimates  analyst sentiment and industry trends to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Today s Best Stocks from ZacksWould you like to see the updated picks from our best market beating

217390,438906,TEVA,Teva s Q1 Earnings Could Show CEO Schultz s Turnaround Still On Track,opinion,"  Reports Q1 2019 results on Thursday  May 2  before the market open  Revenue Expectation   4 38 billion  EPS Expectation   0 58
Teva Pharmaceuticals   NYSE TEVA  turnaround has been a tough sell for its Chief Executive Officer  Kare Schultz  at least in 2019 
The share price of the world s largest manufacturer of generic drugs has tumbled more than 40  from the 52 week high reached in August  amid concerns that the worst for the company s growth isn t over yet  Its stock was trading at  15 22 a share at yesterday s close  after sinking 2 5  through the session 

Analysts  consensus forecast for profit and sales for the first quarter suggests the investment community still remains doubtful about the company s transition to stability  During tomorrow s release  Israel based Teva is likely to report its profit fell to  0 58 a share from  0 94 a share from the year ago period  while sales to shrank 13 5  to  4 38 billion  according to analysts  average estimate 
Teva is trying to recover from a slump  started in the summer of 2015  that sent its shares tumbling as the company invested heavily to grow its copycat medicines business  That happened at a time when margins began to shrink in the U S  amid fierce competition from other pharma producers  The biggest setback came when Teva lost its monopoly on Copaxone  a blockbuster multiple sclerosis injection that at one point generated half of Teva s profits 
That bearish outlook  however  will change quickly if Schultz can show that his cost cutting efforts are working and the company has been able to control the decline in sales  We feel that outcome is unlikely this year  given the company s earlier warnings that growth will not return until next year and that 2019 will continue to be a  tough  year 
Teva Is a Compelling Value Play
But Teva  in our view  offers a compelling value opportunity if your investing horizon is long term and you re comfortable staying invested for the next few years  One big reason making us bullish on this beaten down stock is the CEO s measurable success in trimming Teva s costs and its huge pile of debt 
Against a very tough operating environment  Schultz managed to cut spending by  2 2 billion last year and will close or sell another 11 manufacturing plants in 2019  which would bring the total figure to about 60 sites 
Teva is also on track to meet its overall target of  3 billion in savings by the end of 2019  and may close more plants afterward  Schultz said in February  As a result of these measures  the company s debt has fallen to  29 billion from its 2016 peak of  36 billion 
Teva s robust pipeline of new drugs is another bright spot in the company s turnaround plan  The recent approval of its next generation migraine medication Ajovy has so far not created much excitement  but this drug has a great future and could bring in a significant new revenue stream in the next two to three years 
More than 36 million people suffer from these debilitating episodes and the medicine could generate around  500 million in sales by 2022  according to analysts  estimates  Teva s Huntington s disease medicine Austedo could also prove another big revenue generator  which would help the drugmaker arrest the slide in its sales  Austedo s peak sales are forecast to reach as high as  1 3 billion within the next three years 
Bottom Line
Despite the 2019 setback  we continue to see improvement in Teva s financials and investor perception going forward as the company successfully implements its three year turnaround plan and the U S  generic drug market shows signs of stability  Schultz s belt tightening  an impressive pipeline of new drugs  and the backing of large investors  including Warren Buffett s Berkshire Hathaway Inc   NYSE BRKa  and Capital Group Companies  make Teva a good turnaround stock for long term investors ",2019-05-01,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/tevas-q1-earnings-could-show-ceo-schultzs-turnaround-is-on-track-200413493,200413493

JZP 258 is an oxybate product candidate with 92  less sodium content than its marketed product Xyrem  sodium oxybate   Xyrem is currently approved for narcolepsy with cataplexy and EDS 
Jazz s shares have increased 10 1  so far this year compared with the  s rise of 15 2  

 
The phase III study evaluated JZP 258 for change in weekly cataplexy attacks compared to a placebo in adult patients with narcolepsy as its primary endpoint  It was mainly initiated to reduce sodium intake in narcolepsy patients associated with Xyrem  Data from the study demonstrated highly statistically significant differences in the number of cataplexy attacks as well as in the key secondary endpoint of change in Epworth Sleepiness Scale  ESS  score for JZP 258 versus placebo  The candidate has a safety profile similar to Xyrem 
Detailed data from the study will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting  Top line data from the phase III study along with interim data from an ongoing 24 week open label safety study will form the basis for the new drug application   NDA   for JZP 258 
Xyrem generates significant revenues for Jazz with sales from the drug expected to cross  1 5 billion in 2019  Earlier this month  the FDA approved Sunosi    as a treatment to improve wakefulness and reduce EDS  Potential approval to JZP 258 will boost Jazz s sleep disorder portfolio further 
Moreover  JZP 258 is likely to expand the patient population for Jazz as it will include patients ineligible for Xyrem as they are at risk for high sodium intake related consequences  including hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases  The highest approved dose of Xyrem of 9 grams per night contains 1 640 mg of sodium  which is almost 70  of the recommended daily sodium intake for a healthy adult per an  published on FDA s website 
The generic version of Xyrem is set to hit the market starting 2023  The low sodium content of JZP 258 and a similar safety profile is likely to largely offset the decline in Xyrem sales once generic versions enter the market 
A few other pharma companies are also developing treatment for narcolepsy  which includes Avadel Pharmaceuticals   NASDAQ AVDL    Approved drugs for narcolepsy include Teva Pharma s   NYSE TEVA   Provigil and Novartis    NYSE NVS   Ritalin SR Jazz Pharmaceuticals PLC Price

Prior to today s trading  shares of the company had lost 4 46  over the past month  This has lagged the Medical sector s gain of 1 34  and the S P 500 s gain of 1 83  in that time 
Wall Street will be looking for positivity from TEVA as it approaches its next earnings report date  In that report  analysts expect TEVA to post earnings of  0 59 per share  This would mark a year over year decline of 37 23   Meanwhile  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of  4 44 billion  down 12 37  from the year ago period 
For the full year  our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of  2 40 per share and revenue of  17 34 billion  which would represent changes of  17 81  and  8 05   respectively  from the prior year 
Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for TEVA  These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short term business trends  As a result  we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company s business outlook

217442,438958,TEVA,Teva Stock Is Still Cheap  Q4 Earnings Should Show Turnaround Progress,opinion,"  Reports Q4 2018 results on Wednesday  Feb  13  after the market close
  Revenue Expectation   4 53 billion
  EPS Expectation   0 54
Teva Pharmaceutical  NYSE TEVA  is showing great momentum this year  Its shares are up about 25 percent so far in 2019  more than 5x the levels the benchmark S P 500 is up 
Teva is trying to recover from a three year slump that sent its shares tumbling as the company invested heavily to grow its copycat medicines business 

That happened at a time when margins began to shrink in the U S  amid fierce competition from other producers  The biggest setback came when Teva lost its monopoly on Copaxone  a blockbuster multiple sclerosis injection that generated half of the company s profits at one point 
The challenges for the Israel based generic drug giant are enormous  It has to reduce its massive debt load at a time when generic drug prices are falling in the key U S  market and new competition for its top selling multiple sclerosis drug is intensifying 
But we believe Teva s restructuring program is getting into shape and 2019 will be the year when investors will see it begin to pay off 
In the third quarter CEO Kare Schultz  who has occupied the top slot for more than year now  showed that he is making a solid progress on reducing the company s leverage and cutting costs  Net borrowings  which peaked in 2016 at around  35 billion  have fallen below  30 billion 
Sales of MS drug Copaxone fell after new competitors emerged  but new product launches like migraine treatment Ajovy will bring in new revenue stream in the next two to three years 
Ajovy won U S  regulatory approval in September  More than 36 million people suffer from these debilitating episodes and the medicine could generate around  500 million of sales by 2022  according to analysts  estimates 
Despite these positive signs  a complete turnaround won t show in the numbers yet  Teva is forecast to report sales down more than 17 percent in the most recent quarter  with earnings per share shrinking to  0 54 from  0 93 in the year ago period 
Bottom Line
Teva is a good turnaround situation for value investors 
Despite its powerful rally in 2019  the stock is still quite cheap  with a forward price to earnings multiple of about 6 9  If the company s deleveraging and cost cutting continues and new experimental drugs  such as a non opioid pain treatment  prove successful  we could see Teva s sales growth revive sooner rather than later 
Teva isn t fully out of the woods  but for contrarian investors the time to take a chance is now  when the stock is cheap ",2019-01-25,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/teva-is-cheap-and-earnings-should-show-turnaround-progress-200379159,200379159
217443,438959,TEVA,Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd   TEVA  Stock Sinks As Market Gains  What You Should Know,opinion,"Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd   NYSE TEVA  closed the most recent trading day at  19 70  moving  0 76  from the previous trading session  This move lagged the S P 500 s daily gain of 0 09   Elsewhere  the Dow gained 0 26   while the tech heavy Nasdaq lost 0 25  
Coming into today  shares of the company had gained 20 38  in the past month  In that same time  the Medical sector gained 5 59   while the S P 500 gained 7 92  
TEVA will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release  which is expected to be February 13  2019  The company is expected to report EPS of  0 55  down 40 86  from the prior year quarter  Meanwhile  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of  4 54 billion  down 16 92  from the year ago period 
Any recent changes to analyst estimates for TEVA should also be noted by investors  These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short term business trends  As such  positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company s business and profitability 
Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near term stock prices  We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon  Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear  actionable rating model 
The Zacks Rank system ranges from  1  Strong Buy  to  5  Strong Sell   It has a remarkable  outside audited track record of success  with  1 stocks delivering an average annual return of  25  since 1988  Within the past 30 days  our consensus EPS projection has moved 0 42  lower  TEVA is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold  
Digging into valuation  TEVA currently has a Forward P E ratio of 7 1  Its industry sports an average Forward P E of 9 82  so we one might conclude that TEVA is trading at a discount comparatively 
It is also worth noting that TEVA currently has a PEG ratio of 6 04  This metric is used similarly to the famous P E ratio  but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock s expected earnings growth rate  TEVA s industry had an average PEG ratio of 1 22 as of yesterday s close 
The Medical   Generic Drugs industry is part of the Medical sector  This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 156  putting it in the bottom 39  of all 250  industries 
The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups  Our research shows that the top 50  rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1

217444,438960,TEVA,Why The Earnings Surprise Streak Could Continue For Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd   TEVA ,opinion,"If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report  you should consider Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd   NYSE TEVA   This company  which is in the Zacks Medical   Generic Drugs industry  shows potential for another earnings beat 
This company has an established record of topping earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 20 03  
For the last reported quarter  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd  Came out with earnings of  0 68 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 55 per share  representing a surprise of 23 64   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  0 67 per share and it actually produced earnings of  0 78 per share  delivering a surprise of 16 42  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd Estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd  Currently has an Earnings ESP of  0 50   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on February 13  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-02-03,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-the-earnings-surprise-streak-could-continue-for-teva-pharmaceutical-industries-ltd-teva-200383282,200383282

In exchange  Sanofi will pay Regeneron  462 million  representing the balance of payments due under the existing agreement  This payment will cover Sanofi s share of the immuno oncology discovery program costs for the last quarter of 2018 and up to  120 million in development costs for the two selected clinical stage bispecific antibodies plus the termination fee for the other programs under the original immuno oncology agreement 
In addition  the revised agreement gives Sanofi the right to opt in to the BCMAxCD3 and MUC16xCD3 bispecific programs when proof of concept is achieved or when the allocated funding is expended  On the other hand  Regeneron will commit up to  70 million to further develop the BCMAxCD3 bispecific antibody for multiple myeloma and up to  50 million to further develop the MUC16xCD3 bispecific for mucin 16 expressing cancers 
Assuming Sanofi exercises the right to opt in  the company will lead development and commercialization of the BCMAxCD3 bispecific  Sanofi will also fund 100  of development costs  with Regeneron reimbursing up to 50  out of its share of collaboration profits  Both the companies will share global profits equally 
Regeneron will lead MUC16xCD3 bispecific development and will be responsible for the commercialization in the United States  The companies will share development costs and global profits equally  Sanofi will be responsible for commercialization outside the United States 
Meanwhile  the ongoing collaboration for the development and commercialization of Libtayo  cemiplimab rwlc  will be unaffected by the revised agreement  The FDA has already approved Libtayo for advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma  CSCC   A regulatory application for Libtayo has also been submitted in the EU  The drug is also being evaluated in multiple other cancers  including potentially pivotal trials in lung  cervical and skin cancers 
Regeneron retains full rights to its other immuno oncology programs 
We note that  Regeneron has a global strategic collaboration with Sanofi for the discovery  development and commercialization of fully human monoclonal antibodies  Under the agreement  Regeneron has exercised the option to co promote Praluent  Dupixent and Kevzara in the United States 
Regeneron s key growth driver  Eylea was co developed with the HealthCare unit of Bayer  DE BAYGN  AG   OTC BAYRY     Regeneron has also partnered with Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd    NYSE TEVA   for the development of fasinumab in patients suffering from chronic pain from osteoarthritis  OA  of the knee or hip 
Regeneron s shares have gained 7 5  in the past six months  against a decline of 17 6  for the

Meanwhile  Regeneron is working on expanding Eylea s label into additional indications  The FDA recently approved a 12 week dosing interval of Eylea injection in patients with wet AMD based on physician s assessment 
Consequently  Eylea is now the only anti VEGF drug for the treatment of wet AMD that offers the flexibility to optimally treat patients  regardless of whether they require fixed interval dosing of 4  8 or 12 weeks  The FDA also accepted for review the supplemental Biologics License Application  sBLA  of Eylea for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy  with a target action date of May 13  2019 
Label expansion of other approved drugs will also boost sales for the company 
Dupixent s performance has been strong so far after the drug was approved last year for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis  AD   The company and partner Sanofi   NYSE SNY   are also working to expand Dupixent s label  which should diversify the company s revenue base and reduce dependence on the lead drug 
In October 2018  the FDA approved Dupixent as an add on maintenance therapy in patients aged 12 years or older with moderate to severe asthma  The drug is also under review in Europe for this indication and a decision is expected in the second quarter of 2019  The FDA has also accepted for priority review the sBLA for AD in adolescent patients and set a target action date of Mar 11  2019 
Regeneron is working to expand its portfolio pipeline  In September 2018  the FDA approved Libtayo for the treatment of patients with metastatic or locally advanced CSCC who are not candidates for curative surgery or curative radiation  The drug is also under review in Europe and a decision is expected in the first half of 2019  Libtayo is also being evaluated for the treatment of non small cell lung cancer in a phase III study  which is currently enrolling 
The company is also working to expand its PCSK9 inhibitor Praluent s label  The FDA approved Praluent for the treatment of patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia  HeFH  undergoing apheresis  The agency also accepted an sBLA for Praluent as a potential treatment to reduce major adverse cardiovascular events and had set a target action date of Apr 28  2019 
Approval of new drugs will further boost the top line  Earlier  the company and partner Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd    NYSE TEVA   announced positive top line results from a phase III study on pipeline candidate  fasinumab in patients suffering from chronic pain from osteoarthritis  OA  of the knee or hip 
We expect a solid performance from the company in the coming quarters as well

217503,439019,TEVA,Teva s Quarter Will Be A Window Into Its Turnaround,opinion,"Judging by the performance of Teva Pharmaceutical  NYSE TEVA  shares in recent months  it seems investors are starting to believe that the world s largest generic drugmaker is taking the right steps in its turnaround strategy 
The company reports earnings Thursday before the bell  On average  analysts expect the company to earn 65 cents per share on revenue of  4 74 billion 

Shares have surged 30  since the Israeli company produced powerful first quarter earnings  beating the consensus forecast by a big margin  A similar performance for Q2 will show that CEO Kare Schultz is in control of his plan to cut costs and manage a huge pile of debt 
Teva is trying to recover from a three year slump that sent its shares tumbling as the company invested heavily to grow its copycat medicines business  That happened at a time when margins began to shrink in the U S  amid fierce competition from other producers  The biggest setback came when Teva lost its monopoly on Copaxone  a blockbuster multiple sclerosis injection that at one point generated half of Teva s profits 
Despite the ups and downs of the past three years  there are signs that Teva is gaining some ground  Teva raised its full year guidance in May  anticipating earnings between  2 40 and  2 65 a share  up from a previous per share range of  2 25 to  2 50  It now sees revenues of  18 5 billion to  19 billion  up from  18 3 billion to  18 8 billion 
Keep An Eye On Cost Cuts
To further cement this recovery  Teva needs to show that prices for its products are bottoming out in the U S   the world s largest pharmaceutical market  and its new product launches are performing well despite the tough market conditions 
Teva launched 10 generic products in the first quarter  but said its generics business is still under pressure  Copaxone retained much of its market share in the first quarter with aggressive price cuts 
Details on cost cuts will be crucial  Schultz  who took over in November last year  plans to slash the company s workforce by 25   targeting to reach about half of that goal by the end of the second quarter  Teva has more than  17 billion of debt due over the next five years 
After managing investors  expectations with dire forecasts about its future  Teva has set the stage to impress with better than expected results down the road  But it s a long road to recovery  especially when the U S  pharmaceutical industry is going through drastic changes  ranging from accelerated Food and Drug Administration  FDA  approval of competing medicines to government regulation that limits drug prices ",2018-08-01,Haris Anwar/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/tevas-quarter-will-be-a-window-into-its-turnaround-200334951,200334951

Renewable Energy Group  Inc   REGI   one of our old swings  has done very well with a big run up and a 2 month consolidation  We noted the breakout last week  a beautiful wedge  and now it s accelerating  It popped 65 cents  or 3  on Thursday  to 22 40  on 747 711 shares  At the top of the channel it might pull back  but if it accelerates  this could be mid 20s  25 26 short term 
Stitch Fix  Inc   SFIX  swing trade is under way and working well  After breaking out  it s extended  On Thursday  it was up 1 33  or 4   to 34 16  on 1 8 million shares  I believe any move across he 35 1 2 range could lead to something near 39  That s my swing target

217580,439096,TEVA,Can PolarityTE Grow Skin From Scratch ,opinion,"What if we can grow fully functional skin  hair follicles and all  with just a biopsy  It s been done successfully in large animal studies already  and one biotech firm called PolarityTE Inc   NASDAQ COOL  is now trying it for the first time on humans  In just a few weeks  we ll find out if it works 
The company  now a year old  140M startup  just announced the first applications of its skin regenerating SkinTE  platform on its initial batch of patients  Included are those with burn wounds  surgical reconstructions  and unsightly scars  Some involved have even had their already healed skin grafts removed and replaced with the experimental technology 
It sounds like a hustle  but it s being backed by some of the biggest names in biotech  including former Teva
Teva Pharmaceutical  NYSE TEVA  Chairman Dr  Phillip Frost who owns nearly half a million shares and Medivation founder Dr  Steven Gorlin  now part of Pfizer  NYSE PFE  
The system itself is actually pretty simple to understand  In the case of minor cuts and scrapes  skin fully regenerates with little to no scarring  Full skin regeneration is possible because of cells called LGR cells  or leucine rich repeat containing G protein cells  These cells communicate with other skin cells through chemical signaling to determine which kinds of skin cells are needed at different layers within the wound  be they dermal  subdermal  epidermal  or hair follicles  In minor wounds  LGR cells can signal across the wound for fully functional skin regeneration 
But with serious injuries like major burns or large surgical scars  LGR cells cannot chemically signal across the area of the wound  The result is an area of disorganized  undifferentiated skin cells that serve as little more than a barrier  Hair is lost  sensation is dull at best  thickness  color and texture are all off 
Standard skin grafts  while obviously better than an open wound  are little more than aided scarring  Partial thickness autologous skin grafts only take the upper layers of skin  and full thickness skin grafts  while more fully functional  are risky for patients and unfeasible for larger wounds 
The company s founder Dr  Denver Lough  while working at Johns Hopkins Hospital Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery  discovered that the protein human alpha defensin 5  HAD5  induces LGR cells to proliferate and migrate into wound beds  in theory enabling full skin regeneration  Basically  a biopsy is seeded with LGR cells using HAD5  grown in vitro  and then applied to the site of injury  Soon after Lough made the discovery  he resigned from Johns Hopkins to found PolarityTE  pulling along many JHU physicians along with him including the director of the JHU burn center Dr  Stephen Milner  who now serves as the Chief Clinical Officer 
The same cellular mechanisms can  in theory  be applied to many tissues in the human body  with LGR cells directing the polarized regeneration of cartilage  bone  muscle  and blood vessels  PolarityTE has products in the proof of concept and preclinical stages for each of these applications  which could end up becoming a turnkey solution to all manner of injuries and illnesses like cardiovascular disease  muscle injury  arthritis caused by the thinning of cartilage between joints  etc  No FDA Approval Required
It s not just the technology itself  but the regulatory framework in which it operates that makes PolarityTE s platform disruptive  There are no clinical trials required here  meaning no Phase I  Phase II  or prohibitively expensive Phase III years long regulatory processes involved  SkinTE  is regulated under an FDA regime that requires no pre market clearance  save a post market regulatory follow up  That means SkinTE  can go to market whenever PolarityTE s sales team feels it is ready to do so  With the application of SkinTE  to its first patients  that process has already begun exactly one year since the company went public in December 2016  The same minimal regulations apply to all of its regenerative products in development  Finances
There is one potential weak point in the case for PolarityTE  It is low on cash  for now  As of August  the company has only  3 5 million  Though the sale of its SkinTE  kits to burn centers across the country has already begun  we do not know the hard numbers on its sales forecasts or margins yet  Nevertheless  the company is moving forward quickly and just announced a move to a 200 000 ft2 facility to expand manufacturing capabilities in anticipation of demand  There will probably be some equity financing ahead to fund a full scale rollout  which could dilute the holdings of current investors somewhat 
Regardless  the biggest influence on the stock price going into 2018 will be results reported on the initial patient batches as data comes in  If results are positive  PolarityTE will likely refinance on the back of that news at an elevated share price in order to fund a full marketing plan 
If results are negative  then this will obviously put into question PolarityTE s entire business model  making early data a likely binary event  Investors will find out the answer in a matter of months ",2017-12-21,Samuel Rae,https://www.investing.com/analysis/skin-grown-from-scratch-thanks-to-polarityte-well-soon-find-out-200275161,200275161

Teva is still in the process of finding buyers for one set of assets  a bundle of drugs in various stages of development worth about  500 million  but expects to agree to a deal as soon as next week  the source said  The source would not provide details on the buyers ",2016-05-05,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/teva-pharm-finalizing-asset-sales-to-clear-allergan-deal:-source-400227,400227

217706,439222,TEVA,Contraception opt out violates religious freedom  U S  appeals court,news,By Brendan Pierson  Reuters    A U S  appeals court has ruled that President Barack Obama s healthcare law violates the rights of religiously affiliated employers by forcing them to help provide contraceptive coverage even though they do not have to pay for it  Parting ways with all other appeals courts that have considered the issue  the 8th U S  Circuit Court of Appeals in St  Louis on Thursday issued a pair of decisions upholding orders by two lower courts barring the government from enforcing the law s contraceptive provisions against a group of religiously affiliated employers  The split in the circuit courts created makes it more likely that the U S  Supreme Court will take up the issue in its coming term  which begins in October and runs through June  Several employers have already filed petitions with the court  The Affordable Care Act  commonly known as Obamacare  requires employers to provide insurance for their employees  including access to contraception  sterilization and other preventative services for women  The law allows religiously affiliated non profit employers to opt out of paying for contraceptive coverage directly  Once they do  insurers must provide the coverage separately at no extra cost to the employee  Employers that do not follow the opt out process face a financial penalty  Many employers have filed lawsuits against the government  claiming that the opt out process makes them complicit in providing contraceptive coverage  Before Thursday  however  every appeals court that considered the issue has rejected that argument  Heartland Christian College and addiction services non profit CNS International Ministries Inc  both based in Missouri  and Dordt College and Cornerstone University  both in Iowa  filed the lawsuits before the 8th Circuit  They object to emergency contraceptives  including Plan B from Teva Pharmaceutical  NYSE TEVA  Industries Ltd  TA TEVA   which they believe are equivalent to abortion  The employers say the opt out provision violates a 1993 federal law called the Religious Freedom Restoration Act  Circuit Judge Roger Wollman  who wrote Thursday s decisions on behalf of a three judge panel  said the court must defer to the employers   sincere religious belief that their participation in the accommodation process makes them morally and spiritually complicit in providing abortifacient coverage   A representative of the U S  Department of Justice  which litigated the cases for the government  was not immediately available for comment  The cases are Dordt College et al v  Burwell  No  14 2726  and Sharpe Holdings Inc et al v  U S  Department of Human Services et al  No  14 1507  both in the U S  Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit ,2015-09-17,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/contraception-opt-out-violates-religious-freedom:-u.s.-appeals-court-362164,362164

217712,439228,TEVA,Bio Tech Vs Pharma,opinion,"Investing in bio tech and pharma  They re as different as chalk and cheese
With the recent announcement of Teva s  NYSE TEVA  successful phase III trials for a new  game changing  migraine medication  and new announcements every day from other biotech companies  it is worthwhile to sit back and have a strong look under the cover of the pharma and biotech industry 
Biotechnology has been a hot topic in recent years and the big data possibilities has only intensified it  With improvements in health and healthcare a constant driver in any market conditions  it is alway likely to be a sector that has many businesses  But at the current time we are at a particularly exciting juncture  where technology has provided a clear path toward optimisation of health that was only a dream a few short years ago 
Not only through wearable  wifi  and data  but also by copying how data is used by technology companies 
The best technology companies offer a product designed to provide a maximal user experience as well as collect as much data as they can  Much of this data goes to product development  which is what you would expect data to do  But a large proportion of the collection also goes toward marketing activities  Sometimes it can be sold to other interested parties  Often though  it creates a synergy with your current activities and is used to drive further activities and developments 
At a recent biomed conference  this writer was talking to a provider of dispensing and charting software to the hospital and pharmacy industry  As a former pharmacist  I enjoyed discussing the advantages of the product and its unique benefits  As the discussion grew more detailed  it was clear that rather than developing products further to include more functionality  the business was more interested in its side project of selling user data to pharma companies  to allow them to gauge the sales of their drugs 
This highlights not only the value of data for developing a product  but also the very real way that biotech companies are following the lead of technology companies  in terms of using their collected data 
For pharma companies the same challenges apply that they have always faced  Although technology helps with clinical trial data collection and is continuing to improve the ease of a clinical trial on the test subject  it has not provided much in the way of advancing the streamlining of drug development  Drugs pass through a very time consuming and expensive set of testing simply to get to the first stage of the regulatory process  After that  the time and costs get even more significant  with any of a million factors capable of derailing an otherwise promising product  Issues such as manufacturing  formulation development  stability  toxicity  tolerability  efficacy  mutagenicity  I added this to sound smart   it basically means the ability to give you cancer  and side effects all need to be navigated before a drug can get to the market 
As a result the market is dominated by big players who can reinvest huge profits into development in the hope to create a replacement product that is providing them with their current income  Normally a patent expires within 7 13 years  by which time the market is swamped by a bunch of  me too  generic products  Whilst efficacy data from phase II trials is always promising  there is still a large proportion of drugs that fall over during phase III  Others  succeed in making the long treck to market  and then once there  don t do all that well 
Pharma has increased its throughput  with new registrations receiving approval in the last few years as they get smarter about their development process  But the nature of the beast is that it is a lot of work to get a drug to market  and once it arrives  there is no guarantee of success 
So whilst biotech is reaching new heights and new paradigms  things remain very much the same in pharma ",2017-07-17,Amram Margalit,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bio-tech-vs-pharma-200201404,200201404
217713,439229,TEVA,AstraZeneca  AZN  CEO Rumor Reportedly Ends  Shares Rise ,opinion,"AstraZeneca plc s   NYSE AZN   shares rose almost 5  on Friday after the company reportedly confirmed that its chief executive officer  CEO  Pascal Soriot is not quitting the company to join the generic drug maker  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited   NYSE TEVA   
AstraZeneca s shares have impressively outperformed the Zacks classified  industry so far this year  The stock has jumped 24  compared with the broader industry s increase of 11 8  

We remind investors that last week on Thursday  AstraZeneca s shares lost more than 4  after it was reported by an Israeli business newspaper Calcalist that Pascal Soriot will be filling in the shoes of Teva s former CEO  Erez Vigodman  who stepped down in February 
However  AstraZeneca reportedly confirmed on Friday that Soriot will present the company s earnings on July 27  which indicates the CEO is still with AstraZeneca  Teva s shares dropped almost 4  on Friday 
Notably  Pascal Soriot has been serving AstraZeneca as a CEO since Oct 2012  Earlier  he served as the chief operating officer  COO  at Roche Pharmaceuticals   OTC RHHBY   from 2010 to Sep 2012  Before that  he also served as the CEO of Genentech  where he led its successful merger with Roche 
Teva has been searching for a permanent CEO  which remains the company s  highest priority   Chairman Sol Barer  at the first quarter conference call  said that the company is looking for a top notch CEO with  deep and broad pharmaceutical experience  
Michael McClellan  CFO of the Global Specialty Medicines division  started serving as the Interim CFO  since Jul 1  2017 Astrazeneca  LON AZN  PLC Price

217774,439290,TEVA,Allergan  AGN  Tops Q2 Earnings  Revises  16 Outlook,opinion,"Allergan plc s  second quarter 2016 earnings came in at  3 35 per share  easily surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  3 28  Though up 12  sequentially  reported earnings were down 8 7  from the year ago period 






	Revenues  however  missed expectations  Revenues came in at  3 68 billion  up 1 5  from the year ago period  falling short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  4 14 billion 

Quarterly Details
	Earlier this month  Allergan divested its generics business to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries  NYSE TEVA  Ltd   and also signed an agreement to sell its Anda distribution segment  Allergan has been treating its generics business as discontinued operations and has considered the Anda distribution segment as discontinued operations from the second quarter of 2016 
	Continuing operations include the U S  General Medicine  U S  Specialized Therapeutics and International business segments 
	U S  Specialized Therapeutics net revenues increased 10 5  to  1 5 billion driven by strong growth in Eye Care  Facial Aesthetics and Neuroscience  Products like Botox and Restasis brought in sales of  189 9 million and  371 3 million  respectively  While Botox sales were driven by continued market share expansion  enhanced promotional focus and overall continued strong demand for the product  Restasis benefited from continued strong promotional efforts 
	U S  General Medicine net revenues fell 9 9  to  1 4 billion in the second quarter of 2016 due to a decline in Central Nervous System and Established Brands revenues that was partially offset by strong growth in Gastroenterology  Women s Health and Anti Infectives performance 
	Strong growth was put up by products like Linzess  Lo Loestrin  Estrace Cream  Minastrin 24  Liletta and new product launches like Viberzi  Avycaz and Dalvance 
	International segment recorded net revenues of  757 million  up 5 6  from the year ago period  Its growth was driven by Eye Care  Facial Aesthetics and Botox revenues 2016 Outlook Updated
	Allergan updated the guidance for 2016  The updated guidance excludes the impact of Anda from net revenues and expenses  Allergan expects total net revenues in the range of  14 65 billion to  14 90 billion  Previously  Allergan had anticipated total net revenues of about  17 billion  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently at  16 62 billion  Branded net revenues are expected in the range of  14 75 billion to  15 billion in 2016  Previously  branded net revenues were expected to be approximately  15 billion in 2016 
	Allergan expects earnings in the range of  13 75 to  14 20 per share  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is currently at  14 01 per share 
	While research and development spend is still expected to be about  1 5 billion  selling  general and administrative  SG A  expenses are expected to be around  4 billion  Previously  the company had anticipated SG A expenses  as a percentage of net revenue  to be approximately 25  

	Allergan plans to start a share buyback program shortly with an initial focus of repurchasing approximately  5 billion in shares over the remainder of the year  Upon the closing of this program  the company will evaluate whether to move forward and repurchase the remaining  5 billion authorized by the board  We note that the company had announced a new share buyback program of up to  10 billion at the time of announcing first quarter results 


		ALLERGAN PLC Price


   


Our Take

217797,439313,TEVA, Event Driven Hedge Funds Rescued By Obamacare ,opinion,"In the first seven months of 2015  the healthcare market came to the rescue of the event driven strategy  Reports indicate 

The gains for event driven hedge funds in this period have been quite modest  just 1 7  
These funds lost ground in July  with a bottom line of  0 6  in contrast to  0 7  for all strategies 
Exposure to the commodity sector was the big problem 
Healthcare has been the solution  keeping this sector in the black YTD 

The rippling effects of the Affordable Care Act of 2010 AKA Obamacare in the United States  have a lot to do with the volatility of related markets  and the subsequent  events  or  special situations  on which the strategy thrives 
All of this raises the question  why is a bill that was signed into law five years ago having such an impact just now 
Three Challenges 
In part  its impact on the investment world has been mitigated until very recently by the protracted and complicated litigation that the new law immediately generated  There was no clarity about how much of the law would survive the various challenges 
Since then  three big challenges to the law  framed in different ways  have gotten as far as the Supreme Court  and the administration has won two of them  In June 2012  SCOTUS upheld the constitutionality of the individual mandate 
Two years later  the court allowed closely held for profit corporations to opt out of the contraceptive mandate  a regulation adopted by the Health and Human Services Department pursuant to the ACA  Despite the furor this created  in retrospect this looks like a detail in the operation of the law  not a significant set back to the over all scheme  Meanwhile  in January 2014  most major provisions of the law had come into effect  although some remain to be phased in 
Finally  in June 2015  the court decided King v  Burwell  a challenge that took the form of a dispute over the interpretation of the statute  SCOTUS found that the law means what its sponsors thought it means  thus upholding the use of federal subsidies to pay for health insurance in every state  not merely in states that have set up state sponsored exchanges  Any remaining hope that SCOTUS would restore something like status quo ante must by now have disappeared 
With that hope gone  and with implementation taking hold  the law seems to have inspired a good deal of consolidation in the healthcare world  in physicians  practices  in hospitals  in medical devices  and in pharmaceuticals 
Looking at Pharmaceuticals
Thus  Teva  ARCA TEVA  decides to buy Allergan  NYSE AGN pa  for  40 5 billion  and hedge funds reap rewards for long positions in them both 
Even leaving Obamacare aside  there are two factors in the pharmaceutical business in particular that make it peculiarly susceptible to the urge to merge just now  First  the profits in the generics end of the business have been on a diet  they ve been getting more slender over at least a decade  That process seems to have reached a tipping point  Second  the drugs which were scheduled to go off patent have gone off patent  What has been a loss for some  the patent holders  has been a boon for others  Yet such boons are slowing  and the companies that might once have pitched their planning around drugs held by other  and proprietary  manufacturers and that were nearing the end of their patent life  now have to look elsewhere  the M A market 
Obamacare is giving us a new world  and in the transition to that new world  and whatever equilibrium it will entail  there will be inefficiencies  The typical event driven merger arb play is the  easy way  to make money on this situation  There are other ways 
For example  do the sorts of closely held corporations referenced in Hobby Lobby get an advantage or a disadvantage by opting out of contraception coverage  If they either get an advantage or suffer a disadvantage from their decision  in comparison to  say  publicly owned competitors  then it ought to be possible to bet on that outcome in one or the other direction  Surely someone will figure it out  and will do so ahead of the market at large  before the logic of discounting and of equilibrium closes this window ",2015-08-12,AllAboutAlpha,https://www.investing.com/analysis/event-driven-hedge-funds-rescued-by-obamacare-261336,261336
217798,439314,TEVA,Alexza Pharmaceuticals  Regaining Adasuve Rights Amid Strategic Review ,opinion,"Regaining Adasuve rights amid strategic reviewAlexza  O ALXA  is in transition as it is undergoing a strategic review to either unlock value or fund R D programs such as AZ 007  The decision to reacquire US Adasuve rights from Teva  N TEVA  may facilitate this process  as an outright sale or royalty agreement for its entire interest in Adasuve may be more straightforward once the US rights are regained  After lowering our revenue and COGS assumptions  our valuation on a standalone basis  net of debt  is  20 9m  or  1 04 per share fully diluted 

US Adasuve rights returning from Teva to AlexzaFollowing tepid US sales and corporate changes at Teva  Alexza will reacquire the US Adasuve rights by year end 2015  Teva s existing  25m loan to Alexza would normally require repayment upon the partnership s dissolution but Alexza is seeking to restructure or extend payback terms  However  while we do not expect this to be the case  should Teva demand near term repayment and or an equity for debt swap  current shareholders could be subject to significant dilution
