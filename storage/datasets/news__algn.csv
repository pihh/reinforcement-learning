3691,225206,ALGN,Stocks   Techs Lead S P to Small Gain  3M Weighs on Dow,news,"Investing com   Technology stocks drove the S P 500 and Nasdaq higher Thursday thanks to big earnings beats from key stocks  including Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT  and Tesla  NASDAQ TSLA  
The S P 500 rose 0 19   The Nasdaq Composite index added 0 81  and the Nasdaq 100 index rose nearly 1   The Dow Jones industrials ended down 0 11  after falling as many as 120 points early in the session 
Microsoft  PayPal Holdings  NASDAQ PYPL   Tesla and Amazon com  NASDAQ AMZN  were responsible for more than 40 points of the Nasdaq 100 s 70 point gain  The first three reported either late Wednesday or Thursday 
Amazon shares  however  fell nearly 8  after hours when third quarter earnings per share came in a  4 23  The consensus estimate from analysts tracked by Investing com was  4 59  Worse  the EPS was the lower than a year ago and first profit decline in two years  The online retail giant had warned it was making heavy investments in being to deliver purchases to Amazon Prime customers in a little as a day  In addition  its guidance for fourth quarter sales were lower than expected

Microsoft also added nearly 18 points to the Dow  which was held back primarily by a weak earnings report from 3M  NYSE MMM  
But Twitter  NYSE TWTR  shares dropped nearly 21  as earnings badly missed Wall Street estimates 
It was a busy day for markets  which experienced the heaviest day of third quarter earnings reports 
In addition  Vice President Mike Pence  in a speech today  criticized the National Basketball Association for failing to back protesters in Hong Kong  Worries that the remarks  which were a defense of the protestors  might affect the ongoing U S  China trade talks faded as the day went on

131548,353063,ALGN,Better Buy  Align Technology Vs  Envista,news,"Align Technology  NASDAQ ALGN  has spent more than 20 years selling its clear dental aligners  a substitute for traditional braces  Envista Holdings  NYSE NVST  emerged last September following an initial public offering  being spun off from parent company Danaher  NYSE DHR   Cobbled together from 25 acquisitions over the past 15 years  Envista markets a portfolio of more than 30 global brands comprising dental implants  surgical tools  biomaterials  imaging tools  and orthodontic products  including newly launched clear aligners  
Align s business model is quite simple  Alongside its flagship Invisalign teeth aligners  it sells imaging equipment and services to dentists and orthodontists globally  Envista s business is more complex due to the range of products it sells  However  the company claims its products can be found in 90  of dentists  offices  making it a formidable dental supplier  Which of these two dental giants  stocks are a better buy today 

Why the disparity in valuation 
Align s  22 1 billion valuation dwarfs Envista s  5 1 billion market cap  Why  For one  Envista is a relatively new stock  so its management must forge relationships with institutional investors  This is a period to establish awareness and credibility of the team and help investors understand the dynamics of the business 
Second  Envista offers a suite of tools and products for dental offices that includes lower margin supplies  Align focuses only on higher margin aligners and the scanners needed to create them  Thus  Envista generated net income of  161 5 million on sales of  2 03 billion through the first nine months of 2019  while Align s net income came in at  321 5 million on sales of  1 76 billion  Using percentages  Envista s earnings were 8  of sales  compared with 18 3  for Align  Envista s management touts a shift in product mix to higher margin specialty products  but investors will need to see that play out  
Third  Envista faces more operational challenges based on its acquisition history  At the recent JP Morgan Healthcare Conference  Envista s management noted that it was reducing its operational complexity  footprint  and cost structure by reducing the number of brands  consolidating physical sites by more than 35   and drastically cutting back on the number of suppliers  This should provide  60 million annually in cost savings  
Fourth  Align simply continues to beat analyst earnings estimates every quarter  The company expects to generate at least  640 million in fourth quarter sales  Add that to the  1 76 billion in revenues through the first nine months of 2019  That s  2 4 billion worth of clear aligners and the supporting imaging equipment sold last year  That s tremendous compared to Envista s basket of products approach for a variety of dental and orthodontic needs 
How will the stocks perform 
Since Envista only began trading at the end of September  its stock history is minimal  The 10 analysts who cover it peg price targets between  30 and  37 per share with a median of  33 50  The current price of  32 58 does not leave a lot of room for growth  assuming the analysts are right  
Meanwhile  Align sports price targets from analysts ranging from  220 to  363 per share  with a median of  305  Hitting the median implies a return of 14 7  using the current price of  266  However  analysts have differing views on the future for Align  Those with price targets at the bottom of the range believe potential headwinds will challenge the company  The negative case focuses on the end of the partnership with SmileDirectClub  NASDAQ SDC  which announced its intent to compete with Align by selling its clear aligners directly to dentists and orthodontists  
What does the future hold 
Align will continue to dominate with Invisalign  arguably the most recognized product in the clear aligners field  Increased demand for Invisalign  particularly overseas  is expected to drive much of the revenue growth  Some investors may be wary in the near term until there is more clarity on SmileDirectClub s new effort to compete with Align 
Part of the messaging for Envista s spinoff from Danaher was to allow the dental business to grow through additional acquisitions  Management boasts more strong cash flows to support merger and acquisition activity  The company s website and recent presentations focus on priority areas for possible acquisitions  However  investors may want to seek more clarity on the strategy before buying the stock 
Which stock wins 
Align shows no signs of slowing  and demand for Invisalign should continue through 2020  However  if an economic downturn or recession hits  individuals will likely delay straightening their teeth  Many individuals view teeth aligning as a want rather than a need  and some dental insurance plans do not cover the entire amount  A market downturn would negatively impact Align s sales and its stock 
Envista remains in a show me mode for investors learning about the company and its operations  Over the course of the year  it s likely to grow as well  potentially delivering on one or two small acquisitions  Envista s broad product mix and existing widespread penetration into most dental offices makes it the better positioned of the two should the economy turn south 
I predict Envista s clear aligners will struggle to gain significant market share over Invisalign and other existing competitors unless Envista can incentivize dentists and orthodontists to switch  Pricing will likely be in line with competitors  That means that Envista has to take less revenue per sale in order to give extra financial incentive to the dentists and orthodontists  Therefore  investors seeking exposure to the dental industry are better off  for now  buying shares of Align ",2020-01-29,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pofi7,2070588

Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Shirley  Good afternoon  and thanks for joining us  On our call today  I ll provide some highlights from the fourth quarter and full year then briefly discuss the performance of our two operating segments  clear aligners and intraoral scanners  John will provide more detail on our financial results  discuss our outlook for the first quarter and share our high level thoughts about 2020  Following that  I ll come back and summarize a few key points and open up the call to questions Our fourth quarter was a strong finish to a great year with record revenues and volumes  Q4 Invisalign shipments increased 23 9  year over year and marked another major milestone with our 8 millionth Invisalign patient  who started treatment in December  This rate of growth is really amazing to me given our 7 million Invisalign patient was just this past May seven months ago  For Q4  iTero scanner revenues increased 20 2  year over year with strong growth especially from international doctors On a sequential basis  Invisalign volumes were up 7 4  driven by strong growth in North America  EMEA and Latin America with all time highs in those regions  We also saw strong growth in Invisalign Go systems across all regions  reflecting continued progress with GP dentists  as well as a ramp up from Invisalign Moderate  which launched at the beginning of Q4 in North America  For the quarter  we shipped Invisalign cases to approximately 67 000 doctors  of which 7 200 were first time customers  We also trained over 5 500 new doctors in Q4  including 3 400 international doctors For the full year  total revenues of  2 4 billion  reflect record revenues  up 22 4  year over year  includes  2 billion in clear aligner revenues  In 2019  Invisalign volumes were up 24 2  year over year and iTero scanner revenues were up 38 5  year over year  During the year  over 1 5 million people started treatment with Invisalign clear aligners worldwide  including 447 000 teens and younger patients  which was up 34 1  Now let s turn to the specifics around our fourth quarter results  starting with the Americas region  For the Americas region  Q4 Invisalign case volume was up 4 9  sequentially and up 19 3  year over year  On a sequential basis  Q4 results reflect strong growth from North American GP dentists  as well as continued strength from Latin American doctors  Year over year growth for Q4 reflects continued adoption of Invisalign treatment from both orthodontist and GP dentist channels  which were up 20 5  and 17 3  respectively  Latin America volume was up 79  year over year  led by continued strong growth from Brazil  For the full year  Americas Invisalign volume was up 17 5  For international business  Q4 was a great quarter with Invisalign case volume up 10 5  sequentially  driven by strong growth in the EMEA region  rebounding from Q3  19 summer holidays and offset somewhat by slower growth in APAC  specifically China  On a year over year basis  strong Invisalign volume of 30 1  reflects increased utilization to continued expansion of our customer base in both  EMEA and Asia Pacific region  In Q4  we trained over 3 400 new Invisalign doctors internationally and roughly 55  in EMEA and 45  in APAC  For the year  International volume was up 34  year on year In EMEA  Q4 was a strong quarter  Volumes were up 37 3  sequentially  driven by growth in all core markets  primarily from Spain and Italy  as well as from the teen segment  which was up 50 6  from Q3  19  On a year over year basis  Invisalign volume was up 31 5  driven by growth in all core country markets  including the teen segment  which was up 38 7  from the prior year  For the full year  EMEA volume was up 34 2  led by Spain  Italy and France  as well as our key expansion markets led by Turkey  the Middle East and Africa region and Russia For APAC  Q4 was down sequentially as expected following a very strong Q3  19 teen season in China  as well as less than expected volume from adults  partially offset by strong volume growth from Japan  We believe the ongoing U S   China trade war and economic uncertainty remained a headwind for our consumer demand  especially for consumption of luxury goods and considered purchases  On a year over year basis  APAC volume was up 28  driven by growth across the region led by Japan  Australia New Zealand  Southeast Asia  For the year  APAC volume was up 33 7  Overall for the teen market  in Q4  approximately 116 000 teenagers started treatment with Invisalign clear aligners  an increase of 33 1  year over year driven by continued strong adoption across all major regions  For the full year  total teen cases worldwide grew 34 1  to approximately 447 000 teenagers or 29 3  of our total volume  I m pleased with our progress treating teenagers and younger kids and the continued strong adoption of Invisalign clear aligners globally  For 2019  Invisalign treatment with mandibular advancement was up 85  year over year and Invisalign First was up 455  year over year for a cumulative total of 41 500 cases and 32 400 cases to date respectively Product  technology and innovation continues to be a key growth driver across our regions  Over the past year  we launched several new Invisalign offerings for both comprehensive and non comprehensive treatment  giving doctors more tools and choices to treat a greater range of cases from adults to teenagers and now kids as young as seven years old  as well as new treatment options and technology designed to appeal to consumers who are considering or starting Invisalign treatment In Q4  we introduced the Invisalign Moderate Package  a 20 stage treatment option designed for consumers whose treatment goals fall between the existing Invisalign Lite and Invisalign Comprehensive Packages and can be completed in the range of 5 months to 12 months  We launched SmileView  an online tool designed to help prospective Invisalign patients visualize a new straighter smile before they opt for Invisalign treatment  Align s new SmileView visualization tool is designed to drive awareness and demand for teeth straightening  using Invisalign treatment by engaging consumers and allowing them to see a simulation of what their smile could look like We also upgraded MyInvisalign Mobile App  which previously focused on patients already in treatment  but now includes several new features to help potential patients who are seeking information about teeth straightening treatment including an in app version of SmileView  Consumers can use the app to take a selfie and instantly visualize how their smile can transform after Invisalign treatment Our consumer marketing efforts are designed to build the category and drive demand for Invisalign treatment through a doctor s office  We invest over  100 million each year in consumer marketing programs  including TV  digital and social media  PR  event marketing  as well as our Patient Concierge program  Our goals are to make the Invisalign brand a household name worldwide and to motivate consumers to seek Invisalign treatment through a doctor s office In Q4  we continue to see strong engagement with consumers and had over 5 3 million unique visitors on Invisalign com sites for a total of 18 million over the    year over year  Other key metrics showed increased activity in engagement with the Invisalign brand and are included in our Q4 quarterly slides For our iTero scanner and services business  Q4 was very strong quarter with better than expected revenues  up 6 6  sequentially and 20 2  year over year driven by strength from all regions  Q4 volumes reflect continued commercialization of the iTero Element 2 and Element Flex scanners  especially for orthodontists in North America  The continued rollout with our major DSO partners and increased sales internationally  especially in Japan 2019 was a great year for our iTero business with total revenues up 38 5  year over year  Cumulatively  over 20 5 million orthodontic scans and 4 7 million restorative scans have been performed with iTero scanners  Use of the iTero scanners for Invisalign case submission continues to grow and remains a positive catalyst for Invisalign utilization  For Q4  total Invisalign cases submitted with a digital scanner in the Americas increased to 79 5  from 73 5  in Q4 of last year  International scans increased to 64 7   up from 57 5  in the same quarter last year What s really exciting is to see that within the Americas  93 3  of cases submitted by North American orthodontists are submitted digitally now  We are pleased with the continued progress of our iTero business and remain confident that it will continue to help drive our overall growth and help increase the adoption of our digital platform with Invisalign treatment With that  I ll turn the call over to John John F  Morici    Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President  Global FinanceThanks  Joe  Now for our Q4 financial results  Total revenue for the fourth quarter was  649 8 million  up 7  from the prior quarter and up 21 7  from the corresponding quarter a year ago  For clear aligners  Q4 revenues of  543 6 million was up 5 3  sequentially with strong Invisalign volume from EMEA and North America  Year over year  clear aligner revenues growth of 22  reflects strong Invisalign growth volume across all regions  Clear aligner revenue growth was unfavorably impacted by approximately 1 3 points year over year from foreign exchange Q4 Invisalign ASPs were down sequentially by approximately  20 to  1 240  primarily due to discounts mix and unfavorable foreign exchange  On a year over year basis  Q4 Invisalign ASPs increased approximately  5  primarily reflecting price increases in all regions and increased additional aligner revenues  partially offset by promotional discounts and unfavorable foreign exchange and product mix shift Total Q4 Invisalign shipments of 413 700 cases were up 7 4  sequentially and up 23 9  year over year  Our scanner and services revenue for the fourth quarter was  106 2 million  up 16 6  sequentially due to volume increases in EMEA and Americas  Year over year revenues were up 20 2   primarily due to volume increases in EMEA  APAC and the Americas  as well as higher services revenues from our increased installed base Moving on to gross margin  Fourth quarter overall gross margin was 72 6   up 0 6 points sequentially and up 0 9 points year over year  Clear aligner gross margin for the fourth quarter was 74 1   up 0 6 points sequentially  primarily due to lower freight and training costs and lower number of aligners per case  partially offset by lower Invisalign ASPs  Clear aligner gross margin was flat year over year  primarily due to lower training costs and a slight increase in Invisalign ASPs offset by an increase in aligners per case  Scanner gross margin for the fourth quarter was 64 9   up 0 8 points sequentially  primarily due to manufacturing efficiencies  partially offset by lower ASPs and up five points year over year  primarily due to manufacturing efficiencies and higher service revenue in scanner ASPs Q4 operating expenses were  320 8 million  up sequentially 3 4  and up 22 2  year over year  The sequential increase in operating expenses primarily reflects our continued investment in sales and marketing and R D activities  partially offset by lower litigation expenses  Additionally  the third quarter included a  6 8 million benefit from the settlement of our Invisalign store leases  Year over year  the increase in operating expenses reflects higher spending commensurate with go to market activities offset by lower legal expenses Our fourth quarter operating income was  151 2 million  up 18 9  sequentially and up 25 5  year over year  Our fourth quarter operating margin was 23 3   up 2 4 points sequentially and up 0 7 points year over year  The sequential increases in operating income and operating margin are primarily attributed to improved gross profit and reduction in litigation expenses  Operating margin was impacted by approximately 0 6 points year over year from foreign exchange  The third quarter operating income included a  6 8 million benefit from the settlement of our Invisalign store leases  which increased Q3 operating margin by 1 1   On a year over year basis  the increase in operating income and operating margin  primarily reflects higher gross profit and operating leverage  partially offset by continued investment in R D  geographic expansion and go to market activities With regards to fourth quarter tax provision  our tax rate was 22 2   which includes approximately  5 8 million of tax benefit related to a tax audit settlement  Fourth quarter diluted earnings per share was  1 53  up 25      0 25 sequentially and up  0 33 compared to the prior year Moving on to the balance sheet  As of December 31  2019  cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  including both short and long term investments were  868 6 million  an increase of approximately  86 7 million from the prior quarter  which is primarily due to higher cash flow from operations  Of our  868 6 million of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities   590 1 million was held in the U S  and  278 5 million was held by our international entities Q4 accounts receivable balance was  550 3 million  up approximately 3 5  sequentially  Our overall days sales outstanding was 76 days  down three days sequentially and up two days as compared to Q4 last year  Cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter was  218 2 million and free cash flow  defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures amounted to  175 6 million  Our business continues to have a very strong cash generation Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were  42 5 million  primarily related to our continued investment in increasing aligner capacity and facilities  During Q4 2019  we repurchased  100 5 million of our stock against our stock buyback authorization and have  100 million still available for repurchase under the May 2018 repurchase program Before we move to the Q1 outlook  I would like to make a few comments on our full year 2019 results  In 2019  we shipped a record  1 5 million Invisalign cases  up 24 2   This reflects 34  volume growth from our international doctors and 17 5  volume growth from our Americas doctors  Shipments of our iTero scanner were up 29 7  over 2018  Total revenue was a record  2 4 billion  up 22 4  year over year with clear aligner revenues of  2 billion  up 19 8  year over year  Clear aligner revenue growth was impacted by approximately 2 6 points year over year from foreign exchange 2019 iTero scanner and services revenues were a record  38 1 million  up 35   Full year operating income of  542 5 million  up 16 3  versus 2018 and operating margin at 22 5   2019 operating income also includes a litigation benefit of  51 million and Invisalign store closure costs of  23 million for a net positive impact on operating margin of approximately 1 2   Operating margin was unfavorably impacted by approximately one point year over year from foreign exchange  Free cash flow was  597 6 million  up  266 2 million versus 2018  For the year  we repurchased over 1 8 million shares of Align s stock for  400 million  2019 diluted earnings per share was  5 53 Before I comment on the demand outlook  I wanted to take a minute to talk about the corporate structure reorganization to relocate our European headquarters from the Netherlands to Switzerland in Q1 and the implication to our GAAP financials  As a result of the corporate structure reorganization to relocate our European headquarters from the Netherlands to Switzerland in Q1  our Q1 2020 GAAP tax rate will reflect a significant one time tax benefit associated with the recognition of a deferred tax asset related to the intra entity sale of certain intellectual property rights  This deferred tax benefit will be amortized starting in 2020 and will continue in subsequent quarters and years The period over which this tax benefit will be recognized depends on the profitability of our Swiss headquarters and therefore is uncertain at this time  Management ordinarily assesses the health of our business with regard to these types of one time events and believes this reorganization will make it difficult for investors to assess our core underlying financial performance where we report solely based on GAAP  Therefore  we will supplement our GAAP information with non GAAP measures going forward Beginning in Q1 2020  in addition to our GAAP results  we will present non GAAP measures that exclude the aforementioned tax impact along with certain other items that may not be indicative of our fundamental operating performance including discrete cash and non cash charges in order to prevent    present investors with greater transparency into our core business operations  We will present GAAP  non GAAP and a reconciliation in our earnings release in conference call materials With that  let s turn to our Q1 outlook and the factors that inform our view  Q4 was a strong quarter with record volumes and we expect to enter Q1 with this momentum from both the Americas and the EMEA regions  For the Americas region  we expect Q1 to increase sequentially with growth from North America orthodontists and GP dentists  For international  we expect Q1 volumes to be down sequentially  We expect demand to be up sequentially as momentum continues from Q4  However  we expect the growth to be offset by a sequential decrease in APAC  primarily due to the expected impact from the novel coronavirus in China  We expect our iTero business to be down sequentially following a seasonally strong Q4 and consistent with seasonal trends in capital equipment market and fewer sales in China Many of you have been following the news regarding the recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus in Wuhan  the capital of the Hubei province in China  China is one of our largest country markets and represents roughly 8  of our total revenues  It is home to hundreds of employees across China  Thankfully  we are not aware of any employee or family member who has contracted the novel coronavirus  The situation in China is very fluid and we are closely monitoring it  We are in contact with all relevant agencies globally  The Chinese government has implemented travel bans and has essentially shut down public transportation in Wuhan  It has also issued public warnings to avoid all non essential medical and dental procedures for the time being  Some government run hospitals and private clinics are following suit by instructing patients to stay home unless it s an emergency While we do not believe there is any impact to our product safety due to the stringent health and safety procedures ingrained in our manufacturing processes  we are taking additional precautions across China to minimize the risk of spreading illness to our internal teams  including additional protections and health screening procedures  as well as travel restrictions Given the increased uncertainty and disruption to our employees  doctors practices  their patients and consumers  we believe it is prudent to reduce our outlook for Q1 to reflect the increased risk  Therefore  for Q1  our outlook reflects approximately 20 000 to 25 000 less Invisalign cases and  30 million to  35 million less revenues for Invisalign and iTero products sold in China  In addition  we are also absorbing  3 million to  4 million in idle China manufacturing plant and treatment planning capacity  which results in approximately 0 5  gross margin impact With this as a backdrop  we expect the first quarter to shape up as follows  Invisalign case volume is expected to be in the range of 396 000 to 406 000 cases  up approximately 13  to 16  year over year  We expect Q1 revenues to be in the range of  615 million to  630 million  up by approximately 12  to 15  year over year  Our supply agreement with SDC was terminated December 31  2019  And hence  our Q1 2020 revenue outlook does not reflect any SDC volume as compared to the same quarter a year ago when non Invisalign aligners supplied to SDC contributed about  5 7 million to revenue On a GAAP basis  we expect Q1 gross margin to be in the range of 71 5  to 72   Q1 gross margin is expected to be down sequentially from slightly lower ASPs  driven by lower mix of China volume and idle China manufacturing and treatment planning capacity in our facility in Ziyang  On a non GAAP basis  we expect Q1 gross margin to be in the range of 71 7  to 72 2  excluding stock based compensation from gross profit We expect Q1 GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of  345 million to  350 million  which reflects our continued investments in go to market activities along with our annual increase in employee compensation expenses  On a GAAP basis  Q1 operating margin is expected to be in the range of 15 4  to 16 5   On a non GAAP basis  we expect operating margin to be in the range of 19 5  to 20 5  excluding stock based compensation from operating income On a GAAP basis  our effective tax rate is expected to be approximately negative 1 400   which includes approximately  1 4 billion of tax benefit associated with the recognition of a deferred tax asset related to the intra entity sale of certain intellectual property rights resulting from our corporate structure reorganization  This deferred tax benefit will be amortized starting in 2020 and continue into subsequent quarters and years  The period over which the tax benefit will be recognized depends on the profitability of our Swiss headquarters  and is therefore is uncertain at this time On a non GAAP basis  excluding the one time benefit from the intra entity sale of certain IP rights  as mentioned above  and the tax benefits related to stock based compensation  we expect our tax rate for Q1 2020 to range from approximately 22  to 23   Diluted shares outstanding should be approximately 79 1 million exclusive of any share repurchases  Taken together  we expect our Q1 2020 GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of  18 65 to  18 74  Non GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of  1 19 to  1 28 from excluding the one time tax benefit from the intra entity sale of IP rights as mentioned above  and the stock based compensation related expenses  In addition  as we can continue our operational expansion efforts  we expect capital expenditures for Q1 to be approximately  95 million to  100 million and we expect depreciation and amortization to be  23 million to  25 million Now let me turn to our view for the full year 2020  As I just described  the situation in China surrounding the novel coronavirus is very fluid  While our Q1 outlook includes our best view of how the coronavirus will impact our business in the first quarter  it is very difficult to predict and forecast the longer term impact  Therefore  we are providing you with our best view of 2020 prior to the novel coronavirus outbreak so that you can use it as a baseline from which to build your models for the year  This means that you will need to make your own assumptions about how the coronavirus outbreak impacts our business over the remainder of 2020  Beyond the Q1 outlook in our commentary for 2020 below  we will not provide specific 2020 guidance at this time  We will continue to monitor the situation closely and update these comments when appropriate With that  our outlook for 2020  notwithstanding the impact of foreign exchange rates and the novel coronavirus is as follows  We anticipate total revenue growth for the company  Invisalign and iTero to be at the low end of our long term operating model target of 20  to 30   We anticipate Invisalign volume to be at the low end of our long term growth model target of 20  to 30   On a GAAP basis  we anticipate 2020 operating margin to be slightly above our 2019 operating margin of 22 5   We also expect our long term operating margin range of 25  to 30  to remain unchanged  On a non GAAP basis  we expect 2020 operating margin to be approximately 3 5  higher than our GAAP operating margin excluding stock based compensation from operating income On a GAAP basis  our 2020 tax provision will include approximately  1 4 billion of tax benefit in Q1 associated with the recognition of a deferred tax asset related to the intra entity sale of certain intellectual property rights  This deferred tax benefit will be amortized starting in 2020 and continue into subsequent quarters and years  The period over which this tax benefit will be recognized depends on the profitability of our Swiss headquarters and therefore is uncertain at this time  On a non GAAP basis  excluding the one time tax benefit from the intra entity sale of certain IP rights as mentioned above and the tax benefits related to stock based compensation  we expect our tax rate for 2020 to range from approximately 22  to 23  With that  I ll turn it back over to Joe for final comments  Joe Joseph M  Hogan    Director  President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  John  and thanks to those of you joining our call today  Overall 2019 was a great year for Align and I m very pleased with the strong performance for both our Invisalign and iTero businesses  Not only did we celebrate our 22nd year in business  we also achieved several major milestones  including our 8 millionth Invisalign patient   2 4 billion in revenue for the first time As we kick off 2020  we re very concerned for the safety and health of our employees  customers  doctors and their patients in China  Their well being is our top priority and we are doing what we can to ensure that they are in good hands  We are working with our local teams to donate medical supplies and provide funding to help combat the outbreak Like SARS in 2003  the coronavirus is already having a major impact on China and may expand to other countries around the world  I saw and experienced this impact as a CEO of GE Healthcare  We expect that like SARS and MERS before it  in time the virus will be addressed  the markets will assume an equilibrium and our business in China will continue to grow  The timing of this is uncertain  but the future growth opportunity for our business in China is certain While we are mindful of the increased uncertainty in China and its impact on our Q1 outlook  it s important to take a step back and remember that our business is broad and deep  We have a strong growth in other regions and are seeing strong momentum in the Americas  across EMEA and in all other countries in APAC  especially Japan  Australia New Zealand  Southeast Asia  Taiwan and Korea In closing  I want to share with you a few thoughts regarding the future of our industry  Never before have I seen an amount of change in products technology distribution channels and business models  Align has always believed that the market opportunity for clear aligners is significantly larger than the underlying orthodontic case starts each year  We believe that over 300 million people want a better smile and the best way to access that potential patients is through doctors  using a digital approach with iTero scanners and the Invisalign system  Our partnership with doctors is a critical part of how we win with consumers and we will continue to insist that patients visit a doctor in person for Invisalign treatment If I could leave you with one thing is that Align is not just a provider of the best clear aligner in the industry and our clear aligner is not just a piece of plastic  Align is founded on digital  IT  data  artificial intelligence  software algorithms  digital scanning and 3D printing  We are the largest mass customized business the world has ever seen  Each Invisalign aligner is the output of millions of lines of code and thousands of digital actions that allow us to ship 0 5 million customized Class 2 medical devices a day As a digital leader  we must continue to provide doctors with the best technology and tools to help them treat any patient  In 2020  we expect to bring several new products and systems and services to market  but we must provide more than just individual products  In digital  you pick a platform not a product  You pick a company you believe in for the long term  Digital dentistry is being driven by products like iTero scanners and Invisalign clear aligners  And we believe our digital platform is setting the foundation for the future of dentistry  Align and our doctor partners are sitting on the edge of one of the biggest areas of growth that dentistry has ever seen  I m very excited about what this means for our business and continued growth prospects in 2020 and beyond as we continue to transform smiles and change lives With that  I want to thank you again for joining the call  I look forward to updating you on our progress as the year unfolds  We ll see many of you at the Chicago Midwinter Meeting next month  as well as industry and financial conferences throughout the year  including our Analyst Meeting on May 12 in New York City Now I ll turn the call over to the operator for questions Questions and Answers OperatorThank you   Operator Instructions  Our first question comes from the line of Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs  Please proceed with your question Nathan Rich    Goldman Sachs Group  Inc    AnalystHi  Good afternoon  guys  Thanks for the question  Joe  maybe just to start on China  the revenue headwind that you guided to I think is kind of 60  or so of your kind of total China volume  Can you talk maybe just about what you ve seen so far in January that kind of    you know that you used to kind of inform your estimate of the case and revenue impact  And if we continue to see this play out  can you kind of think about    help us think about how we should frame the impact going forward Joseph M  Hogan    Director  President and Chief Executive OfficerNate  I think we framed it as well as we can in the first quarter  I mean that    and that s what we can see right now  I think our responsibility when you think about it  is  we re through January right now  We can take a look at our order rates and we can responsibly make the prediction that John just did that we re going to    20 000 to 25 000 cases that we think we re going to be pressured on  An unfortunate part of this whole thing is  we see we re on the dark side of the moon right now because of the Chinese New Year  and our order rates drop off to a point that you hardly see them and it s not just now  it s been every year since  And since the government there has extended the holidays for another week or so and it could go on  we really don t have    we just take our best guess on that 20 000  25 000  And I    we re not ready to project  I m not ready to project anything into the second quarter and the rest of the year Remember going back to SARs  I talked about  I was involved in that at GE Healthcare is that remember it took six months from the initial infection rate  all the way    not that it ended  but it actually stabilized and things got back in year again  So we know that it would be more than the first quarter that we ll be impacted  but none of us are ready to give any kind of a forecast as to the extent of that Nathan Rich    Goldman Sachs Group  Inc    AnalystThat s fair  And then maybe just a question on the Americas GP growth  There is a nice acceleration in the quarter  utilization also ticked higher  You ve obviously put a lot of investment into that channel  Can you maybe just talk about some of the traction that you re seeing among the GP base that you serve Joseph M  Hogan    Director  President and Chief Executive OfficerYes  Nate  there s multiple levers we pull in that sense  all right  We have more of a segmentation around GPs today from a sales standpoint  you ll see that accentuated as we go into 2020  We have a product called IGo  Phonetic  that it just fits the workflow aspect of GPs extremely well  Then you have to add to that the extra salespeople we put in last year  A lot of those salespeople were making GP calls because there is just    there s only so far you could go for the orthodontic community  And the last part of that  we have a huge amount of increased advertising from a consumer standpoint  I read about the consumer hits for new interest in Invisalign which are pretty outstanding when you look at it from a year to year basis  So it s really all those variables we see are being put in place to help to drive that growth Shirley Stacy    Vice President of Finance  Corporate   Investor CommunicationsThanks  Nate  Next question please OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Kevin Caliendo with UBS  Please proceed with your question Kevin Caliendo    UBS    AnalystHi  thanks  Thanks for taking my call  Just a quick one on China  So a quick one on China  The    how is it impacting the training of the doctors in China  Obviously it s impacting your revenues  but is it impacting the overall expansion of your business there as well so that as we think about the number of doctors and think about the number of dentists there that will be registered Invisalign users  How do we think about the impact this is going to have on that as well Joseph M  Hogan    Director  President and Chief Executive OfficerYou know  Kevin  honestly it s a good question  because that is a variable in the equation you have to think of  So right now  you can imagine  when you have a contagion like this  you don t want a lot of people hanging out together and Chinese government knows that and we know it too  Our training facilities are in Shanghai and also Chengdu  There is    obviously there s infection rates in those areas  but they re not like the major provinces that have been impacted so far  But my anticipation is after the holidays  we ll just have to watch and see exactly what develops in the different provinces in China and what that means  If it s not a big issue in Shanghai or Chengdu or whatever  obviously  we ll bring doctors in and train them  But we re not in a position to even guess on that right now  But it s a great question  It s the key variable  And as things develop  we ll certainly come back after the first quarter and let you know Kevin Caliendo    UBS    AnalystAnd just one quick follow up  As we talk about sort of expectations around margin expansion embedded in your 2020 guidance  can you give us a little bit of apples to apples on what you re expecting  If we were to sort of back into your non GAAP gross margin or operating margin expansion  like  what s sort of embedded in the non GAAP side year over year John F  Morici    Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President  Global FinanceYeah  Kevin  this is John Morici  Yeah  we would expect it to be slightly up  both on a GAAP and on a non GAAP basis for operating margin  as well as gross margin Kevin Caliendo    UBS    AnalystOkay  great  Thank you so much Joseph M  Hogan    Director  President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Thanks Kevin OperatorOur next question comes from the line of John Kreger with William Blair  Please proceed with your question John C  Kreger    William Blair   Company  L L C     AnalystHi  Thanks very much  John  first one s for you  Just to clarify the full year  20 commentary that you gave us  does that reflect a weaker first quarter from China  but the rest is up to us or does it not reflect the Q1 here  Just wanted to clarify that John F  Morici    Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President  Global FinanceIt s the latter  It does not reflect any impact from China John C  Kreger    William Blair   Company  L L C     AnalystNo impact from China  Okay  that s helpful  And then  Joe  again just sticking on the China theme  If we think about over the last year  the rates of growth that you guys have experienced in that region have been all over the place  From your perspective  what do you sort of view as sort of the new normal there in terms of once we get beyond the infection outbreak  Is it 20   is it 50   Do you have an updated view on it Joseph M  Hogan    Director  President and Chief Executive OfficerJohn  I don t  I mean  because obviously we re in a storm right now and just trying to get through what that looks like  As I said in my script  if you think about  as we came off of third quarter  we got a really good teen season  We didn t have as much of an adult pick up in the fourth quarter as we had hoped  But you know  again  it was double digit growth and still robust growth  but not the 50  to 60  that we had enjoyed in China for several years So I d say  John  I d like to give that to you  I can t reliably give it to you now  but it s double digit growth  We continue to make our investments  We are    and continue to be excited about China  It s our second biggest market  We don t think that s going to change  But we certainly got to get through this cloud before we can give you something definitive in that sense John C  Kreger    William Blair   Company  L L C     AnalystGreat  Thank you OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Jon Block with Stifel  Please proceed with your question Jonathan D  Block    Stifel  Nicolaus   Company    AnalystAll right  Thanks guys  Good afternoon  So I m going throw out a couple of growth rates on China  just trying to do some implied math  I mean with 20 000 to 25 000 fewer cases in 1Q  it seems like you re implying that China s down 50  year over year in the first quarter in case volumes and that would even be considering coronavirus just sort of not there for the entire quarter from a rev rec standpoint  So is that in the ballpark that we re seeing sort of that magnitude of a decel  Maybe the follow up to that first question would be  more importantly  what do you think about these cases  Are they lost  Are they delayed  Are they some sort of a combination of the two John F  Morici    Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President  Global FinanceHey  John  This is John  I think you re in the ballpark  I think when you look at what we see from China  I mean there s certainly last year was significant growth in Q1 and this year obviously impacted by the coronavirus  It s difficult to say from a    either cases lost or delayed and so on  There s certainly    for this time period  they re not happening  It s difficult for us to see afterwards  after this period of time to see whether those cases come back or not  But at least for the fourth    first quarter here  we re assuming that they re not going to come into the quarter Jonathan D  Block    Stifel  Nicolaus   Company    AnalystOkay  Got it  And then maybe just shift gears and I don t want everything lost on China  Joe  you highlighted and I think for the first time quantified the number of math in Invisalign First cases  pardon me  I think the summation was around 75 000 out of 450 000 teen cases for the year  So this has quickly become 15  to 20  of your teen cases  Maybe if you can just talk to that  Do you still see hyper growth for those two offerings into 2020 and beyond  And maybe there is an update on palatal expansion as well  Thanks guys Joseph M  Hogan    Director  President and Chief Executive OfficerHey John  I m really excited about the math growth when you see that  And remember math to it s kind of age contained  you know it s a growth aspect between like 10 years old and 12 5 years old  so that really fits  But when you take math and you combine that with First  that is about 20  to 25  including palatal expansion of the teen marketplace  So the idea that    you know that s 15  to 20  of our teen cases you talked about matches up pretty well in the sense of what we re seeing in the marketplace overall  I do think you ll continue to see this hyper growth out there  It is a great solution  We look at Teen and First and how it works You don t see it  John  but we continue to improve math all the time  We learn about anchorage on back molars and certain kinds of teeth and whatever  We program those things  We have signed releases  But piece by piece  we get better at being confident and moving those Class 2 things forward  So overall  we re excited about it  I m confident about the technology Lastly  on the palatal expansion piece  I    we know how to make this  we have the right kind of software to develop it  The trick is finding something that you can actually scale from a manufacturing standpoint and get consistent properties with it  And I feel we ve been closing in on that rather fast  So we ll give you more of an update as we go into the investors conference in June  I mean in May and more specificity around that kind of a launch date Jonathan D  Block    Stifel  Nicolaus   Company    AnalystFair enough  Thanks for your time  guys Joseph M  Hogan    Director  President and Chief Executive OfficerOkay  All right  see you Jon OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Richard Newitter with SVB Leerink  Please proceed with your question Richard Newitter    Leerink Partners    AnalystHi  Thanks for taking the questions  Joe  I have two for you  Just going back to your comment on your experience with SARs the last time and the impact on the business you were running there at GE  Can you maybe just give a little bit more color  what s the definition of stabilization and kind of maybe just talk through some of the visibility that was able to come into focus and what    how that happened over that six month time period  And I have a follow up  Thanks Joseph M  Hogan    Director  President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Hey Rich  it s really interesting is to say when I talk about stabilization  it means infection rate  Is how    when you start to get to that plateau about not an increase in infection rate  but a decrease and you ll see that  that s kind of the deceleration and that indicates that it s kind of under control  Again  what I ve learned in 2003 about China is  and I think in the western world we miss this sometimes  it s how much influence the overall government influences there  You can see they changed holidays  they locked down cities  they take drastic measures to try to deal with these things  It s something that s really unheard of from a western world standpoint I think we kind of have to respect that it s a society that will respond to these kind of things in a way that we re not necessarily used to  which is actually good for the population  because they re just trying to isolate it and contain that thing because depending    that virus hasn t been quantified yet with exactly it s infection rate  meaning how many people are infected per person that s infected  but the numbers are jumping around  But this is in the area of SARs  And so I think the best proxy we can have right now is SARs side So that s the two things  One is  when it plateaus when fewer people are being infected and you see that curve start coming down  And then secondly is  how fast the Chinese government will move  And that s why we re staying close with what s going on there  And just staying behind the government and trying to support their actions  Okay Rich Richard Newitter    Leerink Partners    AnalystOkay  That s helpful  Go ahead Joseph M  Hogan    Director  President and Chief Executive OfficerNo  I have nothing  That s it Richard Newitter    Leerink Partners    AnalystOkay  Just to follow up here on  I appreciate the operating margin guidance excluding the China factors here  But let s just say there is some extended impact moving through the year  What s your    how are you thinking about your approach to operating margins if there were to be kind of an extended shortfall in revenues in that region  And would you    would you kind of go full blast on the spend or is there a target that you will kind of look to on preserving leverage  Thanks John F  Morici    Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President  Global FinanceHey Rich  This is John  It s probably too early to tell that now  I mean  like we said  we re kind of in the dark side right now of the extended Chinese New Year  we ll see how things progress as we come out and make that assessment  I mean  as we ve talked about a number of times in our business  there is a lot of different levers that we can pull or not pull based on the conditions that are going on in a particular market and we would assess that as well with China OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Matthew O Brien with Piper Sandler  Please proceed with your question Matt O Brien    Piper Jaffray Companies    AnalystAfternoon  and thanks for taking my questions  Just a couple here   Shirley Stacy    Vice President of Finance  Corporate   Investor CommunicationsHey Matt Matt O Brien    Piper Jaffray Companies    AnalystHello  One was asked a little bit earlier  just about the deferral of these cases  I mean if they re locking everybody down in China at this point  it s not like they re going to be getting brackets and wires  So I m just trying to figure out why this wouldn t come back in eventually  And then if it were to come back in say in a Q4 timeframe or something like that  could you do upwards of 50 000 cases in a quarter  So like all of this would come running back to you fairly quickly if the all clear was signaled Joseph M  Hogan    Director  President and Chief Executive OfficerMatt  could we do 50 000 cases  Yeah  I mean we got capacity  we have both treatment capacity and we got bleed off capacity obviously through Mexico and Costa Rica  if we were overwhelmed in China  what we have there too  But Matt  my experience in this business is if things don t happen like that that you don t get this kind of a bow wave that comes after something like this  And so it s not that you lose those cases  From an adult standpoint  they just get pushed out into the future  but they don t come back to you all at once  It just late demand  The only exception I would make to that that I would guess that the teen season because teens are kind of timed based on their age  did you have a little more what I call bolus effect there  you d have bow wave if you really capitalize on teens  But it wouldn t occur that way with adults Matt O Brien    Piper Jaffray Companies    AnalystOkay  Can you give us    so it s fair to assume that this is not lost revenue and it will come back at some time  Could you give us any sense for the split between the two  teen versus adult over in China Joseph M  Hogan    Director  President and Chief Executive OfficerNo  At this point in time given what we re seeing over there  I can t even guess that  If you re asking for historical splits  I don t think we ve shared that data in the past  And just know that our third quarter is always our biggest quarter in China and it s a biggest because it is teen season  So if you take at that look historically  you would see what those numbers look like on adult versus teen Matt O Brien    Piper Jaffray Companies    AnalystGot it  One quick one for John  just on gross margin  you know it s come down over the last kind of three years to the low 70s in 2019  and a lot of moving parts here  But how do we think about that metric going forward  Are we kind of getting close to the bottom on that metric or should we expect more kind of annual erosion of that metric John F  Morici    Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President  Global FinanceWell  I think  Nate  you saw that our gross margin improved 60 basis points in Q4 from Q3 and we would look into the future to expect that with the cases that we do sometimes it s more difficult versus even the non comprehensive cases  We know how to drive that gross margin and we d expect to see improvement in 2020 and beyond Matt O Brien    Piper Jaffray Companies    AnalystThank you Shirley Stacy    Vice President of Finance  Corporate   Investor CommunicationsThanks  Matt OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw with Wolfe Research  Please proceed with your question Shirley Stacy    Vice President of Finance  Corporate   Investor CommunicationsHi  Steve Joseph M  Hogan    Director  President and Chief Executive OfficerHi Steve Steve Beuchaw    Wolfe Research    AnalystHi  Thanks for the time here  I wanted to try to maybe put a rosy  Phonetic  potentially in China for just a second so we can consider the possibility if things do resolve  One is  I m sorry if I missed this  but did you give China growth for the fourth quarter  And then the second part of it is  if this ends up isolated to Wuhan or the province surrounding Wuhan  how does that change your view on the impact of the business Joseph M  Hogan    Director  President and Chief Executive OfficerHey  Steve  It s Joe  It would obviously change because now you segment what the issue is in China  but I don t have a guess in a sense of what that would mean  I mean  when you think about it  obviously Shanghai is a big part of our business and more north of that  Beijing is too  I d say the coastal provinces or whatever have always been pretty big  So I think your comment would be  if it s just isolated to Wuhan or generally isolated of Wuhan  the effect won t be as dramatic  But I can t    I really can t quantify it  Steve  And I d find it kind of surprising that it    not that the infection rate is going to reach the other provinces the way it has Wuhan  it s just the Chinese government will take the same steps there to make sure that whatever infection that they do have in those regions don t end up being like Wuhan  That makes sense Steve Beuchaw    Wolfe Research    AnalystIt makes a lot of sense  And I m sorry  did you give a China growth rate for 4Q John F  Morici    Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President  Global FinanceNo  we didn t  Steve  It s similar growth that we saw in Q3 Steve Beuchaw    Wolfe Research    AnalystOkay  perfect  Thank you  And then  John  just a couple of quick ones for you and then I ll drop back in the queue  One is  are you willing to give folks a sense for how much of the benefit on the margins in 2020 there is tied to the wind down of the Netherlands facility or some of the legal expenditures winding down  And then can you give a sense for what your assumption is for pricing year on year in the outlook for 2020  I really appreciate all the color  Joe  Thank you John F  Morici    Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President  Global FinanceYeah  When you look at the    some of that litigation in some of those entity restructuring programs  it was about    it impacted us in 2019 by about a point of op margin  So essentially that s the benefit for us in 2020 and that s part of our    part of our expansion  But when we look at the expectations for 2020 and a comparison versus 2019  we would expect margin expansion on whether using GAAP or non GAAP based on the leverage and the investments that we re making Joseph M  Hogan    Director  President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks Steve OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies  Please proceed with your question Brandon Couillard    Jefferies   Company  Inc     AnalystThanks  Good afternoon  Joe  I don t have a question about China  actually I want to talk about the U S  Curious if you ve seen any    just curious to get your latest views around just the competitive environment between DTC and in office and also noticed you put Frank Quinn in a new role in terms of Head of the U S   curious about the rationale behind that and whether that s a reflection of a bigger focus on perhaps the DSO channel Joseph M  Hogan    Director  President and Chief Executive OfficerHey Bran  that s good question actually  It s a good deep question  First of all  I mean you saw our growth in the Americas  For the fourth quarter it s good  accelerating in a GP channel and good progress in the ortho channel  So obviously I feel good about    I talked about in the previous caller in the sense of the investments we ve made in sales people and advertising  products and all that we have in those different channels  And we look at that    going forward  we feel good about that capability From a DTC standpoint  we ve always start with what we said  I mean we know that DTC will go after some of the same patients we do  but we haven t necessarily felt an impact in that sense  And you see us pushing hard in the sense of our product and portfolio to go after that  We ve talked about 100 million patients that we think want treatment from an orthodontics standpoint in North America Other competitors  honestly they re out there  I can t say that we ve made any price moves against them  We haven t necessarily felt that we have lost any significant volume in any consistent way  And so I don t have anything different to report from that standpoint than I did the previous quarters that we ve had a discussion  I think when you re hearing about that two  Brandon  it s what    I think we ve been consistent for the last two years You know when I talked about at the end of my script about this digital platform  there s a lot of work you have to do to compete in this marketplace  It s not like just I can produce the plastic aligner and then I can have a material difference in how Align is effective in the marketplace  There s just so many things you got to be good at in this business from a logistics standpoint  from manufacturing standpoint  your digital platform  health service consumers and what it does with docs  You got to be able to play really well on multi dimensions  And I m not saying that none of our competitors will reach that  they re just not at that scale right now that I think that it s made a tremendous difference to us in any way Brandon Couillard    Jefferies   Company  Inc     AnalystThanks  And then the question about   Joseph M  Hogan    Director  President and Chief Executive OfficerI m sorry  On Frank    I m sorry  on Frankie  Look  Frank is a great commercial  right  I know he is associated with DSOs and he helped to put us on the map with DSOs with his leadership  But overall  Frank  he came here with good external experience from a sales and dental standpoint  He has really helped the business that way  And I thought he is a perfect pick for us to really help to I d say to really help us not just extend what we do  but will put a lot of focus from a commercial standpoint in our business  So we re excited about Frank  He has good relationship with Simon  who has great experience from Europe also and taking some best practices there and implementing them  And so we re excited about Frank and Simon in broadly in the North American team Brandon Couillard    Jefferies   Company  Inc     AnalystThe question about the Invisalign Moderate  Any early feedback you can share on that rollout  Is an international launch in the works  And just curious about your thoughts in terms of whether you might see more trade up from Invisalign Lite rather than more so than trade down perhaps from a more comprehensive case for those patients Joseph M  Hogan    Director  President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I think we haven t actually documented much trade up from Lite in that product line  It s most of it have been trade down from a    trade down from comprehensive  But remember when you trade down on this product line  it still has a gross margins that s accretive to our business and not decretive in that sense  So we re allowing more choice for our patients  allowing more choice for our doctors  But we re not doing this to an extent that it really hurts our operating profit Brandon Couillard    Jefferies   Company  Inc     AnalystSuper  Thank you Shirley Stacy    Vice President of Finance  Corporate   Investor CommunicationsThanks Brandon Joseph M  Hogan    Director  President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  See you  Brandon Shirley Stacy    Vice President of Finance  Corporate   Investor CommunicationsNext question OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Robert W  Baird  Please proceed with your question Jeff Johnson    Robert W  Baird   Co  Incorporated    AnalystHey guys  thanks  Good afternoon  Joe  I missed the prepared remarks  so I ll go back to the transcript on that  But just a question  one other on China  and maybe you addressed it  But are you seeing any bleed outside of China in any of the tangential markets where patients are also hesitant to go to hospital settings  dental settings  dental office settings  things like that  Any early indications of anything brewing like that Joseph M  Hogan    Director  President and Chief Executive OfficerNo  Jeff  nothing like that so far  We haven t seen anything anywhere around the world in that sense  You know Hong Kong has been kind of locked down since the protest or whatever  So it s hard to get a signal out of there one way or another  But Taiwan  Korea  some of the neighboring countries  Southeast Asia  we haven t seen anything Jeff Johnson    Robert W  Baird   Co  Incorporated    AnalystAll right  That s helpful  And then at the GP Summit late last year  Joe  you made a big effort I thought to kind of    you know at least put in people s head the idea of around  2 500 price point   3 000 price point  things like that  We ve anecdotally been hearing some guys dropping their prices there to compete more against the DTCs  We did some survey work though and didn t find that at all  In fact  I think GPs and orthos both out there price points that they charge patients going up over the next 12 months and 24 months  Just what are you hearing on a more consolidated basis  Are these docs willing to kind of go aggressively after this lower comprehensive or non comprehensive market and use some of your newer product to do that and really get after that 100 million patient population in North America Joseph M  Hogan    Director  President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Jeff  It s funny  not funny  but it s really interesting  There s a lot of noise out there  right  And it s just    your question is  how you pull signal from noise out of this whole thing  And what we feel is obviously there s a lot of doctors  both GPs and orthos  There is segment  a significant segment of them that see really a clinical build  Meaning  you don t have to do a complete bite reconfiguration on    you can responsibly move anterior teeth to give a good smile without having to move molars and other aspects of what s going on  Those doctors that see this as progressive is  hey maybe I ll fix the anterior teeth for a lower price and then move to a full bite correction at some point in time that patient wants to go  We see both orthodontist and GPs  a certain segment of them really engaging in that sense So we feel common  there is enough doctors out there that want to hit this kind of a price point and will do it in a very efficient way  Some of them look at it doing with maybe two or three touches with the patient rather than constant touches every few weeks and using remote monitoring and those kind of things to see how patients are going  So we actually feel that we can    that there are doctors out there with a limited product that will engage in that sense and be able to go after these  what we call price sensitive DTC patients who are looking for just really in a steady correction and not a bite correction Jeff Johnson    Robert W  Baird   Co  Incorporated    AnalystYeah  Fair enough  Thank you Joseph M  Hogan    Director  President and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Jeff Shirley Stacy    Vice President of Finance  Corporate   Investor CommunicationsThanks Jeff  Next question OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette with Barclays  Please proceed with your question Steven Valiquette    Barclays    AnalystGreat  thanks  Good afternoon  My China questions also have been addressed  I m going to go non China for a moment  Just a question on the total ASPs  For the portion of ASP that was down sequentially due to the promotional discounts that you alluded to  just curious for more color around that whether that s related to maybe higher volumes being achieved by individual practitioners  kind of like what happened in mid  18 and nobody probably wants to relive if they can help it or is this perhaps related to maybe a greater mix of DSO business  maybe more discounts for groups  maybe less related to individuals  Just more color around the discount that you alluded to  Thanks John F  Morici    Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President  Global FinanceYeah  I think  Steve  as you look at it  we run promotions on a regular basis to be able to drive volume  drive behavior  We see a mix effect of that as well where in Q3 there was maybe more ortho cases than in Q4 more proportionately GP cases  But as we said  as I ve said really throughout the 2019  we expected our ASPs to be relatively flat throughout the year  notwithstanding FX  And if we looked at where things were a year ago  we re up  5  And if you look at the FX impact to that  it was a negative  15  So you re going to have puts and takes as you go through the quarters  but we saw relative consistency throughout the year on our ASPs Steven Valiquette    Barclays    AnalystOkay  All right  thanks Shirley Stacy    Vice President of Finance  Corporate   Investor CommunicationsThanks  Steve  Next question please OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Michael Ryskin with Bank of America  Please proceed with your question Michael Ryskin    BofA Merrill Lynch Global Equity Research    AnalystYeah  thanks  The same  A lot of the China questions have been sort of flushed out  I want to follow up on Steve s question just now  Sort of how do you think about that moving forward  the ASP component as we move through 2020  You highlighted some of the moving pieces you had in 2019 and historically and you ve also got shifting portfolio mix  shifting geographic mix  especially from the China events going on  So I just want to get a sense of how you re thinking about both discounts promotions  the Advantage program and the mix shift evolving over the next couple of years sort of net net  how do you envision ASPs trending down Joseph M  Hogan    Director  President and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  It s a good question  Michael  I mean you think of it    just think of it separately for once and then we ll go together  So if you look at it separately  if you look at the comprehensive product  relatively consistent  There is not going to    from a promotion standpoint and everything else  you would expect consistency in those ASPs  same way from a non comprehensive product  But when you see the interaction between the two as non comp grows faster  you could see ASPs to be flat  to be slightly down as a result of that mix  And as we ve said and as we saw in the fourth quarter where ASPs    even if it s at a lower ASP  it still comes with a higher gross margin and we saw that in the fourth quarter  We expect that going forward  So when we look to the future  ASPs of course get the headlines  but we re really focusing on driving that gross margin and operating margin Michael Ryskin    BofA Merrill Lynch Global Equity Research    AnalystGreat  And quick one if I may as well on the scanner segment on the iTero  Strong end to the year  but still sort of not nearly at the same pace you had early on  I realize part of that is the stack comps  But there s also been a lot of noise in the market with some other competitive entrants throughout 2019  Can you talk about anything you re seeing in iTero if it s tied to some of your DSOs where you sort of exhausted the pool of the installs that you had when you sign on board with them or if it s something from a competitive landscape you re seeing Joseph M  Hogan    Director  President and Chief Executive OfficerI still feel great about the growth in iTero business for the year  right  is at 38   And you re right  I mean  when you look at the capital equipment market in any medical business  the fourth quarter is usually the biggest one that people are looking at    what they re going to do from a capex standpoint  they buy  So it was a tough comparison year over year  but still growing 20   I think the best way to think about this  Michael  there s competition out there  We feel really good about our digital platform that iTero represents  How it competes against any scanner really out there  And you see that it s doing well on restorative too as well as from an orthodontics standpoint  So we think we re really competitive  But as you    I think back to your question is like how do you model that thing going forward  I think you model that at our 20  to 30  growth rates that we have given you for our business in general  And that s what we ve done through the many years we ve had iTero so far is keeping that range  Sometimes we ve been outside that range on the upside or whatever  But long term  your model  think of 20  to 30  in a significant amount of that being some services revenue too that really helps in there Shirley Stacy    Vice President of Finance  Corporate   Investor CommunicationsThanks  Mike  Next question please OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Erin Wright with Credit Suisse  Please proceed with your question Erin Wright    Credit Suisse    AnalystGreat  thanks  A follow up on iTero  I guess what s the early feedback on the 5D scanner and how should we think about the overall opportunity on that front  Thanks Joseph M  Hogan    Director  President and Chief Executive OfficerThe doctor feedback    Erin  it s Joe  on the 5D scanner has really been great  I mean the ones that really use it to scan every patient when they come in  they are picking up carries or cavities at a rate that are almost 2x of what they can actually visually see or see through an X ray and that s driven a lot of new business through those docs  And so a lot of this information comes in  I mean obviously outside the United States because the FDA hasn t approved that yet  So we see this near infrared technologies that were being used to see cracks in teeth and carries in teeth as really helping from a cash flow standpoint  from a doctor and the cases they re seeing  Secondly  it s helping patients in that sense to be able to identify issues that you can get out a little more proactively before they really become an issue As far as 5D in the United States  I think we ve said that I m never going to guess when the FDA says yes  I ve been in the Class 2 medical device business for too long  But our expectation is in sometime in the first half that we ll get 5D approval through the FDA Shirley Stacy    Vice President of Finance  Corporate   Investor CommunicationsThanks  Erin  Next question please OperatorNext question comes from the line of Chris Cooley with Stephens  Please proceed with your question Chris Cooley    Stephens  Inc     AnalystThanks for squeezing me in  and also thank you for taking a shot at China  that s a really fluid situation for you guys this evening  Just from my perspective  can we go back to 30 000 feet and just looking at the guidance for  20 in terms of growth ex China  You re talking about toward the lower bound of the LRP plan  there is    let s say 20  to 25   Why wouldn t growth inflect higher after the deceleration from  18 to  19 just pretty meaningful  Could you maybe just help us parse out whether it s the challenging part of comps  if it s a difference in the consumer mix  competition  Just want to try and understand why that wouldn t inflect back up with the strong volume growth that you re seeing globally here in 2018 and 2019  independent obviously of China  Thanks John F  Morici    Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President  Global FinanceYeah  Chris  this is John  It s a good question  I mean  when we look at the investments that we re making  we invest into as you said that long term growth model where there is international expansion we want to continue to expand and grow into countries  we want to continue to grow our utilization  whether it s on the ortho side or the GP side  We look at how we exited  We felt really good about fourth quarter  felt good about coming into this year  And    but we want to make sure that as we invest and as we continue to grow  we can give you information that we see  And as we look at the year and as we look at our investments  this is the best information that we can get  Of course  as we invest  we will always look for additional opportunities  whether it s growth in other markets  increased utilization and so on  and those are things that we ll do  China gets a lot of the headlines now because of what s happening there  But the rest of our business is a good growth opportunity for us and we re making investments within those areas Shirley Stacy    Vice President of Finance  Corporate   Investor CommunicationsThanks  Chris  We will take one last question  please  operator OperatorOur last question comes from the line of Ravi Misra from Berenberg Capital Markets  Please proceed with your question Joseph M  Hogan    Director  President and Chief Executive OfficerHi  Ravi Shirley Stacy    Vice President of Finance  Corporate   Investor CommunicationsMaybe Ravi dropped off OperatorRavi  your line is live  Are you on mute Ravi Misra    Berenberg Capital Markets  LLC    AnalystHi  How are you  Sorry I was on mute Shirley Stacy    Vice President of Finance  Corporate   Investor CommunicationsHi Ravi Ravi Misra    Berenberg Capital Markets  LLC    AnalystTwo quick questions  thanks for squeezing me in  Just on the balance sheet  both of them  Number one  just inventory days have been creeping up throughout the year  Historically  it s been a pretty good working capital business  Can you help me understand why that s the case and what s the kind of new normal expected there  And secondly  with almost  870 million on the balance sheet  just in terms of capital allocation  maybe help us think about any changes to the current kind of philosophy of share repurchases  Thanks John F  Morici    Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President  Global FinanceHey Ravi  This is John  I ll take the first one on iTero or the balance sheet with inventory  The majority of that increase is on the iTero side as we transition to products with Element 1  Element 2 and then to 5D  there is just some timing related to that  But that    as we start to sell more 5D and as we increase our volume on iTero that inventory would come down  On the Invisalign side  it s pretty consistent to what our growth has been Joseph M  Hogan    Director  President and Chief Executive OfficerOn the cash on the balance sheet  obviously this company is an amazing cash generator in that way  Yeah  I just want to reemphasize  Ravi  We re not in the general dentistry business  so don t look us going out to broaden the portfolio in any particular way  We re building what we talked about when I closed about a digital platform and investing in that digital platform is where we re focused on  So when we have our Investor Day in May  we ll reapproach in a sense of the share buyback and what we think we ll be doing with that cash in the future Shirley Stacy    Vice President of Finance  Corporate   Investor CommunicationsThanks Ravi  Thanks everyone  That concludes our conference call today  We appreciate you taking the time  As a reminder  we did send out

131551,353066,ALGN,Coronavirus Worries Overshadow Align Technology s Solid Q4 Earnings,news,"Align Technology  NASDAQ ALGN  returned to investors  good graces in October with its strong third quarter results  After warning about potential headwinds and lowering its guidance  Align blew past expectations  But that s the past 
The orthodontic device maker announced its 2019 fourth quarter and full year results after the market closed on Wednesday  Although those results were great  they were overshadowed by concerns about the potential impact of the coronavirus that first affected China and has now spread to other countries  Here are the highlights from the company s Q4 update 

Good news
There was plenty of good news with Align s fourth quarter results  The company reported fourth quarter revenue of  649 8 million  reflecting a 21 7  year over year increase  It also topped the consensus Wall Street Q4 revenue estimate of  646 5 million 
Align announced diluted earnings per share  EPS  of  1 53  up 27 5  over the prior year period result  The average analysts  estimate was for EPS of  1 40 
The company s strength in Q4 was evident across the board  Invisalign volume jumped 23 9  year over year to 413 725 case shipments  This reflected 19 3  growth in the Americas and 30 1  growth in international markets  Align made impressive progress in the teen market  with Invisalign shipments rising 33 1  year over year 
Align s scanners and services segment also performed very well  with sales increasing by 20 2  year over year  The company said it saw especially strong growth internationally 
Bad news
Normally  trouncing Wall Street s revenue and earnings estimates would please investors  However  investing in stocks requires a focus on the future instead of dwelling on successes of the past  And Align s future appears a little murky 
Align set its sights lower than expected for the first quarter of 2020  The company anticipates net revenue between  615 million and  630 million  significantly below the consensus analysts  estimate of  657 3 million  It projects adjusted diluted EPS between  1 19 and  1 28  lower than the average analysts  estimate of  1 44 
The problem is China  Align reduced its 2020 Q1 outlook because of concerns about the impact of the coronavirus outbreak in the country  China represents close to 8  of the company s total revenue  The large country has implemented travel bans in some areas and has issued public warnings about avoiding nonessential medical and dental procedures 
Align has taken steps of its own in response to the coronavirus outbreak  CEO Joe Hogan stated 

As we kick off 2020  we are very concerned for the safety and health of our employees  customers doctors and their patients in China   Their wellbeing is our top priority and we are doing everything we can to ensure that they are in good hands  We are working with our local team to donate medical supplies and provide funding to help combat the outbreak   

The net impact of the coronavirus concerns is that Align expects  30 million to  35 million less revenue for its Invisalign and iTero scanners in China in the first quarter  The company also said that it s  absorbing  3 0 million to  4 0 million in idle China plant capacity costs which we expect will result in approximately a 0 5  gross margin impact  
Looking ahead
Despite the bad news related to the financial hit that Align could take from the coronavirus scare  the long term prospects of the company appear to remain quite good  Hogan said that  it s important to take a step back and remember that our business is broad and deep   He s right 
The impact of the coronavirus concerns should only be temporary  Align s performance in Q4 shows that overall demand remains very strong for its Invisalign clear aligners and for its iTero scanners ",2020-01-30,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/powi1,2071589
131552,353067,ALGN,Smile Direct Club  SDC   The Comeback Story,opinion,"Smile Direct Club   NASDAQ SDC   has been a wild ride for investors since the company went public in mid September and is finally on the upswing  Below you can see SDC s progression since its IPO 

SDC started off on a rocky note  Its first day on the public markets demonstrated the worst IPO in decades  with traders pushing this stock down 27 5  day one  The stock then proceed to break down to just a fraction of its IPO price  with the primary catalyst being legal concerns  The fundamentals of the business remained strong  and all it took was some positive news to push SDC shares right back towards their IPO price 
In the 2 weeks of 2020  SDC shares have appreciated over 60  in value due to a couple of critical announcements  Smile Direct Club announced that it would be partnering with Walmart  NYSE WMT  to sell some of its supplementary products on January 6th  Investors and traders pushed the stock price up over 20  initially after the news but then traced back down 
On January 14th  news was released that SDC would now be selling its aligners to orthodontists  This was the catalyst that was needed to propel these shares towards analysts  target price  Analysts have been calling this a buy for months now  and the stock is finally making its way towards the  20 average price target that analysts have set for it 
Since Tuesday  January 14th   Smile Direct Club s stock price has rallied 35   and its primary competitor  Align Technology   NASDAQ ALGN    has dropped over 5   Selling its products to orthodontists significantly broadening SDC s reach into a much more legitimate realm  and now poses a more substantial risk to Align Technology s clear aligner  Having real orthodontists using Smile Direct s aligners gives this product validity for those wanting to try its direct to consumer channel 
The Business
This company is a driving force in the next era of medical treatment  where ease and convenience are the underlying stimulus  Millennials and Gen Z s value appearance with social media making all your images are worth a thousand words  SDC offers consumers a more convenient and cheaper option to straighten out your smile compared to traditional orthodontists 
Take Away
Zacks Ranking is putting SDC at a  4  Sell  right now  but once analysts have adjusted their models for this most recent news  this ranking should be pushed up  The markets have smothered SDC since its IPO  I don t think that these shares recent rally is over  If the broader market can stay afloat  I am confident that SDC has legs to run

131566,353081,ALGN,Banks worth  47 trillion adopt new U N  backed climate principles,news,"By Matthew Green
UNITED NATIONS  Reuters    Banks with more than  47 trillion in assets  or a third of the global industry  adopted new U N  backed  responsible banking  principles to fight climate change on Sunday that would shift their loan books away from fossil fuels 
 Deutsche Bank   DE DBKGn    Citigroup   N C  and  Barclays   L BARC  were among 130 banks to join the new framework on the eve of a United Nations summit in New York aimed at pushing companies and governments to act quickly to avert catastrophic global warming 
 These principles mean banks have to consider the impact of their loans on society   not just on their portfolio   Simone Dettling  banking team lead for the Geneva based United Nations Environment Finance Initiative  told Reuters 
Under pressure from investors  regulators and climate activists  some big banks have acknowledged the role lenders will need to play in a rapid transition to a low carbon economy 
Financing for oil  gas and coal projects has come under particular scrutiny as climate scientists step up calls to change the global economy s deep reliance on fossil fuels to avert disastrous warming 
The principles  drawn up jointly by U N  officials and banks  require lenders to 
  Align  NASDAQ ALGN  their strategies with the 2015 Paris Agreement to curb global warming and U N  backed targets to fight poverty called the Sustainable Development Goals
  Set targets to increase  positive impacts  and reduce  negative impacts  on people and the environment
  Work with clients and customers to encourage sustainable practices
  Be transparent and accountable about their progress 
The principles  main backers say the norms will encourage banks to pivot their loan portfolios away from carbon intensive assets and redirect capital to greener industries 
Critics argue that banks should go much further by explicitly committing to phasing out financing for fossil fuel projects and agribusiness that drive deforestation in the Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   Southeast Asia and other regions 
However  the new standards could also force participating banks to choose between foregoing business from clients in high carbon sectors and the risk of being accused of backsliding on the principles if they continue to finance such firms 
Although the initiative is voluntary  Dettling  who played a central role during 18 months of negotiations with a core group of 30 founding banks  said lenders would be reluctant to accept the reputational risk of losing their signatory status 
 They need to demonstrate that they are making progress   and progress within a given timeline   Dettling said 
 Ultimately  banks that are not in line with their commitments and do not make progress can be stripped of their signatory status   she said 
Banks in Europe  in particular  also face growing regulatory pressure to disclose their exposure to the potential impact of climate related disasters and a low carbon energy transition on their asset base 
Bank of England Governor Mark Carney  who has joined counterparts in France and the Netherlands to push for better supervision of climate risk  was due to address the U N  climate summit on Monday  according to a draft agenda 
Other banks to join the  Principles for Responsible Banking  initiative included  Danske Bank   CO DANSKE   ABN Amro  AS ABNd    BNP Paribas   PA BNPP   Commerzbank  DE CBKG   Lloyds Banking Group  L LLOY  and  Societe Generale   PA SOGN   according to a statement ",2019-09-22,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economy/banks-worth-47-trillion-adopt-new-unbacked-climate-principles-1983399,1983399
131571,353086,ALGN,XRAY Or ALGN  Which Is The Better Value Stock Right Now ,opinion,"Investors with an interest in Medical   Dental Supplies stocks have likely encountered both Dentsply International  XRAY  and Align Technology  NASDAQ ALGN   But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks  Let s take a closer look 
Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities  but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank  The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions  while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits 
Dentsply International has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Align Technology has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold  right now  The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates  so investors should rest assured that XRAY has an improving earnings outlook  But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors 
Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics  including the popular P E ratio  as well as the P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years 
XRAY currently has a forward P E ratio of 23 35  while ALGN has a forward P E of 50 74  We also note that XRAY has a PEG ratio of 2 01  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  ALGN currently has a PEG ratio of 2 30

Based on these metrics and many more  XRAY holds a Value grade of B  while ALGN has a Value grade of D

131572,353087,ALGN,All You Need To Know About Align Technology  ALGN  Rating Upgrade To Buy,opinion,"Align Technology  NASDAQ ALGN  appears an attractive pick  as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates    one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices 
The Zacks rating relies solely on a company s changing earnings picture  It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure    the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near term stock price movements  the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors  They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time 
Therefore  the Zacks rating upgrade for Align Technology basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price 
Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices
The change in a company s future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  and the near term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated  That s partly because of the influence of institutional investors that use earnings and earnings estimates for calculating the fair value of a company s shares  An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it  Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock 
Fundamentally speaking  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Align Technology imply an improvement in the company s underlying business  Investors should show their appreciation for this improving business trend by pushing the stock higher 
Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions
As empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock movements  tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding  Here is where the tried and tested Zacks Rank stock rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions 
The Zacks Rank stock rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  to Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   has an impressive externally audited track record  with Zacks Rank  1 stocks generating an average annual return of  25  since 1988  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here      
Earnings Estimate Revisions for Align Technology
For the fiscal year ending December  2019  this maker of the Invisalign tooth straightening system is expected to earn  5 39 per share  which is a change of 9 6  from the year ago reported number 
Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Align Technology  Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 3 4  
Bottom Line
Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of  buy  and  sell  ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time  Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5  of the Zacks covered stocks get a  Strong Buy  rating and the next 15  get a  Buy  rating  So  the placement of a stock in the top 20  of the Zacks covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market beating returns in the near term

131578,353093,ALGN,3 Reasons Growth Investors Will Love Align Technology  ALGN ,opinion,"Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market s attention and produce exceptional returns  However  it isn t easy to find a great growth stock 
That s because  these stocks usually carry above average risk and volatility  In fact  betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss 
However  the Zacks Growth Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores system   which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company s real growth prospects  makes it pretty easy to find cutting edge growth stocks 
Our proprietary system currently recommends Align Technology  NASDAQ ALGN  as one such stock  This company not only has a favorable Growth Score  but also carries a top Zacks Rank 
Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market  And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  
While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this maker of the Invisalign tooth straightening system is a great growth pick right now  we have highlighted three of the most important factors below 
Earnings Growth
Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor  as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors  And for growth investors  double digit earnings growth is definitely preferable  and often an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  for the company under consideration 
While the historical EPS growth rate for Align Technology is 32 2   investors should actually focus on the projected growth  The company s EPS is expected to grow 21  this year  crushing the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 11 7  
Cash Flow Growth
While cash is the lifeblood of any business  higher than average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth oriented companies than for mature companies  That s because  growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds 
Right now  year over year cash flow growth for Align Technology is 27 9   which is higher than many of its peers  In fact  the rate compares to the industry average of 9 3  
While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth  it s worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective  The company s annualized cash flow growth rate has been 25 8  over the past 3 5 years versus the industry average of 12 6  
Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions
Beyond the metrics outlined above  investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions  A positive trend is a plus here  Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near term stock price movements 
There have been upward revisions in current year earnings estimates for Align Technology  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0 6  over the past month 
Bottom Line
While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Align Technology a Zacks Rank  2 stock  it has earned itself a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors  including the ones discussed above 
You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here 
This combination indicates that Align Technology is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors ",2020-01-03,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-reasons-growth-investors-will-love-align-technology-algn-200496358,200496358
131579,353094,ALGN,Why Align Technology  ALGN  Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Align Technology  NASDAQ ALGN   which belongs to the Zacks Medical   Dental Supplies industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This maker of the Invisalign tooth straightening system has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 16 74  
For the most recent quarter  Align Technology was expected to post earnings of  1 14 per share  but it reported  1 28 per share instead  representing a surprise of 12 28   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  1 51 per share  while it actually produced  1 83 per share  a surprise of 21 19  
Price and EPS Surprise

Thanks in part to this history  there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Align Technology lately  In fact  the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  for the stock is positive  which is a great indicator of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Align Technology has an Earnings ESP of  1 70  at the moment  suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near term earnings potential  When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold   it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner  The company s next earnings report is expected to be released on January 29  2020 
Investors should note  however  that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2020-01-14,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-align-technology-algn-could-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200498714,200498714

On the flip side  Align Technology registered a dull Invisalign case shipment in China  which dragged down the entire case shipment in the second quarter of 2019  Per the company  this was due to a tough consumer environment in China  This apart  there was slower growth in young adult cases noticed in North America  Also  looking at the company s third quarter guidance  we expect this lackluster trend to linger over the period

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 12 28   A quarter ago  it was expected that this maker of the Invisalign tooth straightening system would post earnings of  1 51 per share when it actually produced earnings of  1 83  delivering a surprise of 21 19  
Over the last four quarters  the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times 
Align Technology  which belongs to the Zacks Medical   Dental Supplies industry  posted revenues of  607 34 million for the quarter ended September 2019  surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 51   This compares to year ago revenues of  505 29 million  The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters 
The sustainability of the stock s immediate price movement based on the recently released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s commentary on the earnings call 
Align Technology shares have added about 2  since the beginning of the year versus the S P 500 s gain of 19 5  
What s Next for Align Technology 
While Align Technology has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock 
There are no easy answers to this key question  but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company s earnings outlook  Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter s   but also how these expectations have changed lately 
Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions  Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried and tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank  which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions 
Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Align Technology was unfavorable  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions  while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits 
Currently  Dentsply International has a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Align Technology has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates  so investors should rest assured that XRAY has an improving earnings outlook  But this is only part of the picture for value investors 
Value investors are also interested in a number of tried and true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics  including the tried and true P E ratio  the P S ratio  earnings yield  and cash flow per share  as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use 
XRAY currently has a forward P E ratio of 23 07  while ALGN has a forward P E of 49 87  We also note that XRAY has a PEG ratio of 1 99  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  ALGN currently has a PEG ratio of 2 26

131615,353130,ALGN,Trade  Impeachment And The Conviction Of Buyers And Sellers,opinion,"Rollover Process 2007 2008
Since every trade has a buyer and a seller  price action in the financial markets is determined by the conviction of buyers relative to the conviction of sellers  In the first half of 2007  chart below   the conviction of buyers became stronger than the conviction of sellers allowing the S P 500 to hold above the red 200 day moving average  In the second half of 2007  the conviction of sellers began to gain traction relative to the conviction of buyers causing the S P 500 to stall and eventually drop decisively below the 200 day moving average 





When the S P 500 s trend rolled over in a decisive manner in 2008 

Price tended to stay below a downward sloping 200 day moving average 
There was noticeable white space above price and below the 200 day 





Does The 2019 Chart Align  With Gloom And Doom 
The right side of the 2006 2008 chart above looks quite a bit different from the present day S P 500 chart shown below  In recent months  price has stayed above an upward sloping 200 day moving average and there has been white space below price and above the 200 day If we move from left to right on the chart above  the conviction of sellers was not strong enough in early 2018 to drive the S P 500 below the red 200 day for a prolonged period  Institutions became more concerned in early October 2018 and selling conviction picked up considerably relative to buying conviction  Once price cleared the 200 day in Q1 2019  the conviction of sellers has not been strong enough to hold price below an upward sloping 200 day 
It Has Been 119 Days Since
In the end  bear markets begin when large institutions decide the fundamental issues of the day have reached a negative tipping point and it is time to head for the exits  as they did in Q4 2007 and in 2008   Large institutions have known about slowing global growth  yield curve inversion  trade tensions  and the threat of impeachment for some time now  and yet selling conviction from institutions has not been strong enough to drive the S P 500 below the 200 day moving average for 119 calendar days 





When institutions believe it is time to significantly reduce risk exposure  instead of having an S P 500 chart with price above an upward sloping 200 day  we will see an S P 500 chart with price below a downward sloping 200 day  That may happen in short order  but it has not happened yet ",2019-09-30,Chris Ciovacco,https://www.investing.com/analysis/trade-impeachment-and-the-conviction-of-buyers-and-sellers-200469297,200469297

131647,353162,ALGN,Bear Of The Day  Align Technology  ALGN ,opinion,On July 24  Align  NASDAQ ALGN  Technology  ALGN  delivered a big EPS beat of 21  and slightly better revenues  But Invisalign case shipments missed estimates  377K vs 380K  consensus  and Q3 2H19 guidance was disappointing due to both slower adoption in China and some softness in US young adult growth   Here were the headline prints from Bloomberg and the CEO summary  and then we ll look at analyst reaction      Align Technology reports Q2 EPS  1 83 vs consensus  1 51 and Q2 revenue  600 7M vs consensus  599 38M     Align Technology sees Q3 EPS  1 09  1 16 vs consensus  1 24 and Q3 revenue  585M  600M vs consensus  623 65M    Align Technology sees FY19 revenue at low end of 20  30  growth target vs consensus  2 45B  Sees FY19 Invisalign revenue and volume growth at low end of long term operating model target  Sees FY19 operating margin below low end of long term model at roughly 22    Commenting on Align Q2 results and the outlook for Q3  Align Technology president and CEO Joe Hogan said   Our second quarter revenues were at the high end of our guidance  reflecting Invisalign volume growth primarily from international doctors  as well as very strong sales from iTero scanner and services  Q2 Invisalign volumes were up 24 6  year over year reflecting continued adoption from teenage and younger patients  as well as increased utilization among orthodontists and expansion of our customer base which totaled 60 000 active doctors worldwide  In Q2  total Invisalign case shipments were lower than expected  primarily due to a softness in China related to a tougher consumer environment and slower growth in young adult case in North America  Given the uncertainty in China  our outlook for the third quarter reflects a more cautious view for growth in the Asia Pacific region   Now here s a sampling of analyst reactions    Jefferies  Analyst Brandon Couillard explained that the 25  drop in ALGN shares on July 25 was all about the Q2 Invisalign case volume miss and Q3 guidance shortfall  due to a consumer led slowdown in China and competitive noise in Americas  However  the analyst does not see the latest  snaggle in two pockets of the business as structural issues   Near term  he thinks the Q3 guidance tilts conservative and believes the valuation should offer support  Couillard lowered his price target for ALGN to  275 from  345  Credit Suisse  SIX CSGN   Analyst Erin Wilson Wright lowered her price target for Align Technology to  320 from  340 on lower outlook following quarterly results  The analyst reiterates an Outperform rating on the shares  Stifel Nicolaus  ALGN price target lowered to  290 from  360 at Stifel on  messier than anticipated  quarter   We expected some noise in the quarter  but results were admittedly messier than anticipated  and our 2019 2021 revenue and EPS estimates move lower   The Stifel analysts also believe management s 3Q19 case volume guidance will prove conservative  Regarding increased competitive pressures  they see that ALGN can still grow case volumes 20   long term due to traction in more insulated high growth markets like Teen  International and LATAM  Growth Hiccup on International Expansion and Competition We have owned and traded ALGN shares for over two years in my Healthcare Innovators portfolio  In fact  we rode a big wave from  130 to  330 for 150  gains between May 2017 and May 2018  I believed that the premier brand of dental aligners combined with iTero  the digital scanning platform ideal for emerging markets penetration  would continue to grow at 25 30  annually and hit  5 billion in sales in 2021  That would justify a price to sales valuation of over 5X and sustain shares above  300  But the growth hiccup is here and will slow down the path to  5 billion with only 21 22  growth  Here s what I told members on July 25     My take  The selling overreaction here is brutal and likely way over done  But estimates will come down and make ALGN a Zacks  5 Rank soon  Estimates were already creeping down enough in the past week to push it to a  4 Rank yesterday morning before earnings  Estimates did indeed come down since then with next year s topline projection falling under  3 billion and the Zacks EPS consensus slipping from  7 22 to  6 69 among eight analysts  Unfortunately  this meant that I had to sell Align Technology and wait for the estimates to turn back up  or at least stop going down  Here s what I told members on July 26    This is a tough decision because I believe that both investors and analysts are overreacting to the China growth miss  But as I indicated yesterday  the stock will become a Zacks  5 Rank soon as estimates come down  so I would be selling at some point next week anyway  In the interest of helping you make your own decision  I provide more analyst views and moves  courtesy of TheFly com    BofA Merrill  Align Technology downgraded to Neutral on reduced visibility as analyst Michael Ryskin weighed the company s lighter Q2 volumes and Q3 volumes guidance that was well below expectations  He noted that while Align has had volatile results in the past  this report stands out given the number of issues that cropped up in the quarter amid positive commentary from management in recent months  Ryskin added that this was  the first time that Align spent significant time discussing incremental pressure from competition   He lowered their PT from  350 to  220  Piper Jaffray  Analyst Matt O Brien lowered his price target for Align Technology to  240 from  350 saying the company s case volumes were a  little light  for Q2 and management issued second half of 2019 guidance  well below  expectations  This is the first time Align has acknowledged the impact of competition and there was also a slowdown in China  O Brien told investors in a research note  He believes that while these issues will not resolve quickly  the company  will be able to navigate them   Further  there were some clear positives from the quarter  including  impressive  scanner growth and  excellent  doctor training numbers  contends O Brien  He keeps an Overweight rating on Align Technology  Of note is the huge move in price target from the BofA ML analyst who had just raised his target to  350 only weeks before ALGN s report  One might suspect he felt fooled by company optimism this year  And if some investors feel that way too  ALGN shares may drift in purgatory for some time near  200  But longer term  they are probably a buy very soon  The

131686,353201,ALGN,Align Technology Inc  Gives Investors Plenty To Smile About With Another Record Qu,opinion,"Continued growth for its Invisalign clear aligners and iTero intraoral scanner propel the orthodontic device maker s success 
Record revenue  Record earnings  Record Invisalign clear aligner shipments 
It seems that every quarter  Align Technology Inc  NASDAQ ALGN  sounds like a broken record  pun fully intended   After getting off to a great start in 2018 with its first quarter results  investors might have wondered if the orthodontic device maker might take a breather at some point 
It could happen down the road  but there was no breather for Align Technology in the second quarter  The company announced its second quarter results after the market closed on Wednesday  Here are the highlights from yet another record quarter for Align 

What happened with Align Technology this quarter 
Align Technology s core business continued to thrive in the second quarter  Shipments of the company s Invisalign clear aligner cases increased 30 5  year over year  That growth doesn t include any clear aligners provided to SmileDirect Club 
What s especially notable about the Invisalign shipment growth is that Align is making solid inroads into the teen market  The company reported that Invisalign cases for teenage patients jumped 42 1  year over year and comprised nearly 26  of total shipments 
Align s scanner business is also rocking  Revenue from selling scanners and services soared 60 9  year over year to  57 million  This business now generates nearly 12  of the company s total revenue 
But the most impressive aspect of Align s second quarter performance is how much the company is growing each quarter  Revenue was up 12 2  from the first quarter  Net profit increased 10 7  from just three months earlier 
Align Technology also notched several other noteworthy achievements in the second quarter  The company opened an Invisalign treatment planning facility in Germany  its first such facility in Europe  It rolled out new products  including Invisalign First for younger patients with a mixture of baby teeth and permanent teeth  the iTero Element 2 scanner  and the iTero Element Flex scanner  In addition  Align received an important regulatory approval in China to market its iTero Element intraoral scanner 
What management had to say
Align Technology CEO Joe Hogan stated 

I m pleased to report another better than expected quarter for Align  Our second quarter results reflect strong growth across our customer channels with record volume in all regions and in almost every country market  Year over year revenue growth of 37 5  was driven by continued momentum from Invisalign doctors and increased adoption of Invisalign treatment for teenage patients which grew 42 1   Q2 Invisalign volume growth of 30 5  year over year reflects increased utilization and expansion of our customer base  which was over 50 000 for the first time and included more than 5 000 new Invisalign trained doctors  We also saw momentum from the iTero scanner and services business which includes the continued rollout of iTero scanners across Heartland Dental s installed base  as well as the first iTero scanner shipments to China 

Looking forward
Earlier this year  Morgan Stanley expressed a negative outlook about Align s growth prospects  saying that the sizzling growth of the past would cool off  So far  however  that hasn t happened  But Align s guidance for the third quarter could hint that a slowing of growth is around the corner 
Align Technology projects that third quarter revenue will be between  493 million and  503 million  That s 28  to 31  higher than revenue reported in the prior year period  However  the midpoint of that range reflects quarter over quarter revenue growth of only 1     well below the trend that Align has experienced recently 
The company expects diluted earnings per share of  1 13 to  1 18  While that reflects a big jump from the third quarter of 2017  even the upper end of the range is less than what Align reported for the second quarter of 2018 
Investors might want to take Align s guidance with a grain of salt  though  The company likes to sandbag with its projections  For example  in April 2018 Align projected second quarter revenue between  460 million and  470 million with diluted EPS between  1 02 and  1 06  The company went on to blow those numbers out of the water with its actual second quarter performance

131705,353220,ALGN,Your Brain On Risk  8 Questions To Check Your Investing Biases,opinion," 1     Are You a Trader or Long Term Investor  5     A Quiz on Your Psychology of Investing 10     Should You Be Listening To Everything Your Advisor Says  13     What Should You Do With An Inheritance   21     How To Navigate A Market Correction 25     Loss Aversion  Confirmation and Availability Bias 35     Long Term Investing vs  Short Term Trading 41     Episode Roundup  Welcome back to Mind Over Money  I m Kevin Cook  your field guide and story teller for the fascinating arena of behavioral economics 
On the inaugural episode of the Mind Over Money podcast  I outlined what two different sciences were teaching us about how our brains make decisions  especially those involving uncertainty and risk like stock market investing 
I liked to describe these scientific twins and their goals and methods this way  neuroscience examines our behavior from the  inside out  and behavioral economics studies our decisions from the  outside in  to gain clues about where it all goes wrong 
In a Medium blog post that accompanied the episode  I listed eight of the most common  or intriguing  cognitive biases that get in the way of better decisions  You can find that piece here   

That article also has a classic money behavior research question from the founders of the  outside in  psychology of economics  Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky  I have talked about that dynamic duo in several podcasts and perhaps most poignantly in this episode  
Charles and Tracey  The Wealth of Investing Wisdom    From Experience
Today  I was excited to discover that the summer edition of the Charles Schwab  NYSE SCHW  magazine OnInvesting was devoted to one of my favorite topics  The cover title reads  Mind Over Matter  and the description says  Overcoming the mental mix ups that may be costing you money  
To take their 8 question investor decision making quiz  I invited my colleague Tracey Ryniec on the show to find out how rational we are as professional investors 
Tracey runs two model portfolios at Zacks  the Value Investor and the Insider Trader  and she has lots of experience with her own decision making traps as well as those of her followers 
We go through the eight questions and their corresponding cognitive biases for over 20 minutes  while also weaving in stories from our experiences as long term investors and short term traders giving stock recommendations to thousands of loyal followers 
Getting  Straight  on Your Goals  Time Frames    Processes
One stock I was honored to mention was one that I just sold today for a sizable gain in my Healthcare Innovators long term portfolio  Align Technology   NASDAQ ALGN    maker of the Invisalign clear dental  straighteners  
I explained how I also owned it for a smaller gain in my short term TAZR Trader portfolio  Wearing two hats like this simultaneously can be done if your goals  time horizons  and research decision processes are clear and deliberate 
It s not about having perfect discipline as much as having the systematic consistency to write out a solid plan and then check your behavior against it as frequently as possible 
Tracey and I also talk about being open to new information but then still vetting that info against your plans and processes 
And I share some ideas about investing mistakes I ve made  based on an article I wrote in March  At the time  I wanted to use at least 3 blunders    selling Salesforce   NYSE CRM   and Adobe   NASDAQ ADBE   and not buying Amazon   NASDAQ AMZN      as windows to my own biased decision making 
These were mistakes in the context of how bull markets actually work based on the goals  methods  and behavior of large fund managers  I explain the concepts in more detail in the article here   

That article also includes a link to a special 1 minute video I made in October that sums up how and why you  follow the big money  right to the end of the bull market 
Because unless you know more than they do  you ve probably called the end of the economic cycle and the top of the market about 5 times before in this decade 
Finally to learn more about the fascinating connections between Salesforce  IBM  NYSE IBM   and NVIDIA   NASDAQ NVDA   in making artificial intelligence a requisite technology of the Fortune 500  see my March 2017 video which I m certain Einstein and Watson would say still stands the test of time   

Disclosure  I own shares of NVDA in the Zacks TAZR Trader portfolio

131751,353266,ALGN,United Rentals  CF Industries Holdings  Shutterfly  Align Technologies And Advanced Micro Devices Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day ,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   Jan 31  2018    highlights United Rentals  Inc    NYSE URI  as the Bull of the Day  CF Industries Holdings  Inc    NYSE CF   as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Shutterfly   NASDAQ SFLY    Align Technologies   NASDAQ ALGN   and Advanced Micro Devices   NASDAQ AMD   Here is a synopsis of all five stocks  United Rentals  Inc   is on a roll as the North American economy heats up  This Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  is expected to grow earnings by over 40  in 2018 United Rentals is the largest equipment rental company in the world with 997 rental locations in 49 states and every Canadian province In 2017  it acquired Neff Corporation for  1 3 billion which has boosted its employee count to 14 800  The company serves construction and industrial customers  utilities  municipalities  the oil and gas sector  homeowners and others A Strong Fourth Quarter to Close Out a Record YearOn Jan 24  United Rentals reported its fourth quarter and full year 2017 results  It met on the Zacks Consensus for the fourth quarter  reporting  3 34 But the earnings meet was only a small part of the story Rental revenue rose 26 8  with owned rental revenue jumping 26 5  Time utilization increased 70 basis points year over year to 70  It s saw strength in the Trench  Power and Pump segment  where rental revenue rose 38 7  year over year and the rental gross margin improved by 230 basis points to 47 5  For the year  rental rates rose 2   The company exceeded its upper band of guidance on total revenue  adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow Tax Reform ImplicationsUnited Rentals is one company that will see a big benefit from the tax reform On a net basis  and leaving all other factors unchanged  United Rentals estimates it will benefit by at least  250 million It also expects an effective tax rate of about 25  in 2018 Share Repurchase Program Re StartedThe company has had a  1 billion share repurchase program since November 2015  It was paused in October 2016 due to mergers and acquisitions At that time  it had completed  627 million of the program In 2017  it bought  28 million worth of stock  leaving  345 million remaining In 2018  it intends to complete the program  In other words  it s buying back  345 million in shares this year Analysts Are BullishThere was a lot to like in the fourth quarter report and 2018 outlook The analysts are bullish about both 2018 and 2019 The 2018 Zacks Consensus Estimate jumped to  15 05 from  13 48 after the earnings report  That s earnings growth of 42 1  Similarly  2019 s consensus rose to  17 11 from  15 20  That s further earnings growth of 13 7  Shares at Multi Year HighsShares have been on a tear the last 2 years  rising 277 8  But because the earnings are also rising at a dramatic clip  this stock is still cheap  CF Industries Holdings  Inc is trying to recover from unsustainable low fertilizer prices  This Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  is expected to see positive earnings in 2018 after struggling in 2017 CF Industries was founded in 1946 as a fertilizer brokerage operation  It s now a global leader in the manufacture and distribution of nitrogen products  both for agriculture and industrial customers  It s one of the largest fertilizer producers It operates nitrogen manufacturing plants in Canada  the UK and the US and distributes plant nutrients through a system of terminals  warehouses and transportation equipment in the Midwestern part of the United States CF Industries also owns a 50  interest in an ammonia facility in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago A Big Beat in the Third QuarterCF Industries has been battling low fertilizer prices the last few years  That appears to be abating On Nov 1  it announced its third quarter results and  for the second quarter in a row  beat the Zacks Consensus It reported a loss of  0 39 versus the consensus of a loss of  0 55 Sales rose to  870 million from  680 million in the year ago period as higher sales volumes more than offset the lower average selling prices across most of its segments The lower prices still reflected the increased global nitrogen supply The company s average selling price for ammonia was  235 per ton in the third quarter of 2017 compared to  287 per ton in the year ago quarter  The average selling price for urea was  195 per ton compared to  203 per ton in the third quarter of 2016 Additionally  the average selling price for UAN was also lower  at  144 per ton  in the third quarter of 2017 compared to  157 in the third quarter of 2016 Price Outlook to Remain Volatile in 2018In the third quarter of 2017  there was a rapid rise in the global price of urea from the unsustainable lows of the second quarter of the year Urea barge prices at New Orleans rose to  245 per ton at the end of the quarter from  160 per ton at the beginning thanks to significantly lower Chinese exports  higher energy and production coasts in parts of the world  a weaker US dollar and strong global demand Brazil continued to be a major purchaser of nitrogen with imports through the month of August up 50  year over year  India was also a big buyer 2017 Estimates Still on the DeclineThe analysts are still pessimistic about 2017  1 estimate has been lowered in the last 30 days CF Industries is expected to see a loss of  0 34 in 2017 compared to a gain of  0 47 in 2016

Commentary
The S P 500  via SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY   joined the NASDAQ Composite and the PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1  NASDAQ QQQ  by closing above its 50 day moving average  DMA   The move was not nearly as dramatic as the previous day s tech bumrush  but it is still significant as the stock market continues to heal from the recent oversold episodes 
The S P 500 did not achieve the milestone easily  after the index gapped up  sellers stepped in with just enough force to fill the gap and dip the index into negative territory  I decided to sell my SPY call options after buyers first failed to push SPY over the 50DMA hump  Buyers smelled the opportunity when SPY went read and led the charge to close the index above its 50DMA with a 1 2  gain

The volatility index  the VIX  on the other hand did not follow through on the previous day s deep pullback  The VIX ended the day near flat after ranging between 17 60 and 20 66  After watching this back and forth  I decided to lock in my profits on my short iPath S P 500 VIX ST Futures ETN  NYSE VXX  position in the after hours  I am primed to fade the next VIX rally   For more details see  Periods of Extremely Low Volatility Remain Bullish   Now With Fresh Footnotes

131863,353378,ALGN,CVS Aetna Deal  What s Hot  What s Not,opinion,"CVS Health Corporation s   NYSE CVS   historic decision to acquire health insurance giant Aetna   NYSE AET   has created quite a buzz in the entire healthcare space  Most economists consider this coming together of two stalwarts   consolidation of CVS Health s pharmacy benefit management   PBM   business with Aetna s large and unshakable insurance base   as a new dimension added to healthcare landscape  However  critics are of the view that the gains from this combined entity will be short lived for the healthcare society at large to benefit from Vision in Favor of the DealPeople supporting this proposed integration between CVS Health and Aetna opine that this merger has fair chances to pass the regulatory hurdles  They see this consolidation as a vertical integration instead of a horizontal one  thus leading to efficiency gain and a formidable cost cutting strategy of CVS Health s PBM platform  Notably  a horizontal integration dreads the chances of forming a monopoly powerhouse in the market An article by Dana Blankenhorn published in InvestorPlace stated that based on this  69 billion deal  insurers will finally achieve the vertical integration they need to control costs  Per the article  the Humana   NYSE HUM   acquisition deal proposed by Aetna was earlier rejected by the Obama administration because of its horizontal acquisition The economists lapping up the deal are looking much forward to this development as they think this vertical integration might finally put the brakes on America s soaring health care costs  Notably  total medical cost has inflated in the 6 7  range over the last four years based on the increasing bills of doctors  hospitals  medical devices and drugs  data published in The Economist article  Blankenhorn in his article stated that to counter this problem  the CVC Aetna deal will enable insurers to buy pharmacies to fight high drug prices through formularies and the lists of medicines that will be prescribed for various conditions  Using generics in formularies or choosing from branded drugs wherein generics aren t available is a method to keep drug prices in check The OppositionThose opposing the buyout comment that despite the two companies trying to strengthen their footprint in health care  both may finally end up paying severely for the merger  Akin to the supporters of the deal  the contrary view underscores the cost control agenda highlighting that the consolidation will apparently push the United States  third largest insurer Aetna s huge client base into CVS drugstores to get their prescriptions filled through CVS  drug plans  This move will in turn eliminate the middlemen s role and other intermediaries in queue  finally resulting in reduction of drug price and overall healthcare cost However  the critics believe this to be a short lived scenario and in the longer term  patients could end up incurring more medical expenses  Per a recent Vox report  this is because mergers like this will gradually make it more difficult for the new insurers to enter the market since they won t be able to negotiate lower drug prices like larger firms  This will in fact diminish competition in the sector leading to inflating prices

131883,353398,ALGN,5 MedTech Stocks To Beat Tax Hazards With Positive Returns,opinion,The latest  1 5 trillion tax reform plan has been a landmark achievement for President Trump  As usual  in its initial stage  the nation gave mixed reactions on the controversial bill  While a few Americans slammed the new plan as a  job killer   others found it to be  an excellent opportunity to fix a broken tax code  While the bill claims to primarily focus on the easing of tax woes for middle class Americans  the massive cut in corporate taxes tells a different story altogether  In fact  a research report by CNBC reveals that Frank Clemente  executive director of Americans for Tax Fairness  slammed the new tax code as a  a big giveaway to millionaires and corporations   neglecting the ones who are in real need of it Now  it is to be seen whether the bill is fated to meet an overall failure or it gets to fulfill its promises of  inclusive economic growth  What s in it for MedTech  They are cutting taxes on the wealthy and taking health care away from millions     Senate Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer Customer Base to ShrinkWhile the reduction in corporate taxes will encourage the development of expensive cutting edge MedTech products  the question over its profitability looms large  This is because with a higher number of uninsured and lesser deductions on healthcare costs  the industry is likely to witness a shrinking customer base  indicating a decline in demand for expensive medical procedures and devices Tax Decision on MedTech Devices ImpendingThe MedTech community has been hopeful since Trump proposed policies that entailed the abolition of the infamous 2 3  medical device sales tax  Such high taxes forced companies to lay off employees  limit research and development activities  and reduce capital investment Furthermore  AdvaMed  a leading American medical device trade association  had referred to the medical device tax as a  significant drag on medical innovation   Notably  small device companies suffered the most  Amid such worries  a repeal of the tax paradigm is expected to resume an aggressive pace of hiring and investment among the 9 000 America based medical device manufacturers  instilling investor confidence in the stocks Per data provided by the medical device trade group  in a Ken Blackwell article published by The Daily Caller   the partial two year repeal of the MedTech tax had resulted in a roughly 83  rise in research and development  R D  investments by MedTech players  The comeback of the tax in 2018 will lead to a  15 billion rise in taxes  largely discouraging R D activities  Undoubtedly  the future of the U S  MedTech industry depends on the Republicans  decision on the 2 3  medical device tax Key PicksPer Trump  the democrats have established a  lousy healthcare  model  However  with a complete medical device tax renovation  it is being widely believed that a new set of streamlined rules will benefit the medical device space Meanwhile  stocks with strong fundamentals will give you assured returns amid this tax conundrum  We have zeroed in on five stocks that sport a Zacks Rank  1  Strong

131915,353430,ALGN,Medtronic Stock Dips On Preliminary Sales Drag  CRHF To Grow,opinion,"On Nov 17  2017  we issued an updated research report on medical device major  Medtronic plc   NYSE MDT    The stock carries a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  
As we wait for the company to release second quarter fiscal 2018 earnings results on Nov 21 2017  the market depicts a bearish picture per the latest preliminary sales update by Medtronic 
Over the past three months  shares of the company have significantly underperformed the broader   The stock has declined 5  versus the broader industry s gain of 4 5  

Per the preliminary results  worldwide revenues for the quarter are expected to dip 4  year over year to  7 05 billion  This dull revenue estimate for the quarter to be reported is mainly due to the company s divestiture of its Patient Care  Deep Vein Thrombosis  Compression  and Nutritional Insufficiency businesses to Cardinal Health  NYSE CAH  at the beginning of the quarter 
Also  per the preliminary report  the impact from Hurricane Maria was approximately  55  65 million on the company s second quarter top line  Besides  the hurricane left an adverse impact of roughly 3 cents on its second quarter non GAAP earnings per share  EPS  
However  despite this year over year drag in preliminary sales  it is encouraging to note that the latest projection is actually an improvement from the company s earlier anticipation of Maria s impact on its financial standing  provided a month back  That time  Medtronic had projected both fiscal second quarter 2018 revenues and adjusted net earnings to the extent of  250 million 
Also we believe that the aforementioned divestitures align with the company s disciplined portfolio management strategy  Per the company  the above businesses do not fall under Medtronic s core product line and hence remain deprived of the required investment and focus at present 
Divestment of these non core non profitable businesses will help Medtronic focus more on core products  This in turn will also enable the company to invest in long term  high return  internal and external opportunities that are more directly aligned with the company s growth strategies of therapy innovation  globalization and economic value 
The stabilizing trend in the global Cardiac Rhythm   Heart Failure  CRHF  market is another upside  We are optimistic about this solid growth trend continuing in the United States as well as the healthy global acceptance of its advanced therapies

Genomic Health has been trading below the broader industry over the past three months  The stock has lost 2 7   wider than the broader industry s 1 8  decline 
Revenues in the third quarter of 2017 lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate due to disruption from the hurricanes in certain regions of the United States  estimated to have affected domestic test volumes by approximately 3    The company s rising operating losses also continue to be a concern  Its sole reliance on profitability of Breast Oncotype DX test is another challenge to cope with  Above all  management s decision not to issue any guidance has been discouraging too as it failed to provide us with visibility about the company s upcoming performance 

However  we are encouraged by the year over year rise in revenues  driven by solid performances in the United States and internationally  During the third quarter  international test volumes expanded 14   representing 26  of total test volumes in the quarter  While revenues grew around 7  year over year 
So far  Genomic Health has witnessed a healthy progress with regard to establishing coverage for its Oncotype DX breast cancer test  In 2018  Genomic Health expects several key catalysts to drive strong revenue growth  These catalysts include the anticipated implementation of both PAMA  Protecting Access to Medicare Act  reimbursement at a higher level than the 2016 invasive breast rate and AJCC  American Joint Committee on Cancer  staging criteria that will become effective in January 2018

metric to determine the bottom line performance of a company Net Income RatioNet income ratio gives us the exact profitability level of a company  It reflects the percentage of net income to total

132015,353530,ALGN, 200 Club Bullish Stampede ,opinion,"On August 10  I made a video to share with the public about a circle of stocks I owned in my Zacks portfolios that I felt were all in a race to  200 

Here were their approximate closing prices on that day  rounded up to nearest dollar  
Alibaba   NYSE BABA     152
Facebook   NASDAQ FB     168
Lam Research   NASDAQ LRCX     150
Align Technology   NASDAQ ALGN     172
In the video that accompanies this article  I show fresh charts two months later of the ups and downs since that day 
Clearly  most of these  high flyers  were still great buys in August  Except Facebook which may have some trouble on its hands as it deals with  adjustments  in its advertising policing in the wake of the  fake news  epidemic 
But I still recommend that long term investors own and accumulate FB under  170 
I also reveal a big mistake I made selling one memberof the  200 Club 
Thankfully  I screwed my shrewd trader investor head back on and bought NVIDIA   NASDAQ NVDA   near  175 right before it made its run for all time highs above  190 
So now we have ALGN and NVDA leading the charge to  200  with BABA and LRCX running neck and neck near  184 
In the video  I also take a look at the over bought Philadelphia Semiconductor Index chart and what opportunity that might spell for us 
By the way  if you are interested in the mental game of trading and the irrational  self sabotage we all deal with as active investors  you might enjoy my podcast tribute to the latest Nobel prize in economic sciences winner  Richard Thaler 
We can t expect to be  perfect  as traders and investors  and knowing what trips us up  and what lifts us up  is key to top performance 
Thaler probably doesn t know much about active trading  but his and Daniel Kahneman s life long battles to bring psychology into economics   and thus give birth to behavioral economics   have helped my daily battles immensely  Here s that link

On a reported basis  the quarter s EPS came in at 68 cents  up 21 4  year over year 
Revenues in Detail
STERIS generated revenues of  608 million  down 4 8  year over year  However  the top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  596 million  The year over year decline was a result of foreign currency fluctuations as well as divested businesses  Organic revenue growth at constant currency was 6  year over year  primarily driven by balanced growth in all segments STERIS PLC Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

   The company operates through four segments  Healthcare Products  Healthcare Specialty Services  Applied Sterilization Technologies and Life Sciences 
Revenues from the Healthcare Products segment inched up 2  year over year to  289 1 million in the reported quarter  This was driven by 7  growth in service revenue and a 2  increase in capital equipment revenue  which in turn were partially offset by a 1  dip in Consumables due to divestitures  
Revenues from the Healthcare Specialty Services segment plunged 25 4  to  113 4 million on a reported basis due to divestitures  However  organic revenues grew 11   reflecting growth at IMS North America and CSD outsourcing business in Europe 
On the other hand  revenues from Applied Sterilization Technologies rose 2  to  124 5 million and organic revenue growth was 6   on the back of an increased volume from the segment s core medical device customers 
Lastly  revenues from the Life Sciences segment dropped 1  to  80 9 million in the quarter as 5  growth in Service revenue and 2  increase in consumable revenues were more than offset by a 12  decrease in capital equipment revenues  On an organic basis  revenues nudged up 1  year over year  
Margins
Adjusted gross margin improved 410 basis points  bps  year over year to 42 3  in the reported quarter  This expansion was on account of the positive impact of divested low margin businesses improvements in operational efficiencies  a favorable foreign currency  plus cost synergies and pricing 
STERIS witnessed a 2 6  year over year rise in selling  general and administrative expenses to  155 8 million  Research and development expenses fell 2 8  to  14 million  Adjusted operating margin expanded 265 bps on a year over year basis to 14 2  in the reported quarter 
Financial Details
STERIS exited the first quarter fiscal 2018 with cash and cash equivalents of  294 8 million compared with  282 9 million at the end of fiscal 2017  The company had a long term debt of  1 49 billion at the end of first quarter fiscal 2018 compared with  1 48 billion at the end of fiscal 2017 
The company generated  80 7 million in cash flow from operations in first quarter  up 0 5  from the year ago period  Free cash flow for this period was  44 2 million compared with  49 5 million in the prior year time frame 
2018 Guidance
STERIS continues to expect 4 5  of organic revenue growth on constant currency basis in fiscal 2018 from the prior fiscal year  Adjusted EPS is expected in the range of  3 96  4 09 per share 
Our Take
STERIS posted better than expected first quarter fiscal 2018 with both earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate  However  the year over year decline in revenues is a disappointment  On a positive note  organic growth performance was strong across all the segments  Further  growth in free cash flow reserve is indicative of the company s strong cash balance  Recently  the company has made a couple of organizational changes  expected to better align with its operations

   Quarter in Details 
Pharmacy Services revenues increased 9 5  to  32 3 billion in the reported quarter  driven by growth in the specialty pharmacy volume  higher pharmacy network claim volume as well as brand inflation  This was  however  partially offset by increased generic dispensing and price compression

Front end same store sales were down 2 1  year over year  The shift of the Easter holiday to second quarter 2017 from the first quarter 2016 had a 75 bps positive impact on Front end same store sales  Front store sales were  however  affected by soft customer traffic and efforts to rationalize promotional strategies  which were again partially offset by an increase in basket size 
Pharmacy same store sales also declined 2 8  in the reported quarter  Sales were affected approximately 410 bps due to recent generic drug introductions  Also  Pharmacy same store prescription volumes were flat on a 30 day equivalent basis  This apart  marketplace changes that restricted CVS Pharmacy from participating in certain networks had a 460 bps negative impact on same store prescription volumes

For the third quarter  the company expects to deliver adjusted EPS of  1 47  1 50  This projection takes into consideration the timing of the Medicare Part D operating profit between the third and fourth quarters  relative to the preceding year  The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is pegged at  1 62  way above the company s projection 
Our Take
CVS Health posted better than expected second quarter results with both adjusted EPS and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate  However  poor year over year Retail LTC numbers along with margin debacle resulted in a dull earnings performance by the company in the quarter 
Nonetheless  year over year growth on the top line was due to a strong Pharmacy Services segment  benefiting from the upside in the Specialty Pharmacy  An unimpressive bottom line scenario also prompted the company to narrow its earnings outlook for 2017

    SBU DetailsFor the second quarter  the company reported BioStim sales of  47 1 million  reflecting 5 4   same at CER  growth from the prior year quarter  Favorable NASS coverage recommendation  introduction of advanced spinal fusion therapy products and extensive sales force were the major drivers for the BioStim business Biologics SBU sales in the quarter totaled  15 7 million  up 9 9   same at CER  from the prior year quarter  This was led by strong demand for Trinity Elite due to expanded distributor network  the reacquisition of the national hospital contract along with increased contributions from the national distributor partner Extremity Fixationsales were  24 7 million in the reported quarter  showing a decline of 7 7   6  at CER  from second quarter 2016  However  after excluding planned subsidiary restructuring and the loss of sales due to the divestiture of a non core business in 2016 impacts  the trailing 12 month growth rate of this business was 3 5  at CER Orthofix reported Spine Fixation SBU sales of  21 4 million  reflecting 17 1   same at CER  growth over the prior year quarter  This can be attributed to strong growth in the U S  and the strategic initiatives adoptedMarginsIn the second quarter  gross margin expanded 30 basis points  bps  to 78 7   Solid top line growth can be a major factor that might have contributed to the improved gross margin Sales and marketing expenses rose 9 6  year over year to  50 5 millionowing to increased sales mix from newly added distributors in Biologics and elevated spending in Extremity Fixation to accelerate sales growth in the U S  General and Administrative expenses were up 10 1  to  20 4 million led by increased investments to implement the strategic initiatives designed by the company  legal settlements and stock based compensation  The company also witnessed a 1 3  rise in research and development expenses to  6 8 million  Accordingly  adjusted operating margin in the quarter contracted 250 bps to 7 3  as a result of increased operating expenses Cash PositionOrthofix exited the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  44 3 million  compared with  41 7 million at the end of the first quarter  Year to date net cash provided by operating activities was  9 7 million  compared with  21 4 million in the year ago period Excluding capital expenditure of  8 6 million  free cash flow was  1 1 million in the reported quarter  This compares to capital expenditure of  10 4 million leading to free cash flow of  11 million in the year ago period Updated 2017 GuidanceBanking on a solid second quarter performance Orthofix has raised its full year 2017 sales expectations to  422  425 million from the previous  411  415 million  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full year revenue is pegged at  414 3 million  below the guided range Adjusted EPS expectations have also been raised to  1 54  1 60 from  1 48  1 58  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full year adjusted EPS stands at  1 54  in line with the low end of the company s projected range Our TakeThe company exited the second quarter on a mixed note  with sales beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate and earnings meeting the same  Per management  the top line was substantially driven by strength in Biologics and Spine Fixation businesses which is expected to continueon the back of improved performance by sales partners  expanded distributorship network and introduction of products Moreover  the company seems to be upbeat on the encouraging response received by the Spinal Stim and Cervical Stim bone growth therapy devices launched earlier in 2017  Moreover  the company s CETRA Anterior Cervical Plate has witnessed strong market adoption  resulting in sales of over  1 million in the first five months since the launch Continuing with its slew of product developments and launches  the company recently launched RIVAL  a full line foot and ankle internal fixation system  Also  within its Extremity Fixation space  the company recently launched JuniOrtho  a new brand for orthopedic products  which currently accounts for roughly one third of Extremity Fixation sales  Also  we believe that the raised full year 2017 guidance is indicative of enhanced prospects On the flip side  currency fluctuations  competitive landscape and macroeconomic headwinds continue to pose challenges for the company  Moreover  higher operating expenses are also a matter of concern for Orthofix  Also  the increased dependence on third  party for final distribution of products exposes the

Inogen  Inc Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
    Meanwhile  business to business International sales rose around 13 9  to almost  14 9 million on the back of solid demand from the company s partner s in Europe Direct to consumer  Direct to consumer domestic sales advanced 33 3  to almost  21 9 million However  direct to consumer rental sales fell 32 3  to  6 1 million  This decline can be attributed to decreased rental reimbursement rates and the company s increased strategic focus on sales Margin DetailsIn the reported quarter  Inogen registered a gross margin of 49 2   as a percentage of revenues   up 120 basis points  bps  on a year over year basis Meanwhile  sales gross margin expanded 240 bps in the quarter to 51 8   as a percentage of revenues  Per management  an increase in sales gross margin was driven by lower material costs resulting in decreased cost of goods sold in the quarter Rental gross margin was 25 0  in the reported quarter  much lower than 41 0  in the second quarter of 2016  This was primarily driven by lower net revenue per rental patient led by fallen reimbursement rate  However  this decline in rental gross margin was partially offset by decreased cost of rental revenue particularly led by lower depreciation and servicing costs Adjusted EBITDA rose 5 6  to  14 4 million on a year over year basis GuidanceBanking on solid performance in the second quarter  Inogen raised its 2017 revenue and adjusted net income guidance  Moreover  the company narrowed its full year adjusted EBITDA guidance Inogen projects revenues in the range of  239  243 million  higher than the previous range of  233  239 million  This represents year over year growth of 17 8  19 8   up from the previously provided range of 14 9  17 8   The company expects rental revenue to decline in 2017  courtesy of lower average rental revenue per patient and continued focus on sales Adjusted EBITDA is now projected in the band of  48  50 million  compared to  46  50 projected previously  thereby presenting an increase of 10 6  to 15 2  from 6  15 2  year over year Inogen expects adjusted net income in the range of  25   27 million  up from the previously provided range of  22  24 million  This represents 21 8   31 6  year over year growth compared to the previous range of 7 2  17  Our TakeInogen reported a stellar second quarter of 2017  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both the counts  The company witnessed solid growth in revenues and adjusted earnings on a year over year basis  In our view  solid domestic and international business to business sales has driven the stellar quarterly performance  In fact  the company expects direct to consumer sales to be its fastest growing channel  followed by domestic business to business sales in the coming quarters  with solid focus in Europe  In this context  the company recently signed a lease for its expansion site in Ohio to accelerate growth in domestic direct to consumer sales channel Moreover  during the second quarter  the company took a series of strategic initiatives to strengthen its product offerings and market position  In this regard  the company successfully integrated MedSupport Systems B V  acquired in May 2017 Continuing with the slew of product developments and launches  the company received EC Certificate for its One G4 product in Jun 2017 Per management  the company also effectively launched its new customer relationship management  CRM  system in Jun 2017  This latest development is expected to enhance the productivity across sales  billing  and customer service teams in the long term On the flip side  declining rental revenues raise concern  which might mar the company s prospects  Moreover  since the company generates a significant portion of its revenues from the International market  volatile foreign exchange rate will always continue to pose a concern for the company Zacks Rank   Key PicksInogen currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  A few better ranked medical stocks are

Revenues of  20 07 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  23 million and declined 3 2  on a year over year basis 
Q2 Highlights
Product and Services revenues rose 17  to  20 07 million on a year over year basis 
Gross margin in the second quarter was 39 9  of net revenue versus 41 1  in the year ago quarter  Research   development  R D  expenses totaled  16 9 million  lower than  17 5 million reported in the year ago quarter Pacific Biosciences of California  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

   Selling  general   administrative  SG A  expenses totaled  15 5 million  significantly higher than  11 2 million a year ago 
Balance Sheet
Cash and investments at the end of the second quarter was  102 6 million  compared with  56 1 million at the end of the first quarter of 2017 
Guidance 
Pacific Biosciences reaffirmed its guidance in product and service revenues for full year 2017 at the range of 35 45  
The company also expects gross margin growth assuming that revenues will increase as anticipated  Overall  the company expects gross margin percentage to reach the mid 40  by the end of the year 
Our Take
Pacific Biosciences exited the second quarter of 2017 on a disappointing note with loss wider than estimated and revenues missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Also  the gap in the loss widened than the year ago quarter with revenue decreasing from the same  Poor margin also adds to the woes 
However  we are encouraged by the new agreement inked in August between Pacific Biosciences of California and Novogene Corp  Novogene will purchase 10 Sequel Systems  giving the DNA sequencing service provider the capacity to run up to 20 Sequel Systems at a time

2017 Guidance
Abbott Labs raised its full year 2017 guidance  The company forecasts earnings per share from continuing operations to remain within the range of  1 03 to  1 13 from earlier range of 92 cents to  1 02  Adjusting certain net specified items for the full year  the adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations are expected to stay within a band of  2 43  2 53  earlier guidance was  2 40  2 50   The current Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at  2 47  at the midpoint of the projected range 
Our Take
One more time  Abbott Labs successfully exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both earnings and sales front  We are optimistic about the company s strong and consistent EPD and Medical Devices performance  However  these strong performances were to some extent offset by sluggish Nutrition business 
However  the company stands to benefit from the recently completed acquisition of St  Jude Medical  which has already started offering it an industry leading pipeline across cardiovascular  neuromodulation  diabetes and vision care  Looking forward to achieving synergy benefits  the company has raised its 2017 outlook buoying investors  confidence on the stock 
In 2017  the company plans to execute its existing operating model which focuses on selling portfolio in core therapeutic areas  This will lead to the creation of unique channel opportunities in differentiated relationships with physicians  retailers and pharmacies  looking to offer a complete line of solutions to treat prominent local health conditions  Also  Abbott Labs has plans to beef up its development capabilities with an expanded EPD innovation center in India 
However  India s transition to new tax system has significantly hampered growth during the reported quarter  Per the company  if this transitory impact of a new GST could be eliminated  the total EPD sales would have grown in the high single digits in the reported quarter 
Abbott Labs currently carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy

For the past year  Haemonetics has been trading above the Zacks categorized  industry  Over this period  the stock has surged 34 7  compared with the broader industry s 10 4  

We are particularly encouraged by the company s consistent growth in both its Plasma segment as well as the Haemonetics Management franchises 
Haemonetics has been witnessing a strong flourish in its Plasma franchise for quite some time now  Management has also maintained high confidence in the continued growth of its commercial plasma collection business 
Of late  management declared that its NextGen plasma collection software has been seeing avid customer interest  Management s 2018 guidance for Plasma revenue growth is 3 5  inclusive of the divestiture of SEBRA bench top and handheld sealers  representing 1 4  of annual Plasma revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017

In the U S   TEG 6s is to be used for cardiovascular surgery and the company is presently pursuing a broader set of indications  beginning with trauma 
On the flip side  the company has been witnessing sluggish revenue growth at the Blood Center franchise  This has significantly affected Haemonetics  results over the past few quarters  Management also doesn t expect any early recovery in the Blood Center s outcomes 
Macroeconomic uncertainty continues to pose a challenge for Haemonetics  Management also anticipates slower than expected product adoption by customers to reduce revenues and profits  Also  currency fluctuations and a stiff competition continue to hamper the stock

Notably  at the European League Against Rheumatism  EULAR  meeting held last month in Spain  Crescendo Bioscience  a wholly owned subsidiary of Myriad Genetics  released new data from a meta analysis of clinical studies  The data has demonstrated the Vectra DA test s ability to predict a joint damage 
The same month  the company had also announced that its BRACAnalysis CDx companion diagnostic test has successfully identified those BRCA mutated patients with HER2  metastatic breast cancer in the OlympiAD trial  who have responded to treatment with olaparib better than standard chemotherapy 
All these remain in line with the company s strategy to diversify revenues by commercializing and upgrading its new and existing products  Per this strategy  Myriad is engaged in raising revenues by commercializing its advanced products including Vectra DA  Prolaris  myPath Melanoma  Myriad s Companion Diagnostics  EndoPredict and myPlan Lung Cancer Test  Management expects each of these products to generate revenues of more than  50 million for the company by fiscal 2020 
Myriad s collaborations with AstraZeneca and BeiGene for development of companion diagnostics also raise optimism  Importantly  AstraZeneca has recently formed a partnership with Myriad to use its newest companion diagnostic  myChoice HRD Plus  to help prospectively identify patients for enrollment in an upcoming exploratory study involving olaparib 
On the other hand  during the third quarter of 2017  Myriad entered into companion diagnostic development collaboration with BeiGene  a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing molecularly targeted and immuno oncology drugs for treatment of cancer to accelerate precision medicine in oncology 
On the flip side  an unfavorable currency translation continues to be a major spoiler for the stock  Management fears that during the event of dollar s further strengthening against foreign currencies might lead to Myriad s deteriorating operating results which may not be overcome through increased revenues 
Intensifying competition as well as the possibility that Myriad s new test might not generate meaningful profits to outweigh the costs associated with their developments  continue to pose threats to the stock

132332,353847,ALGN,Boston Scientific Rides On New Growth Plans Amid Headwinds,opinion,On Jun 29  2017  we issued an updated research report on leading medical devices company  Boston Scientific Corporation   NYSE BSX   Boston Scientific s shares rallied 12 59  in the past three months  considerably ahead of the Zacks categorized  industry s 9 58  increase The company s recent entanglement with several issues has reduced its share price  While an adverse foreign exchange continued to pose challenges  the market acted extremely bearish on the company s recent recall of one of its prime products   Lotus range of heart devices from Europe   because of technical malfunctions However  the market holds optimism on the stock  following the company s recent release of an outline on sustained growth strategy  This strategy focuses on planned expansion in new markets and strengthening of product lines across all business segments  The company particularly plans to launch new products into high growth adjacent markets that may possibly reap an incremental  13 billion in market opportunity by 2020  This apart  plans to diversify its portfolio  shifting from low growth markets to moderate and high growth markets is in the cards  Per Boston Scientific  a solid execution of this strategy will help the company reach  50 billion worth global medical device markets by 2020 from  40 billion today Notably  a strong top line performance in the last reported first quarter 2017 was backed by balanced growth across all geographies and segments  This improved quarterly performance was already a result of a perfect execution of the company s existing long term strategic plans including portfolio expansion  globalization efforts and investments into fast growth markets Boston Scientific s inorganic means to strengthen its core businesses  plus investments in new technologies and global markets buoy optimism  In addition  the company s acquisition of a number of approvals for its products  both in domestic as well as foriegn markets is indeed encouraging Among recent developments  worth mentioning is the company s buyout of Switzerland based Symetis SA  in a bid to fortify its structural heart business in Europe  Besides  NICE s  National Institute for Health and Care Excellence  recommendation of Boston Scientific s cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillators  CRT D  with EnduraLife Battery Technology for treating patients with heart failure was important The company s newly implemented global restructuring plan also looks bright and needs some attention to be paid to  It has already chalked out several key activities under this program including strengthening its global infrastructure through evolving global real estate and workplaces  developing global commercial and technical competencies  enhancing manufacturing and distribution expertise in certain regions  plus continuing implementation of the plant network optimization  PNO  strategy The above activities are scheduled to be complete by 2018 end  Garnering benefits  the company expects the program to reduce gross annual pre tax operating expenses by approximately  115  150 million by end of 2020 Boston Scientific also hopes to reinvest a portion of the program s savings in strategic growth initiatives With the Lotus Valves being yanked off from the European market  we see very little hope for the company to resolve this issue and return the product to the market any time before fourth quarter  This may lead to a major setback for the company s fast growing

132347,353862,ALGN,Will Walgreens Gain From Revised Rite Aid Agreement ,opinion,"Over the past few months pharmacy led  health and well being enterprise giant Walgreens Boots Alliance   NASDAQ WBA   was caught in speculation over resolving the regulatory hurdle to acquire the U S  retail pharmacy chain Rite Aid  However  looking at FTC s  Federal Trade Commission  approach on the merger deal over the last couple of months  we see that this particular move might end on an unhappy note 
Investors are still in shock about Walgreens  shelving of the  17 billion acquisition deal last week  which had once promised a strong platform for developing the companys  brand presence as well as its overall future business growth  However  we believe that there is much hope on the company s revised agreement with Rite Aid 
Delving into the latest deal s details  it is understood that the new agreement would enable Walgreens to buy nearly half of the Rite Aid business at a deal value  almost one third of the original price 
More specifically  Walgreens will purchase nearly 2 186 stores  three distribution centers and a related inventory from Rite Aid for  5 175 billion in cash  Notably  Rite Aid ran about 4 523 stores across 31 states and the District of Columbia as of Jun 3  2017 
This apart  the deal s financial outcome is pretty attractive  Post the new transaction s initial closing  Walgreens expects it to be modestly accretive to its adjusted diluted net earnings per share in the first full year  Synergies from this new takeover are expected in excess of  400 million  to be entirely realized within three to four years of its initial closing   
Per Walgreens  this modified merger contract will also extend its growth strategy and offer additional operational plus financial benefits  It will help the company expand and optimize its retail pharmacy network in the key U S markets  including the Northeast  This partial consolidation with Rite Aid will help Walgreens gain a competitive edge 
Price Performance

The fueling rumor of FTC s  preparing  to block the huge  17 billion Walgreens Rite Aid merger deal has taken quite a toll on Walgreens  stock price over the  past three months 
The stock has lost 4 5   wider than the 1 6  decline of the broader  industry during this period  The market pessimism continues to persist despite announcement of the deal s modified version  However  we believe that this is a momentary phase and expect investors to soon realize the  healthier  part of the improved agreement only to help the stock to rebound

132409,353924,ALGN,Walgreens  WBA  To Report Q3 Earnings  What s In Store ,opinion,Walgreens Boots Alliance  Inc    NASDAQ WBA   is slated to release third quarter fiscal 2017 results before the market opens on Jun 29 Last quarter  the company s earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate  In three of the last four quarters  Walgreens Boots  earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate  leading to an average beat of 3 13   Let s see how things pan out prior to this announcement Factors at PlayWalgreens Boots Alliance  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise   While Walgreens is currently holding its breath and waiting for the Federal Trade Commission  FTC  to declare its final verdict on long pending acquisition of Rite Aid  the market fails to show much optimism as of now  Notably  the world s first pharmacy led  health and wellbeing enterprise witnesses a continuous regulatory hassle with regard to the impending mega acquisition of the U S  retail pharmacy chain   Rite Aid In fact  a Seeking Alpha article estimates the FTC verdict to release the same day as Walgreen s quarterly performance announcement by stating   A report is out that acting chief of the Bureau of Competition Tad Lipsky will recommend a lawsuit to block the merger   If this takes place in reality  the stock price will no doubt sink even if the company manages to post a solid quarterly show Meanwhile  let us sneak a peek into what Walgreens  quarterly earnings have in store for us  Per the last reported quarter  Walgreens Boots  Retail Pharmacy USA division has seen the highest comparable prescription growth in over seven years now Looking ahead  with several recently planned developments as well as the early benefits of new pharmacy contracts which already seem to come through  we expect to view similar growth momentum in third quarter as well However  the sales performance of Retail Pharmacy international division was poor in the last reported quarter  The result was significantly marred in the U K  due to reduction in government pharmacy funding  In absence of any near term catalyst  we expect the scenario to remain harsh and challenging in the upcoming quarter too We also make a note that slowdown in generic introduction has been affecting the Walgreens Boots  margins  Of late  an increased reimbursement pressure as well as a generic drug cost inflation have been hampering the company s margin on a significant level  In the second quarter of 2017 too  Walgreens Boots  gross margin figures contracted in line with the management s expectation on account of current reimbursement pressures and the branded drug price inflation Besides  management continues to witness lower profitability in Boots UK comparable pharmacy s gross profit on the back of lower margins in the U K  Although the company is working tirelessly to increase efficiency and provide high quality  cost effective pharmacy services  the near term outlook is still bleak On the other hand  market growth is expected to be strong in certain emerging markets backed by the timing of price increase Estimate RevisionPlease note that Walgreens Boots has seen two downward revisions over the last 30 days  On the contrary  the magnitude of this trend has inched up 0 8  over the same time frame Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Walgreens Boots is likely to beat earnings this quarter  That is because a stock needs to have both a positive as well as a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  However  that is not the case here  as you will see below Zacks ESP   Walgreens Boots has an Earnings ESP of 0 00   That is because both the Most Accurate estimate as well as the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at  1 31  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks Rank  Walgreens Boots  Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of ESP  However  the company s 0 00  ESP makes a surprise prediction difficult Meanwhile  we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies you may consider as our model shows  they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the upcoming quarter Align Technology  Inc    NASDAQ ALGN   has an Earnings ESP of  2 74  and a Zacks Rank  1  You can see Humana Inc    NYSE HUM   has an Earnings ESP of  2 62  and a Zacks Rank  2 Endocyte  Inc    NASDAQ ECYT   has an Earnings ESP of  12  and a Zacks Rank  2 Sell These Stocks  Now Just released  today s 220 Zacks Rank  5 Strong Sells demand urgent attention  If any are lurking in your portfolio or Watch List  they should be removed immediately  These sinister companies because many appear to be sound investments  However  from 1988 through 2016  stocks from our Strong Sell list have actually

132649,354164,ALGN,Think Like Driehaus And Invest In These Stocks,opinion," Buy high and sell higher  is the basic principle of most momentum strategies  Investors with a high risk appetite seek to invest in potential stocks following this strategy in order to derive explosive returns  However  finding a potential momentum strategy is not always so easy  For those who are lacking enough clues of how to invest in potential momentum stocks  Richard Driehaus    a pioneer of momentum investing   strategy is the way to go  This strategy made Driehaus famous and his name features prominently in the list of the top investment gurus throughout the globe   
The American Association of Individual Investors  AAII  proved that the strategy has the potential to offer high returns  AAII s portfolio  which was developed following the strategy  returned 13 5  and 18 1  in the five  and 10  year timeframe  respectively  compared with  1 1  and 4 2  returns registered by the S P 500  Thus  investors with a high risk appetite may opt for this strategy to boost their portfolio returns 
A Detailed Look into Driehaus  Strategy
Regarding the strategy  Driehaus once said   I would much rather invest in a stock that s increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that s already in a decline and try to guess when it will turn around   In line with this insight  AAII took into account the percentage 50 day moving average as one of the key criteria before creating a portfolio following Driehaus  philosophy 
It is calculated by dividing the numerator  month end price minus 50 day moving average of month end price  by the 50 day moving average of the month end price  Another momentum indicator   positive relative strength   has also been included in this strategy   A positive percentage 50 day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50 day moving average level  indicating an uptrend 
Moreover  AAII found that Driehaus primarily focused on strong earnings growth rates and impressive earnings projections to pick potential outperformers  Companies with a strong history of beating estimates are also given importance in this strategy  which was made to provide better returns over the long term 
Screening Parameters 
In order to make the strategy more profitable  we have considered only those stocks that have a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  and a momentum score of  A  or  B   Our research shows that stocks with a  of  A  or  B  when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential 
  Zacks Rank equal to  1 Only Strong Buy rated stocks can get through  You can see   
  Last 5 year average EPS growth rates above 2   Strong EPS growth history ensures improving business  
  Trailing 12 month EPS growth higher than 0 and industry median  Higher EPS growth compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks  
  Last four quarter average EPS surprise greater than 5   Positive EPS surprise indicates potential  
  Positive   50 day moving average and relative strength over 4 weeks  High   50 day moving average and relative strength signal uptrend  
  Momentum Score equal to or less than B Favorable momentum score indicates that it is ideal to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success  
These few parameters narrowed down the universe of over 7 700 stocks to only 14 
Here are five of the 14 stocks 
Movado Group  Inc    NYSE MOV   is a designer  manufacturer and distributor of quality watches  Movado Group has a Momentum Score of  A  and an average four quarter positive earnings surprise of 10 5

132650,354165,ALGN,SPY  Keep Looking For Signs Of Lows,opinion," The first and the best victory is to conquer self     Plato
Well that wasn t too fun a day  but not too bad either if you cashed out  as I did 
Unless you are shorting stocks  it s times like these that you should take off and enjoy some life and spend some of the money we ve just made 
Sadly  this is about a month early for my next planned trip on the bike 
I did take a short in Align Technology Inc  NASDAQ ALGN  on Tuesday and I may try a few more 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc  NYSE GS  and several other leaders are saying we need a nice long consolidation now  likely 6 to 8 weeks 
Notice  I say consolidation  not correction or bear market 
Seeing the S P pullback 5  or so and forming a new pattern would be ideal and is very likely as we remain a ways off from the blowoff top in this bull market in my view 

No go for SPDR S P 500  NYSE SPY  falling on heavy volume 
It s all good though 
Let s see where we find support but this may be a nice break in the strong bull market we re in the midst of 
I d look for a spike to the 100 day average at 225 or so as a potential low  but it doesn t matter what I  think  
I ll be watching and looking for signs of lows and that s all I can really do 
See the rest of this letter and get a few potential short positions that may hit ",2017-03-22,Warren Bevan,https://www.investing.com/analysis/sold-it-all-200179722,200179722

132728,354243,ALGN,A New Running Of The Bulls  Zacks July Market Strategy,opinion,"This is an excerpt from John Blank s latest   To access the full PDF   
A New Bull Run 
Summer is peaking  The lousiest start for stocks in a New Year on record has reversed  The S P500 finally broke out of a tight mid 2016 range  The S P500 passed  in mid July  its all time high seen in June 2015 
This index technical is very important to bulls 
The 12 month forward look on earnings growth matters in mid summer  Consensus sees  0 8  in annual S P500 EPS growth for 2016 and a hockey stick  13 4  for 2017  In 2015  the S P500 saw  1 1   In 2014  it saw  4 8  
The U S  Economy Heats Up on Both Tracks
The latest June ISM surveys say it all  The U S  economy has stayed on track 
 1   U S  manufacturers grew in June at the fastest pace in 15 months  signaling a clear if modest uptrend after a bout of extended weakness 
 2   On top of that  economic activity in the non manufacturing sector grew in June for the 77th consecutive month 
 3   If it is my guess  the U K  Brexit event will be a non event for U S  consumers 
 4   However  for firms and banks  Brexit will delay any inward investment into the U K  by U S  and non U S  groups alike 
The optimistic thing that can be noted about the post Brexit situation in the U K  is the government    all of it  previous ones  future ones and the present one    have time to sort this out  As an economist who thinks mightily of the U K  and its long history  I hope they do  They can do this  They can emerge with a positive and forward looking solution for their country 
To summarize the U S  macro situation  a Fed economist duly noted 
   While the average gain of 152 000 jobs per month represents a slowdown relative to the robust pace of the past few years  it is well above the level needed to support further improvement in overall labor market conditions  estimated to be in the range of 60 000 to 100 000 new jobs per month  
Yes  the U S  remains in expansion  Recent monthly labor market evidence emerged conclusive  The U S  created 287K jobs in June  bouncing back after adding just 11K new jobs in May  June was the biggest job addition this year
