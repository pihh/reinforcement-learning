219616,441132,PFE,Is Pfizer Stock a Buy ,news,"Last Tuesday  pharmaceutical titan Pfizer  NYSE PFE  reported its 2019 fourth quarter earnings  This underwhelming Q4 report    in conjunction with the downturn in the broader markets due to the coronavirus threat    have caused the drugmaker s shares to dip by nearly 7  so far this week 
While Pfizer s year end results were certainly nothing to write home about  it s still fairly rare for a megacap pharma company to fall by high single digits in just a matter of two trading sessions  Should investors take advantage of this profound weakness  or is this hefty sell off justified  Let s break down Pfizer s near term prospects to find out  

Pfizer s transformation might be a buying opportunity
Going forward  Pfizer s biopharma unit will be the foundation of its success or failure  The drugmaker  after all  is slated to spin off its flagging Upjohn generic drug business with Mylan by mid year 
What s on the near term horizon for Pfizer s all important biopharma business  Since announcing the planned merger between Mylan and Upjohn  Pfizer has repeatedly stated that its remaining biopharma unit should post exceptional top line growth in the area of 6  per year  on average  for the next five years  The company s long term revenue forecast is predicated upon the continued success of existing growth products such as Ibrance  Xtandi  Eliquis  Xeljanz  and Vyndaqel  as well as the future commercial success of a suite of next generation products currently under development 
Fleshing out this point  Pfizer stated during its Q4 conference call that the company is on track to make major strides across several key therapeutic areas such as dermatitis  hemophilia  cancer  and vaccines  among many others  over the next year or so  As a direct result  the company revealed that it plans on boosting its already rich dividend program over the course of 2020 and investing in additional business development opportunities to further strengthen its biopharma unit 
In the same breath  management also announced that the company probably won t make any further share repurchases during calendar year 2020  That s a major departure from the company s former policy of beefing up its bottom line through massive share buybacks nearly every quarter 
Verdict
As things stand now  Pfizer arguably already has the assets in place to achieve a respectable 6  compound annual growth rate for its top line over the forecast period    that is  once the Upjohn Mylan merger becomes official later this year  In fact  that s not really a major risk factor  given the company s proven track record as a top notch innovator and commercial powerhouse  Things start to get truly interesting from a value creation standpoint when you consider Pfizer s stated interest in pursing additional mergers and acquisitions  M A  to solidify its core biopharma business 
The obvious problem  though  is that Pfizer has a poor track record when it comes to the M A scene  For example  its  14 billion buyout of Medivation still looks questionable almost four years later  and the drugmaker also paid a rather steep price for cancer specialist Array Biopharma Inc  in 2019  So  there s no guarantee that will be able to readily boost its top line by acquiring late  or commercial stage assets    at least not at an acceptable price tag  And that s probably the main reason investors have largely kept their distance from this top biopharma stock over the past 12 months 
In the final analysis  though  there s still a strong case to be made that Pfizer s stock does indeed deserve a spot in almost any growth or income oriented portfolio  The next stage of the company s life cycle promises to be far more lucrative for investors than the prior decade  Pfizer  after all  finally has a viable growth engine in place thanks to its successful pivot to oncology as a main source of growth  That means management won t have to repeatedly lean on financial engineering tactics    such as massive share buybacks    to impress the market  At some point  the drugmaker s healthy top line growth will shine through ",2020-01-30,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pozzt,2071841
219617,441133,PFE,5 Reasons Pfizer Is Big Pharma s Top Dividend Stock to Buy Right Now,news,"Pfizer  NYSE PFE  recently reported fourth quarter earnings that missed expectations on the top and bottom line  As a result  a jumpy stock market knocked a few percentage points off the stock price 
Despite missing consensus forecasts  Pfizer stock looks like a perfect fit for dividend portfolios  Here are five of the most important reasons to buy this pharma stock on the dip 

1  The price is right
The average stock in the S P 500 trades at 19 3 times forward estimates at the moment  Since announcing fourth quarter earnings  shares of Pfizer have fallen to just 13 7 times the low end of the company s 2020 adjusted earnings forecast  
Right now  the average dividend paying stock in the S P 500 index offers a measly 1 8  dividend yield  Pfizer shares pay out more than double the benchmark average with a 3 9  yield at the moment 
2  A 2 for 1 deal
Around the middle of 2020  Pfizer shareholders will end up owning two very different drugmakers  both of which will continue distributing profits to shareholders  The Pfizer that remains will develop new drugs and sell them until they lose patent protected market exclusivity  
Pfizer s post exclusivity pharmaceutical segment  UpJohn will merge with Mylan  NASDAQ MYL  to form a new company called Viatris  Pfizer shareholders will own 57  of Viatris and receive a significant dividend from the new company  Once the deal completes  Viatris is expected to generate free cash flow at a rate of  4 billion annually and rise from there 

3  Steady Viatris profits
According to Pfizer  dividends from Viatris plus dividends from the Pfizer that remains will fall in line with the amount investors receive from their shares at the moment  Sales of popular brands generally plunge once they have to fight generic competition  but Viatris will have a diverse line of products and geography on its side  The combined entity will market around 3 000 brands and molecules in 165 countries around the globe 
In 2020  Viatris is expected to generate pro forma earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization between  7 5 billion and  8 billion from revenue expected to reach between  19 billion and  20 billion  There s a lot of operational overlap between UpJohn and Mylan  and the pair expect to squeeze out synergies that reach  1 billion annually by 2023  
Of course  Viatris isn t simply expecting growth from synergies alone  Potential new generic versions of popular drugs losing exclusivity could add around  3 billion in annual revenue to Viatris  top line by 2023  
4  Rapid growth from the Pfizer that remains
While Viatris delivers a dividend powered by fairly steady profits  the company that remains could deliver a payout that grows at a hair raising pace for years to come  That s because Pfizer s enormous drug development pipeline is going to get much bigger in the years ahead 
In 2019  Pfizer used  8 9 billion to repurchase shares and spent  8 7 billion on research and development expenses  In 2020  the company will continue spending more than  8 billion on R D  but share repurchases will take a backseat to pint sized acquisitions and licensing of new drug candidates in the middle stages of their development timelines  
This year  Pfizer anticipates sharing proof of concept data from 15 potential new drugs and we should also get to see pivotal data from five key studies  With enough financial firepower to sign a dozen significant deals per year  Pfizer s annual pipeline presentations are going to get much longer in the years to come 

5  No more cliffs
Pfizer and big pharma in general make dividend investors extremely nervous because they ve seen the loss of market exclusivity for one or two key products at a time send total revenue plummeting in the past 
The Pfizer that remains will produce lumpier earnings results than Viatris from one year to the next  but steadier than shareholders experienced over the past decade  Rather than trying to offset losses for huge blockbusters with giant mergers  CEO Albert Bourla is thinking much further ahead by stocking the company s pipeline with promising assets in mid stage clinical testing 
Hold tight with both hands
It may seem hard to believe  but Zoetis  the animal health business Pfizer spun off in 2013  has outperformed its parent by a mile  Investors that have held on since the spinoff have seen their Zoetis shares deliver a 343  total return and their Pfizer shares deliver 68  over the same time frame  
Shares of Pfizer at recent prices would make a great addition to a dividend portfolio but investors will want to hold on tight to shares of both companies they ll end up owning for the long term ",2020-01-31,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/ppfld,2072914
219618,441134,PFE,Pfizer s Biosimilar Ruxience Gets EU Regulatory Backing,news,"The European Medicines Agency s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use  CHMP  on Friday recommended that the European Commission approve Pfizer s  NYSE PFE  drug Ruxience  a biosimilar to MabThera  which to Roche  OTC RHHBY  and Biogen  NASDAQ BIIB  sell in the U S  as Rituxan 
CHMP s positive opinion was based on a clinical trial  dubbed Reflections B3281006  which compared Ruxience to the branded biologic drug MabThera in patients with a specific type of follicular lymphoma  Both drugs produced similar overall response rates 
Biologics are large molecule drugs that are produced using living organisms  as opposed to via chemical processes like conventional  small molecule medications  This difference in how they re manufactured means that while another company may be able to develop a biologic that does essentially the same thing as a previously approved drug  that new version    the biosimilar    will not be not quite the same as the original    thus the  similar  in the name 

While Pfizer is better known for its branded drugs  the pharmaceutical company has jumped on the biosimilar bandwagon  it has already developed four other oncology biosimilars that are available in Europe  The company sold  911 million worth of biosimilar drugs last year  with those revenues split almost equally between the U S  and the rest of the world  Pfizer has also gotten a taste of its own medicine on this front  Sales of its anti inflammatory biologic Enbrel were down 18  in the fourth quarter due to biosimilar competition  When Pfizer hives off its Upjohn generic drug unit later this year  its biosimilars will stay with the branded drug division 
Before Pfizer can start selling Ruxience in the EU  CHMP s positive opinion will need to be finalized by the European Commission  That decision is expected to be handed down in the first half of this year ",2020-01-31,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/ppley,2073421
219620,441136,PFE,Should Investors Buy Pfizer on the Dip ,news,"Pfizer  NYSE PFE  still hasn t recovered from the fall the stock took back in late July  when analysts downgraded the stock after a disappointing earnings result and forecast  affected by the company s decision to exit its Upjohn business  Although the stock has been rallying in the months since then  over the past six months  it s up just 4  and nowhere near the S P 500 s returns of 16  during that time  Pfizer has also been struggling in recent days as it released its fourth quarter results on Jan  28  which didn t inspire much enthusiasm from investors 
However  let s take a look at whether the underperforming stock is likely to rally  or if more red is in its future 
The big concern for investors  growth
There are many question marks surrounding how Pfizer will do post Upjohn  and right now  investors aren t convinced that the company will do well    at least not yet  It disappointed investors in Q4  with sales down from the prior year quarter while earnings missed expectations  However  the company did indicate that it expects the new look Pfizer to achieve operational revenue growth of 8  for 2020 
Over the longer term  spinning off the Upjohn business  which features off patent medicine  could be a way for Pfizer to focus on higher growth products that can generate more revenue for the company  However  it s still unclear how all of that will pan out and just how much additional growth the company will generate  For now  it looks as though investors need some convincing of that given their lack of enthusiasm thus far 

With Pfizer also combining its consumer healthcare business with GlaxoSmithKline  it s difficult for Pfizer investors to gauge just how strong the company will be once all the dust settles from these moves 
Still  what s encouraging is that many of Pfizer s biopharma products saw strong growth in 2019  Ibrance  Eliquis  Vyndaqel  Xtandi  and Xeljanz all generated more than 20  sales growth operationally during the year  contributing a combined  12 7 billion  That s more than one quarter of the company s revenue for the year  which totaled  51 8 billion  With those drugs playing such a big role and already achieving such strong growth  there s reason to be optimistic that Pfizer may not be in as much trouble as its share price suggests 
Dividend is a consolation for impatient investors
For companies that may take a while to achieve longer term growth  a dividend can go a long way in appeasing investors who may otherwise not be willing to wait  Currently  Pfizer pays investors a dividend yield of 4  per year  What s even better is that the company recently raised its quarterly payments from  0 36 to  0 38  Pfizer s strong track record of not just paying dividends but increasing them can give investors an added incentive to buy and hold the stock for multiple years  
The company s dividend payments have more than doubled from 2010 when Pfizer was paying its shareholders  0 18 every quarter 
Is the price right 
Pfizer has a good dividend as well as products that are generating solid growth for the company  The last factor to consider in the decision making process is whether it s well priced  Trading at 13 times earnings and a forward price to earnings ratio of just 12  Pfizer is attractive given that the company hasn t run out of growth options just yet  Its PEG ratio of 1 4 also suggests that given the growth analysts are expecting from the stock  it s not that expensive  
Investors typically discount a stock when there s some risk or uncertainty involved  and that looks to be what s happening with Pfizer 

PFE P E Ratio data by YCharts 
Although the stock has traded at lower multiples in the past  its current price suggests the stock is likely undervalued  especially if it becomes a better growth stock as a result of the Upjohn spinoff  For long term investors who are looking for more than just growth  Pfizer is an excellent option  The healthcare stock could be a great buy for many years ",2020-02-06,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/ps1gl,2078167
219621,441137,PFE,Better Buy  Pfizer vs  AbbVie,news,"Pfizer  NYSE PFE  and AbbVie  NYSE ABBV  are both top notch dividend stocks  At current levels  Pfizer s shares sport a ginormous yield of 3 99   AbbVie  on the other hand  is the home of one of the industry s most generous payouts  with a forward looking annualized yield of 5 11  
Nonetheless  these two elite income stocks have been headed in drastically different directions over the past half year  While AbbVie s shares have produced total returns on capital of 48   when including dividends  over the last six months  Pfizer s stock has generated a far more modest return on capital of only 6  during the same period  
The central issue behind this stark divergence is that Pfizer and AbbVie have taken markedly different approaches toward solving the same problem  namely  the loss of exclusivity for key revenue generators 
Pfizer  for its part  has decided that it needs to slim down by carving out its legacy products business in a planned merger with generic drug giant Mylan  AbbVie  by contrast  intends on bulking up through a merger with Botox maker Allergan  This mega merger is designed to lower the importance of the biotech s top selling anti inflammatory medication Humira  as the drug starts to face biosimilar competition in earnest    

Which of these two blue chip dividend stocks is the better buy as things stand now  Let s check out how Pfizer and AbbVie stack up on several key fronts  
The case for Pfizer
Pfizer s overarching goal is to become a growth oriented biopharma with keen interests in immunology  oncology  rare diseases  and vaccines  By doing so  it expects to post high single digit top line growth for at least the next five years  That kind of revenue growth won t exactly wow anyone on Wall Street  but it is a welcome change from the company s anemic top line growth over the past decade 
Truth be told  Pfizer s previous decade was really all about financial engineering  huge amounts of share buybacks   rather than solid revenue growth spurred by innovative new products  Pfizer s new lineup of growth products  which includes Ibrance  Xtandi  Eliquis  Xeljanz  and Vyndaqel  should be sufficient to effectively close this dark chapter in the company s history  
But there is a major element of the unknown with Pfizer at the moment  It s no secret that the company is gearing up to pursue one or more bolt on acquisitions in order to flesh out its pipeline and product portfolio  The good news is that the biopharma landscape is an especially target rich environment right now  That being said  Pfizer has been one of the worst companies when it comes to creating value from mergers and acquisitions  M As   So there s no telling how the company s next bout of M A will ultimately pan out   
The case for AbbVie
Even though Humira s sales have been rapidly declining overseas  AbbVie s top line has only continued to tick higher in recent quarters  In the fourth quarter of 2019  for instance  the biotech s revenue rose by a solid 5  compared with the same period a year ago  While Humira s U S  sales did play a big part in this healthy year over year rise in revenue  the drugmaker s newer immunology medicines  Rinvoq and Skyrizi  and its blood cancer franchise consisting of Imbruvica and Venclexta loomed large as well  Skyrizi  in particular  absolutely crushed Wall Street s forecast for the three month period  beating the consensus sales estimate by a whopping 51 3   
What s on tap for AbbVie for the remainder of the year  The seminal event will undoubtedly be AbbVie s forthcoming tie up with Allergan  which is set to close before the end of the first quarter of 2020  This transformational deal will immediately benefit AbbVie s top line  diversify its product portfolio  and perhaps result in another sizable increase to the drugmaker s dividend 
Having said that  there s also a good chance that the combined AbbVie Allergan entity will decide to put some of its noncore assets up for sale in the near future  That s not uncommon upon the closing of a biopharma mega merger  but it does add another moving part to an already complex investing thesis    
Which stock is the better buy 
All things considered  AbbVie appears to have a solid leg up on Pfizer  AbbVie sports a stronger near term growth outlook  a richer dividend  and a broader array of high growth products  Pfizer  on the other hand  still needs to round out its pipeline and product portfolios    a process that could take a few years to complete ",2020-02-11,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/ptsah,2081724

219637,441153,PFE,Pfizer s Q4 Results  2020 Guidance Leave Investors Cold,news,"Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer  NYSE PFE  reported fourth quarter results Tuesday that beat expectations for revenue  but missed on the bottom line  That miss  combined with weak profit guidance  helped propel shares lower  The stock was trading down by more than 5  as of 3 p m 
Revenue  which was diminished by the spinoff of its consumer healthcare business in the third quarter  fell 9  to  12 69 billion  but that was better than the analysts  consensus estimate of  12 61 billion  Excluding the impact of the divestiture  revenue grew 2  operationally  Adjusted earnings per share fell 13  to  0 55  compared with analysts  consensus forecast of  0 57 

Pfizer is in the process of spinning off its Upjohn unit  which will be combined with Mylan  NASDAQ MYL  to form a new company to be named Viatris  Mylan s shares were actually up 3  in late afternoon trading 
A large share of the quarter s declines came from the recent arrival on the market of generic competition for Lyrica  a drug that will be part of the spinoff  After multiple generic companies launched their versions  Lyrica sales plummeted 67  in the quarter  But operational revenues increased by 9  for Pfizer s biopharma business  which will be the part of the company that remains after the Upjohn spinoff 
Pfizer s guidance for 2020 was complicated by all the moving pieces  but its earnings forecast for the full company as it exists today was not entirely to the market s liking  Management expects earnings per share to land in the  2 82 to  2 92 range  the midpoint of which was below analyst s consensus expectation of  2 90 
Investors may also have been disappointed by the revenues from two of the company s blockbuster biopharma drugs  Ibrance  sales of which were flat from Q3 despite 25  growth year over year  and Xeljanz  which had a sequential sales gain of only about 1   Management expressed confidence that sales of those two drugs would return to growth  and was optimistic about the pipeline developments it expects this year ",2020-01-28,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/po1f7,2069794
219638,441154,PFE,Why Pfizer s Shares Sank Today,news,"What happened
Shares of Pfizer  NYSE PFE  were sinking by 5 4  as of 3 05 p m  EST on Tuesday after the big drugmaker announced its 2019 fourth quarter and full year earnings results before the market open  Pfizer reported Q4 revenue of  12 7 billion  down 9  year over year  The company s adjusted earnings also dropped to  3 1 billion  or  0 55 per share  from  3 75 billion  or  0 63 per share  in the prior year period 
Pfizer also provided full year 2020 guidance  projecting revenue between  48 5 billion and  50 5 billion with adjusted diluted earnings per share between  2 82 and  2 92  Both ranges were below consensus Wall Street estimates 

So what
Investors were understandably disappointed with the Q4 update  especially with the company s guidance  However  the big picture arguably looks better than in recent years 
Pfizer s main problem right now is the declining sales for blockbuster nerve pain drug Lyrica in the face of new generic competition  Lyrica is part of the company s Upjohn unit  which Pfizer plans to spin off and merge with Mylan into a new company  
While this move isn t a perfect solution  it will enable the  new  Pfizer to achieve much stronger growth than the company has been delivering  Pfizer projects that sales for the company remaining after the spinoff of Upjohn will increase by 8  year over year in 2020 
Now what
The smartest thing for investors to do with pharmaceutical stocks is to focus on the prospects of their current drugs and pipeline candidates instead of the performance from one quarter  After the Upjohn Mylan transaction is complete  Pfizer will have multiple growth drivers  notably including Eliquis  Ibrance  Vyndaqel  and Xeljanz  without any major anchors weighing it down  as is the case now with Lyrica 
In addition  Pfizer s pipeline includes plenty of promising candidates  Keep your eyes especially on the company s 20 valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine PF 06482077  Pfizer plans to report results from three phase 3 clinical studies for the vaccine in the first half of this year ",2020-01-28,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/po1f5,2069793

Prepared Remarks 
OperatorGood day  everyone  and welcome to Pfizer s Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call  Today s call is being recorded  At this time  I would like to turn the call over to Mr  Chuck Triano  Senior Vice President of Investor Relations  Please go ahead  sir Chuck Triano    Senior Vice President  Investor RelationsGood morning  and thank you for joining us today to review Pfizer s fourth quarter and full year 2019 performance and 2020 financial guidance I m joined today by our CEO and Chairman  Albert Bourla  Frank D Amelio  our CFO  Mikael Dolsten  President of Worldwide Research and Development  Angela Hwang  Group President  Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals Group  John Young  our Chief Business Officer  and Doug Lankler  General Counsel The slides that will be presented on this call were posted to our website earlier this morning and are available at   You will see here that slide 3 covers our legal disclosures Albert and Frank will now make prepared remarks and then we will move to a question and answer session With that  I will now turn the call over to Albert Bourla  Albert Albert Bourla    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Chuck  and good morning  everyone This morning I will speak about our performance for the year  the continued advancement of our pipeline and the steps we are taking to position Pfizer for accelerated growth following the expected separation of Upjohn from Pfizer later this year  Frank will then provide details regarding our fourth quarter performance and our 2020 financial guidance 2019 was a productive and transformational year for Pfizer  We generated solid full year financial results  These results were highlighted by exceptional 8  operational revenue growth for the year and 9  in the fourth quarter for our Biopharma business  which will become the new Pfizer  following the expected separation of Upjohn Once again  our Biopharmaceutical Group s outstanding growth was driven primarily by the continued strong performance from all our key growth drivers  This include Ibrance  Xtandi  Eliquis  Xeljanz  Vyndaqel  among others  Biopharma also generated 14  operational growth in emerging markets in 2019  I would point out that Biopharma s 2019 growth came from volume increases  not pricing  In fact  pricing had a negative 2  impact in Biopharma s results For full year 2019  global Ibrance revenues increased 23  operationally to become a nearly  5 billion a year product  In the US  Ibrance realized robust growth and retained its strong leadership position in the syndicate class with a nearly 90  surge  Ibrance performance outside of the US was also very strong and we still see significant opportunities in countries where the use of CDK inhibitors has not yet reached the levels seen in the US  Overall  Ibrance is approved in more than 90 countries  It s the number one prescribed CDK4 6 inhibitor globally and has reached more than 250 000 patients For Xtandi  alliance revenues in the US were up 20  for the full year and when combined with our royalty income on ex US sales  totaled nearly  1 2 billion in 2019  Xtandi is the leading branded novel hormone therapy in an increasingly competitive but growing class  with 37  market share in total prescriptions  Their vast year over year growth was due to continued uptake of the non metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer indication as well as prescriber confidence and the recognition of Xtandi s strong data across CRPC  With the recent launch of our Xtandi indication in metastatic castration  sensitive prostate cancer in the US  Xtandi is now the first and only oral treatment approved by the FDA in three distinct types of prostate cancer Eliquis continued to perform well  Pfizer s sale in the global revenues was up 26  operationally to  4 2 billion  This growth was driven primarily by continued increased adoption in non valvular atrial fibrillation as well as oral anticoagulant market share gains  Eliquis is now the oral anticoagulant leader in 12 markets across the globe Xeljanz had a strong performance  with global revenues increasing 29  operationally to  2 2 billion  We are very pleased with the continued positive uptake across all indications  rheumatoid arthritis  psoriatic arthritis and ulcerative colitis  and we continue to launch psoriatic arthritis and ulcerative colitis into new markets Looking at our rare disease business  Vyndaqel continues to ramp up nicely in the US  following the May 2019 approval and launch for the treatment of ATTR cardiomyopathy  Overall  this first of its kind medicine contributed  473 million in revenue in 2019  Our disease awareness efforts helped drive the diagnosis rates to 9  by the end of the fourth quarter compared with 1  prior to launch  As such  at the end of 2019 more than 9 000 patients have been diagnosed  more than 5 500 patients had received a prescription for Vyndaqel and more than 3 000 patients had received the drug  These numbers do not include approximately 100 patients who are still in the early access program Global Prevenar 13 revenues were up 3  operationally to  5 8 billion  The US CDC also published its updated recommendation for immunocompetent adults aged 65 and older to shared  Phonetic  clinical decision making in the November morbidity and mortality weekly report  highlighting that a patient can serve a decision to vaccinate with PCV13 with a physician  physician s assistant  nurse practitioner or pharmacist Looking at our sterile injectables portfolio  our focus on manufacturing recovery is taking shape and beginning to have a positive impact on the top line in the US  We have made solid progress with remediation and modernization and expect continued improvement throughout 2020  Of note  while global revenue from our sterile injectables portfolio declined 1  operationally for the full year  it increased 5  operationally during the fourth quarter  Additionally  more than 80  of our injectables portfolio is in stock today and we anticipate this percentage will continue to increase in 2020 Our global biosimilars portfolio grew 22  operationally to  911 million for the full year  This was driven largely by 70  growth in the US  thanks to the launch of Retacrit and a gradual uptake of Inflectra  The growth in the US was partially offset by decline in international markets  driven mainly by Inflectra  We expect an additional contribution from biosimilars in 2020 with the launch of free oncology monoclonal antibody biosimilars  Last week  we announced the launches of Zirabev and Ruxience in the US market and next month we expect to launch Trazimera  All three products will be available at a substantially discounted price compared with their originator products Full year revenues for our Upjohn business were down 16  operationally to  10 2 billion  The key headwind during the year was the advent of generic competition on Lyrica in the US  which was partially offset by 7  operational growth in China  The growth in China was driven primarily by Viagra and Celebrex as well as Lipitor in non reimbursed channels  which constitute significant market share in China  We are making good progress with a pre integration planning for Upjohn s proposed combination with Mylan  which remains on track for mid 2020 In December  we announced that former Pfizer Chairman  Ian Read  and current Pfizer Director  James Kilts  will join the Viatris  board of directors upon completion of the transaction  We are also working closely with our counterparts of Mylan on the CFO selection process  We expect to announce the appointments of both the CFO and the third Director by the end of this quarter  We have great confidence in Viatris which will combine Upjohn s strong commercial capabilities and iconic brands with Mylan s terrific pipeline Turning now to R D  We remain very pleased with the progress we are making with our pipeline  We are expecting key clinical results in 2020  several of which have the potential to make this an exciting year for patients hoping for new treatment options  We anticipate sharing data from up to 15 proof of concept readouts with contributions from all our therapeutic areas as well as up to 10 pivotal study starts and five key pivotal study readouts I will now highlight some of those expected events  We continue to expect our two event driven Ibrance early breast cancer programs PENELOPE B and PALLAS to read out in late 2020 and early 2021 respectively  If successful  and following regulatory approval  these programs could double the number of patients eligible to benefit from Ibrance  The Phase 2 open label  single arm ANCHOR CRC study evaluating the efficacy and safety of the combination of Braftovi and Mektovi and cetuximab in patients with previously untreated BRAF V600E mutant metastatic colorectal cancer is currently ongoing  Results from the study will be submitted for presentation at a medical congress in the second half of 2020 For abrocitinib  our investigational JAK1 inhibitor for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis  we look forward to sharing top line findings from the Phase 3 JADE COMPARE trial in the coming months  Pending successful conclusion of the core Phase 3 studies  regulatory submission in the US is projected for the third quarter of 2020  with subsequent markets following later in the year  This study is designed to assess the efficacy and safety of abrocitinib or dupilumab placebo in adults on background medicated topical therapy with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis  The study also has a key secondary endpoint but it is designed to assess the effect on each severity of abrocitinib compared with dupilumab in adults with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis on background topical therapy There are up to five proof of concept readouts expected in 2020 from our industry leading immunokinase pipeline  Our hope is to advance several of these into Phase 3 trials  This include TYK2 JAK1 with potential POC readouts for psoriatic arthritis and for a topical formulation for psoriasis and atopic dermatitis as well as an oral JAK3 TEC for vitiligo and oral TYK2 for psoriasis  This is a great example of our unique strategy to purposefully match a molecule to a disease where we think it has the potential to make the most difference as well as a formulation that we believe has the potential to treat milder forms of disease Our gene therapy platform is advancing with promising Phase 1 2 hemophilia A data  but is expected to support the Phase 3 start this year  This would be our second gene therapy pivotal study following the ongoing hemophilia B Phase 3 study  In addition  our DMD gene therapy program is gathering additional robust patient data  building on the progress we served at the current project muscular dystrophy conference last June  We are preparing for an expected POC in the first half of 2020 and the Phase 3 pivotal study start in second half of this year We look forward to successfully completing the Phase 3 studies for our investigational 20 valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine candidate in adults and remain on track to submit the Biologics License Application to the FDA by the end of this year  Pfizer s candidate represents a potential significant advancement compared with the potential 15 valent  If successful in Phase 3 and approved  the five additional serotypes may provide coverage against approximately 33  more strains that cause invasive pneumococcal disease in adults and 42  more strains causing the disease in infants in the United States For our maternal vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus  RSV  we are preparing for an expected POC in the second quarter of 2020  followed by potentially swift progression to Phase 3 We look forward to sharing more updates on our pipeline during our upcoming Investor Day on March 31 In summary  we finished 2019 with strong momentum and we look forward to continuing that momentum in 2020  During the year we generated a solid financial performance  further advanced our strong R D pipeline and took bold actions to reshape Pfizer into an innovation powerhouse that will build on our legacy of delivering breakthroughs that change patients  lives Now I will turn it over to Frank to provide details on the quarter and our outlook for the remainder of 2020  Frank Frank D Amelio    Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President  Global Supply and Business OperationsThanks  Albert  Good day  everyone Now moving on to the financials Fourth quarter 2019 revenues were  12 7 billion  down 8  operationally versus the year ago quarter  Excluding the impact of the Consumer Healthcare business  revenue was down 1  operationally  Our Biopharmaceuticals Group business revenues were  10 5 billion  up 9  operationally versus the year ago quarter  with strong operational growth in Ibrance  Eliquis  Xeljanz and Vyndaqel and a second straight quarter of operational growth for our hospital business  including our sterile injectables Revenues for our Upjohn business in the fourth quarter decreased 32  operationally to  2 2 billion  with the primary year over year impact again being generic competition for Lyrica in the US that began in July of 2019  Excluding the unfavorable impact of Lyrica in the US and other recent product losses of exclusivity  fourth quarter 2019 revenues for Upjohn declined 6  operationally  I know Upjohn s business in China has been an area of focus  and fourth quarter revenues for Upjohn declined 1  operationally  We saw the expected revenue declines for Lipitor and Norvasc in provinces where the volume based procurement program has been implemented  and these declines were mostly offset by operational growth from products not impacted by the VBP program including Celebrex and Viagra Adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue was favorably impacted by the July completion of the Consumer Healthcare joint venture transaction with GSK  partially offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange and the Lyrica loss of exclusivity In the fourth quarter we recorded a  0 06 loss per share on a GAAP basis  which was primarily due to a  2 6 billion asset impairment charge for Eucrisa and restructuring  purchase accounting and legal charges  Adjusted diluted EPS for the fourth quarter was  0 55 versus  0 63 in the year ago quarter  The decrease was primarily due to lower revenues  again  mainly due to the Lyrica LOE in the US and higher operating expenses I want to point out that diluted weighted average shares outstanding declined by 281 million shares compared to the year ago quarter  reflecting the impact of shares repurchased during 2018 and 2019 and partially offset by dilution related to share based employee compensation programs  Finally  foreign exchange had a negative impact of  158 million or 1  on fourth quarter 2019 revenues and a  0 03 negative impact on adjusted diluted EPS compared to the year ago quarter As you can see on the chart  our 9  operational growth in the Biopharma business was driven by strong performance by Ibrance  Eliquis  Xeljanz  Xtandi  Vyndaqel and Inlyta Moving on to 2019 financial guidance  As you can see on the chart  we met or exceeded all components of our 2019 financial guidance Now I want to highlight how our 2020 guidance compares to 2019 revenue and adjusted diluted EPS  Starting on the left side of the slide  our 2019 results reflect partial year contributions from the Consumer Healthcare business segment which we deconsolidated in the third quarter of 2019  Excluding  2 1 billion in revenues generated from the Consumer Healthcare business segment  total Company 2019 revenues were  49 7 billion and 2019 adjusted diluted EPS is  2 95 For 2020  the adjusted diluted EPS guidance range reflects Pfizer s share of the Consumer Healthcare joint venture s earnings that were generated in fourth quarter 2019 and will be reported in the first quarter 2020 along with Pfizer s share of the JV s anticipated earnings for the first three quarters of 2020  As you can see  the midpoint of our 2020 guidance range for revenues implies comparable performance to 2019 revenues after excluding the partial year contribution from Consumer Healthcare as well as an anticipated  200 million favorable impact from foreign exchange based on mid January 2020 rates compared to last year  Despite an anticipated  2 4 billion in LOE headwinds in 2020  we expect the midpoint of the revenue range to remain flat operationally  excluding Consumer Healthcare Now let s go through the full details of our 2020 financial guidance for total Company  As we ve said  we are expecting the close of the transaction between our Upjohn business and Mylan to be completed in mid 2020  So we are providing three sets of guidance  First  total Company  which reflects our current construct of the Biopharma and Upjohn businesses and excludes any impact from the pending Upjohn combination with Mylan  second  New Pfizer  which is a full year pro forma view that reflects the impact of the pending fee interest transaction by removing Upjohn and including  12 billion in cash proceeds from Upjohn to New Pfizer and other transaction related factors such as transitional service agreement revenue  and third  Upjohn as a stand alone business  All of these scenarios are based on a full year of revenues and expenses in 2020 Beginning with total Company  2020 revenue guidance of  48 5 billion to  50 5 billion reflects anticipated continued strong momentum in our Biopharma business  primarily offset by the continued negative impact of product losses of exclusivity in our Upjohn business  primarily Lyrica in the US Moving on to other elements of our 2020 financial guidance for total Company  compared with 2019 actual results  the midpoints of these ranges imply higher adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenues due to the continued impact from the Lyrica LOE  higher adjusted R D expenses and higher adjusted other income which reflects earnings from the Consumer Healthcare joint venture and lower adjusted SI A expenses and adjusted diluted EPS In 2020  financial guidance for adjusted EPS assumes no new share repurchases and we will focus instead on increasing the dividend and investing in the business during this period of growth  As a result  our guidance for adjusted diluted EPS assumes diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 5 65 billion shares  which is approximately the same as 2019 Moving on to financial guidance for New Pfizer for the full year 2020  we now anticipate full year 2020 revenues between  40 7 billion and  42 3 billion  with the midpoint of the guidance range representing 8  operational growth as compared to 2019 Biopharma revenues  excluding Meridian and Mylan Japan and an improvement from our initial July targets  This guidance range excludes  600 million of contributions from Meridian  a Pfizer subsidiary and manufacturer of EpiPen and other autoinjector products as well as from the strategic collaboration with Mylan in Japan for the development  manufacturing and marketing of generic medicines  Due to an organization realignment  both of these assets have shifted to Upjohn effective at the start of 2020  Both Meridian and Mylan Japan will be reported in Pfizer s Upjohn business beginning in first quarter 2020 We now anticipate full year 2020 adjusted IBT as a percentage of revenue of approximately 37   also an improvement from July  We anticipate the midpoint of the guidance range for adjusted diluted EPS to be  2 30  The operating cash flow guidance range remains approximately  11 billion to  12 billion  This EPS guidance reflects the  12 billion cash that Pfizer will receive upon the close of the combination of Upjohn with Mylan  which will be used to pay down debt during 2020 As you can see  the midpoints for New Pfizer s 2020 revenue and adjusted IBT margin guidance have improved materially since our preliminary 2020 projections were presented in July in conjunction with the announcement of the proposed Mylan and Upjohn combination  We have provided a bridge from our initial July targets to this current guidance on the bottom of the chart for clarity  Upon the close of the Mylan Upjohn combination  and once we become New Pfizer  you can expect the same level of detail in our 2020 guidance that we provided today for total Company Moving on to 2020 financial guidance for Upjohn for the full year 2020  we anticipate revenues of  8 billion to  8 5 billion  reflecting the continued negative impact of losses of exclusivity for products such as Lyrica in the US  which began facing multi source generic competition in July 2019 and the expansion of the volume based procurement program in China and reflecting the inclusion of revenues and expenses associated with Meridian and Mylan Japan We anticipate full year 2020 adjusted EBITDA for the Upjohn business of  3 8 billion to  4 2 billion  Other than the inclusion of revenues and expenses associated with Meridian and Mylan Japan  there are no operational changes to Upjohn s 2020 financial guidance compared with preliminary financial targets provided in July of 2019  Again  we have provided a bridge from our initial July targets to this current guidance at the bottom of the chart Moving on to key takeaways regarding 2019  We delivered a strong fourth quarter with our Biopharma business growing 9  operationally  which represents our go forward business after the pending combination of Upjohn and Mylan  We provided 2020 guidance ranges for total Company  New Pfizer and Upjohn  Importantly  we are projecting strong organic revenue growth for New Pfizer in 2020  We accomplished key product and pipeline milestones since our previous quarterly update  And we returned  16 9 billion to shareholders in 2019 through a combination of dividends and share repurchases Looking ahead  we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2020 and beyond Now I ll turn it back to Chuck Chuck Triano    Senior Vice President  Investor RelationsThanks  Frank and Albert for those remarks  At this time  operator  can we please poll for questions Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions  Your first question comes from Randall Stanicky from RBC Capital Markets Randall Stanicky    RBC Capital Markets    AnalystGreat  Thanks  guys for the questions  I have two  one for Albert and one for Angela  Albert  a couple of weeks ago  you called out  4 5 billion in enabling costs in SI A with an opportunity to simplify  So how do we    how do we think about the cost savings opportunity after you close Upjohn in terms of  number one  how much incremental cost savings do you see beyond what is built into the 37  margin  And then number two  how much of that could hit back half 2020 versus 2021  And then I have a follow up after that for Angela Albert Bourla    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerOkay  I think you should    how can he ask the question to Angela now Chuck Triano    Senior Vice President  Investor RelationsHe can get back Albert Bourla    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerHe can get back  Okay  All right  So  indeed we have this year approximately  14 3 billion of SI A and I will ask Frank to run the numbers in more details  And as I said  for the half approximately is what we call enabling functions  These are functions like finance  legal  HR  facilities  that they are facilitating and enabling the core functions of our business to perform core functions  I mean  R D that is discovering the products  manufacturing  that is making them happen and commercial  that is making them available to the patients We do believe that this  for the half billions  and actually approximately 10 000 people  can be improved  And we have plans to do so  In the current guidance  and I will ask Frank to comment  there is a part  a small part of that  cost opportunity  saving already incorporated  And in 2021 it will be a much bigger part  So  Frank Frank D Amelio    Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President  Global Supply and Business OperationsSo Randall  just let me run the numbers  which is if you look at 2019 actual SI A  for example  we spent about  14 billion as a company  Obviously  that  4 5 billion that Albert alluded to in that  14 billion  If you look at our 2020 guidance for SI A  the range is  12 billion to  13 billion  midpoint  12 5 billion   12 5 billion from  14 billion is a decline of  1 5 billion  Now  roughly half of that is consumer  Because  we went from consolidating Consumer to equity accounting on Consumer once the deal closed in July 31 of 2019 The remaining half is really operational savings across the Company  including part of the    including some of the  4 5 billion that Albert alluded to  And that obviously helped contribute to the IBT as a percentage of revenue improving from 35     from the mid 30s to 37   And then to Albert s point  obviously what we re doing now is working on further improvements that would obviously positively impact the SI A and that was floated upon Chuck Triano    Senior Vice President  Investor RelationsGreat  Thanks  Albert and Frank  Next question  please OperatorYour next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan Chris Schott    JPMorgan    AnalystGreat  thanks very much for the question  Just had three  quick product ones  The first was on Vyndaqel  It seems like a nice step up in all your patient metrics  seems like all those basically doubled or tripled from 3Q  Can you help bridge those figures with the sequential sales ramp we saw which wasn t quite as dramatic The second question was on Ibrance  Just elaboration there in terms of what drove the revised timelines for PALLAS  and have you taken another interim look at the data at this point  And then finally on tanezumab  just an update in terms of what the status and outlook is for that product at this point  Thanks so much Albert Bourla    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerVery good  Thank you very much  I will ask Angela to address the Vyndaqel and tanezumab questions and then I will say a few words about Ibrance and maybe I will ask Mikael to chime in  Please Angela Hwang    Group President  Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals GroupYeah  So  thanks for the question  And certainly  we are pleased with the increased diagnosis  prescription  as well as the numbers of patients that are receiving Vyndaqel  As you said  our diagnosis now is up to about 9   the ability for patients to receive prescriptions up to about 64  of those that are diagnosed and those that are receiving medications are around 35  of those that are diagnosed and every quarter since we ve been reporting this  we ve been seeing some nice increases  So we re certainly pleased with that I think in terms of just the sort of the commensurate alignment with the actual net sales numbers  I think that there are obviously there    every single day this is a dynamic situation and the number and the proportion of patients  whether they are Medicare and commercial lives  those are changing  And so the gross to nets of those are going to affect  I think  what you see on a net sales basis  So I think that  we are watching and really focused on driving diagnosis and ensuring that as many patients can get on these drugs as possible  and we re starting to see some really nice pickup  But I think that is still a very dynamic situation because we re really relatively new in this process  So we ll continue to monitor and should expect to see some quarter to quarter changes in terms of net sales Albert Bourla    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAnd obviously the new patients are contributing disproportionately because they are in fewer months of treatment in terms of sales Angela Hwang    Group President  Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals GroupRight  And then your second question was on tanezumab  So we re really pleased that in December of 2019  we completed our US submission of tanezumab  and we are also pursuing regulatory submissions in the EU and in Japan  This submission was done in close collaboration with the FDA  and it includes the 2 5 milligram in moderate to severe osteoarthritis patients  So  at this moment in time we re awaiting acceptance of this filing  But we see significant potential of tanezumab in osteoarthritis  So we re really excited about this filing  particularly because we re in a time where non opioid solutions are very  very much needed for these patients If you look at the market potential  today  there are about 27 million Americans that suffer from osteoarthritis and 11 million of those have moderate to severe OA  80  of those 11 million people have tried and failed three or more analgesics  So that tells us that there is just a huge amount of unmet need in this patient population  Patients are cycling through a number of pain medications and there just is an incredible need for new options and this is where we think tanezumab can really fill an unmet need  It has the potential to become the first in class non opioid treatment for these patients and we eagerly await the acceptance of this file from the FDA Albert Bourla    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Now let me address the question on Ibrance  The expected completion of the study slipped a little bit    a few weeks  actually  It was at the end of the  19    excuse me  at the end of  20  and now it s moved into the very beginning of  21  The only reason of this is that the events are not coming at the pace that we had forecasted and expected  So  in other means  people are not progressing into their disease  I don t think we can draw any conclusions if that means a good news or bad news  I think it s just facts of the data  We don t know if the people aren t progressing equally in the two arms or they aren t progressing in the treatment arm  That remains to be seen when we unblind the date As regards to your question  if there was an interim analysis  there was not an interim analysis  So we haven t seen an interim analysis  There will be an interim analysis  but we do not expect that    the most likely scenario is that the study will continue when this interim analysis comes  The study was designed to come to full completion  and the criteria that we have set to start for efficacy in the interim study are very  very high  So it s not impossible that this will happen  but most likely scenario  it is that as we had planned that the study will come to completion at the end of it  this is what will happen We are very    we still remain very  very encouraged and optimistic about Ibrance  Of course  it s a Phase 3  You never know what it would be  But all the science behind it is supporting that we could have a positive outcome  And I will ask actually Mikael to make few comments on the science and what does this mean Mikael Dolsten    Chief Scientific Officer and President  Worldwide Research  Development and MedicalI ll just punctuate a few things that Albert described so well  Four aspect of why we are very excited and optimistic about the science and clinical data to predict a potential positive outcome for the discussed PALLAS study  As you know  first of all that the CDK4 6 inhibitor Ibrance converge with SGN receptor drives to stop cancer cells or breast cancer cells to divide  We have shown that in the PALOMA 2 and 3 studies  and more recently we reported that we could reproduce data direction in real world evidence  based on real world data from Flatiron and other databases    and this is noteworthy including also overall survival data    again showing  in medical practice  the importance of these drugs Three  the PALLAS study that looked at the ability of palbociclib  Ibrance to stop dividing of SGN receptor positive breast cancer showed that this mechanism was very well operating in a powerful way  And finally  let me remind you that other agents that act on SGN receptor positive breast cancers and converge with the palbociclib such as tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors all were initially developed in metastatic cancer and did very well in adjuvant treatment in early breast cancer So these four observations and others makes us continue to be excited and very optimistic  And as Albert alluded to  a relatively small change in projected trial is based on the trial that actually started four and a half years ago  and it is quite common that in the final 12 months or so  minor changes in enrollment rate and process planning for study reports can affect a trial  But with all of this  you can hear we remain encouraged  enthusiastic about what Ibrance can offer for adjuvant treatment of breast cancer Chuck Triano    Senior Vice President  Investor RelationsRight  Thanks for the helpful context  Michael  Next question  please OperatorYour next question comes from Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs Terence C  Flynn    Goldman Sachs    AnalystHi  thanks for taking the questions  Maybe just two product ones for me  I was wondering if you can talk about Ibrance s rest of world dynamics  any specific headwinds this quarter and how to think about the trajectory into end of this year  And then for Xeljanz  I was wondering if you can give us a split of sales by indication and if you re seeing any impact in RA from the launch of AbbVie s Rinvoq on either share price  Thank you Albert Bourla    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you very  very much  So  Angela Angela Hwang    Group President  Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals GroupSure  So first of all on Ibrance  We continue to see good growth and strong growth ex US  But probably two factors that are tempering the net sales  as you saw in Q4  The first is pricing  and that continues to be something that we work hard at  especially in EU to gain access for our products in Europe And the second is class growth  So  if you look at the class growth of the CDK class through the quarters  that has increased  but over the last quarter it has tempered  and it s sort of sitting at around a 35  CDK class growth right now    class share  But within that  the Ibrance still has a very  very high product share  in the 80s  So I think it s pointing out to us the fact that there is still opportunity for us to grow and that growing the CDK class is going to be an area of our tremendous focus for us  ex US in 2020 and beyond Your second question was around Xeljanz  And so Xeljanz again  we continue to see excellent growth in Xeljanz  In fact  despite the fact that you only see this sort of 1  net sales growth in Q4  I ll point out that globally  full year  we had 29  growth of Xeljanz which is one of the highest of all of our core brands here at Pfizer in our entire portfolio  Q4  we saw 23  prescription growth  and this prescription growth was driven by extremely strong performance in rheumatoid arthritis  which really was not impacted by the label changes  And we still continue to see strong growth in ulcerative colitis even though here was the biggest label change and so physicians that have to adjust the way that they were prescribing Xeljanz But we expect this growth to continue because we have excellent momentum and confidence in prescribing from our physicians  We have significant unmet need  And we have greatly improved access  And this access is in fact what drove the 1  net sales in Q4  There was a    in Q4 of  18  we saw an inventory build at the end of the year  which didn t happen in Q4  19  So that was one of the reasons that affected our Q4 performance in  19 and then also and more importantly  throughout the course of 2019  we gained significant access In fact  we added 59 million incremental lives through contracting  and it s because of the timing of when these contracts were signed or renewed that drove the subsequent impacts of rebates  and this sort of came to a head and sort of disproportionately affected us in Q4 of   19  So I think stepping back  we re really pleased with the access that we do have in Xeljanz since it was launched eight years ago  This is the most favorable access situation that we ve ever had  which is very important when it comes to our ability to compete with Rinvoq You asked a question around Rinvoq  Just to sort of put into perspective  I think that we are excited about having another competitor help drive the growth of the JAK class in all of our indications  That being said  Xeljanz still enjoys a leading market share  especially in RA  where we have more than 15  of the market share of the entire class Chuck Triano    Senior Vice President  Investor RelationsRight  Thank you very much  Angela  Next question please OperatorYour next question comes from Umer Raffat from Evercore Umer Raffat    Evercore ISI    AnalystHi  thanks so much for taking my question  First  Albert  if I may  what are you hearing on a possible upcoming rule on IPI  There s a lot of press that companies have been notified by White House  I was curious what you know about it and if there s something we should be very concerned about Mikael  two quick ones  one quick one for you on the DMD gene therapy for a minute  You mentioned there is a proof of concept coming  My question is  have there been additional protocol driven pauses in enrollment and I asked because recall when the first SAE and acute kidney injury happened  the trial was paused and I m curious  has anything like that happened again And then finally  Frank  maybe just quickly on SI A line  I know it s a little higher than consensus  but technically year over year versus 4Q  18  it wasn t that much higher  but I also realized 4Q  18 had some Consumer  Maybe if you could just tell us about your holiday party  Thank you very much Albert Bourla    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAll right  so let me start with the IPI  We have not received any notification on that  So there is no news from our side other than what we read on the newspaper  So  Mikael Mikael Dolsten    Chief Scientific Officer and President  Worldwide Research  Development and MedicalYeah  Just to remind you we shared at the PPMD conference mid of last year update on six patients dosed with our DMD gene therapy that showed encouraging data on expression new muscle fibers amount to micro dystrophin and on some of the patients we had also an opportunity to report the encouraging trends on functional outcomes  We have dosed additional patients since then And we continue to garner experience on efficacy  safety and clinical management that are incorporated in the procedures  how we manage these patients going forward  We plan to conclude Phase 2 this spring  And based on current data and insights we are planning to start Phase 3  of course pending regulatory dialogs later this year  as indicated in Albert s opening remarks Albert Bourla    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAll right  Frank  Maybe you want to tell us about the holiday party I was not invited to Frank D Amelio    Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President  Global Supply and Business OperationsSure  Yes  I wasn t invited either  So I m busy since the party  Well  let me run the numbers  and I ll explain what happened  So for the quarter SI A all in was about  4 1 billion  It was up about 4  operationally   100 million  give or take from the prior year quarter  What really drove that was increased investment behind some of our brands  some of our oncology products  some of our launch products like Vyndaqel and some increased investments in emerging markets  but it was really investment in terms of supporting our brands Albert Bourla    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Thank you  Mikael  And just to make a comment  we are very  very diligent in the way that we allocate capital  And we are    when we have opportunities to put in promotional money  so we can have a very strong start  we do it  And we spend those money usually by being very diligent in the way that we control the indirect expense  I have been very clear but direct with indirect is a very clear distinction in our mind  So when it comes to things that they are overheads and things that they are not affecting directly the business results  we are very  very tough  And when it comes to areas that the investments can affect business results  we are creative and generous  So that s what we associate Umer Raffat    Evercore ISI    AnalystAnd these are clearly direct expense spend Albert Bourla    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAnd these are all direct expense spends  And the same  by the way  although you didn t ask  comes to R D  Right now  we are increasing R D investments  but we are increasing R D investments only for programs  only for projects  We are not increasing for infrastructure  we are not increasing for research centers  At large  we maintain a very strong presence there and we keep that very strong  But what is driving the increased R D  it is more Phase 3 or Phase 2 studies  It s very clear Chuck Triano    Senior Vice President  Investor RelationsRight  Thank you  Next question please  operator OperatorYour next question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley David Reed Risinger    Morgan Stanley    AnalystYes  Thanks very much  So I have three questions  please  First  Albert  could you discuss why Pfizer decided not to repurchase shares in 2020  And then maybe  Frank  you can comment on how we should think about the EPS implications when we consider your guidance relative to consensus  which had assumed some share repurchase Second  regarding the opportunity to rationalize the  4 5 billion in costs  could you just give us a sense for what percentage reduction is reasonable to assume a few years out  I was guessing maybe 20   But I just don t know what s reasonable  And then third  regarding the transfer of  600 million in revenue to Upjohn  does that change the economics that Pfizer will receive as part of the exit to Mylan  Thank you Albert Bourla    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes  I think basically all questions can be answered by Frank  I would just make some introductory comments  The reason why in our capital allocation we are allocating right now money to increase the dividend and also to invest in our business  all the opex to modernize our facilities    all the capex to modernize our facilities  The reason why we don t do right now share repurchase is because we want to make sure that we maintain very strong firepower to invest in the business The past was a very different Pfizer  The past of the last decade had to deal with declining of revenues  constant declining of revenues  And we had to do what we had to do  even if that was financing visionary  We couldn t invest them and create higher value  Now is a very different situation  We are a very different company  The Company is going to have best in class top line growth  revenue story starting from now  from the separation of Upjohn in the middle of the year    from the expected separation of Upjohn in the middle of the year  And we do not need  We can organically grow EPS  As you can see  all our projections on EPS this year are organically  Indecipherable  but we can use the capital to invest in good Phase 2  Phase 3 assets that will build our pipeline  So this is the strategy behind it Now let me ask Frank to run the numbers Frank D Amelio    Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President  Global Supply and Business OperationsSo  David all I ll do is I don t want to duplicate anything Albert said  I ll just add a couple of things on the share repurchases  One  we also announced a dividend increase in December  So obviously we continue to deploy capital in the area of dividends  which we think is important to our investment thesis  And that s something obviously as we go forward we ll continue to look at  and then obviously our 2020 guidance assumes no repurchases  So when you look at the improvement which is material in terms of the midpoint versus what we did back in July  none of that is coming from share repurchases Now let me answer your other couple of questions  On the  600 million transfer to Upjohn and does that change any of the economics  Let me kind of    let me give some context on this  which is  one  nothing has been decided yet  We are still in negotiations with Mylan on those two businesses and whether or not they will transfer the Viatris upon close  By the way  if we don t come to an agreement  those businesses would remain with New Pfizer  And so  we re still in negotiations  And so in terms of the economics  I d say  more to come  still to be determined and if and when we complete that obviously  I ll be in a better position to answer that On the  4 5 billion of indirect spend and directionally what do we think we can do there  I don t want to give a specific percentage because we re still working our way through the process  But I think I alluded to this earlier  which is  we ve already made some nice headway  I think we can make additional headway  That additional headway would show up in SI A  and obviously our intent would be for that to show up in the IBT as a percentage of revenue line  So that s what we re working to do  Our intent is to improve upon those numbers  And  as we work our way through the process and as we have more to report  we ll make sure we do so Albert Bourla    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Frank  Just a comment on the reasons why we transfer those business to Upjohn  Both on these businesses  first of all  they fit more under Upjohn in terms of the dynamics that they have so they can be managed much better  And secondly  I think they fit very nicely with Mylan because  one  it is the EpiPen predominantly business that Mylan is    but right now it s shared between the Mylan  we are providing for them And the second  it is  say  a partnership that we have with Mylan that was established years back and with generic  Indecipherable   So both of them fit much better in Viatris and that s the reason why we separated them  And also that will allow you to have  in case that this happens  a much more cleaner view of a growth trajectory of the Company because now you know exactly what will be the P L of the remaining company Chuck Triano    Senior Vice President  Investor RelationsThank you  Next question  please  operator OperatorYour next question comes from Louise Chen from Cantor Louise Alesandra Chen    Cantor Fitzgerald    AnalystHi  thanks for taking my questions here  So I had a few  My first question is  is the 6     approximately 6  five year sales CAGR for stand alone Pfizer  the New Pfizer still hold  Second question I had is  how much of a priority is M A for you under the New Pfizer and what kind of size of deals or types of deals are you most interested in  And last question I have is on the PCV dataset that s coming through  You and a competitor also have a whole set of PCV data  I m just curious how you see that landscape evolving over time  Thank you Albert Bourla    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Thank you very  very much Louise  Let me start with the 6  CAGR  if it still holds  absolutely  It s still holds  Actually  as you can see  if anything else  this business what we are projecting five years CAGR  all the way to  25 actually CAGR  of 6   This year performed at 8   9  for the quarter and we are projecting 8  for 2020  So  definitely we are on good  let s say  way to achieve that As regards the M A  yes  the M A is a very important part of our strategy  and as I just alluded before  this is why also we are not diluting our firepower with stock purchases right now because we do believe that we can create significant value with the right strategic move Now  we never say never to anything  But strategically we have made very clear that we are not interested in for a big M A that will have cost synergies as value driver because  first of all  that would be like diluting our top line growth  I don t think there are many companies that they can have this type of growth trajectory that we have in the next few years Second  it could be disruptive because having a big M A means that the thousands of people will have to work on integrations rather than supporting all these products that we just saw that are growing in 20s and 30s and also all this pipeline that is coming up  So we never say never  but this is not our strategy  Our strategy for M A  it is to be able to have Phase 2  Phase 3 programs ready    Phase 2  Phase 3  which could become potential medicines in the period  25   26   27   28  so that we can augment our internal pipeline and be able that we maintain this 6  growth for the long term  actually for the very  very long term because it s right now five years  I would say  is the long term And the other thing that I want to emphasize  it is that the 6  CAGR  it is risk adjusted  I repeat  it is risk adjusted  That means that in our projections  we are adjusting all the non read studies right now appropriate  Now  if all the Phase 3 goals in the right way and they are all successful  it s not going to be 6   It is going to be double digits  12  13   14   15   Now  if everything fails  also will not be 6   will be very low But these statistics works and the studies    and let s say at 50  more or less are successful  that means that we will achieve 6   That s why I want to emphasize that there is no binary event in our projections  Binary event would be if the 6  was dependent on two or three major results  that if they could go one way or another could affect  Right now  they are dependent on 15  16  17 blockbusters and then many other that are much smaller So then  Frank  maybe something to add on that before I ask Mikael to comment on specific data Frank D Amelio    Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President  Global Supply and Business OperationsAnd Louise  the only thing I wanted to add just to punctuate everything Albert said is    and why are we focusing on Phase 2b  Phase 3  is because the LOEs really start to kick in 2007  So if you think about we re in January of 2020  we literally have 8 years to work our way through this problem  And by the way  given that kind of a timeframe  given the breadth and strength of our pipeline  given our balance sheet  our capacity  obviously  we feel confident we will be able to solve it Albert Bourla    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerMikael Mikael Dolsten    Chief Scientific Officer and President  Worldwide Research  Development and MedicalYeah  I m pleased that you asked about our  Indecipherable  next generation  So as you know  we have adult and pediatric studies ongoing  The adult study has been given breakthrough designation on 28 September based on our encouraging Phase 2 data  and we expect very soon to report Phase 3 outcome of the adult PCV20 trial  And obviously  we are optimistic about that outcome based on the Phase 2 and the breakthrough designation On the pediatric  we have now accumulated further  Indecipherable  dose data of the PCV20 Phase 2 study  These data from the  Indecipherable  further substantiate the positive data reported in the press release of the  Indecipherable  and we expect initiation of Phase 3 soon for the infant vaccine pending discussions with regulators  The full dataset will be presented at the major vaccine related conference likely mid of this year Now  Albert commented also in his introduction very nicely on the improved relative coverage of the PCV20 from us versus a potential competitor 15 valent  And he mentioned 33  better coverage for adults and 42  better coverage in the US for infants  obviously very important significant better coverage  I just wanted to punctuate when you look in the top European market similar improved coverage in adults is actually 62 to 100   in infants 80 to 200   This is all for invasive pneumococcal disease Also in US  we have analyzed for community acquired pneumonia where we see substantial data coverage for the 20 versus a potential 15 valent  So all in all  you can see  we look forward to data sets advancing the program and think it would be the premier 20 valent and premier pneumococcal vaccine for patients Albert Bourla    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you Chuck Triano    Senior Vice President  Investor RelationsThank you  Next question please  operator OperatorYour next question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen Stephen Michael Scala    Cowen and Company    AnalystThank you  I have a few questions  An increase in the dividend was mentioned twice  but it sounds as though Upjohn will be  spun not split  in which case the dividend will be reduced  So I m wondering if you could clarify the dividend comment and I assume the 2020 EPS guidance implies a spin  not a split  Secondly on the abrocitinib versus dupixent study  given the fact that it is completed  Mikael  I m wondering if the data met the very positive portrayal you provided on the Q3 call which included superior itch relief to dupixent  And then lastly  will the proof of concept DMD data be presented at the March 31 meeting  Thank you very much Albert Bourla    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWell  thank you very much  Steve  Very good question  So  Frank why don t you clarify once more the dividend Frank D Amelio    Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President  Global Supply and Business OperationsSure  So  Steve  in terms of the guidance  you are right  it assumes a spin  not a split  And then in terms of the dividend  you said    I think you said in your question  it d be a reduction  I don t see it that way  What we ve said is the sum of Viatris dividend and our dividend would equal the current dividend that a Pfizer shoulder receives today  So I don t see a reduction in the dividend  The dividend income will be kept whole  I think we ve been very clear about that all along Albert Bourla    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAnd we ll continue growing  maybe not at the same pace  which we do right now  it s  0 02 per quarter  but we ll continue growing Frank D Amelio    Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President  Global Supply and Business OperationsRight  And Steve I can quickly run the numbers for you if you d like  just    so what do you think  What Viatris has said  is their first full year of about  4 billion of free cash flow  they d pay about 25  of that in the dividends  so that s 1  Phonetic  billion  Total Viatris will have about 1 2 billion shares  you put the 1 billion over 1 2 billion shares  it s about  0 83  The exchange ratio is about 1 2  Phonetic   You put a 100 shares of Pfizer  you get 12 shares of Viatris assuming a spin that s roughly  10 a share  We would reduce our dividend on an annual basis by that  10 but some of our dividend plus that  10   Albert Bourla    Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 0 10 Frank D Amelio    Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President  Global Supply and Business Operations 0 10  I m sorry  yeah  thank you  would equal what Pfizer s only gets today  And my thing it s  10 not  0 10 Albert Bourla    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerOkay Stephen Michael Scala    Cowen and Company    AnalystAbrocitinib Mikael Dolsten    Chief Scientific Officer and President  Worldwide Research  Development and MedicalYes  So  thank you for your interest in abrocitinib  And we believe that it s going to be a new drug class for such a prevalent disease that affects tens of millions of Americans  atopic dermatitis and where an oral alternative seems to be a real patient and physician preference  We will soon report out the data from the important COMPARE study So I haven t actually seen the data  so I can only punctuate a little bit what we discussed at earlier investor meetings that the historical comparison between abrocitinib and Dupixent suggest that we should expect to see similar or better impact on clearing skin  And particularly as Albert alluded to in his introduction  there is an important key secondary endpoint looking at itch relief starting with a readout already of two weeks and then following the study through the 12 to 16 weeks And the historical data suggests that we should be very optimistic about abrocitinib outperforming biological such as Dupixent on itch relief at earlier time points and provide the potential benefit of early onset of relief for disease  Now  we have to wait for the data to be able to obviously be absolutely confident in that outcome  but this is what I believe and look forward very much to see the data come shortly Albert Bourla    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAnd on the DMD question Mikael Dolsten    Chief Scientific Officer and President  Worldwide Research  Development and MedicalYeah  We are finalizing I think the program for the R D Day  So I can t be absolutely promise you  but I think it s likely that such an interesting program as the DMD gene therapy will be one of the potential agenda items  And obviously we would like to then share updates from increased number of patients over a longer time period  So please welcome and take a front row seat Albert Bourla    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you very much  both  And by the way  Frank  as always was right  It is  10 for 20 shares of Mylan Chuck Triano    Senior Vice President  Investor RelationsAll right  Move on to our next question  please OperatorYour next question comes from Geoff Meacham from Bank of America Geoff Meacham    Bank of America    AnalystGood morning  guys  Thanks so much for the question  Just have a couple  Mikael  the gene therapy platform with the advancement of hemophilia A and B  as well as DMD into Phase 3  what s the capacity to add additional indications to the portfolio  I mean  you guys have been successful partnering  but at this point it does seem like you could expand the platform organically in a material way And then for Angela on Xtandi  I just wanted to get your perspective on the inroads you ve made in M0 prostate patients and where do you think could represent a tipping point commercially  especially given that generic Zytiga available in the US  Thank you Albert Bourla    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerMikael Mikael Dolsten    Chief Scientific Officer and President  Worldwide Research  Development and MedicalYes  So  Geoff  you are showing  Indecipherable  for the gene therapy platform and what is particularly I think a strategic advantage for us is the end to end capability from discovery  clinical  manufacturing and of course that capability is also linked to important external partners that gives us capacity to advance increasing number of internal as well as partner programs  And we have an option for the Vivet Wilson disease program that could in a relatively near term future be available for clinical studies  And we expect from internal and external initiative to aspire to about bringing one new gene therapy into the clinic every year or so for the next period to come  And we think that should build up a very comprehensive gene therapy portfolio The three programs you alluded to are of course the frontier for us with factor IX that we hope to be the first company bringing that over the finish line in Phase 3 now and to start additional two Phase 3s for hemae  Phonetic  where we think we have a best in class profile so far  And then we already spoke about the NDA  Phonetic  Albert Bourla    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you very much  Angela Angela Hwang    Group President  Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals GroupSure  So  in terms of the M0  the non metastatic CRPC  I mean  what we re seeing here is just tremendous growth and tremendous performance  Just broadly speaking in terms of Xtandi  we had a great quarter  right  We grew 29   and this was driven by two things  One was actually demand across both metastatic as well as non metastatic  but also what we saw was the continued expansion of the actual class  the novel hormone therapies  And in this class Xtandi has the lion s share  We have about 35  share right now So first of all  to answer your question vis a vis generic Zytiga  we really don t see a competition from a generic versus brand in this instance  I think the competition    Zytiga is really among generic Zytiga versus branded Zytiga  whereas what we re seeing here is a clear uptick in Xtandi and specifically from the prostate trial in this M0 population as you say  we are continuing to see  As I ve talked about in all the previous quarters  really  really significant and very confident and uptake in urology prescribing  And we do believe that this is underpinning the growth of our non metastatic population  And the fact that these are patients also earlier in their disease is helpful in driving our growth in this population I also mentioned that just from a market share perspective  though the non metastatic  the M0 population has Xtandi  Erleada as well as Nubeqa  Xtandi by far and away has the leading market share in this segment and has been from the time that it was launched Chuck Triano    Senior Vice President  Investor RelationsGreat  Thank you  Angela  Next question  please  operator OperatorYour next question comes from Tim Anderson from Wolfe Research Tim Anderson    Wolfe Research    AnalystThank you  A couple of questions  One is on Prevenar in China  So sales have been ramping up there  but the regulatory authorities recently approved a domestically produced 13 valent product and the CEO of that company suggest they have capacity that s in the 10s of millions of doses  and who knows if that s true or not  But I m wondering if you can give some perspective on how you see competitive dynamics in a situation like this going forward  not only in China  where a domestic producer could potentially benefit from favoritism but also if that company were to take their product into other markets outside of China at a different price point  I think a lot of investors assume vaccines are durable forever  but I m wondering if this sort of thing could be disruptive and how you take the sort of potential competition into your forecast Second question is on M A  So any M A that you may engage with in 2020  Should we assume at least during this first six month window while you still have Upjohn that that is probably put on hold  And then last question on Vyndaqel  Might there be a low hanging fruit phenomenon where we see initial nice uptake  but then it kind of flattens out suddenly  Or do you expect this will be continued strong linear growth Albert Bourla    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you very much  I will give a quick answer to your M A question  Tim  and then Angela can deal with Prevenar China growth  On M A  no  the answer is no  absolutely not  We are very actively looking to invest capital on value creation opportunities  And then I assume that we will have several of them in the first half of 2020 before the close of the deal  Again  across the lines that I have described  you know exactly what we re doing  We want to make sure that we sustain the growth beyond 2027 when the alloys will have some impact Angela  what about Prevenar China Angela Hwang    Group President  Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals GroupSure  So we have acknowledge that there is a new competitor in the form of Volvax  Phonetic  in PCV13  However  I want to recognize that there are some differences here  Though it is a 13 valent vaccine  Volvax s vaccine is made with a different conjugate  And this conjugate technology being an older technology  so quite different from what we see in PCV13  That being said  it is a competitor However  if you sort of step back and look at the opportunity that we have in pneumococcal vaccinations  there are approximately 14 million new births every year in China and today only over maybe 1  of those infants are being vaccinated  So regardless of the volumes that Volvax might have available  I think the opportunity between us is just much larger than that  And we have a tremendous amount of untapped potential in the marketplace and we are confident that with the quality  the reliability  as well as the tremendous experience that Pfizer has had globally with PCV13 but also the tremendous success that we ve had in China  specifically for PCV13 that our growth will continue  And this is what we expect We have a very robust footprint  As you know  the vaccines    and it will be the same for Volvax  PCV13  This is an out of pocket market and it will be the same for the both of us  So this is where we ll be competing  which is why having a robust promotional engine and having a footprint of representatives that can really be available to support patients and caregivers at the points of vaccinations is really important  And I think in this regard  we have demonstrated great expertise and ability to grow this market So that s how we see it  We acknowledge the competition  but we continue to see tremendous potential Albert Bourla    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWhat about Vyndaqel Angela Hwang    Group President  Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals GroupAll right  So in terms of Vyndaqel  so yes  of course  in the year of launch one might expect to see a little bit of a bolus  a number of patients who have been identified and are awaiting diagnosis and treatment  That being said  we are confident of what we    we re confident about what we ve learned in the marketplace  in our first year of launch  We are confident that we have the right set of tools for helping to physicians to suspect the patients that might have ATTR CM  We have mobilized education around using non invasive methods like scintigraphy to diagnose patients  And we have also mobilized a patient support hub to help patients receive their medications So I think doing more of that as well as continuing to think about new methods to help diagnose and treat patients such as using artificial intelligence and increased number of tools  all of that will continue to support our ability to drive the important and rapid diagnosis of patients as well as their treatment Chuck Triano    Senior Vice President  Investor RelationsGreat  Thank you  Next question  please OperatorYour next question comes from Andrew Baum from Citi Andrew Baum    Citi    AnalystThank you  Couple of questions  please  Firstly on your pending oncology biosimilars rollout in the US  Given the challenges to start with biosimilar penetration  could you talk to your expectations  particularly with these three drugs  there should be an economic incentive for payers given the pass through  But yes  those issues in patients already on an established  Indecipherable  biosimilar to switch    and it s a brand to switch to biosimilar  So if you could give us some kind of sense of how much penetration and how quickly you may expect  that would be super helpful And then second  in terms of tafamidis  Angela  you tried to give some penetration figures at the beginning which I was struggling to keep up with and writedown  But just more broadly  could you outline how large you think the untapped patient population really is here and how far Pfizer is along in establishing that market  Many thanks Albert Bourla    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAngela  a lot of questions for you today  Please go ahead Angela Hwang    Group President  Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals GroupOkay  Sure  All right  So I think firstly we see the dynamics in oncology biosimilar as being very different from that of the    what we saw for inflammation in the form of Inflectra  So to your point about how will the dynamics change here and how quickly can payers as well as providers capture their savings is going to be much quicker  This is    the use of oncology biosimilars are much more rapid  right  You see more patients cycling through  treatment times are much shorter  So that s going to enable payers them providers to capture savings much more quickly  which is a very different dynamic that you see in Inflectra where it s a chronic treatment and patients are on their treatment for a very long time  So I think that s one big difference The second is that there is already some    we already have some precedents  We saw this with Retacrit  where after a year of being in the market  Indecipherable  supportive care in oncology  We already have 20  market share  This is still a far cry from what we see in Europe where there is much more rapid uptake  But I think that s  it s a signal  an indicator of the differences you see in the various biosimilar markets And we also have some early signals from competitor biosimilars that have already some good market share in oncology biosimilars  So I think that we have some good indicators that this is going to be different  I think the benefit that we see here is that we have a portfolio of three oncology biosimilars  all coming out around the similar time like around now  And I think what we have    we have a robust pricing strategy discount to the WACC  Phonetic  of the originator as well as I think strong relationships and networks built with both providers and payers that give us confidence that this will be an area of high growth for Pfizer Albert Bourla    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Angela Angela Hwang    Group President  Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals GroupAnd then your question was around tafamidis  So can you just repeat that again Andrew Baum    Citi    AnalystThe untapped population  Indecipherable  Angela Hwang    Group President  Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals GroupSo  as we have said in previous calls  we do believe that this is a rare disease and that in the US  there will be about 100 000 patients in total  Globally  500 000  but in the US  100 000  To date  we have diagnosed 9 000 patients  So that leads us to 9  of the population that we have diagnosed So while this may feel like very significant progress on the time that we have launched  and it is  I think you can also see that we have a long  long way to go to finding all 100 000 of these patients  And what I spoke earlier about in terms of the education  in terms of how to suspect the disease  how you diagnose the disease and then very quickly gaining access so our patients can benefit from treatment of the disease  These are all three levers that we are intensely focused on Chuck Triano    Senior Vice President  Investor RelationsGreat  Thank you  Next question  please OperatorYour next question comes from Navin Jacob from UBS Navin Jacob    UBS    AnalystHello  Thanks for taking my questions  A couple if I may  Just on biosimilars following up with Angela  Your comment about strong growth continuing on for the biosimilar  So I m wondering if you could give any color around how we should think about the trajectory over the next couple of years  Is this a doubling or tripling of that now almost  1 billion business  And then also  would love to understand how you re thinking about the tail of each of the individual assets  Are you seeing    should we be thinking of this as a ramp that goes up for a few years and then eventually starts tailing off like other generics  Or do you see this stabilizing and having a sustainable tail And then just on Vyndaqel  you received a positive CHMP opinion in the EU in December  Given that Vyndaqel is already approved in the polyneuropathy indication  wondering how we should be thinking about the price with the addition of the cardiomyopathy indication  Is there any chance for moving that around  And then how we think about the ramp in the EU  relative to the US  Thank you so much Angela Hwang    Group President  Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals GroupSure  So  I ll start with the last one first  So you re right  we just received EU approval for Vyndaqel  And as you know  there is quite a time lag between approval and then reimbursement in each of the countries  So all I can say is  right now we are in active negotiations with the countries in terms of determining the price of Vyndaqel as well as its reimbursement  You referred to the fact that we already have the 20 milligram of peripheral polyneuropathy in Europe and we recognize that That being said  we have    first of all  ATTR CM is a completely different indication  The trials that were conducted as well as the significant mortality benefits that were demonstrated in our clinical trials in ATTR CM are completely different  and we have the clinical data to demonstrate the great patient benefits that we have in ATTR CM  And so that s the basis of our discussions with each of the countries in Europe for reimbursement Your second question was around Vyndaqel growth and sort of the pace of it  I think the way to think about it is the following  We have through analogs seen that only 30  to 50  of all rare diseases are ever diagnosed  But of course  we believe that based on the mortality data that we have and the patient benefit that can be derived that it is critical that we meet that or at beat that  And so that s what we are intensely focused on  We have 10  of our patients    or with 9  in the US are diagnosed today  we have a long way to go and that s what we need to do Your last question Navin Jacob    UBS    AnalystWas the rhythm on the biosimilars  We ve had strong growth  22  this year for the year  What can we expect going forward Angela Hwang    Group President  Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals GroupThat s right  So I think in terms of the biosimilars  again  this is an area of growth that we can anticipate  We have three biosimilars now in oncology  plus the two that we have been supportive care  And so we look forward to this being a significant growth contributor to oncology portfolio  not just from a growth percentage perspective  but also from a revenue base perspective Chuck Triano    Senior Vice President  Investor RelationsRight Mikael Dolsten    Chief Scientific Officer and President  Worldwide Research  Development and MedicalI just would    yeah  I just wanted to add that Vyndaqel polyneuropathy has a positive EU recommendation  So we expect approval to come soon  And you know that links very nicely to really helpful outline you did  Angela Angela Hwang    Group President  Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals GroupThanks  Mikael Chuck Triano    Senior Vice President  Investor RelationsGreat  And if we can take our last question please  operator OperatorYour final question comes from the line of Mani Foroohar from SVB Leerink Mani Foroohar    SVB Leerink    AnalystHey  guys  thanks for taking my question  A couple of little ones on the Rare Disease side  In terms of tafamidis  we saw pretty attractive growth OUS including some markets that don t necessarily have the cardiomyopathy indication yet   Indecipherable  some follow on benefit in polyneuropathy from the increased promotional efforts in cardiomyopathy in Europe and elsewhere As a second question  given the expansion of patient opportunity into polyneuropathy in the US  how do you think about the opportunity to pursue a supplemental NDA or similar strategy in the US based on the real world evidence guidelines laid out previously by the FDA or would that require a separate study  And then finally on the gene therapy side  obviously pretty interesting data in hemophilia at ASH  moving forward in a couple of Phase 3s now  How do you think about that market in a universe where you have multiple therapies within curative intent in gene therapy alongside a number of fairly robust chronic therapies  Who are the patients who should receive an irreversible intervention in terms of gene therapy and who do you think that are more appropriate for chronic therapy such as  Indecipherable  Thank you Albert Bourla    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I think I will ask Mikael to start with gene therapy and  Indecipherable  follow this great assets that we have and how they fit together  Mikael Mikael Dolsten    Chief Scientific Officer and President  Worldwide Research  Development and MedicalYeah  Thank you very much  What I think is unique in our hemophilia portfolio  first  of course  we have a legacy of being one of the pioneers four intravenous delivery of factor VIII and factor IX  So we have a platform and experience on the business and R D side  And  as you so nicely alluded to  we also shared with our partner Sangamo some very much best in class data recently on the factor VIII gene therapy  Our current portfolio has factor VIII and factor IX gene therapy plus our TFPI antibody that has  like Hemlibra  an opportunity to provide subcute alternative but actually TFPI can be applicable for both factor VIII and factor IX deficiency So  the way we see it develop is that    I think physicians will look at gene therapies that have durability and good tolerability  and that has really been the hallmark for the strategies when we developed factor VIII and factor IX best in class profile because there are alternatives for these patients  So once they see the data for drugs    treatments that are approved that have durability and really good outcomes  which I think has been so far what we have seen with our gene therapies  those will be the one that can be adopted because there are alternatives that have less convenience but will at least until strong data is available be used For patients that are early in the disease diagnosed at earlier age  I think this would be a very important treatment as it saves them from the breakthrough bleedings that occur on lifelong treatment with infused factor VIII  Phonetic  and particularly for patients that are at early age that are very physically active it is important to have a solution for cure  So I think this will be a tremendous important patient populations  But availability of subcutaneous agents will supplement them and also allow for patients that may have antibodies to gene therapies to use them until a sufficient number of gene therapies available that there is always one for each patient And finally  us bringing together  I think what s unique with us is the entire portfolio that can address these patients  and we look really much forward to the year around 2021 and  22 when we see this portfolio coming into registration phase  I think that was the main piece here Albert Bourla    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  And then  Angela  maybe on Vyndaqel  we have seen some uptick in markets that cardiomyopathy was not approved  what s going on there and about supplemental filing on polyneuropathy Angela Hwang    Group President  Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals GroupYeah  In terms of polyneuropathy in the US  this is something that we re continuing to explore with the FDA  So   Albert Bourla    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerNo  this is  Speech Overlap  made yet  but we are in discussions Angela Hwang    Group President  Pfizer Biopharmaceuticals GroupThat s right  exactly  And then in terms of the upticks in polyneuropathy  I mean  I m not sure that it s a cardiomyopathy effect  As you know  we are improved  It s an approved indication for us ex US  So  we continue to actively promote it and it s probably as a result of those activities Albert Bourla    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  We will have  as we said  approval for that indication  and this is one I would think we will see material impact on Vyndaqel in cardiomyopathy in these patients who are not right now    we are just promoting  of course  The indications that we have registered over there  so we don t do anything outside that All right  I think this concludes more or less our call  Just I wanted to make some comments because really  I feel that we have at an exciting point in Pfizer s history  And if you take a big picture view over the last decade  we have changed and refocused our approach to R D  we have improved dramatically its productivity and we have developed the best pipeline we ever had and one of the best I believe in the industry  If you ve seen 2019  it was a year that we took deliberate and forceful steps to strengthen each one of our businesses and eventually shred  Phonetic  the current Pfizer into a new  smaller  high growth profile enterprise that will remain powerhousing marketing but also has been converted to the powerhouse of science Following the expected close of the Upjohn and Mylan transaction later this year  of course  we will be a very different company  And we will focus on continuing to execute our strategy  This includes we will continue the commercial momentum and preparing our new product launches  You have all asked a lot of questions about those products that keep surprising with their growth profile  And also you ve seen that we are taking seriously and we are investing in new launches We are continually advancing our internal pipeline and we ll augment it with mid stage R D programs through targeted bolt on business development opportunities  As I referenced before  we should continue seeing these type of activities in the first and second half of this year  Of course  we are working very intensively to set up Upjohn to be in a strong position when it combines with Mylan to become  Indecipherable  and create a formidable company  And of course  we will continue leading the conversation in Washington as we work to address the affordability challenge facing patients  These are the areas that we are focusing for next year Once again  we look forward to sharing more pipeline updates during our Investor Day on March 31  Have a great rest of your day Operator Operator Closing Remarks Duration  88 minutesCall participants Chuck Triano    Senior Vice President  Investor RelationsAlbert Bourla

Mac Greer  It s Tuesday  January 28th  Welcome to MarketFoolery  I m Mac Greer  and I am joined in studio by Motley Fool analyst Emily Flippen  Emily  how are you doing today 
Emily Flippen  I m all right  How about yourself 
Greer  I m doing good  I m doing good  Now  in a minute  as our resident expert  as a student of China    do you like when I always just kind of build your credentials up 
Flippen   laughs  I love it 
Greer  Well  I m going to have to ask you about the coronavirus 
Flippen  Of course 
Greer  Chris and Jason talked about it on yesterday s MarketFoolery  and I certainly want to talk to you about it in a few minutes  But I want to kick things off with some earnings stories  And let s begin with McCormick  the spice maker  And really a dang good stock over the last few years  but not so much today  Shares slipping a bit after McCormick reported lower than expected earnings  What is going on here 
Flippen  Well  not only did McCormick miss on their revenue and earnings  but they gave weak guidance for 2020  Net income was actually down  0 01 year over year on flat revenue  So  I think all in all    I mean  McCormick s never been a high flying stock  but it was a worse quarter than what was expected  But you need to put it in context  For instance  McCormick prior to this earnings was up 40  over the past year alone  And that is foiled against the market s 25   but still  that s 15   20  over the market  which is extremely impressive for a company that has only grown revenue in the low single digits for a long time now 
Greer  That s a lot of Old Bay 
Flippen  It s a lot of Old Bay  And it might not be a high flying company  but in constant currency terms  the company actually grew sales 3   So  there were some headwinds in there that were a little bit out of their control  I think all in all  McCormick  ultimately what you re seeing is a strong  stable  dividend paying company that has just been on a tear  and needs a little bit of a pullback  if you ask me 
Greer  And speaking of being on a tear  I think a lot of us  when we think McCormick  we think spices  But in recent years  they ve gone on a bit of a buying spree where they bought food companies and food brands like Frank s Red Hot  French s  When I think mustard  I think French s  So  it s not just a spice maker anymore 
Flippen  Yeah  look  I have a bottle of Frank s Red Hot in my fridge constantly  I put that stuff on everything  to stick with their tag line there  So  McCormick is smart  because they re always looking forward and thinking  OK  well  if we see any softness in the spice market    last year  there was some softness on the food service side of their spice division  So  yeah  when they see opportunities to acquire different brands  then they do that  And it s smart because it diversifies their revenue stream a little bit  And Frank s Red Hot is great 
Greer  Do you have a favorite spice 
Flippen  I like McCormick s premixed spices  I know it s a cop out 
Greer  In the little paper bags 
Flippen  In the little paper bags  I know  I know  When I go home  I already have all those spices in my cabinet somewhere  But there s something so nice about just getting a little bag  putting it on the chicken  putting it on whatever  and then baking it and making it all easy enough 
Greer  I think there s no crime in that  I think you should just own it  You know what I love  And I m such a late adopter  I feel like I came across this maybe 10  15 years ago  but I m such a huge fan of sea salt  And I know salt  I know the world   
Flippen  What s the difference 
Greer  I don t know  it just feels kind of chunkier  I don t know  it feels better  Now  I know the tide has been turning against salt for a while  And I know that too much salt  not a great thing  So  hold your emails  But  love me some sea salt  So  back to the stock  The stock has more than doubled over the last five years  Are you still bullish on McCormick going forward 
Flippen  I am  Their cash flow from operations were up 15  year over year  And in November  they authorized their 34th consecutive quarter of dividend increases  I think today s reaction might be a little bit of a needed pullback for the stock itself  but in terms of it as an investment  especially if you re looking for a dividend  it s a low dividend at about a 1 5  yield  but it s a good  stable player that generates a lot of cash flow 
Greer  And let s move on to 3M  Shares of 3M down around 4  on earnings  3M also announcing that it is laying off 1 500 employees  That works out to around 1 5  of its workforce  Emily  what do you think 
Flippen  3M had an interesting quarter  Their sales slightly missed  Their earnings missed big  They posted a gap EPS of  1 66 versus  2 10 expected  So  a big miss there  But there was a  0 49 headwind associated with  as you mentioned  the restructuring charges with that layoff of 1 500 people  a huge number of people  as well as litigation costs that don t expect to reoccur  So  on the bright side  it seems like they have some room for operational improvements throughout 2020  In fact  in 2020  they guided that the bottom line should rise more in the range of 2  to 7  thanks to those job cuts  It s never really a good thing you want to see with a company that needs to raise that income by laying off a huge number of people like this  But at the same time  they really do need to return to growth in 2020  Their sales were down 2  year over year 
Greer  And let s talk about another potential catalyst  Because back in October of 2018  3M first warned that trade tensions with China would be a problem  Now  last week  we talked about phase one of the trade deal with China  We ve got that now locked in  So  could that be a catalyst  I mean  it seems like things are getting better  and that can only help 3M  right 
Flippen  Every single time I think things are getting better the trade war  I need to knock on wood  because it seems like you take a step forward then two steps back  I really think it s too early to say whether or not we re going to see any further improvements in the trade war than the phase one deal  The phase one deal was the low hanging fruit  There s a lot of very nitty gritty details there that need to be worked out  And unfortunately  the safety and industrial segment for 3M is their largest revenue segment  and that s the most affected by the trade war 
Greer  Exit question  10 years from now  will there still be Post it Notes 
Flippen  100   just because David Gardner will still be in the world and he ll still be buying those Post it Notes 
Greer  I love it  you re bullish on Post it Notes 
Flippen  I m bullish on Post it Notes 
Greer  I love Post it Notes  but I m not sure with millennials    I mean  you  as a millennial  I feel like it s all gone digital  So  I m not sure  Five years from now  maybe so  10 years from now  I think there s going to start to be a backlash against Post it Notes because of the waste  And I love Post it Notes 
Flippen  I also love Post it Notes  If you go into my workspace at my home  I have Post it Notes all over the place  I will admit  it s maybe not the most environmentally friendly thing I do 
Greer  Well  let s move on to Pfizer  Shares of Pfizer falling on earnings  down around 4   Emily  what is going on with Pfizer 
Flippen  Ultimately  the big story with Pfizer is that they were not helped by the loss of patent exclusivity for Lyrica  That s Pfizer s drug used to treat pain from fibromyalgia and other nervous system diseases  That s a mouthful  It s essentially to say that  yeah  Lyrica lost two thirds of its revenue over the past year because of the loss of this patent  which has really impacted Pfizer s bottom line  They missed on earnings  And that was actually a 13  decrease year over year in earnings  But  Pfizer s looking up for 2020  They re actually spinning off one of their divisions  Upjohn selling it to Mylan  and they re forming what they call a new Pfizer  which is a new and improved  smaller  lean  innovative machine 
Greer  A new Pfizer  I hope that works out better than the whole New Coke thing 
Flippen  I hope so  too 
Greer  Back to back to the loss of exclusivity  When you re looking at a drug maker like Pfizer  it s really all about the pipeline  right  for investors  and their ability to replenish that pipeline as they lose exclusivity 
Flippen  Exactly  And you have to recognize that Pfizer and other companies like this are always going to be very lumpy  They tend to have really great quarters  and then really bad quarters  It depends a lot on that patent process  I presume that new Pfizer s focus will be on biopharma  They have a lot of great products coming out in that division  as well as bringing their existing products into emerging markets  But the CEO  Albert Borella said that  quote   The company will be a smaller  science based company with a singular focus on innovation   So  hopefully  moving forward  that means that they re focusing on their core products that they see their ability to scale 
Greer  And as we wrap up  Emily  as I mentioned  I want to ask you about the coronavirus  Now  Chris and Jason talked about it on yesterday s show  We re seeing a lot of stocks getting hurt  Travel stocks  especially  and gaming stocks  like Wynn really falling  because of the coronavirus story  Now  Chris talked about how it s an opportunity to see how companies communicate  and to see how transparent and how forthcoming some of these companies are  We ve seen Starbucks and Disney both make statements and close    to see how companies communicate  As you watch this coronavirus story unfold  what are you watching  What s your big question 
Flippen  I think Chris hit the nail on the head with watching how these companies communicate  I will just add a grain of salt there  which is to say  what they re operating off of is limited information  And they re usually getting that information from the horse s mouth itself  which is the Chinese government  It s not the most reliable source of information  So  even though you can have companies that are trying their best to be as transparent as possible with what they know about the impact of this disease  if anybody is being over communicative  it s probably going to give investors a feeling of false hope  right  Nobody really knows where this is going to develop  Nobody can really tell the impact of it 
What I ll be watching is seeing how this affects the general Chinese economy over the next quarter  Chinese stocks have been beaten down because of the trade war issues associated with our different governments  And this definitely does not help what I had initially hoped in 2020 would be a secular rotation back into Chinese companies  So  we need to make sure that this doesn t impact the Chinese economy too much  or these Chinese companies can continue to stay hit down 
Greer  And as we wrap up  the desert island question  You re on a desert island for the next five years  and for some reason  well  you re going to buy a stock  You have to buy one of these three stocks  McCormick  3M  or Pfizer 
Flippen  That s such an easy question to me  For me  that s McCormick  100  
Greer  Wow  didn t even hesitate 
Flippen  I really don t need to  When I look off into the future five  10 years from now  I see McCormick still being around  They re really the leader in their space  I think they re well managed  They re not the biggest dividend player    all of these companies are dividend payers  by the way    but  they do pay a steady dividend  They have strong cash flows  Look  any company that acquires Frank s Red Hot is good in my book 
Greer  I like that  And they have the premade spice packs  You don t have to do anything  You just tear the thing up  Yeah  I love that  too 
Well  as always  people on the show may have interest in the stocks they talk about  and The Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against  so don t buy or sell stocks based solely What you hear  Emily Flippen  thanks for joining me 
Flippen  Thanks for having me 
Greer  That s it for this edition of MarketFoolery  This show is mixed by Dan Boyd  I m Mac Greer  Thanks for listening and we will see you tomorrow ",2020-01-29,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/poius,2070859

219652,441168,PFE,The 3 Most Important Things to Know About Pfizer s Q4 Earnings Results,news,"Everyone who follows Pfizer  NYSE PFE  expected that 2019 would be a challenging year for the big drugmaker  And it was  The company s blockbuster nerve pain drug Lyrica faced generic competition  with sales quickly plummeting  Pfizer s share price fell 10  last year  while the S P 500 index soared 29  
Pfizer announced its fourth quarter results before the market opened on Tuesday  Here are the three most important things to know about the company s Q4 update  

1  Overall revenue declined  but there are some bright spots
Pfizer s revenue in the fourth quarter fell by 9  year over year to  12 7 billion  There was one major culprit behind the decline  Sales for Lyrica plunged 67   from  1 32 billion in the prior year period to  433 million in the fourth quarter of 2019  Pfizer also reported sales declines for several other drugs  most notably Enbrel  which saw sales fall 21  year over year to  414 million 
But there were some bright spots with Pfizer s Q4 revenue  It topped the consensus analysts  estimate of  12 6 billion  And while overall revenue fell  sales for Pfizer s biopharma segment increased by 7  on a reported basis and 9  operationally to over  10 5 billion 
Sales for the company s top selling product  pneumococcal vaccine Prevnar 13  rose 4  year over year to  1 58 billion  The most impressive growth  though  came from rare disease drug Vyndaqel  with sales skyrocketing from  39 million in the prior year period to  213 million in Q4  Pfizer s top blockbusters also delivered strong growth  Sales for blood thinner Eliquis soared 21  to nearly  1 1 billion  with sales for breast cancer drug Ibrance jumping 13  to  1 28 billion 
2  Earnings were a little below expectations 
With Pfizer s revenue sliding  it came as no surprise that earnings would fall as well  Pfizer reported a net loss of  337 million  or  0 06 per share  based on generally accepted accounting principles  GAAP   The company posted a GAAP net loss of  394 million  or  0 07 per share  in the prior year period 
Pfizer announced adjusted income of  3 1 billion  or  0 55 per share  This was well below the adjusted income of  3 75 billion  or  0 63 per share  posted in the same period in 2018 
CFO Frank D Amelio said that full year results for 2019  met or exceeded all components of our financial guidance   He was right  However  the company didn t quite meet Wall Street s expectations of adjusted earnings per share of  0 57 
3  Complicated guidance
Pfizer provided three different outlooks for full year 2020  Why such complicated guidance  The company plans to spin off its Upjohn unit and merge it with Mylan  Because of this pending transaction  Pfizer gave full year 2020 guidance for the full company as it stands now  for the  new  Pfizer that will remain after the deal is finalized  and for Upjohn by itself 
For the full company  Pfizer projects full year 2020 revenue will be between  48 5 billion and  50 5 billion with adjusted diluted EPS of  2 82 to  2 92  This guidance reflects low single digit percentage declines on both the top and bottom lines 
The picture looks much better for the  new  Pfizer that will emerge after Upjohn is spun off  It expects full year revenue between  40 7 billion and  42 3 billion for the new company  reflecting 8  year over year operational growth at the midpoint of the range  Adjusted diluted EPS is projected to come in between  2 25 and  2 35 
Pfizer expects that full year 2020 revenue for Upjohn will be between  8 billion and  8 5 billion  The midpoint of this range reflects a 23  year over year operational decline  Pfizer didn t provide adjusted EPS guidance for Upjohn  but the company projects that Upjohn s adjusted EBITDA for full year 2020 will fall between  3 8 billion and  4 2 billion 
Looking ahead
As is the case with any pharmaceutical stock  Pfizer s future rests on its pipeline  The company has several important milestones on the way this year for investors to watch 
CEO Albert Bourla said that the company expects to report pivotal top line results in the first half of 2020 for abrocitinib in treating atopic dermatitis  for three late stage studies of 20 valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine PF 06482077  and for Xeljanz in treating ankylosing spondylitis  Even more late stage results should be on the way in the second half of the year  as well as results from earlier stage clinical studies throughout 2020 
Bourla also said   2020 is expected to be an exciting year for Pfizer with the close of the Upjohn Mylan transaction anticipated by midyear  leaving New Pfizer positioned to deliver revenue and adjusted diluted EPS growth that is expected to be among the industry leaders  New Pfizer will be a smaller  science based company with a singular focus on innovation  while also continuing to allocate significant capital directly to shareholders  primarily through dividends  
Current shareholders will probably like the prospects of stronger revenue and earnings growth  But they ll especially like that the company intends to keep the solid dividends flowing ",2020-01-28,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pnywd,2069553

219682,441198,PFE,Is Pfizer  PFE  Stock Outpacing Its Medical Peers This Year ,opinion,"Investors focused on the Medical space have likely heard of Pfizer  PFE   but is the stock performing well in comparison to the rest of its sector peers  A quick glance at the company s year to date performance in comparison to the rest of the Medical sector should help us answer this question 
Pfizer is a member of our Medical group  which includes 908 different companies and currently sits at  2 in the Zacks Sector Rank  The Zacks Sector Rank considers 16 different sector groups  The average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups is measured  and the sectors are listed from best to worst 
The Zacks Rank is a successful stock picking model that emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions  The system highlights a number of different stocks that could be poised to outperform the broader market over the next one to three months  PFE is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy  
Within the past quarter  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for PFE s full year earnings has moved 1 50  higher  This signals that analyst sentiment is improving and the stock s earnings outlook is more positive 
Our latest available data shows that PFE has returned about 0 79  since the start of the calendar year  Meanwhile  stocks in the Medical group have gained about 0 76  on average  This shows that Pfizer is outperforming its peers so far this year 
Looking more specifically  PFE belongs to the Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry  which includes 14 individual stocks and currently sits at  48 in the Zacks Industry Rank  Stocks in this group have gained about 0 45  so far this year  so PFE is performing better this group in terms of year to date returns 
PFE will likely be looking to continue its solid performance  so investors interested in Medical stocks should continue to pay close attention to the company ",2020-01-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-pfizer-pfe-stock-outpacing-its-medical-peers-this-year-200498382,200498382
219683,441199,PFE,Is Pfizer s Stock a Buy ,news,"Pfizer  NYSE PFE  is one of the top pharmaceutical companies in the world  With more than  50 billion in annual sales and profits of more than  16 billion over the trailing twelve months  the company offers investors a great deal of stability  The problem is that its business has shown minimal growth in recent years  While its dividend may attract investors looking for recurring income  it may be a struggle to find another reason to buy shares of Pfizer today  However  recent developments could make the company much more investable in the near future 
Changes to the business could improve its growth rate
There are two big moves the company is making that will change how the stock looks and that should improve its growth rate as well 
The first is the spinoff of its Upjohn division  which encompasses the company s off patent medicine  The division will merge with another drug manufacturer  Mylan  Upjohn contributed  8 1 billion to the company s top line over the past nine months  or one fifth of the  39 1 billion in sales that Pfizer earned over that time  but that s down 13  from the  9 3 billion that the segment generated over the prior year period  Spinning off the business will allow Pfizer to focus on products that are exhibiting more growth  like breast cancer drug Ibrance  which has seen its sales rise 23  year to date  Eliquis  which treats blood clots  has also seen impressive year over year sales growth of 24  

Another change for Pfizer comes with its consumer healthcare business combining forces with GlaxoSmithKline in a joint venture  effective Jul  31  2019  It isn t a big segment of Pfizer s business  as its 2018 sales from consumer healthcare totaled just  3 6 billion  which is a relatively small chunk of the  53 6 billion in revenue it generated during the year  It didn t show much growth  either  rising just 3 8  from the prior year  
By shifting its focus onto products that are core to its business and that have been exhibiting more growth  Pfizer s stock becomes more valuable in the process  While sales for Pfizer will look smaller  its growth rate may actually improve  Revenue in the third quarter was down 4 6   while year to date totals are down around 1 5  
But will it be enough to attract growth investors 
Although Pfizer will be cutting some low performing segments out of the stock s financial results  what s left may still not be enough to make the company an attractive buy from a growth perspective  In Q3  the company s biopharma segment  which accounts for 80  of its top line  was up just 7 3  from the prior year quarter  while year to date figures show even less impressive growth   4 1   Aside from its oncology products  where sales were up 28  in Q3  there aren t a whole lot of reasons for growth investors to get excited 
That makes Pfizer primarily a buy for those investors who are looking for a recurring payout and a bit of stability as well  The low volatility stock currently pays its shareholders a quarterly dividend of  0 38  The company recently hiked its dividend payments from  0 36 and the dividend yield is now up to 3 9   well above the 1 85  that the S P 500 averages  While it s not a Dividend Aristocrat  Pfizer has been raising its payouts consistently since 2010 
Is the stock a buy 
If you re looking for a solid dividend stock to buy and hold  Pfizer could be a good option for your portfolio  And with better prospects for growth moving forward  the stock may perform better than it has over the past five years    rising just 18   far below the S P 500  which is up 62  over the same period 
But with higher yielding dividend stocks out there and better options available for growth  there isn t an overly compelling reason to buy Pfizer today  especially with all the changes that the company is undergoing  Until Pfizer can show some strong  sustainable growth  investors may want to look elsewhere  at other healthcare stocks to invest in ",2020-01-14,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/phtb6,2058798
219684,441200,PFE,Why Pfizer Stock Fell 10 2  in 2019,news,"What happened
Pharmaceutical mega titan Pfizer  NYSE PFE  lost an eye catching 10 2  of its value over the course of 2019  according to data from S P Global Market Intelligence  Investors avoided this top drugmaker last year for two major reasons 
First  the drugmaker s decision to spin off its generic drug business  known as Upjohn  and merge it with Mylan  was not a big hit with Wall Street  Although this strategic move will remove a key overhang in the form of ongoing patent losses  it will also significantly reduce the company s free cash flow  lessening its firepower for value creating business development transactions 
Second  Pfizer s top selling pain medication  Lyrica  officially began facing generic competition in the middle of 2019  Unsurprisingly  its sales plummeted during the third quarter   

So what
Wall Street rarely likes major shake ups  especially when they are undertaken by industry stalwarts like Pfizer  Pfizer  however  clearly needed to change course  Despite the drugmaker s successful pivot to oncology as a main growth driver  it simply hasn t been able to generate healthy levels of top line growth on a consistent basis due to an avalanche of patent expiries  The spin off of its generic drug business should immediately remedy that fundamental problem  In fact  management expects the company s revenues to rise by an average of 6  annually for the period from 2021 through 2025     
Now what
Is Pfizer s stock worth buying after last year s double digit pullback  The answer is a resounding yes  The fact of the matter is that this pharmaceutical giant should be a far more compelling growth play than it has been in years past  thanks to management s decision to finally execute a much needed split ",2020-01-16,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/piw9x,2061180
219696,441212,PFE,Is Pfizer Raising Drug Prices Too Much in 2020 ,news,"Ahead of election years  the cost and future of health care has become one of the top debates for better than two decades now  Most politicians say that they want to lower prescription drug costs  The only problem is that it never really seems to happen on a measurable basis  A study from Rx Savings Solutions showed that pharmaceutical companies have issued price hikes on hundreds of drugs for 2020  While the average price increase of 5 8  was less than the average price hike of just over 6  seen a year earlier  some companies are targeting higher price hikes than others Pfizer Inc   NYSE  PFE   which saw its stock lose 10  in 2019 versus the 28  gain for the S P 500  appears to be among the companies with the largest price hikes for prescription drugs in 2020  The data are from outside sources  and investors and consumers should keep in mind that some price hikes on the list prices may not be true price hikes after considering rebates and or other discounts Pfizer was shown to have raised prices by more than 9  on over 40 pharmaceutical products for 2020  Pfizer was also shown to have price hikes of about 5 6  on about 27  of the drugs it sells in the United States  and prices were higher in 2020 on more than 90 drugs div connatix margin bottom  1 5em   div connatix img  margin  unset  The WSJ reported that nearly half of the drugs with price hikes were classified as sterile injection drugs which are typically administered in hospitals and in medical clinics  with the majority being a hike of less than  1 00 per product dose A further executive summary of the CPI RX from the White House in October 2019 showed that  as of August 2019  the annualized price change in drug prices had been  0 7  from a year earlier  The White House document also warned that there is no formal way of tracking net net drug price changes due to the complexities and variables  It said The most informative measure of prescription drug prices would be based on net prices and would reflect all discounts and rebates  However  due to the difficulty in obtaining information on rebates  no such measure exists Heparin products  which are blood thinners  were shown to have price hikes of 15   and that is after a 50  increase in the costs of its raw materials and expanded capacity to meet demand  The African swine flu in China was shown to have a hand in the cost of materials as the drug is derived from pig products  although Pfizer s U S  heparin supply is not shown to be sourced from China In a prior blog post  Rx Savings Solutions discussed the Consumer Price Index Prescription Drug Index  CPI Rx  as an overall inflation measurement of drug prices  Unfortunately  this is only a partial guide as the CPI Rx is shown to not include specialty drugs and that the CPI Rx also does not accurately measure what insurers pay  These so called list prices on drugs also do not take into consideration rebates and discounts and the group showed that some pharmaceutical companies are claiming that their prices are lower An opinion piece from NBC showed that Big Pharma greed is to blame for the industry s price hikes  and that the status quo is unhealthy for anyone except pharmaceutical company executives In the case of Pfizer  the company was shown to have its price hikes offset by higher rebates paid to insurance companies and to sales organizations  Pfizer has come under fire from President Trump back in 2018 after raising prices at that time  and the company ended up rolling back those price hikes before reinstating them Pfizer s loss of 10  in 2019 was versus a 19  gain for rival Merck and was versus a 25  gain for the SPDR S P Pharmaceuticals ETF  XPH   As of the start of 2020  Pfizer s Refinitiv consensus analyst target price of  41 91 implied a total return projection of 10 9  after taking its 3 9  dividend yield into consideration  That said  the 10  drop in 2019 was after a 20 5  gain in 2018 and the consensus data a year ago had been calling for upside of about 7 1

219697,441213,PFE,Why Pfizer Is My Drug Stock of Choice,news,"With the market at all time highs and a  risk on  mentality perhaps more common than not  the pharmaceutical space might not seem like the most opportune sector in which to be on the prowl  However  there is a name in the industry that I sense deserves more than a passing glance  and that s Pfizer  NYSE PFE  
What makes the drug giant worth a gander  A couple of things stand out 

Expectations are low  but the future is promising
A quick look at consensus analyst figures shows that investors aren t expecting anything extraordinary on the earnings front in the near future  In fact  analysts are calling for the company to earn  2 97 per share this year  down 1  from the prior year  and that trend is set to continue with expected 2020 earnings down another 8  
I know what you re thinking    that s hardly inspiring  But I m still upbeat when it comes to Pfizer s future earnings potential  especially given its development pipeline and storied history of blockbuster products 
As far as its current drug pipeline is concerned  as of Oct  29th  it had 96 products in varying stages of development  And of that number  there were 37 and 24 products in Phase II and or Phase III trials  respectively  some of which may bear fruit in the not too distant future  For example  Abrocitinib is a Phase III product for atopic dermatitis  or what s more commonly known as eczema  The company noted in its third quarter earnings release 

In October 2019  Pfizer announced complete results from a Phase 3  12 week  pivotal study  JADE MONO 1  in patients aged 12 and older with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis  AD   Abrocitinib  an investigational oral Janus kinase 1  JAK1  inhibitor  met all the co primary and key secondary endpoints  which were related to skin clearance and itch relief compared to placebo 

For a condition that s estimated to affect as many as 10  of adults and 20  of children worldwide  this is just one example of the significant markets Pfizer can serve with the products in its pipeline  For a company that generated over  53 billion in revenue in the trailing 12 month period  that s got my attention 
So what is the company s cache of products worth 
Given the competitive landscape and the fact there are always unexpected costs and risks when advancing products through clinical trials  it s hard to quantify  However  my ears perked up when the company declared earlier in the year that there could be as many as 15 potential billion dollar drugs it says could win approval within the next five years 
Another thing worth mentioning
As of Oct  29  Pfizer had some 42 oncology cancer products in its pipeline  This is important  because as one might surmise  cancer is a serious health concern  And just to put some perspective on how much cancer affects our every day lives  more than 600 000 people in the United States alone were expected to die from the disease in 2018  according to the National Cancer Institute  And more than 1 7 million cases were expected to be diagnosed  In short  Pfizer is in a good place to help in the fight against this disease for years to come 
Also investors should remember that Pfizer has a strong track record  Ever heard of Lipitor  Xanax  Dilantin  Viagra  or Zoloft  They all fall under the Pfizer product umbrella  not to mention everyday consumer products like ChapStick  Centrum  and Advil  All are part of the company s arsenal 
In nutshell  Pfizer has a history of managing blockbuster products  and I d wager that a respectable number of those 96 products in development could ultimately end up being household names as well 
The dividend provides a bit of a cushion
To be clear  Pfizer s dividend isn t some massive  double digit behemoth  But the stock does sport a generous yield approaching 4  as of this writing  Also  I d be remiss if I didn t point out that the company has impressively grown its dividend since 2010 

Data by YCharts 
Now  as the old saying goes  past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results  and Pfizer s payouts will change shape following the expected Upjohn and Mylan combination  But I d argue that the track record is still impressive given the economic backdrop  particularly in the early part of the decade and the capital intensive nature of the pharmaceutical business in general  A quick look at the company s cash flows also leaves me optimistic that it has flexibility to keep rewarding shareholders going forward 
Pfizer isn t expected to grow leaps and bounds in the near term    that much is clear  But it does have a strong existing portfolio of big names  plus a sizable pipeline of products that will drive the company s growth over the next decade  With a solid dividend yield that can also serve as a cushion should the broad market experience a pullback  which is not beyond the realm of possibility given its trajectory over the last 12 months  ignore Pfizer at your own risk ",2020-01-10,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/pgft4,2056891

219712,441228,PFE,Novartis s  90 million Swiss factory to help solve cell therapy bottleneck,news,"By John Miller
ZURICH  Reuters    Swiss drugmaker Novartis s  S NOVN  new  90 million cell and gene therapy factory in northern Switzerland is on track to begin commercial production of treatments  including Kymriah for cancer and Zolgensma for spinal muscular atrophy  in 2020 
The new gene and cell therapy factory  expected to employ 450 people  will allow the drugmaker to make its Kymriah treatment for European patients without first having to fly their immune cells across the Atlantic Ocean 
The Swiss factory  as well as a separate French site also being expanded  are central to Novartis s plans to transform Kymriah from a modest  250 million per year seller into a  1 billion blockbuster as European demand rises 
 We have already started to produce clinical batches at both sites and are on track to begin producing commercial product in 2020    Novartis  said 
Basel based Novartis sees cell and gene therapies eventually contributing about 15  of its revenue 
T cells currently harvested from Europeans getting the  400 000 per patient Kymriah blood cancer therapy currently must be sent to a U S  laboratory for re engineering  Analysts have called the lack of manufacturing capacity a  major bottleneck  
Novartis is investing some  500 million in new facilities around the world to address production bottlenecks and drug companies including Novartis   Pfizer   N PFE  and others  have plans to spend  2 billion building out gene and cell therapy manufacturing after rapid expansion into these treatments 
Novartis will also make Zolgensma at the Swiss and French factories  a  2 1 million per patient spinal muscular atrophy gene therapy awaiting European and Japanese approval 
Kymriah s global rollout in 20 countries  plus Novartis s efforts to expand the therapy s indications  make adding commercial production a priority  including in China and Japan

219735,441251,PFE,Ex FDA chief Gottlieb sees investment opportunity in  unloved  antibiotics,news,"By Rebecca Spalding
NEW YORK  Reuters    As a private investor  former U S  Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb is focused on an area where few have found success in recent years  developing new antibiotics 
Since leaving the FDA in April  Gottlieb has revealed little about what types of investments he would make in his new role at New Enterprise Associates  one of the country s largest venture capital firms where he worked prior to his time in government 
But in an interview  Gottlieb said he intends to use his expertise to back therapeutic areas that other healthcare investors have overlooked due to concerns over how the treatments are paid for 
Near the top of his list are companies researching new kinds of antibiotics  an issue he advocated for while at the FDA 
 I m very interested in finding opportunities in the anti infective space  particularly around multi drug resistant organisms   Gottlieb said in an interview   Anti infectives have been unloved for a very long time  There s a huge clinical need  
In many ways  it s a contrarian bet  Global health officials have repeatedly warned about the rise of bacteria and other microbes that are resistant to most available drugs  raising the specter of untreatable infectious diseases that could spread rapidly 
But few large drugmakers are researching new medicines that can combat these so called  superbugs  because the economics often work against them  Drugmakers earn more revenue the more drugs they sell  However  antibiotics are more effective the less they are used 
Last year  pharmaceutical giant  Novartis  AG  S NOVN  said it would abandon its antibiotic research  following similar moves made by peers AstraZeneca Plc  L AZN  and Sanofi SA  PA SASY  
 Pfizer  Inc  N PFE   whose board Gottlieb joined in June after leaving government  is one of the few remaining large players still in the space along with GlaxoSmithKline Plc  L GSK   which this week begun late stage testing of an experimental antibiotic in patients with urinary tract infections and gonorrhea 
Smaller players  meanwhile  have struggled to find financing  Achaogen Inc said earlier this year that it would file for bankruptcy despite having brought a novel antibiotic through FDA approval  Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals  Inc  O TTPH  plummeted earlier this month after it gave a disappointing sales forecast for its antibiotic treatment 
Gottlieb said the sector s low valuations create an opportunity to roll up therapies into a larger company focused on making antibiotics 
 After the Achaogen episode  a lot of valuations have been driven down quite dramatically  I think there s an opportunity to try to find some existing assets and maybe build a company around those assets   he said 
 That s what I think I d be interested in doing   Gottlieb said   There are other investors that are interested in this as well  I think the capital is out there to do that  
While at the FDA  Gottlieb advocated finding new ways to pay for antibiotics  such as a licensing model that would charge hospitals upfront for access to new kinds of anti infective drugs rather than paying for them on a per unit basis 
In the past  Gottlieb was criticized over potential conflicts of interest between his government and private sector work  including an investment in Kure Corp  a privately held vaping company  Gottlieb promised to divest that interest prior to joining the FDA  where he assumed oversight of the burgeoning e cigarette market ",2019-10-29,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exfda-chief-gottlieb-sees-investment-opportunity-in-unloved-antibiotics-2007065,2007065

Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is Pfizer due for a pullback  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a

in the third quarter while raising its guidance for earnings and tightening the same for revenues Third quarter 2019 adjusted earnings per share of 75 cents beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 63

adjusted earnings Revenues of  12 68 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  12 15 billion  Revenues declined 5  from the year ago quarter on a reported basis  On an operational basis  excluding the 2  negative impact of currency  revenues declined 3  year over year as higher sales of some key brands in Pfizer s Biopharmaceuticals group was offset by a decline of revenues in the Upjohn

sales declined 28   down 26  on an operational basis  to  2 2 billion mainly due to U S  loss of exclusivity of Lyrica in July 2019  Excluding the unfavorable impact of Lyrica in the United States  Upjohn sales declined 6  operationally as continued generic competition for certain off patent products offset sales growth in China Revenues from the Consumer Healthcare unit declined 55   54  on an operational basis  to  377 million as a result of the completion of the JV transaction with Glaxo  Consumer Healthcare s third quarter revenues reflect only one month of domestic operations and two

include two additional boxed warnings as well as changes to the indication and dosing for UC following review of a post marketing study  Regarding this update  Pfizer mentioned on the call that it was not sure how the label update will affect prescribing trends of the drug in the future quarters Inlyta revenues increased 98  to  139 million driven mainly by 240  growth in the United States  U S

headwinds than guided previously  Foreign exchange is expected to have an unfavorable impact of  1 4 billion on revenues and 10 cents on adjusted EPS for the year  which indicates more onerous

219745,441261,PFE,Italy business leaders urge government to restore investment scheme,news,"By Valentina Za and Giancarlo Navach
CERNOBBIO  Italy  Reuters    Italian business leaders called on the country s new government on Friday to restore incentives for investment and to support economic growth  while keeping public finances in check 
The country s economy flirted with recession under the previous ruling coalition  which collapsed last month after infighting and repeated confrontations with Brussels over increased budget spending 
Business leaders gathered on the shores of Lake Como for the annual Ambrosetti forum were cautiously hopeful that conditions could improve under the new coalition between the center left Democratic Party  PD  and anti establishment 5 Star Movement 
 This government will definitely do more than the previous one  that s not at all hard   said Alberto Bombassei  chairman of brake maker Brembo  urging the executive to unblock public works 
Italy s investment spending is equivalent to 2  of gross domestic product  a third less than at the start of the decade  Private investments are also below pre crisis levels having shrunk by 30  between 2007 and 2013  according to the Bank of Italy 
Businesses said they hoped for a new version of an incentive scheme for investment and innovation introduced by the former center left government  which was phased out by the recently collapsed coalition in order to raise money to send people into early retirement and provide a basic income for the poor 
 The government needs to pay closer attention to both foreign and domestic investments in the country   said Claudio Brandolino  chief financial officer at the Italian arm of French IT services firm Atos 
 The Industry 4 0 package was a good starting point   he said in reference to the center left s incentive scheme 
The PD 5 Star coalition  however  has little room for maneuver  It must cut spending or find alternative revenues for 23 billion euros to defray a scheduled sales tax increase next year  which businessmen in Cernobbio said had to be avoided at all costs 
It has promised the 2020 budget  a draft of which must be presented to Brussels by mid October  will be expansionary without jeopardizing public finances 
Fiscal discipline is necessary to keep the cost of refinancing Italy s 2 3 trillion euro public debt near the record lows it hit this week when markets welcomed the new pro European government 
 The fall in  bond yield  spreads is a positive sign  but public debt must be reined in   said Andrea Costantini  vice president of Agrati Group  a family owned maker of fastening systems for the automotive sector based north of Milan 
With a question mark hanging over how workable a coalition comprising two former bitter enemies will turn out to be  the desire for political stability topped some people s wish list 
 Political stability is the key element for foreign investments  even more than incentives which you could not otherwise be sure are there to stay    Pfizer   NYSE PFE  Italia CEO Massimo Visentin said ",2019-09-06,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/economic-indicators/italy-business-leaders-urge-government-to-restore-investment-scheme-1972504,1972504

ADR share price performance




Business description
Hutchison China MediTech is an innovative China based biopharmaceutical company targeting the global market for novel  highly selective oral oncology and immunology drugs  Its established commercial platform business continues to expand its outreach 
Portfolio rapidly advancing
HCM continues to make rapid progress towards its goal of becoming an international biotech company with a marketed portfolio of innovative drugs  Of its late stage pipeline  surufatinib  savolitinib and fruquintinib are in pole position to ensure HCM s goal is reached in the medium term  Surufatinib has made significant strides this year  the Phase III SANET ep trial cessation one year ahead of schedule due to overwhelming positive efficacy in advanced stage non pancreatic NET means the drug could launch in China in late 2020  If the global Phase III trial  US and Europe due to initiate in H1 20  results are consistent with data seen in Chinese patients to date  this would pave the way for surufatinib to be the first universal small molecule drug treatment for NET 
NET  Fragmented but highly prevalent disease
Data from Frost   Sullivan indicate the global NET market in 2018 was worth approximately  5 8bn and is expected to grow to  21 2bn by 2030  NET cancers arise out of cells of the endocrine and nervous systems  predominately the digestive and respiratory tracts  NETs can be aggressive or indolent in nature  the latter meaning that patients can survive longer in the course of disease than certain solid tumors  NETs are typically classified as pancreatic NETs or extra pancreatic NETs  a catch all for a tumor that does not arise out the pancreas  and commonly include lung NETs and gastrointestinal  GI  NETs  NETs can be functional   40  of patients  or non functional depending on whether the hormones produced by the tumor lead to symptoms  functional NET  
In China there is significant market opportunity with reported incidence of NET in 2018 of approximately 67 600  While the current prevalence of NET in the US is  150 000 patients  incidence of  19 000 new cases per year   current treatment modalities are typically limited to subsets of NET with only Afinitor approved for a broad range of NETs  pancreatic  GI and lung  
SANET ep supports broad use in non pancreatic NET
Surufatinib s China Phase III program consists of two studies evaluating the drug  vs placebo  in pancreatic NET  SANET p  planned n 195  and non pancreatic NET  SANET ep  actual n 198   thus covering all NET patient types  In June 2019  HCM announced the independent data monitoring committee had recommended stopping the Phase III SANET ep early following positive interim data  This was based on the trial meeting its primary endpoint of PFS and the trial was unblinded a year ahead of schedule  Upon unblinding  patients on placebo had the opportunity to cross over to the surufatinib arm  Surufatinib met primary endpoints and significantly improved investigator assessed PFS  PFS 9 2 months vs placebo 3 8 months  HR 0 334  p




Eligibility criteria for the study included well differentiated extrapancreatic  ep  NET pathological grade 1 or 2 with advanced disease  patients with prior use of VEGF VEGFR inhibitors were excluded  Around 69  of patients on surufatinib had received prior systemic anti tumor therapy  chemotherapy  somatostatin analogues  everolimus  vs 64  on placebo 
Safety was in line with previous data  hypertension  64 3  on drug vs 26 5  on placebo  and proteinuria  70 5  on drug vs 52 9  on placebo   while the most common adverse events were medically manageable  Given surufatinib inhibits three different targets  vascular endothelial growth factors  VEGFRs  fibroblast growth factor receptor 1  FGFR1  and colony stimulating factor 1 receptor  CSF 1R  at therapeutic dosing  its tolerability with combination therapies is an important factor  However  median exposure days on surufatinib  217 days  and placebo  146 days  suggests discontinuation rates were largely due to disease progression rather than tolerability issues 
At ESMO 2019 HCM reported preliminary results of the global Phase Ib study of surufatinib in US solid tumor patients   HCM initiated the US Phase Ib II study in P NET and BTC in July 2018  The two part study design including dose escalation and dose expansion assessed safety and tolerability  It confirmed a safety and PK  pharmacokinetic  profile consistent with studies in China patients  Importantly  surufatinib showed early signs of utility  two partial responses  n 15 pNET patients  in heavily pre treated patients with some receiving up to eight different lines of therapy  The maximum tolerated dose recommended Phase II dose was established as 300mg daily for global development 
Global development plans closely follow China
HCM is building its China oncology commercial team ahead of surufatinib launch  with the intention to have full coverage of China in preparation for launch late 2020  NET will be surufatinib s first  potential  approved indication  Non pancreatic NET is estimated by HCM to represent  80  of NET cases in China  SANET p Phase III data  pancreatic NET H1 20  is critical to widening its market potential to an additional 10 20  of patients  Based on the SANET ep data  of the Chinese patients with advanced disease  prior to enrolment around 40  had received treatment with chemotherapy  30  with a somatostatin analogue and c 10  with everolimus  on the strength of the data presented we believe that surufatinib could provide a universal treatment for NET  particularly if SANET p provides a similar benefit to patients with pancreatic NET  reduction in risk of disease progression   Pricing strategies in China will be important given competitor NRDL reference pricing of  2 007 per month for Sutent and  1 320 per month for Affinitor 
HCM plans to investigate surufatinib in other solid tumors both as monotherapy and in combination therapy with a PD 1 focus  HCM has multiple PD 1 collaborations in place  the Tuoyi  Junshi collaboration  dose expansion study in multiple tumor types is anticipated to start in Q419 
Following encouraging proof of concept data from the Phase II study in BTC  a pivotal open label Phase IIb III trial  NCT03873532  in China initiated in 2019  Interim data on the first 80 patients recruited into this trial are expected mid 2020  BTC represents a high unmet need due to limited treatment options and an increasing patient population 
Surufatinib s global registration clinical trial is in planning stage  The end of Phase II meeting with the FDA is expected in Q419  with US and Europe Phase II III estimated to start in H1 20 
Competitive landscape in NET
To date no targeted therapies have been approved across the broad NET population  Although progress has been made in the treatment of NETs  most approved treatments are for subsets of NET  dependent on the primary site of NET  stage and grade  Treatment options include surgery where possible and long term systemic treatment to treat symptoms and suppress tumor growth include somatostatin inhibitors such as Novartis s Sandostatin LAR  octreotide  and Lutathera  177Lu Affinitor   which slow the hormonal production driving the formation of NETs  ex lung   Approved drugs include somatostatin inhibitors  Afinitor  an mTOR inhibitor  and sunitinib  a tyrosine kinase inhibitor  Exhibit 2 highlights the different treatment options by NET subtype available in the US  In China  the Afinitor label has now been expanded to include the same NET indications as its USA label  pancreatic  GI and lung  




The treatment landscape is fragmented  for example Lanreotide data  CLARINET  supports use in pNET  and GI NET  while Sutent  sunitinib  data support its use in pNET only  Targeting aberrant angiogenic VEGF signalling has been proven with Sutent in treating pancreatic NETs  demonstrating a 5 9 month improvement in mPFS vs placebo  HR 0 42  p
Surufatinib multiple modes of action in cancer
Surufatinib is an oral angio immunokinase inhibitor that targets VEGF1  2 and 3  FGFR1 and CSF 1R kinases  During the last decade modalities of cancer treatment that involve targeted therapy  addressing cancer specific mutations   harnessing the power of the immune system and cancer cell blood supply to treat the tumor microenvironment are additional armaments to traditional chemotherapy and surgical treatment options  As such combination therapies evaluating drugs with multiple mechanism of action are approved  eg EGFR inhibitor plus PD 1 inhibition  or undergoing late stage testing in a multitude of cancer  Surufatinib is a small molecule therapeutic protein that addresses three distinct kinases and thus multiple different regulatory processes that enable cancer proliferation 
Anti angiogenesis via VEGF receptor and FGFR inhibition  VEGF inhibition is a well known mechanism of action  with leading antibody Avastin  FY18 sales   7 0bn  approved for over 30 tumor types in its decade on the market  FGFRs are transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases that mediate cell differentiation  migration and survival  genetic aberrations to FGFRs can lead to a gain in function and have been implicated in the progression of a range of cancers 
CSF 1R is a cell surface protein that acts as the receptor for the cytokine CSF1  which controls macrophage  a type of white blood cell  function  Inhibition of CSF 1R limits the production of pro tumor macrophages  which  among other functions  is believed to aid in angiogenesis  tumor cell invasion and evasion of the immune system  CSF 1R activity  which is very novel and potentially important for PD 1 combinations as there may be synergy  both act by activating the immune system against the cancer   may differentiate it from competitor PD 1 PD L1 inhibitor combination studies with axitinib   Pfizer   NYSE PFE   or lenvatinib 
Surufatinib s three in one profile bodes well for current and evolving treatment paradigms in oncology where immunomodulatory drugs such as checkpoint inhibitors are being used in earlier lines of therapy

Investment summary
Company description  Immunotherapy platform
Transgene is a drug discovery and development company that develops viral vector based immunotherapies for the treatment of cancers and infections  It has two platforms  therapeutic vaccines and oncolytic viruses  Its lead clinical stage programme is TG4010  Therapeutic vaccine TG4010 is being trialled in combination with PD 1 ICIs in first line non squamous NSCLC  Transgene s other clinical candidates are TG4001 in head and neck cancer  TG1050 in hepatitis B  TG6002 in glioblastoma and Pexa Vec   nivolumab  in hepatocellular carcinoma  HCC   Early stage development continues with its Invir IO  anti CTLA 4  and myvac platforms  TG4050   Transgene is based near Strasbourg  France  and was founded in 1979  It was listed on the Nouveau March   now Euronext  in 1998  Transgene is 60  owned by Institut M rieux 
Valuation  rNPV of  287m   3 45 share 
We value Transgene at  287m   3 45 share  vs  312m previously   5 02 share   based on a risk adjusted NPV model of TG4010  TG4001  TG1050  Pexa Vec and TG6002  The decrease in value is driven by the removal of Pexa Vec from our valuation  This decrease has been offset by the gross  48 7m capital raise  assumed net  47m  and  10m upfront from the AZN deal  We have updated our R D cost assumptions across assets  rolled forward our model and updated for FX  Our valuation includes the prospects for TG4010 in NSCLC in the US and Europe  combined peak potential sales of c  2 5bn   TG1050 for hepatitis B in the US and Europe  peak potential sales of c  2 0bn across both regions   and TG4001 for oesophageal cancer in the US and Europe  peak potential sales of c  200m across both regions   Due to a shift in strategy we no longer value TG6002 for glioblastoma and instead now value its potential in colorectal cancer in the US and Europe  peak potential sales of c  800m across both regions   We do not currently include TG4050 or the Invir IO anti CTLA 4 oncolytic virus in our model but will reassess on the start of clinical trials 
Financials   48 7m capital raise enables cash reach into 2021
Transgene reported cash and equivalents of  12 8m at 30 June 2019  vs  16 9m at 31 December 2018   This does not include the post period gross capital raise of  48 7m and the  10m upfront from signing the AZN deal  Net cash burn in H119 was  4 1m vs  8 3m in H119 and the company expects this to be around  20m in FY19  we forecast  20 4m   Transgene has secured a  20m revolving credit facility with Natixis  The credit facility has a 30 month term and Transgene will be able to draw and repay the facility at its discretion  Transgene has used its shares in Tasly Biopharmaceuticals as collateral  We forecast a decrease in 2019 R D based on a reduction in the number of clinical trials year on year while we expect 2019 G A expenses to be largely in line with 2018  We forecast a cash reach into 2021 based on the capital raise and AZN upfront alone with no draw down of the Natixis credit facility 
Sensitivities  ICI combinations may not be conclusive
Transgene is subject to the usual risks associated with drug development  including clinical development delays or failures  regulatory risks  competitor successes  partnering setbacks and financing and commercial risks  The key sensitivities relate to the results of the ICI combination studies of TG4010 and TG4001  The outcome of the TG4010 combination studies in particular will have an impact on its partnership and or the financing prospects for the programme  First results from these trials will be available later this year  We note that the ICI combination trials are small  open label and non controlled  therefore  it is not possible to ascertain the magnitude of the effect of each product separately and assess the actual synergistic effect 
Broad pipeline of assets limits PHOCUS impact
Partner Sillajen has stopped the Phase III PHOCUS trial of Pexa Vec in patients with advanced HCC  hepatocellular carcinoma  after planned interim futility analysis determined the therapy was unlikely to meet its primary endpoint  While the failure is disappointing  we do not feel it is critical to Transgene s future  The potential of the company s pipeline in combination with ICIs  particularly in relation to expanding the eligible patient population who respond to ICIs  remains the key driver of long term value  As such  multiple combination readouts before year end will be more telling of the strategic potential of its assets  notably the data from the Phase II TG4010   nivolumab   chemotherapy  trial in first line NSCLC 
In addition to clinical assets  Transgene continues to rapidly advance its next generation platforms  Invir IO and myvac   The first product candidate  TG4050  from the company s myvac platform is expected to enter the clinic by year end  while the collaboration with BioInvent aims to have its anti CTLA 4 oncolytic virus enter the clinic in Q120 
Global pharmaceutical companies continue to recognise the need to develop the next generation of immunotherapies  This was evidenced by the announcement earlier in the year of the collaboration with AZN to develop five novel armed oncolytic immunotherapies   10m upfront  potential future milestones and royalties   This partnership provides external validation of Transgene s oncolytic virus expertise and in the long term could be a significant contributor of revenue to the company 




Pexa Vec  End of the line
Pexa Vec is an oncolytic virus that targets fast dividing cells with an active EGFR Ras signalling pathway that is believed to cause cells to lyse and stimulate a T cell immune response  Transgene s partner Sillajen has stopped the Phase III PHOCUS trial of Pexa Vec in patients with advanced HCC after a planned interim futility analysis determined the therapy was unlikely to meet its primary endpoint 
The PHOCUS study was an international randomised  1 1  open label study comparing Pexa Vec followed by Bayer s sorafenib  anti BRAF VEGFR PDGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor  versus sorafenib alone in patients with advanced HCC who have not received prior systemic therapy  n 600   Pexa Vec was administered as three bi weekly intratumoural injections at day one and weeks two and four  followed by sorafenib at week six  the comparator arm received sorafenib 400mg twice daily starting on day one  The primary endpoint was OS  secondary endpoints include time to progression  progression free survival  PFS   overall response rate  ORR  and disease control rate  DCR   SillaJen had responsibility for conducting and funding the study and retains rights outside Europe  China and South Korea  Transgene retains development and commercialisation rights in Europe  Lee Pharma retains China rights and Green Cross Pharma has South Korea rights 
The trial was ceased based on the recommendation of the IMDC  The IMDC believed the trial was unlikely to meet its primary endpoint of a statistical increase in OS over the control arm  The trial had enrolled 190 patients at the time of completion  Patients in the PHOCUS trial were randomised to one of two treatment arms where they received Pexa Vec   sorafenib  Nexavar  or sorafenib alone 
Following the failure of the Phase III PHOCUS trial  analysis of the data and conversations with physicians in the field  Transgene has decided to cease the Pexa Vec   nivolumab  Opdivo  Phase II trial  We believe recent struggles for ICIs in HCC  as shown by the failure of the second line Phase III KEYNOTE 240 trial  following accelerated approval of Keytruda in this setting based on Phase II KEYNOTE 224 results  and the first line Phase III Checkmate 459 trial  will also have been factored into the reasoning for the cessation of the trial  particularly as the standard of care  SOC  for HCC continues to evolve rapidly  with recent approvals for tyrosine kinase inhibitor lenvatinib  first line HCC  and cabozantinib  second line HCC  
At this time we do not expect Pexa Vec to be utilised in any new clinical trials 
TG4010  Important data readout approaches
Initial data from the Phase II  NCT03353675  in first line patients testing a triple combination of TG4010  Opdivo  nivolumab  Bristol Myers Squib  and chemotherapy are expected to readout by year end  The trial is a single arm EU US study and is anticipated to enrol 39 patients  without EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangements  who express low or undetectable levels of PD L1  The primary endpoint is an objective response rate and Transgene is funding the study with Bristol Myers Squib supplying Opdivo  For patients without a driver mutation  EGFR  MEK etc  the standard of care has quickly become chemotherapy plus Keytruda  irrespective of PD L1 status  The first line setting could be a significant opportunity for Transgene if TG4010 in combination with a PD  L 1 ICI is proven to be more effective than PD  L 1 ICI monotherapy treatment in low PD L1 expressing patients 
First line NSCLC treatment is now dominated by PD  L 1 approvals  notably Keytruda plus chemotherapy and Tecentriq plus Avastin plus chemotherapy  Transgene s first line TG4010 NSCLC trial will need to demonstrate a comparable or improved ORR  Keytruda combo ORR  48   95  CI  43 45  and Tecentriq triple combo ORR  55   95  CI  49 60   in similar patient populations to be considered for future development  Since the commercial launch of Keytruda  Merck  and Opdivo  Bristol Myers Squib  in melanoma in 2014  PD  L 1 ICIs have become the standard of care in many cancers  FY18 sales of Opdivo and Keytruda were  6 7bn and  7 2bn respectively  




Transgene believes its therapeutic vaccine TG4010  a modified vaccinia Ankara  MVA  virus that expresses MUC1 antigen and interleukin 2  IL 2   could prove beneficial in combination with PD  L 1 ICIs  TG4010 is believed to induce a specific T cell response to target MUC1 expressing cancer cells that when used in combination with a PD  L 1 ICI removes inhibitory effects on the T cell  Along with the MUC1 T cell stimulation  IL 2 enables the differentiation of T cells into effector and memory T cells  which could enhance the response against the MUC1 expressing cancer cells 
TG4010 has previously been tested in combination with chemotherapy  Data from the Phase IIb TIME trial compared chemotherapy plus TG4010 to chemotherapy plus placebo in patients with advanced NSCLC  n 222   For the total population  squamous and non squamous NSCLC   patients receiving TG4010 benefited compared to the placebo arm  ORR  39 6  vs 28 8   duration of response  30 1 vs 18 7 weeks   In non squamous NSCLC patients  the ORR was 40   n 98  in the experimental arm compared with 28  in the control arm  with median duration of response of 41 and 18 weeks respectively  Median PFS in non squamous NSCLC patients was 5 8 months  95  CI  5 5 7 2  vs 5 0 months  95  CI  4 2 5 8  for the control  The median OS in non squamous NSCLC patients was 14 6 months  95  CI  11 1 20 4  vs 10 8 months  95  CI  9 5 14 5  for the control  In a post hoc analysis of all non squamous NSCLC patients  there was a similar level of PFS and OS benefit in the 97 patients with low levels of PD  L 1 expression  
Rest of pipeline still on track for inflection points
Transgene has a range of other product candidates in the clinic with multiple readouts anticipated in the next 12 months  Transgene forecasts readouts for TG6002 in colorectal cancer  administered intravenously  and TG4001 in HPV   human papilloma virus  cancers including oropharyngeal  in combination with PD L1 inhibitor avelumab  in H219 and H1120 respectively  Additionally  Transgene will present Phase Ib trial data at ESMO 2019  27 September to 1 October  for TG4001  Beyond these  new trials are expected to initiate by year end with TG4050 tested in patients with HPV  head and neck ovarian cancers and TG6002 tested in patients with colorectal cancer and liver metastasis  intrahepatic arterial administration  
TG4001  Potential in HPV positive HNSCC
TG4001 is a therapeutic vaccine based on an MVA vector engineered to express HPV 16 antigens E6 and E7 with adjuvant IL 2  In collaboration with  Pfizer   NYSE PFE  and Merck  Transgene is running a Phase Ib II study in second line HPV positive head and neck squamous cell carcinoma  HNSCC  combining TG4001 and the anti PD L1 antibody avelumab  The trial is funded by Transgene  while Pfizer and Merck will provide avelumab  Pfizer and Merck do not have exclusive rights to the data or TG4001  both of which remain Transgene s  Patient enrolment is ongoing with 52 patients expected to be treated  The study is split into two parts  in the Phase Ib component nine patients were tested at increasing doses of TG4001 in combination with a fixed dose of avelumab 
Transgene will present Phase Ib trial data at ESMO 2019 and plans to host a press conference on 3 October to further detail the findings  The published ESMO abstract highlights the treatment of nine patients with oropharyngeal  five   anal  two   cervical  one  or vaginal  one  cancer  Patients had refractory or metastatic cancers and had received at least two prior treatment regimens  Three patients received a low dose  5x106 plaque forming units  pfu   of TG4001 and the other five a high dose  5 x107 pfu   TG4001 was administered SC weekly for six weeks  every two weeks up to M6  and every 12 weeks thereafter  All patients additionally received avelumab at 10mg kg every two weeks  No dose limiting toxicities or serious adverse events were observed  Three out of the nine patients had a partial response  Phenotypic and gene findings supported the idea of a shift in tumours from a  cold  state to an immunologically  hot  state 
In the expansion cohort  Phase II   40 patients with HPV positive HNSCC are being enrolled into a single arm cohort  Patients will receive the highest dose tested in the Phase Ib component of the trial  The primary outcome of the Phase II part will be efficacy as measured by ORR  Interim results are expected in H120  Details of the financial terms  IP rights or other aspects of the agreement between the three parties have not been disclosed 
TG1050  Phase I complete in hepatitis B
TG1050 is a therapeutic vaccine for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B that expresses three antigens of the hepatitis B virus  HBV   Transgene presented Phase I data  NCT02428400  for TG1050 at the AASLD 2018 liver meeting  Data were presented on the safety and immunogenicity of either single or multiple injections of TG1050 at various dose levels  The 48 patients were split into single  n 12  or multiple injections  n 36  cohorts  Patients in each cohort were then randomised across three dose levels  109  1010 and 1011 virus particles  and randomised in each dose level 3 1 to either receive treatment or placebo 
There were no serious adverse events  AE  reported and all AEs were grade 1 or 2 except one grade 3  which was not related to treatment  Immune responses to the HBV antigens that TG1050 encodes for were monitored  Exhibit 3   Detectable responses occurred at the higher doses  1010 and 1011 virus particles  in both the single injection  SD  cohort and the multiple injection  MD  cohort against the three antigens vectorised by TG1050  The intermediate dose  1010 vp  was immunogenic in c 70  of patients 




Additionally  at the 2018 AASLD liver meeting Transgene presented preclinical data on the combination of TG1050 with a range of immunomodulators  TLR9 agonist  PDE5 inhibitor  and direct acting antivirals  siRNA  capsid inhibitor  entecavir   Combinations with the TLR9 agonist  PDE5 inhibitor and the siRNA led to improvements in antiviral effects

TG6002 is a viral vector derived from vaccinia virus expressing the FCU1 gene  The FCU1 gene encodes a protein that catalyses the transformation of the nontoxic pro drug flucytosine into 5 FU and 5 fluorouridine monophosphate  a widely used chemotherapy  Its expression is restricted to tumours  thereby reducing toxicity to normal tissues  The company has conducted numerous in vitro and in vivo experiments to establish its mechanism of action 
TG6002 is involved in a Transgene sponsored Phase I II trial in advanced gastrointestinal adenocarcinoma  colon cancer  and the first patient was dosed  via IV  in October 2018  The trial  NCT03724071  is enrolling 50 patients who have failed  or are intolerable to  standard therapeutic options  Initial data are expected by year end 
Additionally  Transgene is preparing a new Phase I II study in patients with advanced gastrointestinal adenocarcinoma  colon cancer  with liver metastasis who will be dosed by intrahepatic arterial administration  The first patient is expected to be enrolled by year end  Transgene also expects to take TG6002 into a new indication in 2020 
We note the Phase I II trial in glioblastoma with Assistance Publique H pitaux de Paris  principal investigator Professor Delattre  and support from French National Cancer Institute is still enrolling patients  However  it no longer forms a core part of Transgene s strategy  No safety issues have been found to date  according to clinicaltrial gov the completion of the trial is expected in 2021 
Evolving partnerships and platforms
Transgene continues to advance its partnerships and early stage technologies  Notable in 2019 was the announcement of a partnership with AZN to develop oncolytic viruses using Transgene s Invir IO platform  Although early  the partnership could generate significant value for Transgene in the long run  More advanced is Transgene s partnership with Tasly Biopharmaceuticals  which was formed in summer 2018  Tasly paid Transgene  48m in shares and has gained Greater China rights to T601 and T101  The Invir IO collaboration with BioInvent has been expanded to include the development of anti CTLA 4 antibody armed oncolytic vaccinia virus  expected in the clinic in H120   The first product candidate  TG4050  from the company s myvac platform is expected to enter clinical trials later this year 
AZN partnership major validation of Invir IO platform
Global pharmaceutical companies continue to recognise the need to develop the next generation of immunotherapies  This was evidenced by the announcement earlier in the year of the collaboration with AZN to develop five novel armed oncolytic immunotherapies based on Transgene s novel vaccinia virus double deleted backbone  Invir IO platform   Transgene received  10m upfront and is eligible for additional pre clinical milestones of up to  3m  If AZN decides to exercise an option on any of the candidates  Transgene will receive an option payment in addition to eligibility for development and commercial milestones  plus royalties on any future sales 
Transgene is responsible for the design and engineering of the oncolytic virus and for in vitro pre clinical development  AZN will select the genes to be encoded within the viruses and will be responsible for further in vivo pre clinical development  If AZN decides to take up the option on a virus it will then be responsible for clinical development and commercialisation  This partnership provides external validation of Transgene s oncolytic virus expertise and in the long term could be a significant contributor of revenue to the company  We do not currently value the AZN partnership due to its early nature but will reassess this once assets enter the clinic 
Tasly Biopharmaceuticals  Hong Kong IPO still expected
In July 2018  Transgene sold the greater China rights for T601  TG6002  and T101  TG1050  to Tasly Biopharmaceuticals  This was an expansion of a previous partnership formed in 2010 that was based on the development of T601 and T101  Transgene received approximately 2 53  of the outstanding capital of Tasly Biopharmaceuticals  which was valued at  48m  However  the valuation of this holding could decrease or increase depending on future funding events  Tasly has filed its prospectus with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and we expect it to aim complete the IPO as soon as possible  although we note local political unrest could halt or delay any planned filing  Transgene has a 12 month post IPO lock up on its shares in Tasly Biopharmaceuticals 
In China T101 has completed a Phase I trial of T101 for treating chronic HBV infection  T101 is a viral vector that expresses the same suite of HBV antigens as TG1050  The trial is a randomised  double blind  placebo controlled study that enrolled 36 patients who are on antiviral therapy  According to Tasly the trial  produced satisfying results in safety  tolerability and immunogenicity  with both single and multiple injections well tolerated and producing no serious AEs  The trial demonstrated that T101 could stimulate an HBV specific T cell response when injected subcutaneously generated antiviral activity  Future development plans are unclear at this time 
T601 is an oncolytic virus that expresses the same FCU1 gene as TG6002  Tasly submitted an IND application to the China authorities  National Medical Products Administration  in April 2018 and it was approved in April 2019  Under the IND application  Tasly has agreed to commence a clinical trial in advanced malignant solid tumours of the digestive tract  The company expects a Phase I trial to initiate in H219 and plans to enrol 45 60 patients 
Invir IO and myvac  Deals demonstrate value
Transgene s early stage technology platforms Invir IO and myvac are coming to a critical juncture in the next 12 months as they enter the clinic  For myvac  Transgene has announced its plans to start clinical development  partnership with NEC Corporation  for new asset TG4050 by year end  TG4050 is based on Transgene s personalised immunotherapy platform  myvac  and NEC s neoantigen prediction system  Transgene will initiate two clinical studies in H219 focusing on second line  following surgery and chemo  ovarian cancer and second line  following surgery and radiation therapy  head and neck cancer patients  The trials are jointly funded by both parties 
In additional support of the industrialisation of the myvac platform  the NEOVIVA project was awarded a  5 2m grant from Bpifrance s  Investments for the Future  programme  Transgene will receive  2 6m of the grant  The NEOVIVA project is across four companies and aims to develop and validate manufacturing approaches for individualised therapies  The two TG4050 trials will provide proof of concept for the myvac platform 
In 2017  Transgene launched its Invir IO technology platform  The technology aims to use the cancer cell killing capability of oncolytic viruses in combination with the ability of the viruses to insert relevant genes into cancer cells to express other anti cancer compounds  The technology is based around high capacity vaccinia viruses  which are engineered to express a range of anti cancer drugs such as ICIs  enzymes  ligands  chemokines and cytokines  Transgene is developing both its own internal proprietary product candidates and partnered candidates  most notably with AZN and BioInvent 
The BioInvent collaboration is focused on new  unspecified multifunctional oncolytic viruses for the treatment of solid tumours  Transgene will provide its oncolytic virus expertise and technology  Invir IO   while BioInvent will provide its antibody capabilities  including novel antibody sequences  Costs  revenue and royalties will be split 50 50  The first product will look to vectorise BioInvent s anti CTLA 4 antibodies for use in cancers  R D costs  in addition to revenues and royalties from any candidates produced  will be shared 50 50  Transgene has 10 wholly owned preclinical candidates based on its Invir IO platform and anticipates the first product candidate will enter the clinic in H120 
Sensitivities
Transgene is subject to the usual risks associated with drug development  including clinical development delays or failures  regulatory risks  competitor successes  partnering setbacks and financing and commercial risks  The key sensitivities relate to the results of the ICI combination studies of TG4010 and TG4001  The outcome of the TG4010 combination studies in particular will have an impact on its partnership and or the financing prospects for the programme  First results from these trials will be available later this year  We note that the ICI combination trials are small  open label and non controlled  therefore  it is not possible to ascertain the magnitude of the effect of each product separately and assess the actual synergistic effect 
Financials   48 7m capital raise boosts cash reach
Transgene reported revenue for H119 of  4 9m  vs  3 5m in H118   which consisted of  3 1m in government financing for research expenditure and  1 5m in collaboration and licensing income  Net cash burn in H119 was  4 1m vs  8 3m in H119 and the company expects this to be around  20m for the full year  we forecast  20 4m  
Transgene reported cash and equivalents of  12 8m at 30 June 2019  vs  16 9m at 31 December 2018   This does not include the post period gross capital raise of  48 7m and the  10m upfront from signing the AZN deal 
Transgene has secured a  20m revolving credit facility with Natixis  The credit facility has a 30 month term and Transgene will be able to draw and repay the facility at its discretion  Transgene has used its shares  27 4m  in Tasly Biopharmaceuticals as collateral  We forecast a decrease in 2019 R D  to  23 3m  based on a reduction in the number of clinical trials y o y as numerous trials were completed or terminated in 2018  TG4010 in second line NSCLC  TG1050 in hepatitis B and Pexa Vec in HCC  breast and solid tumours   We forecast 2019 G A expenses   7 1m  to be largely in line with 2018  We forecast a cash reach into 2021 based on the capital raise and AZN upfront alone with no draw down of the Natixis credit facility 
Valuation   287m   3 45 share 
We value Transgene at  287m   3 45 share  vs  312m   5 02 share  previously  based on a risk adjusted NPV model of TG4010  TG4001  TG1050 and TG6002  The decrease in value is driven by the removal of Pexa Vec from our valuation  This has been offset by the gross  48 7m capital raise  assumed net  47m  and  10m upfront from the AZN deal  However  we note that on a per share basis our valuation has lowered significantly as a result of the dilution from the  48 7m capital raise  We have updated our R D cost assumptions across assets  rolled forward our model and updated for FX  Our valuation includes the prospects for TG4010 in NSCLC in the US and Europe  combined peak potential sales of c  2 5bn   TG1050 for hepatitis B in the US and Europe  peak potential sales of c  2 0bn across both regions   and TG4001 for oesophageal cancer in the US and Europe  peak potential sales of c  200m across both regions   Due to a shift in strategy we no longer value TG6002 for glioblastoma and instead now value its potential in colorectal cancer in the US and Europe  peak potential sales of c  800m across both regions   We do not currently include TG4050 or the Invir IO anti CTLA 4 oncolytic virus in our model but will reassess on the start of clinical trials
Our key assumptions on TG4010  TG1050  TG6002 and TG4001 are as follows 
TG4010  we model a classical clinical development timeline for the project in NSCLC  There could be considerable upside if the company goes for accelerated filing  and or development is expanded into other cancer indications 
TG1050  our valuation includes the EU and US markets and we have assumed TG1050 will be out licensed on completion of a successful Phase II proof of concept study  We forecast that a partner will fund Phase III trials  registration and commercial launch 
TG6002  we no longer value glioblastoma and our valuation is now based on colorectal cancer patients in the EU and US  For TG6002 we have assumed that TG1050 will be out licensed on completion of a successful Phase I studies  We forecast that a partner will fund Phase II III trials  registration and commercial launch 
TG4001  our valuation is based on HPV positive oesophageal patients in the EU and US who have failed standard therapy ",2019-09-23,Edison,https://www.investing.com/analysis/transgene-phocus-turns-to-earlierstage-assets-200467004,200467004

the second quarter of 2019  While it beat earnings estimates  it fell short of the consensus mark for revenues  The company lowered its guidance for full year earnings and sales Second quarter 2019 adjusted earnings per share of 80 cents beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 77 cents  Earnings rose 4  year over year driven by higher revenues on an operational basis  lower cost of sales and reduced share count  Currency changes had a negative impact of 3 cents per share on adjusted earnings Revenues of  13 26 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  13 32 billion  Revenues declined 2  from the year ago quarter on a reported basis  On an operational basis  excluding the 4  negative impact of currency  revenues rose 2  year over year as higher sales of some key brands in Pfizer s Biopharmaceuticals group was partially offset by generic biosimilar competition for products that have lost marketing exclusivity and decline of Upjohn revenues in China International

13 revenues declined 3  to  1 18 billion  Prevnar 13 revenues declined 10  in the United States  reflecting decreased government purchases for the pediatric indication and continued decline in revenues for the adult indication  Prevenar 13 revenues rose 6  in international markets Meanwhile  due to some unfavorable revisions in ACIP s pneumococcal vaccination guidelines for Prevnar 13 in adults in the United States  Pfizer expects some decline in demand for Prevnar  which can hurt sales in the future quarters Enbrel revenues declined 16  to  420 million in key European markets due to

219883,441399,PFE,SNY Vs  PFE  Which Stock Is The Better Value Option ,opinion,"Investors interested in Large Cap Pharmaceuticals stocks are likely familiar with Sanofi  PA SASY   SNY  and Pfizer  PFE   But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors  We ll need to take a closer look to find out 
The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends  while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits 
Sanofi and Pfizer are sporting Zacks Ranks of  2  Buy  and  5  Strong Sell   respectively  right now  This means that SNY s earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive  so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook  But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors 
Value investors are also interested in a number of tried and true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics  including the popular P E ratio  as well as the P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years 
SNY currently has a forward P E ratio of 12 37  while PFE has a forward P E of 13 12  We also note that SNY has a PEG ratio of 1 84  This figure is similar to the commonly used P E ratio  with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company s expected earnings growth rate  PFE currently has a PEG ratio of 2 93 
Another notable valuation metric for SNY is its P B ratio of 1 59  The P B is a method of comparing a stock s market value to its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  By comparison  PFE has a P B of 3 47 
Based on these metrics and many more  SNY holds a Value grade of A  while PFE has a Value grade of D 
SNY stands above PFE thanks to its solid earnings outlook  and based on these valuation figures  we also feel that SNY is the superior value option right now ",2019-08-05,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/sny-vs-pfe-which-stock-is-the-better-value-option-200451376,200451376

This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 3 90   A quarter ago  it was expected that this drugmaker would post earnings of  0 77 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 85  delivering a surprise of 10 39

What s Next for Pfizer 
While Pfizer has underperformed the market so far this year  the question that comes to investors  minds is  what s next for the stock

Ahead of this earnings release  the estimate revisions trend for Pfizer was mixed  While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company s just released earnings report  the current status translates into a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  for the stock  So  the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future  You can see the complete list of today s Zacks  1 Rank  Strong Buy  stocks here

Revenues are expected to be  13 42 billion  down 0 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Pfizer 
For Pfizer  the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  2 91  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Pfizer will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Pfizer would post earnings of  0 77 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 85  delivering a surprise of  10 39  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Pfizer doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/analysts-estimate-pfizer-pfe-to-report-a-decline-in-earnings-what-to-look-out-for-200443290,200443290
219898,441414,PFE,Can Pfizer s Q2 Earnings Help Boost PFE Stock In A Struggling Pharma Market ,opinion,"Pfizer Inc    NYSE PFE   is set to report its Q2 earnings results on Tuesday  July 30  Investors are hoping the report can boost PFE stock since it is down over 2  YTD 
It is important to note the large cap pharmaceutical market has been struggling as a whole recently  The Large Cap Pharma market is down roughly 1  so far this year  while the S P 500 is up 18  in 2019 

Overview
Headquartered in New York City  Pfizer is one of the world s largest pharmaceutical companies  The company is a component of the so called S P 100 and ranked No  57 on the Fortune 500 list in 2018  Pfizer produces popular over the counter drugs such as Advil and Robitussin  as well as a variety of prescription drugs including Lipitor  Viagra  Xanax  and Zoloft 
Along with some of the most popular drugs on the market  Pfizer boasts a major research and develop leg  as do many pharma companies  Pfizer had 97 drugs in its product pipeline as of April 30  according to its website  Over a third of these drugs are currently in the clinical trial phase  or being registered approved by the FDA 
PFE is trading with a P E of 14 72 at the moment  This is just above the industry average of 14 42  but Pfizer has historically traded below its peers  Although the stock is down YTD  it has gained 7  over the past 3 months  In that same time period  its forward earnings estimates have not increased at the same rate which has caused its P E to increase substantially  Because of this  PFE could potentially be overvalued at its current price of  42 89 

Pfizer also pays a dividend and it has increased its payout by  0 08 annually every year since first announcing its dividend in 2009  PFE s annual dividend is currently  1 44 a share  with a strong 3 4  yield at the moment 
Q2 Outlook   Earnings Trends
In Q2  Pfizer is expected to earn  13 42 billion in revenue  according to our Zacks Consensus Estimates  That number falls 0 31  below the year ago period s revenue of  13 47 billion  Revenue shrinkage is not expected to end after this quarter either  with Q3 revenues projected to sink 4 26   And overall fiscal 2019 sales are expected to fall 1 47  
Looking back  Q1 revenue did pop 2  year over year  primarily driven by growth in key brands and emerging markets  Foreign exchange rates had a significant negative effect on Pfizer s Q1 financials and this problem may persist in Q2 
Meanwhile  Pfizer s adjusted EPS figure is also expected to decline  Current estimates call for EPS of  0 77 in Q2  a 4 94  fall from the same period last year  This expected quarterly decline is part of the reason Pfizer s yearly EPS is predicted to fall 4  from last year 
Bottom Line
Pfizer s growth prospects are not that strong right now  With that said  the company provides income through its solid dividend and PFE stock had tracked the larger market for the better part of a decade  until its recent downturn  In the end  Pfizer is a relatively safe investment given its historical performance and should not be going anywhere anytime soon 
If the firm can post better than expected Q2 earnings it may help it to bounce back from its YTD slump  Additionally  any positive updates regarding the progress of its drugs in development could lift PFE stock

219909,441425,PFE,SNY Or PFE  Which Is The Better Value Stock Right Now ,opinion,"Investors interested in stocks from the Large Cap Pharmaceuticals sector have probably already heard of Sanofi  PA SASY   SNY  and Pfizer  PFE   But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now  Let s take a closer look 
Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities  but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank  The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits 
Right now  Sanofi is sporting a Zacks Rank of  2  Buy   while Pfizer has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold   Investors should feel comfortable knowing that SNY likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than PFE has recently  However  value investors will care about much more than just this 
Value investors are also interested in a number of tried and true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels 
The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics  including the popular P E ratio  P S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors 
SNY currently has a forward P E ratio of 13 05  while PFE has a forward P E of 14 91  We also note that SNY has a PEG ratio of 1 89  This popular metric is similar to the widely known P E ratio  with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company s expected earnings growth rate  PFE currently has a PEG ratio of 2 49 
Another notable valuation metric for SNY is its P B ratio of 1 52  The P B ratio pits a stock s market value against its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities  For comparison  PFE has a P B of 4 03 
These are just a few of the metrics contributing to SNY s Value grade of A and PFE s Value grade of C 
SNY has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than PFE  so it seems like value investors will conclude that SNY is the superior option right now ",2019-07-11,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/sny-or-pfe-which-is-the-better-value-stock-right-now-200439253,200439253

219917,441433,PFE,AFT Pharmaceuticals  A Licensing Deal For Pascomer,opinion,"AFT Pharmaceuticals  ASX AFP  has reported a North American licensing deal for Pascomer  a topical formulation of rapamycin being developed for facial angiofibromas in tuberous sclerosis complex  TSC   to private US based Timber Pharmaceuticals  Timber will fund clinical development and provide AFT with over US 10m in upfront  development and regulatory milestones  as well as over US 10m in sales milestone payments and royalties  An Investigational New Drug Application has been approved by the FDA  The first of two 120 patient clinical studies is expected to start shortly  with results in 2020 

An attractive orphan market
According to the US National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke  TSC affects between 25 000 and 40 000 Americans and one to two million people worldwide  Angiofibromas  which can be highly disfiguring  affect around 80  of patients with TSC  Current therapies are typically surgical  such as chemical peeling  excision and laser surgery 
Evidence of rapamycin efficacy
Oral rapamycin was first approved in 1999 for immunosuppressant use  Initial evidence of its potential efficacy in angiofibromas occurred in a patient who initiated oral rapamycin because of renal transplantation and her facial angiofibromas improve markedly  A review of recent studies indicates that compounded topical formulations of rapamycin have improved lesions in 94  of subjects although there is no topical formulation available commercially 
A low risk development plan for AFT
The licensing agreement with Timber allows AFT to retain some of the upside potential of Pascomer but without having to yield near  to medium term profitability to fund its development  Timber will have full responsibility for R D investment  while AFT will collect high margin royalties if Pascomer is successfully developed 
Valuation  NZ 495m or NZ 5 09 per share
We are maintaining our valuation of NZ 495m or NZ 5 09 per share  To be conservative  we are not including Pascomer development in our estimates due to its early stage but we will revisit this as the programme progresses  Also  the company reiterated its operating profit target is between NZ 9m and NZ 12m for FY20 


Business description
AFT Pharmaceuticals is a specialty pharmaceutical company that operates primarily in Australasia but has product distribution agreements across the globe  The company s product portfolio includes prescription and over the counter drugs to treat a range of conditions and a proprietary nebuliser 
Pascomer for facial angiofibromas in TSC
AFT has announced it has licensed Pascomer  which is being developed for facial angiofibromas in TSC patients  to Timber Pharmaceuticals for over US 10m in upfront  development and regulatory milestones  as well as over US 10m in sales milestone payments and royalties 
TSC is a multisystem  autosomal dominant genetic disorder resulting from a mutation in one of two tumour suppressor genes  TSC1  encoding hamartin  or TSC2  tuberin   TSC is characterised by benign tumours  known as hamartomas  in various organs  most commonly the skin  brain  kidneys  heart and lungs  A hamartoma is composed of an overgrowth of mature cells and tissues  which normally occurs in the affected tissue  TSC affects both sexes and all ethnic groups  affecting as many as 25 000 40 000 individuals in the US and one to two million individuals worldwide  with an estimated prevalence of one in 6 000 newborns according to the US National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke  Angiofibromas  which can be highly disfiguring  affect around 80  of patients with TSC 
Pascomer is a topical version of rapamycin  marketed as Rapamune by Pfizer  NYSE PFE    an immunosuppressant used for prophylaxis of organ rejection in patients receiving kidney transplants  It is also approved for the treatment of lymphangioleiomyomatosis  a progressive disease often associated with TSC that results in lung destruction  Rapamycin is an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin  mTOR   which has many functions in protein synthesis and cell growth and is aberrantly activated in patients with TSC  making it a logical target for development in the treatment of this disease 
Initial evidence of rapamycin s potential efficacy in angiofibromas occurred in a patient who initiated oral rapamycin because of renal transplantation and her facial angiofibromas improve markedly 1 As rapamycin is a potent immunosuppressive  systemic exposure for the sake of improving facial angiofibromas is not ideal and there have been several small studies of topical rapamycin in this indication 
According to one review  94  of the 84 patients treated with a topical rapamycin in various studies showed improvement in their lesions 2 In the one randomised  double blind  placebo controlled study  with 23 subjects  in the review  73  of the subjects who received treatment reported a subjective improvement in their angiofibromas compared to 38  in placebo although the p value was not significant  p 0 18   likely because of the size of the study 3 Importantly  although a variety of different topical formulations were used  rapamycin was detected in only three patients out of the 74 tested for serum rapamycin levels  indicating a lack of systemic exposure  However  one of the issues with the various topical formulations used in these studies is that stability is limited  AFT believes it has developed a formulation using a proprietary dermal delivery technology that would be stable and hence commercially viable 
For intellectual property  there are no unexpired patents related to Rapamune in the FDA Orange Book so AFT appears to be free to operate  We do not know the extent of the patent estate for Pascomer but at the very least it will be eligible for orphan drug exclusivity  which is seven years in the United States and 10 years  worth of data exclusivity in the EU  although we would expect patent coverage to go well beyond that due to the proprietary nature of the formulation  
As part of the agreement  Timber will cover the clinical trial costs associated with clinical development  An Investigational New Drug Application has already been approved by the FDA with the first of two 120 patient clinical studies expected to start shortly in eight centres in the US  the Mayo Clinic   Australia  New Zealand  Spain and the UK  Results are expected in 2020 
Valuation
We are maintaining our valuation of NZ 495m or NZ 5 09 per share as Pascomer development is too early stage to include in our estimates  We will revisit this as the programme progresses 

Financials
We are maintaining our financial estimates as the precise size of the upfront payment is undisclosed  Also  the company has reiterated its operating profit target of between NZ 9m and NZ 12m for FY20 ",2019-07-10,Edison,https://www.investing.com/analysis/aft-pharmaceuticals-a-licensing-deal-for-pascomer-200438320,200438320

219926,441442,PFE,A Recession Proof Industry You Probably Haven t Heard Of,opinion,"Recession proof industries are unique 
They sell stuff that people buy no matter what s happening in the economy things like electricity  internet access  toilet paper  and now pet care 
That s right  America is pet obsessed 
Pet ownership is up  Spending on pets is up  In fact  we actually spend more on our pets during a recession 
We ll dig into the details in a moment  and look at three companies in a niche of this recession proof industry that can bolster your portfolio 
Most of Us Own Pets
Around 85 million US families own a pet  according to the National Pet Owners Survey  That s 68  of US households 
This figure has increased around 2  annually since 2011  But spending on those pets has increased almost 7  annually 
Meanwhile  spending on veterinary care is growing especially fast  From 1991 to 2015  it shot from  4 9 billion to  35 billion  For perspective  that s three times faster than US GDP grew over the same period 
And there s more 
Pet care spending even grew during the last two recessions  29  during the 2001 recession and 17  during the 2008 2009 recession 
You can see this in the next chart  
This all points to a solid  recession proof industry 
It means pet care companies enjoy predictable cash flows and sales growth  even during a recession 
It also means stable share prices for stockholders when they re looking for it the most 
The  Dog Mom  Generation There are demographic reasons behind the jump in pets and pet spending 
To start  US household formation is near all time lows  according to Yardeni Research 
The main reason for this  says the Institute for Family Studies  IFS   is that millennials born between 1980 and 2000 are marrying later  And they re turning to pets for companionship 
Millennials make up 25  of the US population  But they own 35  of all pets  making them the largest pet owning cohort in the country 
Aging baby boomers and empty nesters are also big pet fans 
In 2007  only 34  of adults over age 70 owned pets  But by 2016  the year boomers started turning 70  that figure had jumped to 41  
As I write  fewer than half of the country s 75 million baby boomers have reached their 70s  So the  dog mom  generation still has plenty of room to grow 
And these folks are spending a lot on their pets  The Fastest Growing Area in Pet Care Dog owners spend over  1 000 a year on Fido  on average  So companies that cater to these  dog moms  should continue to thrive 
Overall  spending on pets in the US has gone up every year since 1994  And it s grown 4 6  annually over the last 10 years or three times faster than overall consumer spending 
This is good news for pet care companies  And it makes sense that they ve done well  even during the last two recessions 
Pets are  part of the family  now  Their owners skimp on other things before downgrading to cheaper pet food or cutting back on supplies 
This is especially true for the  15 billion pet medication industry  Sure  you might skip your regular dog grooming appointment during a recession  but you re not going skip your pet s medication 
The booming pet medication market is proof positive of that  Pet medication sales are growing twice as fast as overall pet spending 
The pet medication market will be the highest growth area of the pet care industry for the next decade  reports market research firm Packaged Facts  It expects new products for flea and tick prevention as well as itch relief to drive sales 
And we can get a slice of that 
How to Profit from the Pet Health Market Recession is probably not imminent  But it s coming sooner rather than later 
That s why my focus is recession proof dividend paying stocks right now  It will help you add safety and stability to your portfolio and prepare for this recession 
The pet health market is one way to do that 
One of my favorite pet health companies is PetMed Express Inc   NASDAQ PETS    PetMed is a leading  nationwide pet pharmacy  The company markets over 3 000 prescription and non prescription medications for dogs and cats directly to consumers 
PETS pays a hefty 6 7  dividend yield  It also has a low payout ratio  which is critical to dividend stocks  Shares have struggled a bit this year  but that also means they re attractively priced right now and a good way to take advantage of the growing pet health market 
Next on my list is Zoetis Inc   NYSE ZTS   Zoetis used to be the animal health unit of Pfizer  NYSE PFE   The company is the largest manufacturer of anti infectives  vaccines  and other animal health products in the world 
ZTS pays a small 0 6  dividend yield  However  with a 19  payout ratio  there s plenty of room for the company to increase its dividend payout 
Lastly  we have Pets at Home Group PLC  PAHGF   The company operates a network of stores  pet services  and veterinary services in the United Kingdom 
The company pays a high 4 2  dividend yield  At 125   the payout ratio is higher than I would like  But the company has very low debt and strong free cash flow  So it isn t likely to cut the dividend  despite the high payout ratio 
Remember  this recession probably isn t coming tomorrow  But it s still important to buoy your portfolio now 
You want to buy recession proof companies when you can  not when you need to  And now is the perfect time to add some dividend paying pet health companies to your portfolio ",2019-07-05,Robert Ross,https://www.investing.com/analysis/a-recessionproof-industry-you-probably-havent-heard-of-200437193,200437193

219984,441500,PFE,Exclusive  Pharma sector warns Saudis on German drug curbs,news,"By Noah Barkin and Caroline Copley BERLIN  Reuters    European and U S  pharmaceutical associations have waded into a diplomatic row between Germany and Saudi Arabia  warning that ongoing restrictions on German made drugs could hurt Saudi patients and dampen future investment in the kingdom  In a strongly worded letter to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman  a copy of which has been seen by Reuters  the associations highlighted the level of concern in Germany and elsewhere about restrictive procurement measures implemented by Riyadh in response to criticism of its policies   While a human rights row between Canada and Saudi Arabia has dominated headlines in recent weeks  Germany has been embroiled in its own spat with the oil rich kingdom since November  Germany s foreign minister at the time  Sigmar Gabriel  condemned  adventurism  in the Middle East in comments perceived by some as an attack on increasingly assertive Saudi policies  Riyadh dismissed the comments as  shameful  and withdrew its ambassador to Germany  Since then  Chancellor Angela Merkel has tried to ease the tensions  speaking to Prince Mohammed by telephone  But the row has rumbled on and German officials say companies such as Siemens Healthineers  DE SHLG   Bayer  DE BAYGn  and Boehringer Ingelheim are being excluded from public healthcare tenders in Saudi Arabia   For the past six months German healthcare companies have been having trouble doing business in Saudi Arabia   said Oliver Oehms of the German chamber of commerce and industry in Riyadh   It is not a general boycott  but the healthcare sector is clearly suffering   The dilemma for Berlin has been deepened by the Canada Saudi dispute  which was triggered by a tweet from the Canadian foreign minister calling for the release of human rights activists in Saudi Arabia  The kingdom responded by expelling the Canadian ambassador  recalling its own envoy  freezing new trade and investment  suspending flights and ordering Saudi students to leave Canada  Some German politicians have denounced the Saudi reaction  but the government has remained conspicuously quiet for fear of sabotaging its own conciliation efforts   MAJOR NEGATIVE EFFECTS  News that Saudi Arabia was punishing German companies broke in May  But the existence of the letter  dated June 12 and addressed to Prince Mohammed  has not been reported previously     This action could have major negative effects on the sustainable supply of innovative  critically necessary medicines for the treatment of patients in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia   the letter from the German  VFA   European  EFPIA  and American  PhRMA  pharmaceutical associations reads  It says a decision to exclude German made products from the centralized Saudi procurement process for medical supplies  is likely to significantly dampen industry s perception of Saudi Arabia as a site for future investment in innovative medicines   The associations declined to comment further  but German officials said there had been no response from the Saudis or an improvement in their situation since the letter was sent  The Saudi authorities did not respond immediately to a request for comment  Saudi Arabia is the largest pharmaceuticals market in the Middle East and Africa  with sales of  7 6 billion last year  according to healthcare information company IQVIA  With a growing burden of chronic diseases tied to a more Western lifestyle  Saudi Arabia s overall drugs market is growing at 10 percent a year and the tender sector is expanding by about 30 percent  Neither Bayer nor Boehringer rank among the top 10 drug suppliers in Saudi Arabia  That list is led by  Novartis   S NOVN    Pfizer   N PFE  and local manufacturer Tabuk  according to IQVIA  German exports to Saudi Arabia fell 5 percent in the first half of 2018  They totaled 6 6 billion euros in 2017  with an estimated 15 percent coming from the healthcare sector  AMERICAN HELP Bayer and Boehringer declined to comment  But Siemens Healthineers  which makes X ray and MRI machines as well as diagnostic equipment  acknowledged that its business in Saudi Arabia had been affected and said it had turned to U S  authorities for help in ending the impasse   The decision of the Saudi Arabian government indeed has an impact on our local business   said a spokesman for the Siemens unit  which does not provide a breakdown of its Saudi business   We are working on a solution together with U S  authorities to utilize our global value chain to overcome the restrictions of the Saudi Health Ministry   he added  declining to provide further details  The company employs about 13 000 people in the United States  more than a quarter of its global workforce  and could make the case to American authorities that its U S  operations and jobs will be hit if Saudi restrictions are not lifted  It could also rejig supply routes to send more products from the United States instead of Germany  Johann Wadephul  a senior member of parliament from Merkel s conservative Christian Democrats  CDU   described the row with Saudi Arabia  very damaging    Should there be solidarity with Canada  Yes  But I don t think this should be the focus of German foreign policy in the region   he told Reuters   
 The focus should be on improving relations with Saudi Arabia  Unfortunately  we haven t achieved this so far  ",2018-08-22,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusive-pharma-sector-warns-saudis-on-german-drug-curbs-1583239,1583239

Revenues came in at  7 million  down 27 8  year over year due to lower reimbursement from partner Novartis   NYSE NVS   for the costs incurred to support the company s development of its lead pipeline candidate  emricasan  Moreover  the top line fell shy of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  8 million 
Shares of Conatus have plunged 47 9  so far this year  underperforming the  increase of 11 2  

 
Conatus has no approved product in its portfolio at the moment  The revenues generated by the company are all related to its collaboration with Novartis for the worldwide development and commercialization of emricasan 
Quarter in Detail
In the first quarter  research and development expenses were  9 4 million  down 22 3  from the year ago period s figure  mainly on account of lower spending associated with the ongoing ENCORE PH study on emricasan  This was partially offset by higher spending related to ENCORE LF study 
General and administrative expenses were  2 6 million  marginally down from the year earlier quarter s  2 7 million 
Emricasan in Focus
Emricasan  a caspase inhibitor  is being developed for the treatment of patients with fibrosis or cirrhosis caused by nonalcoholic steatohepatitis  NASH   Conatus acquired the worldwide rights to emricasan from Pfizer   NYSE PFE   in July 2010 
The company is currently conducting two ongoing phase IIb ENCORE programs on emricasan for treating fibrosis or cirrhosis induced by NASH  Those are  ENCORE PH  for portal hypertension  and ENCORE LF  for liver function  
Last December  Conatus announced top line results from a phase IIb ENCORE PH  Under the evaluation  emricasan demonstrated clinically meaningful treatment effects on compensated NASH cirrhosis patients  who stand at a risk of passing to the decompensation state  However  the probe failed to meet its primary endpoint  Following a post hoc analysis  emricasan showed a clinically meaningful treatment impact compared with placebo  Additional results are now expected in mid 2019 
Meanwhile  during the first quarter of 2019  Conatus completed enrolling patients in the phase IIb ENCORE LF study  the primary endpoint being event free survival  Top line data from the investigation is anticipated in mid 2019 
Notably  this March  Conatus announced that the ENCORE NF study  which evaluated emricasan for treating patients with biopsy confirmed NASH and liver fibrosis could not achieve the primary goal as it lacked the desired effect on these earlier stage NASH fibrosis patients  Shares of the company significantly dropped back then 
Additionally  in the same month  Conatus announced that it has selected CTS 2090  currently in preclinical development  to move into clinical studies  CTS 2090 is an orally active  potent and highly selective inhibitor of caspase 1  The company plans to submit an investigational new drug  IND  application by the first half of 2020 to begin clinical assessments on the candidate for treating autoinflammatory diseases 
As of Mar 31  2019  Conatus had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of  33 8 million compared with  40 7 million as of Dec 31  2018  Conatus expects the 2019 end balance in the range of  10  15 million excluding any potential milestone fee under the Novartis collaboration

220034,441550,PFE,What s In Store For Bayer  BAYRY  This Earnings Season ,opinion,"Bayer  DE BAYGN  Aktiengesellschaft   OTC BAYRY   is scheduled to report first quarter 2019 results on Apr 25 
Bayer has surpassed expectations in the previous four quarters  the average positive earnings surprise being 6 98  
The stock has dipped 2 3  in the past year compared with the  s decline of 0 9  

 
Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors to Consider
In 2018  Bayer undertook a series of portfolio  efficiency and structural measures  including exiting the Animal Health business unit  and the Consumer Health brands  Coppertone and Dr  Scholl s  to strengthen its position  The company also plans to sell its 60  interest in German site services provider  Currenta  The company completed the acquisition of Monsanto  NYSE MON  in June 2018 
The combined enterprise will enable Bayer to bring innovations to the market faster  and provide customers with better solution  In December 2018  Visanne was approved by the Chinese regulatory authorities for the treatment of endometriosis  The drug is a once daily oral tablet containing dienogest 2 mg that has been developed specifically for the treatment of this chronic gynecological disease In August 2018  the FDA approved Jivi  BAY94 9027  for the routine prophylactic treatment of hemophilia A in previously treated adults and adolescents aged 12 years or older in the United States  The FDA also approved the same for on demand treatment and perioperative management of bleeding in the same population 
Jivi is a long acting PEGylated recombinant human Factor VIII  rFVIII  replacement therapy  In November 2018  the drug  BAY94 9027  was approved by the European Commission for the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in previously treated patients aged 12 years or older with hemophilia A 
Sales of these drugs should boost revenues for the company during the first quarter of 2019 
Bayer is developing Darolutamide for the treatment of non metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer  nmCRPC   In February 2019  the company completed the rolling submission of a new drug application  NDA  for darolutamide to the FDA 
However  Bayer is facing generic competition for many of its products  including the Yaz franchise  oral contraceptives  
What Our Model Indicates
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Bayer is likely to beat earnings in the to be reported quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  to be able to beat estimates  But that is not the case here  as you will see below 
Earnings ESP  Bayer has an Earnings ESP of 0 00  as both the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the Most Accurate Estimate are pegged at 47 cents  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Zacks Rank  The company carries a Zacks Rank  2 
Note that Sell rated stocks  Zacks Rank  4 or 5  going into an earnings announcement are best avoided Bayer Aktiengesellschaft Price and EPS Surprise

   Stocks That Warrant a Look
Here are some stocks you may want to consider  as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter 
Pfizer Inc    NYSE PFE   has an Earnings ESP of  0 65  and a Zacks Rank  3  The company is scheduled to release its first quarter 2019 results on Apr 30  You can see

220035,441551,PFE,Pfizer  PFE  Expected To Beat Earnings Estimates  What To Know Ahead Of Q1 Release,opinion,"Wall Street expects flat earnings compared to the year ago quarter on lower revenues when Pfizer  PFE  reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on April 30  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This drugmaker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 77 per share in its upcoming report  which represents no change from the year ago quarter 
Revenues are expected to be  12 86 billion  down 0 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 65  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Pfizer 
For Pfizer  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 65  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Pfizer will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Pfizer would post earnings of  0 63 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 64  delivering a surprise of  1 59  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Pfizer appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/pfizer-pfe-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates-what-to-know-ahead-of-q1-release-200409444,200409444

Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement 
Factors in Play
Lannett the generic pharmaceutical company launched 17 products in calendar year 2018  which are expected to contribute significantly to net sales in fiscal third quarter 2019  The company s product launches during the quarter are expected to contribute significantly to sales  Investors  focus will be on the launch of these products  as stated by the management earlier

What Our Model Indicates
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Lannett is likely to beat on earnings in the to be reported quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  to be able to beat estimates  But that is not the case here  as you will see below 
Earnings ESP  Lannett has an Earnings ESP of 0 00  as both the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the Most Accurate Estimate are pegged at a profit of 62 cents  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Lannett Co Inc Price and EPS Surprise

    
Zacks Rank  The company carries a Zacks Rank  2  which increases the predictive power of ESP  However  we need to have a positive Earnings ESP to be confident of an earnings beat 
Note that Sell rated stocks  Zacks Rank  4 or 5  going into an earnings announcement are best avoided 
Stocks That Warrant a Look
Here are some health care stocks you may want to consider  as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter

220037,441553,PFE,Takeda CEO prescribes surgical R D cuts after  62 billion Shire deal,news,By Ben Hirschler LONDON  Reuters    For Christophe Weber  the boss of Japan s Takeda Pharmaceutical  T 4502   securing a  62 billion deal last week to buy drugmaker  Shire   L SHP  at the fifth time of asking was the easy bit  Now he has to steer what will be one of the world s most indebted drugmakers through the big spending cuts needed to make the financial sums work  without destroying the lifeblood of future innovation  At the same time he must win shareholders  support for the largest ever overseas purchase by a Japanese company   something he told Reuters could be helped by bringing in one or more long term  large strategic investor   Talks on this were now starting  he said  but declined to identify the parties involved   Weber said in a interview that his prescription for a smooth merger was planning  speed and a surgical focus on culling experimental drugs that fail to offer the high level of medical innovation demanded by cash strapped insurers and governments   It s really important that we don t waste resource on assets that are moderately innovative  When you combine two pipelines you can be more stringent   he said in London  where he is meeting investors and analysts  Takeda will either dispose of programs that don t make the cut or spin them off into separate biotech companies in which it could retain a stake  the latter being a strategy is has pursued around 10 times in the past  Weber said  It is a delicate task  For the past decade  ramming together two drugmakers in mega mergers has been unpopular  following the R D disruption caused by past deals like Pfizer s  N PFE  acquisition of Wyeth in 2009  Indeed  Frenchman Weber has direct experience of one such deal that fell short of expectations after working at GlaxoSmithKline  L GSK  when it was formed in 2000 by the combination of Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham   It s very important that we keep the momentum and don t get disrupted   he said   We rely on R D to grow    LESS DISRUPTIVE  Takeda struck the agreement to take over London listed Shire on May 8  a deal that will propel the Japanese company from a mid size pharma player into the top 10 rankings of global drugmakers by sales  alongside the likes of  Novartis   S NOVN  and  Pfizer   N PFE   Days later  Weber appointed U S  based executive Helen Giza to oversee overall integration of the enlarged group  which will be tightly focused on gastroenterology  neuroscience  oncology  rare diseases and blood derived therapies  There is a big cultural divide to bridge  Takeda is a 237 year old Japanese institution that began life selling traditional Japanese and Chinese herbal medicines  while Shire was born above a shop in southern England in 1986  But Weber believes he has a key advantage because Shire has been focused on later drug development  rather than early research  so there is no large research center that needs to be closed   I think it will be much less disruptive than in typical M A because of the research set up   he said  A key testing ground for the merger will be in Boston  a global hub of life sciences research  where both Shire and Takeda have large teams that must work seamlessly once the deal closes in the first half of 2019  Takeda has forecast annual cost synergies of at least  1 4 billion three years after the deal closes  including  600 million in R D costs  achieved by cutting duplication and rationalizing research programs  Weber said savings would be helped by the fact that R D investment in certain established Takeda drugs was now winding down  Still   600 million remains a big bite out of two companies  current combined R D spend of  4 4 billion   They are cutting quite deep in R D and it is not clear if the amount of money they are saving is going to be beneficial or harmful   said John Rountree  a partner at pharmaceutical strategy consulting firm Novasecta   Merging R D is never easy  There are going to be lay offs and that creates uncertainty and disruption and sometimes the best talent just leaves   Takeda expects to reduce the overall workforce of 52 000 by 6 7 percent  with R D accounting for just under a third of the cuts  Weber said he recognized the risk of losing key staff and his team was currently working on a staff retention program   FINANCING FEARS Many investors have been lukewarm on the Shire deal because of the debt Takeda is taking on and uncertainty over how it will convert a  31 billion bridge loan into long term financing  Takeda has promised to bring the net debt of the enlarged group down to two times EBITDA within three to five years  from 4 5 times when the deal closes  and believes it can do this without significant disposals or shareholder dilution   In the refinancing mechanism we will use a lot of different instruments but none of them are dilutive   Weber said   Weber said he had never doubted he would persuade investors of the case for the transaction but he acknowledged there had been  uncertainty and misunderstanding  initially  More recently  investor comfort with the deal had improved  he said  The real test will come later this year when Weber will learn if he has secured the necessary two thirds support needed from Takeda shareholders and three quarters backing from Shire investors  One Japanese institutional investor who owns Takeda shares said there were some fears the deal would overstretch Takeda s finances but the benefit from business synergies should outweigh this   We hope Takeda will provide a good explanation to the market and ease the investors concerns   he said  Adding strategic investors could help alleviate some of those worries  potentially mirroring Bayer s  DE BAYGn  recent deal to raise  3 7 billion towards its planned takeover of  Monsanto   N MON  by selling a stake to Singapore s state investment company Temasek   There are multiple possibilities of long term investors  such as government funds or others   Weber said   A long term  strategic  stable investor would be great for us

220074,441590,PFE,Why The Earnings Surprise Streak Could Continue For Pfizer  PFE ,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Pfizer  PFE   which belongs to the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This drugmaker has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 2 11  
For the last reported quarter  Pfizer came out with earnings of  0 64 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 63 per share  representing a surprise of 1 59   For the previous quarter  the company was expected to post earnings of  0 76 per share and it actually produced earnings of  0 78 per share  delivering a surprise of 2 63  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Pfizer  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Pfizer currently has an Earnings ESP of  5 13   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner  We expect the company s next earnings report to be released on April 30  2019 
When the Earnings ESP comes up negative  investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric  But  a negative value is not indicative of a stock s earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher  On the other hand  some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate

Ascendis  shares have gained 90 1  so far this year compared with the  s increase of 9 3  

The pivotal heiGHt study evaluated a once weekly subcutaneous administration of TransCon hGH for a period of 52 weeks compared to the daily subcutaneous administration of Genotropin  Patients treated with TransCon hGH achieved an AVH of 11 3 cm per year whereas Genotropin had a AVH of 10 3 cm per year  The data were presented at the Endocrine Society s annual meeting  ENDO 2019 
TransCon hGH is a sustained release formulation of unmodified hGH  which is used in currently approved daily therapies  It helps patients to manage deficiency in growth hormone with once weekly administration instead of daily intake  Hence  the candidate has significant potential to grab market share  if approved 
Another study   fliGHt   is evaluating TransCom hGH in patients who switch from daily growth hormone therapies to its weekly administration  Data from this study is expected in the second quarter of 2019  The company plans to submit a Biologics License Application for TransCom hGH for treating pediatric GHD in the first half of 2020 
The press release states that GHD in pediatric patients is a serious orphan disease characterized by short height and metabolic abnormalities  which can affect overall physical and mental health  Growth hormone deficiency in pediatric and adult patients represents a market opportunity of more than  3 billion 
Ascendis is a Denmark based clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing several candidates for multiple indications  The company has three pipeline candidates  which are being developed for rare endocrinology diseases  One of them is being developed for treating achondroplasia and was granted orphan drug designation last month 
Ascendis is also focused on developing treatment for oncology indications  Moreover  the company has collaborations with Sanofi   NASDAQ SNY   in diabetes and Genentech  a subsidiary of Roche   OTC RHHBY   in the field of ophthalmology 
With no approved product  the company needs to successfully commercialize its pipeline candidate for growth  However  the company s resources are likely to support operations for more than a couple of years at the current rate of its operating expenses Ascendis Pharma A S Price

The ENCORE LF study is being conducted in about 210 patients who were randomized 1 1 1 to receive 5 mg of emricasan  25 mg of emricasan  or placebo twice daily for at least 48 weeks  The primary endpoint is event free survival  Top line data from the study is expected to be presented in mid 2019 
Shares of Conatus have plummeted 59 7  in the past year compared with the  decline of 9 7  

 
Conatus is conducting three ongoing phase IIb ENCORE studies on emricasan for treating fibrosis or cirrhosis induced by NASH  The programs are called ENCORE NF  for NASH fibrosis   ENCORE PH  for portal hypertension  and ENCORE LF  for liver function  
In December  Conatus announced top line results from the ENCORE PH study  In the study  emricasan demonstrated clinically meaningful treatment effects on compensated NASH cirrhosis patients  who stand at a risk of passing to the decompensation state  The study evaluated the capacity of emricasan to reduce hepatic venous pressure gradient  HVPG  in NASH cirrhosis patients  However  the study failed to meet the primary endpoint 
Meanwhile  top line data from the ENCORE NF study is expected to be presented in the first half of 2019

220151,441667,PFE,At AstraZeneca  fewer drug projects bring big productivity jump,news,"By Ben Hirschler LONDON  Reuters    A focus on fewer diseases  together with cuts in laboratories and staff  has delivered a more than fourfold increase in research productivity at drugmaker AstraZeneca  L AZN   based on one key measure of success  The analysis published on Friday comes at a time of soul searching among large pharmaceutical companies as they compete with smaller biotech firms  which are getting new drugs to market more efficiently  The turnaround evident this decade at AstraZeneca follows a shrinking of its global research and development organization and a revision of R D strategy in 2011  a year before the arrival of current chief executive Pascal Soriot  Soriot has since continued the shift to a deeper and narrower focus on priority therapeutic areas  notably cancer   All these improvements have happened with less people  less sites and less money   Mene Pangalos  who leads AstraZeneca s Innovative Medicines and Early Development unit  told Reuters  Previously  AstraZeneca was a laggard in the pharmaceutical industry with a dismal track record in launching new medicines and a rapidly eroding base business  due to expiring patents on its older medicines  Its average success for getting a drug from the discovery phase through to successful completion of final stage Phase III clinical trials was at an all time low of 4 percent in 2005 10  below the industry average of 6 percent  But in the five years from 2012 to 2016  this jumped to 19 percent  while the industry average  according to consultancy CMR International  was little changed  AstraZeneca scientists published the latest findings in the journal Nature Reviews Drug Discovery  Significantly  there was a marked drop in the number of projects started at the discovery stage  with the total falling to just 76 in 2012 16 from 287 in 2005 10   We re working on far fewer programs and the probability of success on those programs is going up   Pangalos said   Going from 4 percent to nearly 20 percent is something we are all very happy with but I still want us to do better     we re still failing 80 percent of the time   INVESTOR SENTIMENT The productivity boost coincides with an improvement in shareholder sentiment as investors have started to bet on AstraZeneca s ability to replace older medicines with new products  particularly in oncology  A failed bid from  Pfizer   N PFE  in 2014 has also helped the investment story  Today  two thirds of analysts recommend buying the shares  up from one in five in 2012

220179,441695,PFE,Will IPO ETFs Sizzle In 2019 ,opinion,"Expectations are high that IPOs will stage a great show in 2019  though January was freezing for the space   were priced globally  raising  2 7 billion  according to data compiled by Bloomberg  compared with 126 listings raising more than  13 billion last January  A month long government shutdown was held responsible for the worst January for IPOs in three years 
The situation was slightly better off beyond the border with 54 offerings raising  2 3 billion  It still marked a third of the  on non U S  exchanges in January 2018  per Bloomberg 
Inside the Market Pulse 
According to a December survey by BDO USA  71  of capital market executives at leading investment banks expect IPO activity to rise  or at least   which was the best year for deals since 2014  as quoted on MarketWatch 
The survey sees 37  of bankers expecting private equity portfolios to generate the most IPOs this year  while 35  expect venture capital to break new ground  The latest market rally despite the government shutdown should pave the path for IPOs 
Hurdles in Sight 
Government shutdown kept the space shut in January With the SEC deferring the completion of reviews  Q1 IPO activity may see a slowdown but the long term picture looks rosy  per the survey 
While the government has restarted operations at January end with a Feb 15 deadline for reaching a permanent deal on the Mexico border wall funding  the chance of a second round of shutdown is high  This is because Democrats are still against funding the border wall  However  once a deal is reached   can be offered to companies in the pipeline  read    
What s Hot Now 
Biotech IPOs are the trending right now  For example  two biotech IPOs with proposed billion dollar valuations   Alector plans to raise  176 million at a market cap of  1 4 billion  and will start trading on Feb 7  And Gossamer Bio looks to raise  230 million at a  1 0 billion market cap on Feb 8 
Meanwhile  BioNTech AG  a European biotechnology company  with Pfizer Inc   NYSE PFE  and Sanofi  PA SASY   is considering an initial public offering in the United States  TCR2 Therapeutics  known for improved immuno oncology treatments for various forms of cancer   of its common stock in an IPO 
There are names beyond the biotech  Cibus  which has created a platform for non transgenic seed modification   for its  100 million IPO  Then there are bigger names like Uber Technologies Inc  s planned listing  Lyft Inc  has also been awaiting the SEC s response on  
This year s other bigshot IPO candidates include Airbnb Inc   which is reportedly eyeing an IPO sometime between June and the end of 2020  And Slack Technologies  to go public 
IPO ETFs to Play
In the view of an upbeat environment  barring shutdown woes   one should keep a tab on IPO ETFs like First Trust US Equity Opportunities ETF   V FPX   and Renaissance IPO ETF   TO IPO    Both funds have been steady this year with a respective 13 8  and 20 9  return

220221,441737,PFE,Is Global X SuperDividend U S  ETF  DIV  A Strong ETF Right Now ,opinion,"Designed to provide broad exposure to the Total Market  U S   ETFs category of the market  the Global X SuperDividend U S  ETF  DIV  is a smart beta exchange traded fund launched on 03 11 2013 
What Are Smart Beta ETFs 
The ETF industry has long been dominated by products based on market cap weighted indexes  a strategy created to reflect the market or a particular market segment 
Market cap weighted indexes offer a low cost  convenient  and transparent way of replicating market returns  and are a good option for investors who believe in market efficiency 
But  there are some investors who would rather invest in smart beta funds  these funds track non cap weighted strategies  and are a strong option for those who prefer choosing great stocks in order to beat the market 
By attempting to pick stocks that have a better chance of risk return performance  non cap weighted indexes are based on certain fundamental characteristics  or a combination of such 
Even though this space provides many choices to investors  think one of the simplest methodologies like equal weighting and more complicated ones like fundamental and volatility momentum based weighting  not all have been able to deliver first rate results 
Fund Sponsor   Index
The fund is managed by Global X Management  DIV has been able to amass assets over  404 69 M  making it one of the largest ETFs in the Total Market  U S   ETFs  DIV seeks to match the performance of the INDXX SuperDividend U S  Low Volatility Index before fees and expenses 
The INDXX SuperDividend US Low Volatility Index tracks the performance of 50 equally weighted common stocks  MLPs   REITs that rank among the highest dividend yielding equity securities in the US 
Cost   Other Expenses
Cost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF  and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins if all other fundamentals are the same 
With one of the cheaper products in the space  this ETF has annual operating expenses of 0 45  
It s 12 month trailing dividend yield comes in at 6 76  
Sector Exposure and Top Holdings

220226,441742,PFE,China biotech s  coming out party  masks long road ahead,news,By Ben Hirschler and Adam Jourdan LONDON SHANGHAI  Reuters    Investors are betting on China s potential to feed the global pharmaceutical pipeline  putting a multi billion dollar price tag on a handful of stocks  even as the country struggles to close a huge R D gap with the West  Shares in firms such as Chi Med  Beigene and Zai Lab have soared on international markets this year  fueled by hopes for their drugs and recent reforms to China s regulatory system that should speed up approvals   It s almost a coming out party for China biotech   said Christian Hogg  chief executive of Hutchison China MediTech or Chi Med  which presented promising data at a global medical congress this week on a lung cancer drug it discovered in China and is developing with AstraZeneca   China is in vogue because of the positive moves on the regulatory side  as well as advances at companies  It s a big  big change versus 10 years ago and it is accelerating   Importantly  national and provincial authorities are also moving faster to agree payments for innovative drugs  albeit after negotiating price discounts in many cases  Yet amid the euphoria it is easy to lose sight of the fact that China still has far to go  It contributes just 4 percent of global drug innovation   as measured by the number of products in development and recent launches   against 50 percent from the United States  according to an October 2016 report from four Chinese pharmaceutical associations   It is very apparent they are trying to transition to being more of a novel drug development environment and bring in more innovative research   Scott Gottlieb  head of the U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA   told Reuters    I think it s going to be a long transition     we built up an ecosystem in this country over decades and decades   China s traditional strengths lie in generic drugs and the bulk production of active pharmaceutical ingredients that are found in pills in pharmacies worldwide  The shift in focus to original research is a change in mindset  although it builds on the success of contract research and manufacturing company WuXi Biologics  which does much of the legwork for China s budding biotechs   REFORMING DRUGS WATCHDOG Bi Jingquan  the reformist bureaucrat who has led China s drugs watchdog the CFDA since 2015  views innovative   and affordable   drugs as the key to meeting the country s growing clinical demands  China is now the world s second biggest drugs market after the United States  with more cases of cancer and diabetes than any other nation  fueled by fast food  smoking and pollution  But the CFDA head lamented in a recent speech that Chinese domestic drug industry R D investment was only 42 billion yuan   6 3 billion  last year  a small slice of the  157 billion spent worldwide by drug companies in 2016  according to market intelligence group EvaluatePharma  Redressing the balance is a priority   We want to make our pharma industry big and strong  make our drug companies more competitive  so that we can shift our country s long standing reliance on imported new drugs   said Bi Jingquan s deputy Wu Zhen  A big part of that involves overhauling regulation  with a new system now in place to accelerate full and conditional drug approvals as the CFDA strives to narrow a typical five to seven year lag between how long new drugs reach the market in China compared with Western countries  Plans announced last week mean the agency will now accept data from overseas clinical trials  That was applauded by  Pfizer   NYSE PFE   the top foreign drugmaker in China  highlighting the stiff competition still facing local biotechs  So far many of the new drugs discovered in China are follow on medicines in established therapeutic classes rather than ground breaking first in class treatments  Some global companies like Swiss based Novartis and Roche  with deeper institutional scientific knowledge  are also tapping into China s science base to discover their own promising new drugs in the country  Still  Chinese firms are notching up their first home grown successes  particularly in cancer  with Shenzhen Chipscreen Biosciences winning a CFDA green light for the first modern oncology drug  used to treat a rare lymph node cancer  in 2015   Now Chi Med  working with Eli Lilly  hopes for approval of what would be a broad use bowel cancer medicine  fruquintinib  around the end of this year  On the international stage  Beigene and Chi Med are also racing to be first to bring China discovered cancer drugs to U S  and European patients  often doing deals with global firms that can provide marketing expertise outside China  In July  Beigene signed a deal worth up to  1 4 billion with Celgene  NASDAQ CELG   licensing a promising cancer immunotherapy drug candidate to the U S  group in the largest ever transaction involving a Chinese medicine   LONG CYCLE BUSINESS Beigene CEO John Oyler is convinced Chinese drug discovery is on a roll  backed by powerful interests in Beijing who want to forge a leading position in the sector  just as China has done in energy  finance and telecoms   The day you see a China grown company that is one of the five major global pharmaceutical companies is approaching   he said  though he admitted recent big share price rises were  not commensurate with clinical data being reported   Others pointed to an under developed academic ecosystem in China and the fact most big local drugmakers were deeply rooted in generics  despite outward talk of innovation   It s easy to say I want to do new drug development  but then it s harder to see yourself spending  100 million and then fail   Samantha Du  chief executive of Zai Lab  told Reuters at the company s headquarters in Shanghai  Du was also a co founder and chief scientific officer of Chi Med until 2011  Zai Lab  which listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange in September  has a drug discovery program focused on immuno oncology  though for now its pipeline is dominated by molecules bought in from the likes of GlaxoSmithKline  Sanofi  PA SASY  and Tesaro  Du hopes to change that one day but says it won t happen overnight   It s such a long cycle  if you want to discover and develop drugs from ground zero  that s 12 15 years   she said   It s going to take time  ,2017-10-19,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/china-biotechs-coming-out-party-masks-long-road-ahead-543952,543952

This pilot study was initially designed as a larger phase II trial to be conducted in the United States  enrolling Japanese subjects and Japanese American subjects that are within second generation  However  due to lesser number of qualified subjects in the United States  the enrollment of this study was limited to approximately 40 subjects across three study arms 
Aerie expects to initiate a phase II study in Japan in the first quarter of 2019  as agreed with the PMDA  with the addition of a 0 01  concentration of netarsudil

220240,441756,PFE,Conatus  CNAT  Focuses On Developing NASH Candidate Emricasan,opinion,"On Dec 27  we issued an updated research report on Conatus Pharmaceuticals Inc    NASDAQ CNAT    This San Diego based company has no approved product in its portfolio at the moment and focuses on developing its lead pipeline candidate  emricasan 
Emricasan  a caspase inhibitor  is being developed for the treatment of patients with fibrosis or cirrhosis caused by nonalcoholic steatohepatitis  NASH   Conatus acquired the worldwide rights to emricasan from Pfizer   NYSE PFE   in July 2010  It has an exclusive option  collaboration and license agreement with Novartis   NYSE NVS   for the worldwide development and commercialization of emricasan 
Conatus is conducting three ongoing phase IIb ENCORE studies on emricasan for treating fibrosis or cirrhosis induced by NASH  The programs are  namely ENCORE NF  for NASH fibrosis   ENCORE PH  for portal hypertension  and ENCORE LF  for liver function  
Earlier this month  Conatus announced top line results from phase IIb ENCORE PH study  which evaluated emricasan in patients with compensated or early decompensated NASH cirrhosis and severe portal hypertension  The study examined the capacity of emricasan to reduce hepatic venous pressure gradient  HVPG  in NASH cirrhosis patients  Although emricasan demonstrated clinically meaningful treatment effects in compensated NASH cirrhosis patients  who stand at a risk of passing to the decompensation state  it failed to meet the primary endpoint 
The ENCORE NF assessment is investigating emricasan for potential improvements in fibrosis and steatohepatitis pertaining to patients with fibrosis caused by NASH  Top line data from the study is expected in the first half of 2019 
The ENCORE LF study is inspecting emricasan in patients with decompensated NASH cirrhosis  Notably  top line results from the study will be presented in mid 2019  much earlier than the previously estimated timeline of the second half of 2019 
Notably  the NASH market holds untapped prospects  People afflicted with diabetes  high cholesterol or high triglycerides are often diagnosed with the disease  which is feared to become the fastest growing cause for liver transplant and liver cancer  With no treatments currently available for this indication  the market opportunity for emricasan seems significant  By 2025  the worldwide market for NASH treatments is estimated to reach a value of  35 billion 
Given such an upbeat scenario  we believe that emricasan has the power to capture a large market share on approval 
Apart from emricasan  another candidate in Conatus  portfolio is IDN 7314  which is currently being evaluated in a phase II study for the treatment of primary sclerosing cholangitis  PSC   a chronic liver disease  Notably  the candidate enjoys an Orphan Drug Designation  ODD  for the indication in both the United States and across the EU 
So far this year  shares of Conatus have plummeted 72 1   significantly wider than the  decrease of 7 4  

 
Zacks Rank   Other Key Pick
Conatus currently carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   Another top ranked stock in the same sector is Bovie Medical Corp    NYSE BVX    sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see

220253,441769,PFE,A biotech CEO who sold his last company for  14 billion explains why he wants to do things differently this time,news,"David Hung wants to do things differently at his new company 
Hung s the CEO of Axovant  a company that has a shot to launch the first new Alzheimer s drug in 15 years  Before joining the company in April  Hung founded Medivation  a cancer drugmaker based San Francisco that  Pfizer   NYSE PFE  bought for  14 billion in August 2016 
But selling Medivation wasn t initially part of the plan  And now he s trying to make sure it doesn t happen again 
 We never looked to get acquired   Hung said   We were on a great trajectory  we had created a drug that was the biggest selling prostate cancer drug in the world  we d crossed  2 billion in revenue  
The company was growing  and its pipeline looked solid as well   Our intention was to be a fully integrated large pharmaceutical company   Hung said 
In the end  that didn t happen 
Because Medivation was publicly traded  it was hard to turn down a  14 billion offer from Pfizer  a  over its stock price at the time  But now he thinks he can grow an even bigger company 
That s in part because Medivation shared the sales of its leading prostate cancer drug  Xtandi  with Astellas  That s not the case with Axovant  which entirely owns intepirdine  the drug Axovant s developing to treat Alzheimer s 
 Medivation was  14 3 billion  but we had less than half of Xtandi   Hung said   Had we owned all of Xtandi  Medivation should have been a  30 billion company  
Axovant  incorporated in Switzerland  also benefits from a lower tax rate than Medivation  which was incorporated in the US  The combination of owning all of intepirdine  the tax rate  and the number of patients who could potentially benefit from the drug has Hung convinced that if the trial is positive  Axovant could become even bigger than Medivation was  Axovant s current market cap is  2 5 billion 
 We think that we have the chance to make a really substantial company and with that we ll have the opportunity to impact many areas of neurology and perhaps even beyond neurology   Hung said ",2017-09-11,Business Insider,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/a-biotech-ceo-who-sold-his-last-company-for-14-billion-explains-why-he-wants-to-do-things-differently-this-time-527392,527392
220259,441775,PFE,Pfizer  PFE  Up 4 3  Since Last Earnings Report  Can It Continue ,opinion,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Pfizer  PFE   Shares have added about 4 3  in that time frame  outperforming the S P 500 
Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release  or is Pfizer due for a pullback  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers  Pfizer Beats on Q3 Earnings  Narrows ViewPfizer reported third quarter 2018 adjusted earnings per share of 78 cents  which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 76 cents  Earnings rose 16  year over year driven by a lower tax rate and share count due to share buybacks in the quarter  Higher other income and currency tailwinds also contributed to bottom line growth The company recorded revenues of  13 3 billion  which slightly missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Revenues rose 1  from the year ago quarter on a reported basis  Currency fluctuation hurt sales by 1  in the quarter due to a strong dollar and weakening of certain emerging markets currencies and euro  On an operational basis  excluding the impact of currency  revenues rose 2  year over year Higher sales of key brands  Ibrance  Eliquis and Prevnar  were partially offset by loss of exclusivity for some products  lower sales of legacy Established Products in developed markets and continued supply shortages in legacy Hospira products International revenues rose 5   up 6  an operational basis  to  6 94 billion  U S  revenues declined 3  to  6 36 billion Revenues from the Consumer Healthcare segment  which Pfizer is considering selling  rose 2  to  839 million  Global Oncology revenues increased 11  to  1 78 billion  Global Vaccine revenues rose 13  to  1 85 billion  Internal Medicine rose 1  to  2 46 billion  The Inflammation   Immunology franchise rose 4  to  1 02 billion  However  the portfolio of Rare Disease declined 5  to  531 million Segment DiscussionPfizer s reporting segments are Pfizer Innovative Health  IH  and Pfizer Essential Health  EH  Pfizer IH sales grew 4  on a reported basis  up 5  an operational basis  from the year ago period to  8 47 billion as higher sales of Eliquis and Xeljanz globally  Ibrance in international markets and Prevnar 13 and Xtandi in the United States offset lower sales of Enbrel With Viagra losing exclusivity in December 2017  its U S  and Canada sales are now reported in the EH segment against IH previously  This hurt sales of the IH segment while adding to EH segment sales Ibrance revenues rose 18  year over year to  1 03 billion as higher international sales offset a decline in the United States  Ibrance sales outside the United States rose 98  driven by continued uptake in developed Europe and launch in Japan  In the United States  Ibrance sales declined 1  due to rising competition and increased rebates In the CDK inhibitors category  Ibrance holds 90  share in terms of new prescription volume despite rising competition  Xeljanz sales rose 26  to  432 million driven by continued growth in rheumatoid arthritis revenues and some early contributions from the drug s recent expansion into psoriatic arthritis and ulcerative colitis  Eliquis alliance revenues and direct sales rose 36  to  870 million  Chantix sales rose 9  to  261 million in the quarter  However  Lyrica sales declined 2  to  1 13 billion Xtandi recorded alliance revenues of  180 million in the quarter  up 20  year over year  In July  Xtandi s U S  label was expanded to include men with non metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer  Xtandi was approved for the same indication in the EU in October  This label expansion can drive growth in 2019 Global Prevnar 13 Prevenar 13 revenues rose 10  to  1 66 billion  Prevnar 13 revenues rose 12  in the United States due to higher government purchases than last year for the pediatric indication  Prevenar 13 revenues rose 6  in international markets driven by higher volumes for the pediatric indication due to increased orders from the Gavi Alliance and launch in China Enbrel revenues declined 11  to  531 million in key European markets due to continued biosimilar competition Pfizer EH segment sales declined 4   both on a reported and operational basis  to  4 83 billion EH revenues were hurt by the loss of exclusivity and associated generic competition for products  primarily Pristiq and Viagra in the United States and Lyrica in Europe and lower revenues from sterile injectables portfolio due to continued legacy Hospira product shortages in the United States  Pfizer is facing supply shortages for sterile injectable products  SIP  from the legacy Hospira portfolio mainly due to capacity constraints and technical issues  On the call  the company said it expects these issues to be resolved by end of 2019 Also  lower sales of legacy Established Products in developed markets driven by industry wide pricing challenges hurt EH segment sales Total Viagra sales declined 55  to  137 million due to generic competition that began in December 2017 However  in the EH business  biosimilars and emerging markets did well in the quarter  Biosimilars revenues rose 40  operationally while emerging markets revenues grew 11  operationally While Inflectra recorded sales of  71 million in the United States and  166 million globally  other biosimilars brought in sales of  31 million  up 6   Other DetailsAdjusted selling  informational and administrative  SI A  expenses were flat  operationally  in the quarter at  3 47 billion  Adjusted R D expenses rose 8  to  2 0 billion In the quarter 2018  Pfizer bought back shares worth  1 1 billion  As of Oct 30  2018  Pfizer s remaining share repurchase authorization was  7 4 billion 2018 GuidancePfizer narrowed its earnings as well as sales expectations for the full year Revenues are expected in the range of  53 0 billion to  53 7 billion compared with of  53 0 billion to  55 0 billion previously Pfizer attributed the lowered sales outlook to weaker than expected revenues in the EH segment  due to continued shortages in the sterile injections business  and currency headwinds The guidance assumes no generic competition for Lyrica in the United States until June 2019 Adjusted earnings per share are expected in the range of  2 98  3 02 compared with of  2 95  3 05 billion expected previously  At the mid point  adjusted EPS is still expected to increase 13  Research and development expenses guidance was maintained in the range of  7 7  8 1 billion while SI A spending is projected in the range of  14 0  14 5 billion versus  14 0  15 0 billion expected previously Adjusted tax rate is still expected to be approximately

The EC decision was based on positive CHMP opinion  Data from a phase I clinical trial  its follow up trial  and the first randomized  controlled phase III gene therapy trial for an inherited disease supported the decision  Data from the phase III trial showed that vision improvement was recorded as early as 30 days following the treatment 
Please note that Spark Therapeutics has a licensing and commercialization agreement with Novartis Pharma   NYSE NVS    which granted the latter rights to develop and commercialize Luxturna outside the United States  Thus  Novartis will be responsible for launch and distribution of the gene therapy in Europe  Spark Therapeutics will manufacture and supply Luxturna to Novartis under a supply agreement 
Under the terms of the agreement  Spark Therapeutics received an upfront payment of  105 million and is eligible to receive additional  65 million in milestone payments from Novartis  However  the majority of the total  170 million in upfront and anticipated milestone payment will be considered as revenues as and when Luxtarna is supplied to Novartis  Novartis will also pay royalties on ex U S  net sales of Luxturna 
Adoption of Luxtarna in Europe remains to be seen along with its impact on Spark Therapeutics  revenues 
We remind investors that Luxturna was approved in December last year for a similar indication in the United States 
Spark Therapeutics  shares were up 1 5  on Nov 23  following the news  However  shares of the company have declined 47 7  in the past six months compared with the  s decrease of 11 1

In the third quarter  the company recorded  8 9 million in sales of Luxturna  which was almost 32  higher than sales of  6 7 million achieved in the first six months of 2018  However  the company is concerned with timely identification of patients with RPE65 mutation  The company plans to shift its focus to support faster identification of patients in 2019 
The company also has a global collaboration agreement with Pfizer   NYSE PFE   under which it is developing a gene therapy for the treatment hemophilia B  Per the terms of the agreement  Spark Therapeutics transitioned a gene therapy candidate to Pfizer for late stage development  In July 2018  Pfizer initiated a phase III study to evaluate fidanacogene elaparvovec  Apart from this  Spark Therapeutics is also developing two gene therapies in early stage studies for treating choroideremia  a progressive vision loss disorder and hemophilia A Spark Therapeutics  Inc  Price

220317,441833,PFE,These 1 Click  Dividend Machines  Yield 8 8  With 56  Upside,opinion,"Certain closed end fund  CEF  investors are getting a little desperate for dividends  It s tough to blame them for reaching for 5   6  and even 7   yields in a 2  to 3  world 
But by grossly overpaying for funds  they are risking too much capital to bank these payouts  If you own any of the five popular funds I m about to call out  you should consider selling them immediately 
 There are bargain replacements  after all  I m talking about funds trading as cheap as  0 88 on the dollar and yielding 7 2   We ll discuss specifics in a moment  
 First level  income seekers can be greedy one minute and fearful the next  We contrarians make our living  and retirement  by purchasing out of favor payouts and selling dividends that are too dear 
Today there are funds trading for as much as  1 39 per share for just  1 in assets  There are others selling at half that price for equivalent portfolios  Here s why this happens   and how we can capitalize on it 
This Discount Premium as Margin of Safety  or Lack Thereof 
CEFs  unlike their   open end   mutual fund cousins  have fixed share counts  This makes their prices subject to the animal spirit whims of the market   for better or for worse 
As usual  despair is our friend  When CEF investors throw in the towel  the funds they discard can see their shares trade at discounts to their net asset value  NAV   This is basically  free money  for us 
If a fund trades at a 12  discount to its NAV  it means we re able to buy its underlying assets for just 88 cents on the dollar  That s exactly the type of  discount to intrinsic value  that many successful stock market investors strive for 
Plus  savvy managers have ways they can force their own discount window to shut again  Such as buying back their own cheap shares 
On the other hand  when CEF investors get greedy  they actually pay premiums for funds  Bad idea  Let me show you why  and give you five  first level favorites  to avoid 
Don t Overpay  A 9   Payer Returns Just 2   Annually
Doubleline Opportunistic Credit  NYSE DBL  has traded at a rich 8  average premium for the last three years as investors flocked to its high  9    yield and celebrity  Bond God  manager Jeffrey Gundlach  An 8  premium means buyers paid  1 08 for just  1 in assets 
How d that bidding war work out  Not well  with the fund returning just 7  over the entire three year period   including the dividends 
A Lackluster Total Return  Just 7  in 3 Years
Income investors bought the generous dividend but lost most of it in price depreciation  They made the same mistake as those who pay a high price to earnings  P E  multiple for a stock  They simply got crushed when the multiple began to contract 
Why  The  Premium Multiple  Contracted
Unfortunately folks are still paying a 3  premium to get into this fund  And that doesn t make much sense with sister fund DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund  NYSE DSL  trading for a 1  discount to its NAV  Same brilliant bond guru  same wide mandate  way better price 
My Contrarian Income Report subscribers smartly chose DSL over DBL in April 2016  The discount disparity was even larger back then  making it extra lucrative to think contrarily 
Price Matters  DSL Returned 56  to DBL s 7 
If we re looking for yield to provide us with retirement income without having to worry about share prices  then we should generally fade premiums 
4 More First Level Favorites  for Mediocre Returns  or Worse 
You probably know the  Bond King  Bill Gross  How about his successor  Dan Ivascyn 
When Gross left PIMCO  a tide of cash followed him out the door  But the flow of money quickly subsided when Ivascyn stepped to the plate and outperformed Gross himself  PIMCO let the King walk because they had their next superstar in waiting 
A money manager of Ivascyn s caliber will usually cost 2  annually  plus 20  of profits   And it d take a million bucks or two to get his attention 
So it s understandable that investors would try to  reach  for Ivascyn and overpay for his fund  That s exactly what happened with PIMCO Global StocksPLUS   Income Fund  NYSE PGP  
In fact  two more PIMCO funds round out our  5 most overpriced  list  If Ivascyn   Co  are at fault  it s for being too good at what they do  Sadly  though  investors who buy today are paying too much   and likely to see their dividends eaten up by price declines  or worse  in the years ahead 
4 More Popular Premiums to Avoid
Don t despair though  While there is certainly some froth in CEF land  there are still some dividend superstars to be had  All we need is a bit of second level thinking 
Contrarian Income Tip  Buy Discounted CEFs as Rates Rise
Here s a little known secret that will help you identify funds that are unfairly discounted 
Higher rates don t really hurt CEFs 
The theory scares people because it sounds true  Closed ends have the benefit of borrowing money at Libor to leverage up their returns  Libor is tied closely to the Fed funds rate  So  the thinking goes  higher Fed rates will end the  cheap money  party that benefits CEFs 
Some funds today are selling at discounts to their NAVs on the fear that rate increases will hurt them  But this lazy conclusion is wrong 
In June 2004  Fed chair Alan Greenspan began boosting rates from then historic lows  Over a two year period  he increased the federal funds rate from 1  to 5 25   A dizzying pace by today s standards 
How d CEFs perform  Let s consider the tax advantaged Nuveen AMT Free Municipal Credit Income  NYSE NVG   which rose in harmony with Alan Greenspan s Fed Funds Rate 
Fed Rate and Muni CEFs Rose in Harmony Then 
And this rate hike cycle  we can simply update the months and years to see a similar picture 
  And Now
Other types of CEFs were also able to perform well in the face of rising rates  Here are three of the largest CEFs from the 2004 to 2006 time period 
CEFs Beat the Market as Rates Rose Then 
  And Now
With rates once ticking up  it s the perfect time to buy the few high quality funds that are still trading for discounts 
But which ones 
These 4 Cheap Funds are  Dividend Conversion Machines

After a short pullback in September Biotech stock prices were rising again into the end of the month and finished September at 3 year highs  All looked well for the sector  And then October started  Of the first 7 trading days in October the Biotech Index has been down 6 of them including the last 4  A 6  drop in just over a week  Is it time to panic 

The pullback brought the Biotech Index ETF   IBB back to its 100 day SMA  It bounced the last time it touched there in June  But momentum is weaker this time  The RSI is making a 6 month low and pushing into the bearish range  And the MACD is negative  It has not dipped to negative since May  when it was rising out of the April low 
These alone do not state the case to sell Biotech yet  Looking at the price action  it has stalled in the move lower at the prior low from August  creating a channel  If it continues below the July dip there is likely trouble ahead as a double top would confirm  Time to protect you Biotech and watch closely

ZURICH  Reuters    Novartis warned on Wednesday that price pressure on its generics drugs in the United States has intensified in the second quarter  cutting into its Sandoz division s sales growth in the world s largest healthcare market 
The Swiss drugmaker  which is holding an investor event in Boston  also said in a statement that it continued to review  all options  for its struggling Alcon eyecare unit 
An update on the future of loss making Alcon  which is among  50 billion in assets Novartis is considering unloading  is expected by the end of the year 
Novartis s Sandoz business  whose  10 1 billion in revenue in 2016 made up a fifth of the company s total  joins generics makers including India s Sun Pharmaceutical Industries and Lupin that have said revenue growth will be muted this year amid intensifying U S  price pressure 
 The impact of U S  pricing pressure and prior year launch timing is expected to have a higher impact on second quarter 2017 sales growth than  in the  first quarter   Novartis said 
Even so  Novartis said it was leaving Sandoz s full year sales targets unchanged  as it still sees the division s revenue  broadly in line  with 2016 
Consolidation among drug distributors has hit generics makers  ability to negotiate on prices  while regulatory scrutiny has also made hikes tougher 
Beyond the price squeeze  Sandoz has also been hurt by the delay of a new generic version of Glatopa  a copy of Teva s multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone  due to a warning letter on a third party manufacturing site in Kansas run by  Pfizer   NYSE PFE  ",2017-05-31,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/novartis-warns-of-u.s.-price-pressure-on-sandoz-generics-490033,490033

Per the company  Remoxy is a new type of abuse deterrent  extended release  oral formulation of widely used opioid drug oxycodone  It is being evaluated for the management of pain  severe enough to require daily  around the clock  long term opioid treatment  and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate 
The news disappointed investors as Remoxy ER is Pain Therapeutics  lead candidate  The FDA has set a Prescription Drug User Fee Act  PDUFA  target action date of Aug 7  2018 for completion of its review of the New Drug Application  NDA  for Remoxy ER 
The NDA is requesting label claims for abuse deterrence against three routes of abuse  injection  inhalation and nasal  Per the company  Remoxy s thick  sticky  high viscosity formulation may deter unapproved routes of drug administration  such as injection  snorting or smoking 
However  given the committee s negative opinion on the formulation  a positive outcome from the FDA review is highly unlikely 
Pain Therapeutics  shares have lost 39 1  so far in 2018 compared to the  s gain of 0 4   Shares lost 70  of their value on the above mentioned news 

 
We note that Pain Therapeutics has a license agreement with Durect to use the latter s Oradur technology for Remoxy  While Pain Therapeutics is solely responsible for clinical development  Durect is responsible for furnishing suitable laboratory facilities  equipment and personnel  during pre clinical phases of development  Both the companies are jointly responsible for certain pre clinical activities  Pain Therapeutics is obligated to pay royalties to Durect on commercial sales of Remoxy  6 0  to 11 5   
The company had a collaboration agreement with Pfizer  Inc    NYSE PFE   for Remoxy  which was terminated by the latter in 2014 
The road to Remoxy s development has been bumpy  It has already been issued Complete Response Letter  CRL  a few times  Most recently  in September 2016  the FDA issues a CRL  stating that Remoxy could not be approved in its present form  and specified additional actions and data is needed for drug approval  Pain Therapeutics resubmitted the Remoxy NDA in the first quarter of 2018

220340,441856,PFE,Novartis wins U S  approval for breast cancer drug  to compete with Pfizer s Ibrance,news,"By John Miller
ZURICH  Reuters    Novartis has won U S  Food and Drug Administration approval for Kisqali to treat postmenopausal women who have a difficult to treat form of breast cancer  challenging U S  rival  Pfizer   NYSE PFE  s Ibrance 
The Swiss company has priced Kisqali to be cheaper than Ibrance  which analysts said could help it win business  though Kisqali s approval includes additional patient monitoring requirements that could work against the new drug 
Novartis considers Kisqali to be one of its stable of 13 new medicines with blockbuster potential for annual revenue in the billions of dollars  Analysts see global annual sales reaching  1 5 billion by 2022  Thomson Reuters data shows 
British biotech company Astex Pharmaceuticals  now part of Otsuka  will receive undisclosed payments from Novartis  having worked out the structure of the key protein targeted by Kisqali 
Approval for Kisqali  previously known as LEE011 and to be administered in combination with letrozole  is for first line treatment of hormone receptor positive  human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative  HR  HER2   advanced or metastatic breast cancer  Novartis said late on Monday 
The quick U S  approval provides Novartis with the jump off point to challenge Pfizer s Ibrance in the initial treatment of patients 
Ibrance hit about  2 1 billion in sales in 2016 
Novartis estimates that it has priced Kisqali at an 18 20 percent discount to Ibrance while providing for flexible dosing 
Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said in a note that the pricing could help to drive take up for prescriptions but that cost factors could be outweighed by patient monitoring requirements that are more rigorous than those for Ibrance 
Kisqali comes with warnings for so called QT prolongation  which can signal heart problems and liver issues 
 Physicians will likely find the monitoring requirements associated with Kisqali to be burdensome relative to Ibrance   Fernandez wrote 
Novartis said that no head to head studies of Kisqali and Ibrance had been done  making efficacy and safety comparisons impossible  But the company said that most health issues that arose during Kisqali s trials were mild to moderate and generally managed through interrupting or reducing the dose 
Kisqali plus letrozole reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 44 percent over letrozole alone  according to results of a study released last year

220372,441888,PFE,Are Dovish Central Banks Doing The USD Heavy Lifting ,opinion,"Currency Markets
The US dollar bulls continued to lead the charge as traders remain centered favorably on the entrenched US data flow  despite a slightly softer ISM  relative to those from other major economies that are cooling quickly  This suggests that central bank policy divergence and the widening interest rate differentials have G 10 traders taking the dollar bull by the horns  It s now over to the FOMC to hold up their side of the bargain as so far  the heavy lifting for the greenback has fallen on the global central bank community which has turned dovish on the first hint of economic slack 
Equity Markets 
After initially grumbling on Pfizer  NYSE PFE  results and dropping oil prices  US equity market rebounded convincingly in Tuesday s NY session  However  investors remain cautious that tariffs and higher oil prices could increase cost pressures and weigh on corporate profits  In addition  the negative equity market connotations from the prospects of higher US interest rates as the Federal Reserve Board concludes its two day policy meeting continues to weigh on markets 
Oil Markets
As the May 12 Iran nuclear deadline nears  headline risk continues to speak volumes  The market turned lower after peaking post Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu s televised expos  which accused Iran of lying about its past nuclear intentions when in fact the existence of a covert Iranian program was divulged in a 2011 report from the International Atomic Energy Agency 
Geopolitical developments will continue to drive sentiment  However  a stronger US dollar  soft ISM and a refocusing on rising US production have caused traders to turn to profit taking mode and capped upticks so far 
The API reported a larger than expected crude inventory build while the U S  Energy Information Administration said Monday that oil production rose to a record 10 264 million barrels a day in February

Gold market is melting as the surging US dollar takes hold  The revitalized greenback has all but crushed demand for bullion  and as we near the critical  1300 level  the specter of stop losses getting triggered on an upbeat FOMC statement has traders now positioning for the path of least resistance  which appears lower 
We re in a lull between geopolitical developments which is also offering little support for gold prices

The USD is bid across the board after testing some significant levels as the market sits tight ahead of the FOMC  but more significantly  now pivots to this week s NFP which could make or break the resurgent dollar 
EUR  Some traders had not entirely positioned for downside exposure so on a break of the psychological key 1 2050 there was a mad dash for downs exposure which toppled the EUR below the 200 day moving average which set up a test of this year s low print  1 1915 
JPY  Interest rate differential and positive developments in the Korea Peninsula suggest a test of 110 is on the cards

220375,441891,PFE,Macron momentum threatens French election frontrunners,news,"By Michel Rose PARIS  Reuters    In May last year  then French Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron sat down with Socialist lawmaker Christophe Sirugue in the steel town of Le Creusot and asked him to join his new political movement  He said No  Eight months on  others are saying Yes  A political outsider who has never run for office and hopes to transcend the classic Left Right divide  Macron suddenly seems to have a fighting chance of winning the keys to the Elysee Palace and becoming president before he turns 40  The latest polls show him breathing down the necks of conservative frontrunner Francois Fillon and the far right s Marine Le Pen and he is drawing larger crowds than both at rallies across France  Macron s rise is beginning to create cracks in the mainstream parties as more and more local officials disregard party orders and defect to the 39 year old s campaign  On the right  four former center right ministers have backed Macron  illustrating Fillon s struggle to rally moderates behind free market policies harking back to former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher  Macron s magnetic pull is also being felt at the center  When the management of the small UDI party endorsed Fillon  the party s youth wing sent a furious statement announcing that their 130 elected officials and supporters would back Macron  A  UDI Youth  sign now adorns the door of a small room at Macron s modest presidential campaign headquarters in the 15th district of the French capital   Long time centrist presidential hopeful Francois Bayrou  who may get about 5 percent of the vote  is facing growing calls from his base to throw in the towel and rally behind Macron   SOCIALIST PANIC The momentum behind Macron is starting to sow panic too in the ranks of the Socialists  who fear they have little chance of making the runoff in May after five years of uninspiring rule by President Francois Hollande  Fifty Socialist members of parliament have already joined Macron  according to his team  defying threats of expulsion from their own party  Even in remote regions of the country  he is attracting more people to rallies than his rivals  More than 2 000 supporters attended his event in the central city of Clermont Ferrand this month  for example   while former Prime Minister Manuel Valls  who is gunning for the Socialist ticket  only pulled in 300 people there  according to local media   There s a real possibility that at some point the dyke breaks and the Socialist party starts hemorrhaging officials towards Emmanuel Macron   Jerome Sainte Marie  head of pollster PollingVox  told Reuters  An Odoxa poll this month showed Macron would get 16 percent to 24 percent of votes in the first round in April  putting him within a whisker of Le Pen and Fillon  In the latest Harris Interactive poll  41 percent said they  trusted  Macron and he was more popular than Fillon for the first time in a December poll by Odoxa   FRESH FACE Macron followed a path well trodden by the French elite  attending the prestigious Sciences Po and Ecole national d administration  ENA  schools and then joining the finance ministry  He then moved to investment bank Rothschild   Cie in 2008 and made a small fortune brokering a  10 billion deal between Nestle and  Pfizer   NYSE PFE  before joining Hollande s presidential staff and becoming economy minister in 2014  Macron quit in November to focus on his  En Marche    or  Onwards    political movement which he established in April  Written off as a presidential hopeful then  Macron has become France s most popular politician in just a few months  his image a regular feature of Paris boulevard newsstands  Macron s popularity is an achievement in a country where many hold a disdain for the world of high finance and much of his broad popularity is down to his attempts to bridge the Left Right divide that dominates French politics  He made a name for himself criticizing sacred cows of the French  social model  such as the 35 hour working week  iron clad job protection and civil servants  jobs for life  But in a country where many often end up voting for the candidate they dislike least  part of Macron s appeal can also be put down to a deep yearning for a fresh face  He stands out in a race dominated by figures who have been sparring with each other for decades  He is a generation apart from 62 year old former prime minister Fillon and 10 years younger than Marine Le Pen  Many Socialist and conservative grandees have long dismissed the Macron phenomenon  deriding him as a shooting star destined to crash and burn in the run up to the two stage election  But with less than 100 days to the election there is no sign yet the media frenzy around him is starting to subside   TWO THIRDS One Socialist MP  who declined to be named  said as many as two thirds of the party s lawmakers could swing behind Macron if the Socialists choose one of the most left wing candidates at their primaries this month   Beyond the presidential election  those MPs are getting worried that if Macron remains high in the polls and fields his own candidates in the legislatives  they re dead   he told Reuters  Analysts warn  however  that as Macron s reform program becomes clearer  especially on how he intends to cut public spending  the harder it will be to appeal across the spectrum  He has yet to release a full manifesto but  aware of the need to attract left wing voters  now says he wants to reform the 35 hour working week and the country s wealth tax  rather than scrap these emblematic Socialist policies   There are some real question marks hanging over him   said Celine Bracq at the Odoxa polling institute   His popularity today will not necessarily foretell success in the presidential election   But others are prudently hedging their bets  Sirugue  the Socialist MP who turned down Macron in May  told Reuters that the presidential hopeful had since toned down his free market message and was now more presentable  
 We re not poles apart   said the lawmaker  who replaced Macron at the economy ministry   If you re asking me who I d choose between Macron and the Right s candidates  there isn t a shadow of a doubt  ",2017-01-17,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/macron-momentum-threatens-french-election-frontrunners-453563,453563
220380,441896,PFE,Chart Of The Day  Is Pfizer About To Retest Its January High ,opinion,"Analysts have recently increased Pfizer Inc  NYSE PFE  s EPS expectations from  0 74 to  0 75  Does this updated estimate indicate that the stock will retest its January  39 43 high 
The overall supply demand balance seems to indicate that it will not 

Pfizer is a Diamond in the Sky that is About to Fall
The price has been developing a diamond top formation  It is rare as it is a profitable pattern  upon the successful downside breakout  The right side of the top is dotted to indicate it is presumptive  assuming the pattern will continue to form and that the former February 28   37 28 peak will maintain resistance 
This pattern is made up of two smaller ones  On the left side  it started mid September to develop a Broadening Pattern  on the right side  it began forming what may be a triangle 
The pattern may be described as a Complex Head and Shoulders with a V shaped neckline 
Thomas Bulkowski is an investor and author  His research shows that 58 percent of the time the last rally before the Diamond Top is steep  Between August 21 and September 12  which is less than a three week period  the price surged by more than 10 percent  During the same period  the S P 500 Index climbed 3 1 percent  An advance three times that of the benchmark more than satisfies the requirement for a steep rise 
When this occurs his research shows that the odds increase that the breakout from the diamond will be downward and will be equally as steep  That means that should the price fall below  36  it should almost automatically fall quickly to the beginning of the last move on August 21 at  32 32 
Pullbacks occur about 54 percent of the time  When they occur  they do tend to detract from performance  in terms of optimum entry  An entry upon breakout with a stop loss above the pattern should eliminate performance weakness 
84 percent of downside breakouts provide a minimum of a 10 percent gain  The 10 percent failure percentage is 16 percent  below the average for most tops complete with a downside breakout  These numbers render the diamond pattern with an above average chance of being profitable with minimum risk 
The 200 DMA increases the weight of the evidence that this pattern as drawn is meaningful  as it  guards  the pattern bottom 
Trading Strategies   Short Position Setup
Conservative traders would wait for a 3 percent downside breakout and for the probable return move  which would demonstrate the pattern s resistance  with at least one red candle engulfing one green candle 
Moderate traders would be satisfied with a 2 percent breakout and might wait for a return move for a better entry 
Aggressive traders may enter a short position immediately  counting on the dual resistance of the former February 28   37 28 peak  The dotted downtrend line from the January 30 diamond top is presumptive  in case the previous peak would maintain resistance ",2018-04-30,Pinchas Cohen/Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/chart-of-the-day-200310739,200310739

220405,441921,PFE,Sanofi  GSK expect further price pressure  more M A under Trump,news,"By Ben Hirschler
LONDON  Reuters    Two of Europe s biggest drugmakers warned on Tuesday there would be no let up in pressure on U S  medicine prices after last week s presidential election win for Republican Donald Trump  which sent pharmaceutical and biotech shares soaring 
Mergers and acquisitions  M A  in the sector  meanwhile  could get a big boost if Trump pushes through plans for a U S   tax holiday  on repatriated overseas profits  executives said 
Both France s Sanofi  PA SASY  and Britain s GlaxoSmithKline  L GSK  have recent direct experience of U S  pricing pressure  with healthcare providers forcing big discounts for their top selling diabetes and respiratory medicines 
In the run up to the U S  election  investors had focused on the threat of price controls posed by Democrat Hillary Clinton  yet Trump also advocated a new role for government agencies in negotiating down drug costs 
 I don t think the pricing debate is over   Sanofi Chief Executive Olivier Brandicourt told an industry conference 
Drugmakers are already having to work much harder to justify U S  prices due to the rising power of U S  pharmacy benefit managers  PBMs   which administer drug benefits and negotiate rebates for employers and health plans 
The buying power of these middlemen has been brought to bear particularly in areas of medicine where there are several similar treatments to choose from  such as insulin injections and inhalers for asthma and chronic lung disease 
OVERSEAS CASH
The trend toward big buyers squeezing prices is only going to accelerate as the U S  healthcare system struggles to find the resources to pay for new medical interventions  GSK CEO Andrew Witty said 
 It doesn t really matter too much who won the U S  election because the direction of travel of the U S  marketplace  owned not by one stakeholder in the White House but by multiple stakeholders in public and private decision making environments  is already set   he told the Financial Times meeting 
Manufacturers contend that the discounts extracted by PBMs are not always passed on to patients 
 We are making significant concessions but patients are paying more   said Brandicourt  who believes legislation may eventually be needed to ensure patients gain from the discounts 
Another key question for investors is the potential for a further wave of deal making in the healthcare sector  given impetus by Trump s plan to work with Congress to allow U S  firms to pay a lower tax rate when bringing back overseas cash 
That would add tens of billions of dollars in firepower for pharma and biotech acquisitions  with deal hungry  Pfizer   N PFE  alone having more than  80 billion it wants to repatriate 
 I think there is likely to be quite a lot of M A next year   said GSK s head of strategy David Redfern   The only thing unclear is how big it gets  ",2016-11-15,Reuters,"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/sanofi,-gsk-expect-further-price-pressure,-more-m-a-under-trump-440958",440958

220408,441924,PFE,Currency drop hits Egypt s medicine supplies  angering public,news,"By Arwa Gaballa and Eric Knecht
CAIRO  Reuters    Pharmacies across Egypt are running short of medicines  some of them life savers  as a plunge in the value of the Egyptian pound coupled with strict government price caps has made scores of products unprofitable to produce or import 
The shortages include some cancer treatments as well as basic items like insulin  tetanus shots and contraceptive pills 
Unable to raise prices above levels set by the Health Ministry but now paying roughly twice as much to import drugs or active ingredients  pharmaceutical firms say they have been forced to phase out certain medicine to stay in business 
 We aren t a charity  We have expenses and production costs  and if a company isn t making profit it will have to halt production   said Said Ibrahim  factory manager at EIPICO  one of Egypt s largest pharmaceutical companies 
That brings no comfort to pharmacists and sick Egyptians 
Out of insulin for weeks  Ali Etman said he was recently forced to turn away eight diabetes patients from his Cairo pharmacy in a single day 
 Patients who come looking for insulin ask me   What am I supposed to do  Die   and I don t know what to tell them  I don t have the drugs they need   Etman said 
Egypt floated its currency on Nov  3  abandoning a peg of 8 8 pounds to the U S  dollar and allowing the currency to roughly halve in value to about 17 50 on Tuesday  
The float helped the cash strapped government clinch a  12 billion IMF loan it hopes will unlock investment and revive growth that has been hampered by political uncertainty since the 2011 uprising that toppled President Hosni Mubarak 
But the medicine shortages are piling pressure on the government of general turned president Abdel Fattah al Sisi  who has been at pains to reassure a populace already struggling with double digit inflation and intermittent shortages that they would be shielded from the worst effects of economic reforms 
Talk of a looming healthcare crisis has dominated popular evening chatshows  with doctors calling in nightly to report rapidly depleting stocks and patients being turned away from hospitals for lack of supplies 
The Health Ministry has blamed the problem on panicking Egyptians hoarding medicines and said it would not raise prices 
Drug shortages are not new to Egypt  More medicines had already begun disappearing from shelves early this year as a severe shortage of dollars in the banks meant pharmaceutical firms could not pay for the necessary imports 
Egypt has struggled to earn enough dollars since the 2011 uprising scared off foreign investors and tourists and the central bank drained its reserves defending the currency peg 
The Health Ministry set up a Drug Shortages Directorate in 2012 to minimize the impact by suggesting suitable substitutes for missing medicines  But the situation has only worsened 
EIPICO s vice president told Reuters about 1 600 drugs had gone short in recent months  including 35 that have no alternatives and would disappear from the market if price caps were not eased 
 Distributors are now telling pharmacies nothing imported is available  The problem has been going on for a while  but has only turned into a crisis in recent weeks   Etman said 
SITUATION WORSENING
Egypt s drugs market is 40 percent multinational   big suppliers include  Pfizer   NYSE PFE   Novartis  GlaxoSmithKline and Sanofi  PA SASY    and 60 percent domestic  Nearly all of it is in private hands  with annual sales worth a total of about 50 billion pounds before the float 
Ahmed al Ezaby  head of the medicine industry division at Federation of Egyptian Industries  said Egypt imports about  600 million in finished medicines per year and  1 8 billion in active ingredients 
Officials at multinationals said they were concerned at the worsening situation  One industry source said companies were now in talks with Egyptian ministries on the possibility of restoring some prices to pre Nov  3 levels  in dollar terms  to ensure supplies of the most critical medicines 
The multinationals have local factories set up but 15 20 percent of drugs are imported  while 80 85 percent are produced locally  About 70 percent of all drugs in Egypt are generic and domestic made 
A spokesman for Sanofi said the French group was  actively engaging local authorities to define a sustainable pricing mechanism  
Egypt s supply problems echo those in Venezuela  where a lack of dollars has also created drug shortages and left manufacturers nursing big losses    
Before the flotation  Egypt faced a dollar shortage that saw imported goods ranging from electronic equipment to sugar disappear briefly from shelves in the past year 
The central bank rationed supplies via weekly auctions  earmarking the little it had for essential items like medicine 
Dollar supply is less of an issue since the flotation  But the cost of buying the greenback is because companies import active ingredients they need to make generic medicines 
The government  which already raised prices on a slew of medicines this year  is under pressure to keep drugs affordable for tens of millions of poor Egyptians 
It has blamed the crisis on hoarding and greed   
 It s an orchestrated crisis  The decision to float the pound was taken   and two hours later people began saying we have a crisis and we don t have meds   Health Ministry spokesman Khaled Mogahed told the Egyptian TV channel Mehwar 
 It s a way to push for a rise in medicine prices  which will not happen  
Mogahed did not respond to requests from Reuters for comment 
The companies want the government to remove the price caps entirely or re adjust them to ease their losses 
The Health Ministry met last week with drug industry leaders to discuss an emergency plan  It has offered to subsidize pharmaceutical companies to the tune of  165 million to support imports of life saving drugs that have no viable substitutes  including some cancer treatments 
Companies said the amount was not nearly enough while rolling out a new subsidy program would take time 
 There s no way of knowing how long this amount will last because cancer drugs are expensive and it depends on the shortages  but the amount is not enough to solve the problem   said Adel Abdel Maksoud  head of the pharmacy division at the Cairo Chamber of Commerce 
TWITTER PHARMACY
In the meantime the companies say they have to stop offering the drugs which most cut into their profits  Some have already sent back shipments that were ordered before the float but arrived after  as selling them at the fixed prices would have created big losses  They all say they have to downsize and cut out certain drugs 
 We re working on a strategy to eliminate any product that s not profitable  But companies that depend on unprofitable products will be forced to shut down now given the new currency rate   said ITO Pharma s deputy general manager Mohamed Geoushy 
More life saving drugs will soon disappear  he said 
His company is one of only two suppliers of cyclosporine  a drug used to prevent organ rejection during transplants  It recently stopped importing the drug  he said  
Pharmacists say patients have no choice but to resort to a black market for once common items like saline and glucose at prices often 10 times higher than the official caps and far beyond the reach of most 
On Twitter  resourceful Egyptians have set up the hashtag  Twitter Pharmacy  to swap medicines they cannot find in shops  Hospitals are using social media to advertise their needs 
 Every minister should have sat down with the government after the float and discussed an emergency plan because it s a crisis if patients can t find life saving medicines   said Osama Tahoon  general manager of medicine producer Julphar Egypt

220421,441937,PFE,Ex Oppenheimer adviser pleads guilty to U S  insider trading charges,news,"By Nate Raymond
NEW YORK  Reuters    A former investment adviser at an Oppenheimer Holdings Inc unit pleaded guilty on Tuesday to charges that he engaged in an insider trading scheme based on information supplied by a childhood friend working at  Pfizer  Inc   NYSE PFE 
David Hobson  48  entered his plea in Manhattan federal court to conspiracy and securities fraud charges over conduct that began while he was at Royal Bank of Canada unit RBC Capital Markets and then continued at Oppenheimer   Co Inc 
Hobson  a Providence  Rhode Island  resident  admitted that he executed trades based on inside information supplied by Michael Maciocio  a friend at Pfizer who pleaded guilty in May as part of a deal to cooperate with prosecutors 
 I m sorry for these actions  and I apologize to the court and to my family   Hobson said in court 
Under a plea agreement  Hobson agreed to forfeit almost  386 000 and not appeal any prison sentence of 2 1 2 years or less  U S  District Judge Laura Taylor Swain scheduled his sentencing for March 2 
The case was announced in June amid a resurgence of insider trading cases this year in Manhattan  where prosecutors have wrestled with a 2014 appellate ruling that limited the scope of insider trading laws 
According to prosecutors  Hobson and Maciocio engaged in an insider trading scheme from 2008 to 2014 based on information obtained by Maciocio  a director of chemical research and development at Pfizer 
As part of that job  Maciocio at times evaluated Pfizer s capacity to manufacture drugs that other companies Pfizer considered potential acquisition targets or partners were developing  authorities said 
While Maciocio was not typically given the identity of a company in a potential deal  with Hobson s help he performed research to discern its identity  the indictment said 
After identifying the company  Maciocio then passed the information to Hobson  his stockbroker  who executed trades in accounts belonging to himself  Maciocio  and clients of Oppenheimer and RBC  prosecutors said 
Trades by Hobson in the stocks of Medivation Inc  Ardea Biosciences Inc and Furiex Pharmaceuticals Inc resulted in profits of  180 000 for himself   40 000 for Maciocio and  150 000 for certain of Hobson s clients  prosecutors said

220441,441957,PFE,BioXcel IPO And Its Many Challenges,opinion,"Machine learning has been used from everything to learning how to play Go to building better chat bots to improving search engines  Now a small  new biotech company aims to use machine learning to save lives  BioXcel Therapeutics  a subsidiary of BioXcel Corp   has filed for a  69 million IPO  In its   BioXcel says that it is  focused on drug development that utilizes novel artificial intelligence  or AI  to identify the next wave of medicines across neuroscience and immuno oncology  
But while BioXcel wants to portray itself as a bold innovator using AI and machine learning  its actual advertised products are a peculiar combination of conservative yet risky  BioXcel has a great idea  but execution matters more than ideas and there is little reason to think it can pull off such an ambitious dream 
BioXcel and BioXcel
The first problem with BioXcel is what it actually is  As noted above  the company which is going public is called BioXcel Therapeutics  BioXcel Therapeutics was split off from BioXcel Corp  last year  and the parent company owns 93 percent of the subsidiary  BioXcel Corp  will continue to own the majority of the company after this IPO  though the exact percentage is unknown as of this time 
BioXcel Therapeutics talks about leveraging a research and development engine called EvolverAI  but this engine is owned by BioXcel Corp  Rather than doing AI development itself  BioXcel Therapeutics exists to develop the drugs found by EvolverAI and BioXcel Corp 
It is not like BioXcel Corp  is the only biotech company interested in leveraging AI and machine learning   points out that medical titans like Pfizer  NYSE PFE   Roche  and GlaxoSmithKline  NYSE GSK  are using artificial intelligence in novel ways to discover new combinations of drugs  find new compounds  and link diseases with treatments  EvolverAI by contrast works by using millions of data points to discover new potential therapeutic uses for drugs which already exist  at which point BioXcel Therapeutics reformulates them 
So what are the drugs which EvolverAI discovered and BioXcel Therapeutics is working on  The two main ones are called BXCL501 and BXCL701  also known as dexmedetomidine and talabostat respectively  Dexmedetomidine is used today under the brand name Precedex as a sedative  Talabostat was tested as a potential treatment for lung cancer by the now defunct Point Therapeutics   over a decade ago  By reformulating them  BioXcel believes that dexmedetomidine can fight Alzheimer s and schizophrenia  and talabostat can fight pancreatic cancer 
Unfortunately  these drugs are only in the latter stages of Phase 1 testing  with plans to start Phase 2 testing later this year  BioXcel hopes that the fact that the drugs have already passed prior levels of testing in the past will help them get past the drug approval process quicker  but the reality is that investors will be waiting even by biotech companies longer than normal for these drugs to hit the market 
Long Term Viability
Like most biotech IPOs  BioXcel s revenue is nonexistent  and it in fact reports no revenue whatsoever in 2016 and 2017  Over those two years  it decided to  its debts and earned a net loss of  2 1 and  4 5 million respectively  BioXcel also reported  1 3 million in assets and  2 3 million in liabilities as of December 31  2017 
Given these losses  raising  69 million may seem to be adequate to keep BioXcel running until its drugs are developed  but net losses will exponentially increase as it moves further in the development process  Unfortunately  BioXcel does not state how long it will be able to keep itself running with the raised IPO proceed  though they do concede that  we expect that we will need to obtain substantial additional funding in order to complete our clinical trials  
But if BioXcel will need substantial additional funding  why did they choose now to go public  Plenty of other companies  biotech or otherwise  are staying private because they can continue to secure rounds of funding from private investors  BioXcel s decision to eschew said funding and go public very quickly is strange and may have happened because said investors lack confidence in their product 
Some Good  Plenty Concerning
BioXcel Therapeutics has some things going for it compared to other biotech IPOs  Its close relationship with BioXcel Corp  means that it is not nearly as dependent on one or two drugs getting past FDA testing  especially as BioXcel Corp  will likely continue to have it test whatever drugs it discover with EvolverAI  A connection to machine learning  even it is indirect  is also a useful tool to attract investors  But it will take longer than normal for its drugs to get through the development pipeline and its disinterest or inability to secure private funding is seriously concerning  There are much better pipelines to take advantage of the growing interest in machine learning in the biotech industry  Investors may want to pay attention to what BioXcel Therapeutics has to say on the roadshow  but should not show any interest in this IPO as it currently stands ",2018-02-15,Alex Newman,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bioxcel-ipo-and-its-many-challenges-200291161,200291161

220486,442002,PFE,Pfizer s opioid painkiller can be manipulated for abuse  FDA,news," Reuters    A long acting opioid painkiller being developed by  Pfizer  Inc  N PFE  has the potential to deter abuse but can be manipulated  a preliminary review by the U S  Food and Drug Administration showed 
The drug is designed for the management of pain severe enough to require around the clock treatment in patients who have not derived enough benefit from other treatments 
The treatment  whose proposed trade name is Troxyca ER  contains commonly used opioid  oxycodone  The abuse deterrence mechanism relies on the incorporation of naltrexone in the drug pellets    
Troxyca ER is designed such that if the pellets are crushed in an attempt to abuse the painkiller  naltrexone is released to counteract the effects of oxycodone 
The panel is being asked to decide whether the drugmaker should be allowed to claim on the drug s label that it deters abuse  The panel will vote separately on whether it likely deters abuse when swallowed  snorted or injected 
FDA reviewers said in a report published on Monday that oxycodone could be selectively extracted from intact pellets by a number of straightforward techniques and certain common solvents appear to be capable of removing naltrexone from crushed pellets 
However  studies did demonstrate that negligible oxycodone is released from heated Troxyca ER vapor  reducing the likelihood of abuse by those seeking to inhale it  the reviewers added 
The review comes ahead of a June 8 meeting of outside experts  who will recommend whether the drug should be approved  The FDA is not obliged to follow the advice of its advisory panels but typically does 
The abuse of opioids   a class of drugs that includes heroin and prescription painkillers   has reached epidemic proportions in the United States  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC  estimates that 78 Americans die every day from opioid overdose 
There is increasing political pressure on the FDA to address the problem of opioid abuse 
Earlier this year  FDA Commissioner Robert Califf said the agency would reform its process for approving opioids after a number of senators threatened to block his nomination as the agency s head 
The CDC recommended in March that doctors prescribe non opioids  including acetaminophen and ibuprofen  for patients with pain unless they have active cancer or are receiving end of life care 
The FDA also announced that short acting opioids would carry new warnings about the potential for abuse  bringing the labels in line with the warnings on long acting pills ",2016-06-06,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/pfizer's-opioid-painkiller-can-be-manipulated-for-abuse:-fda-406763,406763

220496,442012,PFE,Pascal Soriot s big experiment  reinventing AstraZeneca,news,"By Ben Hirschler LONDON  Reuters    AstraZeneca Chief Executive Pascal Soriot is a big believer in science  and the biggest experiment of his career is the reinvention of the drugmaker   The  500 million corporate headquarters and research hub emerging amid cranes on the southern edge of the university town of Cambridge symbolizes his aim to create a science led company with uniquely close ties to academia  For employees  these are uncomfortable times  Thousands of job have been cut globally at the company in the past three years  with more to come  Some staff are also reluctant to move to Cambridge  with its high house prices  from north west England where the company has a strong presence dating from its time as part of the old ICI chemicals empire   Soriot  however  relishes the chance to shake things up by setting up home near world renowned university labs   where he says the firm is better placed to hire the  best of the best    while shrinking its operations to focus on core areas like cancer  respiratory and cardiovascular disease    In the past  we ve had too much stability   the CEO said in an interview with Reuters that gives some of the clearest indications yet of the scale of the cultural change he intends to push through at the company    We had people who never moved and turnover of 1 or 2 percent  That might sound good but it s actually not  because you don t have new ideas flowing through the place    The stakes are high  Two years after spurning a  100 billion bid from  Pfizer   NYSE PFE   AstraZeneca is going through the biggest  cliff  of patent expiries the drug industry has ever seen  wiping off more than half of its sales   or  17 billion   in 2011 2017  That has forced Soriot to seek new routes to profit and his overhaul of the company is now entering a pivotal phase  with make or break trial results and drug approvals due over the next 12 months  coinciding with the move to Cambridge   As with any experiment  the outcome of Soriot s reinvention is uncertain   and investors are divided   Neil Woodford of Woodford Investment Management  the seventh largest AstraZeneca shareholder  is convinced the company will re emerge as a successful player focused on specialty drugs like cancer treatments rather than mass market medicines  He has added to his stake recently   But Andy Smith  chief investment officer at fund manager Mann Bioinvest  says Soriot has yet to prove his plan will pay off   The big question hanging over his tenure is how close he can get to showing actual value from the pipeline  rather than promised value   he said    IMPLODING  No other pharmaceutical company has moved itself wholesale to an academic center  Soriot argues the move is already paying off for some 1 600 staff  nearly a quarter of its UK workforce  now in rented space around Cambridge who are liaising far more closely with academic researchers   It is fundamentally changing the way we operate   said the 56 year old  who trained as a veterinarian in France  Most of the staff will move into the new building from late 2017  Soriot said he had no choice but to overhaul AstraZeneca when he took over in October 2012  due to the patent  cliff    The company was imploding   he said bluntly  His answer has been to invest in internal research and bolt on acquisitions  including more than  7 billion of deals at the end of 2015  to rebuild the company s drug pipeline   This includes cancer drugs that boost the immune system  which are the hottest area of drug research right now  although AstraZeneca also has high hopes for other approaches to fighting tumors  That makes oncology the area with the greatest potential to drive future sales at AstraZeneca  as the company grapples with a wave of patent expiries on older products  such as its cholesterol fighter Crestor and stomach acid pill Nexium  Investors are anxious for proof Soriot s prescription will work  since AstraZeneca shares are languishing 28 percent below the 55 pounds offered by Pfizer and earnings are expected to fall in 2016 and 2017  AstraZeneca has also had to cope recently with some senior executive departures  including the loss on Tuesday of its North America head to Novartis   At the height of the takeover battle  the company went public with a forecast that sales would rise by three quarters to  45 billion by 2023   a hostage to fortune  perhaps  but a target Soriot remains confident will be met    I might not be here to see if we achieve that in 2023 but people won t have to wait until then  If we succeed  the share price will reflect the value of the company much earlier than that   he said   I think it is going to take another 12 months and then hopefully we can show people what they want to see    STEPS FORWARD  BACK  So far  there have been some steps forward  like success with lung cancer drug Tagrisso and with good results for a new asthma drug   But there have also been setbacks  including the loss of a fast to market opportunity for AstraZeneca s big immuno oncology hope durvalumab   The latter has increased the pressure to prove that a combination treatment mixing durvalumab and tremelimumab can help in lung cancer  giving AstraZeneca a foothold in a market currently dominated by Bristol Myers Squibb   Pascal has played his hand well but now he s at the point where it gets harder   said one top executive at a rival company   He s going down to the valley floor on earnings and we don t know how the clinical data will play out to get the business up the other side    AstraZeneca has also used so called externalization income from licensing out non core products to underpin profits  leading to criticism over earnings quality from some analysts   With R D spending equivalent to 24 percent of sales  AstraZeneca s science budget exceeds the industry average  But Soriot aims to push

220518,442034,PFE,U S  plans to curb tax  inversions  could hit foreign companies,news,"By Tom Bergin
LONDON  Reuters    Planned changes that President Barack Obama says are aimed at ensuring American companies do not avoid tax by shifting their headquarters overseas could also force foreign companies to adopt more conservative U S  tax planning strategies 
One of the measures restricts the ability of U S  subsidiaries of foreign companies to deduct the interest they pay on loans from their parent firms from their taxable income 
It aims to stop a redomiciled American firm from reducing its U S  tax bill by piling inter group debt on its U S  operations  and effectively shifting profits overseas 
But it could also affect European companies that use similar strategies to reduce their tax bills in the United States after buying U S  firms 
The new rules announced by the Treasury department this week aim to curb so called  inversions    where a U S  group acquires a smaller overseas company and shifts its domicile to a lower tax jurisdiction 
Drugmaker  Pfizer   NYSE PFE  s plan to buy rival Allergan  NYSE AGN pa  and move to Ireland was one of the planned inversions that prompted the Obama administration to act  The  160 billion deal fell apart last week as a result of other aspects of the Treasury reforms 
Under the new rule regarding debt  if a U S  subsidiary transfers money to its overseas parent within three years before or after borrowing money from it  by paying a dividend or buying shares in the parent  then U S  tax authorities could potentially treat the loan as if it was equity 
This means the interest on the debt would not be deductible for U S  income tax purposes 
Experts said that European companies would still be able to shift profits via inter group debt  but may have to do so gradually over a longer period of time 
 It  without doubt  significantly changes the rules of the game   said Stephen Shay  professor of law at Harvard University 
 In the old days you bought and then you levered up as much as you can and that is not going to happen in the same way  but how much of a constraint that becomes is unclear   he added 
Nancy McLernon  president of the Organization for International Investment  a trade group for the U S  subsidiaries of foreign companies  denied non U S  groups were routinely shifting profit overseas through debt 
 Where s the problem they  U S  authorities  are trying to fix  It feels more like a tax grab   she said 
She said the complexity of the issue and uncertainty over how the Internal Revenue Service  IRS   the U S  tax authority  would seek to use their new powers would make investing in new U S  projects less attractive 
 It will have a chilling effect on foreign direct investment in the United States   McLernon added 
BILLIONS AT STAKE
The Treasury says it is targeting situations where large debts are incurred to fund dividends shortly after an inversion or foreign acquisition  rather than the most common way U S  subsidiaries accumulate inter group debt  That is by having the subsidiary gradually pay all its profit to its parent as dividends and then borrow money from its parent for new investment 
 The proposed regulations generally do not apply to related party debt that is incurred to fund actual business investment  such as building or equipping a factory   a Treasury factsheet released last week said 
Providing the money a foreign company takes out of its U S  subsidiary is in line with the U S  company s profits  the transactions should escape IRS scrutiny  Shay said 
Companies don t usually publish details of their inter group financing so it s impossible to put a figure on how much profit foreign companies shelter from U S  tax through inter group loans  Richard Murphy  professor of practice in international political economy at City University London  estimates the IRS could lose tens of billions of dollars in taxes each year in this way 
Companies that have reduced their U S  tax bills via inter group lending include drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline  education group  Pearson   LON PSON   utility Scottish Power and telecoms group  Vodafone   LON VOD  
All said their lending to U S  subsidiaries had been unwound and that they complied with all tax rules  Details of their lending arrangements came to public attention following data leaks or legal action with tax authorities 
A 2013 Reuters examination of tax planning by Europe s largest software group  SAP AG  DE SAPG   showed how the German company shifted profits from the United States  which has a corporate tax rate of at least 35 percent  to Ireland whose headline rate is 12 5 percent 

HIGH INTEREST LOANS
According to Reuters calculations based on 2015 corporate filings  SAP America Inc reduces its U S  tax bill by around  200 million a year by borrowing  7 4 billion from SAP Ireland US Financial Services Ltd at an interest rate of at least 7 percent 
The debt  which helped fund the acquisition of U S  software groups  cuts its taxable income by around  600 million a year 
A spokesman for SAP group declined to comment on the Reuters calculations but said the company followed all tax rules and that its funding structure was driven by business rather than tax reasons 
Some measures previously proposed by Obama and the Organization for Economic Co operation and Development  OECD   which advises developed nations on tax policy  would have limited interest deductions to the extent that they reflected an operating unit s share of total group interest costs 
Since SAP group s total net interest expense was just 5 million euros last year  most of its U S  subsidiary s deduction may have been disallowed under such proposals 
But the Treasury plan is far more limited than these proposals  SAP filings suggest that it has not taken large amounts of cash from its acquired U S  subsidiaries and recapitalized them with debt 
Debts accumulated as SAP has done   by acquiring and expanding U S  companies   should not be captured by the new measures  even if that debt is out of proportion to the parent s overall debt burden 
But it s hard to be certain 
Inter group debts usually run for a period of a few years  and each time they extend them  there is an opportunity for the IRS to re examine the arrangement

220554,442070,PFE,Emerald Health Therapeutics Nears Phase 2 Of Major Growth Strategy,opinion,"On October 2  2012  Emerald Health Therapeutics  SG TBD  announced that it had appointed Chris Wagner as company CEO  On the appointment  previous CEO Bin Huang shifted to focus on the management of the company s operations and expansion as President of Emerald Health Botanicals  Emerald Health Therapeutics  wholly owned subsidiary 
With this reshuffle  the company has shown its cards as far as future operational focus is concerned and  in doing so  has made itself very much one to watch in the biotechnology space going forward 
Here is why 
Those familiar with Emerald Health Therapeutics will know the company as a Canadian medical cannabis grower and producer  based out of Victoria  BC  The company is a well established player in its sector and the legality of both medical and recreational cannabis in Canada has led to it being able to achieve substantial growth over the last 12 months  raising revenues over this period from  36 000 during the third quarter of 2016 to just shy of  200 000 during the second quarter of 2017   an increase of more than 450  
Over the coming 12 months  however  recent activity suggests that management is seeking to implement what we might refer to as the second phase of Emerald Health Therapeutics  growth efforts and this second phase could very quickly outweigh even the triple digit percentage point topline increase detailed above 
There are two separate elements of near term operational activity that are going to support this last statement  with one being the operational focus implied by the appointment of the above mentioned Chris Wagner 
Before outlining that one  however  let s address the other one   production capacity expansion 
Emerald Health Therapeutics announced during the early part of September that it has put together a joint venture with a company called Village Farms  The latter is another cannabis grower and distributor in Canada and the joint venture will see the two companies combine to create 1 100 000 ft   of fresh greenhouse space  with Village Farms providing the space and Emerald Health Therapeutics putting up  20 million in initial capital to get the facility into production 
Why is this important 
Because right now  Emerald Health Therapeutics  total grow space is just 100 000 ft    An additional 1 100 000 ft   is going to allow the company to compete with some of its much larger  billion dollar peers in the Canadian grow arena and is going to do so with the above mentioned investment of only  20 million  Emerald Health Therapeutics and Village Farms are going to split profits 50 50 but even just taking 50  of the earnings from the project  Emerald Health Therapeutics is going to be in a different league as compares to its current situation 
Moving on  let s now look at why the Chris Wagner appointment is important 
As noted above  it represents something of a pivot for Emerald Health Therapeutics and  specifically  a pivot into the biotechnology sector 
Chris Wagner has a history of leading successful biotechnology companies  with perhaps the most notable being Contextual Genomics Inc  Contextual Genomics  under Wagner s leadership  teamed up with some of the biggest names in the healthcare space  including Astrazeneca  NYSE AZN   Pfizer  NYSE PFE  and Sanofi  NYSE SNY   to develop and eventually commercialize a range of groundbreaking oncology therapies 
What this means  then  is that Emerald Health Therapeutics is trying to capitalize on the dramatically improved grow space that it has picked up as part of the Village Farms deal through the development of its own range of cannabis based pharmaceutical products  Additionally  it looks as though the company is not only becoming a biotechnology play but is also looking to create its own supply chain  minimizing production and manufacturing risk and  the assumption being  reducing operational cost as and when any of its development stage products hit the shelves 
Right now  the company is producing medical cannabis for sale as dried flower and oils at what it calls its Saanich facility  In conjunction with this production  the Saanich facility also serves as Emerald Health Therapeutics  research and product development facility in Canada  Management has submitted some licensing applications to Health Canada  the Canadian equivalent of the FDA in the US  and these licenses are a key first step in getting the facility accepted as a medical product development location in Canada  This makes the response to these applications a potential near term catalyst for the company during late 2017  early 2018 
To sum up  Emerald Health Therapeutics has been growing reasonably well in a rapidly expanding industry in Canada but  with a new CEO and a JV that s going to allow it to dramatically increase production capacity near term  the company is going to look completely different in 12 months than it does today  If the operational execution goes to plan  this transformation could serve up a considerable upside revaluation across the period  meaning Emerald Health Therapeutics is a stock to watch between now and the end of 2018

Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said Monday she and her colleagues hope and expect the economy will continue to expand and if that is the case  it will be appropriate to raise interest rates 
 Most of us expect the pace of that normalization to be gradual   Yellen said in a letter to Ralph Nader released by the Federal Reserve 
Nader penned an open letter to Yellen Oct  30  calling on the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee to raise the fed funds rate off the zero lower bound where it has been since December 2008

New York Fed President William Dudley said Friday that there is a  strong case  for hiking rates at the central bank s next meeting in December as long as economic data continues to remain solid 
Also on Monday  the Federal Reserve Board of Governors scheduled a closed door meeting  held under expedited procedures  to review the discount rates charged by its regional banks 
The discount rate is the interest rate charged to commercial banks on loans they receive from their regional Federal Reserve Bank lending facilities  also known as the discount window  When the Fed increases the discount rate  it makes the borrowing costs for banks more expensive  decreasing the money supply in the system 
The discount rate differs from the Federal Funds Rate  which is the rate banks lend to one another on overnight loans for funds maintained at the Federal Reserve  In February  2010  the Fed increased the spread between the discount rate and the top of the target range of the Federal Funds Rate to 50 basis points  It came nearly two years after the Fed reduced the spread to 25 points in March  2008  in an effort to bolster liquidity 
The Federal Funds Rate has remained at a level between zero and 0 25  for nearly seven years  since December  2008  The announcement of the previously unscheduled meeting helps raise speculation that the U S  central bank will lift the Fed Funds Rate when it meets next on Dec  15 16  The Fed last held an unscheduled meeting in December  2012  An initial rate hike is viewed as bearish for gold  which is not attached to dividends or interest rates and struggles to compete with high yield bearing assets ",2015-11-23,Investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/shares-in-asia-mixed-with-tokyo-gaining-on-strong-pmi-372652,372652

220589,442105,PFE,Can Pfizer  PFE  Prove To Be An Apt Value Investment ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Pfizer  Inc    NYSE PFE   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Pfizer has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14 8  This level compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE ratio for the S P 500 comes in at about 20 4 If we focus on the long term trend of the stock the current level puts Pfizer s current PE above its median over the observed period  which stands at 13 8x   Hence  we could infer that the stock is slightly overvalued in this respect  especially in light of its historical trend Nevertheless  the stock s PE compares favorably with its industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 16 5  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively overvalued right now  compared to its peers PS RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Pfizer has a P S ratio of about 4 2  This is lower than the industry average  which comes in at 4 6x right now PFE is actually in the higher zone of its trading range in the time period per the P S metric  which suggests that the company s stock price has already appreciated to some degree  relative to its sales Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Pfizer currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Pfizer an apt choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the company s P B ratio  used to compare a stock s market value to its book value  stands at 3 6  lower than the industry average of 5 9  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 10 5  which is far better than the industry average of 15 9  Clearly  PFE is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Pfizer might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of B  This gives PFE a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores   Meanwhile  the company s earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen one estimate go higher in the past sixty days compared to four lower  while the full year estimate has seen four upward revisions and one downward revision in the same time period This has had small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has remained constant over the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched up 0 4   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Pfizer  Inc  Price and Consensus   Pfizer has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which indicates that while analysts have some apprehensions about the stock in the immediate future  the stock s growth story might be good over the long term  Thus  we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LinePfizer is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a strong industry rank  Top 17  out of more than 250 industries  further supports the growth potential of the stock  In fact  year to date  the industry has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below Notably  Pfizer has been working on strengthening its product portfolio through acquisitions and licensing deals  However  Pfizer continues to face headwinds in the form of genericization of key drugs  lost alliance revenues  pricing pressure and rising competition which is hurting the top line Though Pfizer s growing immuno oncology portfolio offers strong potential  many of these assets are in early stage of development  Nonetheless  we believe that new products like Ibrance  contribution from acquisitions  cost cutting efforts and share buybacks should help the company achieve its guidance Pfizer also boasts a strong pipeline and expects approximately 25 to 30 drug approvals over the next five years  including around 15 products that have blockbuster potential So  despite a Zacks Rank  3  we believe that bullish analyst sentiment for the long term and favorable industry factors make this value stock a compelling pick Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as the  1 stock to buy according to Zacks research It s not the one you think ,2017-09-20,Zacks Investment

220599,442115,PFE,3 Alternative Mutual Funds To Ride Out A Spooky September,opinion,Though President Trump s support toward the extension of the debt limit deadline might have helped stocks book modest gains on Sep 6  a slew of headwinds will continue to spook investors in the month of September  Investors are expected to grapple with issues pertaining to North Korea  The rogue nations  testing of its deadliest ballistic missile had sent shockwaves through Wall Street  while drawing widespread rebuke from across the globe A potential catastrophic hurricane Irma and persistent worries about elevated stock valuations also raise concerns for investors  A record number of fund managers see the U S  market as the most overvalued in the world  Among the 20 valuation metrics tracked by Ned Davis Research  16 of them indicate that the U S  stocks are extremely overvalued As if all this wasn t enough  September is historically the worst month for the stock market  Weighing all the cons  alternative mutual funds seem to be the best way out for investors  Such funds are known for their potential to hedge risks  provide unwavering returns particularly in difficult times and a diversified portfolio What Are Alternative Mutual Funds These funds mostly include long short equity funds  market neutral funds and trading leveraged equity funds  These types of funds are available to investors of all income groups  Let us now discuss the three types of funds in some  Mutual FundsEquity long short funds seek to gain from both winning and losing stocks  irrespective of the market scenario  These funds use conventional methods to identify stocks that are either undervalued or overvalued  It profits from shorting the overvalued stocks and buying the undervalued ones  Weights are subject to change and are dependent on management s view on the market For example  Say an investor buys a long short mutual fund for  100  then the fund manager will invest it in assets that are expected to fare well  The manager shorts  30 in stocks that are believed to be overvalued  In the process  he receives  30 in cash  He will now use the  30 to buy more assets with an upside potential  Thus  now he has a total of  130 invested in long positions and  30 in short positions  This type of long short fund is called a 130 30 mutual fund Market Neutral Mutual FundsMarket neutral funds aim to adopt a precision approach by shorting 50  of their assets and holding 50  long  This approach seeks to identify pairs of assets that have related price movements  The fund goes long on the outperforming asset and shorts the underperformer  For instance  you take a  1 million long position in Pfizer  NYSE PFE  and a  1 million short position in Wyeth  both of which are large pharmaceutical companies  Now  if pharmaceutical stocks fall  you will lose because of your long position in Pfizer but will gain because of the short position in Wyeth A market neutral fund is designed to provide stable returns at relatively lower levels of risk regardless of market direction  This is particularly relevant in today s highly volatile scenario when the objective is to protect the capital invested Trading Leveraged Equity FundsLeveraged funds use borrowed money to increase returns in a short spell of time  These funds generally strive to return a certain multiple of the short term returns of an equity index  For example  a 2X S P 500 fund aims to generate twice the returns that the S P 500 manages to achieve  Leveraged funds are primarily marked  ultra    bull  or  2X  Leveraged funds also offer benefits such as diversification  These funds invest in a diversified portfolio of assets which minimize risk  while escalating returns  In addition to this  investors enjoy the benefits of  dollar cost averaging   where a young investor depositing  10 000 in these funds reaps the same benefits that a high net worth individual receives  say by depositing  50 000 000  These funds also enjoy tax deductions 3 Alternative Mutual Funds to Buy NowThe investment community is a dynamic one where new products will come into play and make the most of the stock market  In times of market uncertainty  alternative mutual funds are such new product classes that are equipped to protect investors  portfolio and provide steady returns Here we have selected three such

220604,442120,PFE,Historic Pacific trade deal faces skeptics in U S  Congress,news,"By Krista Hughes and Kevin Krolicki ATLANTA  Reuters    Twelve Pacific Rim countries on Monday reached the most ambitious trade pact in a generation  aiming to liberalize commerce in 40 percent of the world s economy in a deal that faces skepticism from U S  lawmakers  The Trans Pacific Partnership  TPP  pact struck in Atlanta after marathon talks could reshape industries  change the cost of products from cheese to cancer treatments and have repercussions for drug companies and automakers   Tired negotiators worked round the clock over the weekend to settle tough issues such as monopoly rights for new biotech drugs  New Zealand s demand for greater access for its dairy exports was only settled at 5 a m  EDT  0900 GMT  on Monday  If approved  the pact would cut trade barriers and set common standards from Vietnam to Canada  It would also furnish a legacy shaping victory for U S  President Barack Obama  who will promote the agreement on Tuesday in remarks to business leaders in Washington  The Obama administration hopes the pact will help the United States increase its influence in East Asia and help counter the rise of China  which is not one of the TPP nations   Lawmakers in the United States and other TPP countries must approve the deal  Five years in the making  it would reduce or eliminate tariffs on almost 18 000 categories of goods  Initial reaction from U S  Congress members  including Democrats and Republicans  ranged from cautious to skeptical   Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders  a Democratic presidential candidate  warned the pact would cost jobs and hurt consumers   In the Senate  I will do all that I can to defeat the TPP agreement   he tweeted  Many of Obama s Democrats  as well as labor groups  fear the TPP will cost manufacturing jobs and weaken environmental laws  while some Republicans oppose provisions to block tobacco companies from suing governments over anti smoking measures  Republican Senator Orrin Hatch  who heads the Senate Finance Committee  was wary   I am afraid this deal appears to fall woefully short   said Hatch  who had urged the administration to hold the line on intellectual property protections  including for drugs  U S  lawmakers can approve the deal or vote it down  but not amend it  CURRENCY  DRUGS  DAIRY  AUTO POLICIES Ministers said the agreement would include a forum for finance ministers from participating countries to discuss currency policy principles  This takes into account  in part  concerns among U S  manufacturers and critics who suggest Japan has driven the yen lower to benefit its car exporters and other companies  But Democratic Representative Debbie Dingell from Michigan  home of the U S  auto industry  said currency has not been fully dealt with   Nothing that we have heard indicates negotiators sufficiently addressed these issues   she said  The United States and Australia negotiated a compromise on the minimum period of protection to the rights for data used to make biologic drugs  Companies such as  Pfizer  Inc  NYSE PFE   Roche Group s Genentech and Japan s Takeda Pharmaceutical could be affected  The agreed terms fell short of what the United States had sought  Under the deal  countries would give drugmakers at least five years  exclusive access to clinical data used to win approval for new drugs  An additional period of regulatory review would likely mean drug companies would have an effective monopoly for about eight years before facing lower cost  generic competition  Politically charged dairy farming issues were addressed in the final hours of talks  New Zealand  home to the world s biggest dairy exporter  Fonterra  wanted increased access to U S   Canadian and Japanese markets  New Zealand Prime Minister John Key said the deal would cut tariffs on 93 percent of New Zealand s exports to the United States  Japan  Canada  Mexico and Peru   We re disappointed there wasn t agreement to eliminate all dairy tariffs but overall it s a very good deal for New Zealand   Key said   The United States  Mexico  Canada and Japan agreed to auto trade rules on how much of a vehicle must be made within the TPP region to qualify for duty free status  The TPP would give Japan s automakers  led by Toyota MotorCorp  a freer hand to buy parts from Asia for vehicles sold in the United States  but sets 25 30 year phase out periods for U S  tariffs on Japanese cars and light trucks  The deal between Australia  Brunei  Canada  Chile  Japan  Malaysia  Mexico  New Zealand  Peru  Singapore  the United States and Vietnam also sets minimum standards on issues ranging from workers  rights to environmental protection  Trade ministers said the TPP would in future be open to other countries  including potentially China   There is a real opportunity for China to be a part of this   Malaysian Trade Minister Mustapa Mohamed said  
Though Obama painted the deal in part as a way of stopping China from writing the rules of the global economy  China s Ministry of Commerce broadly welcomed the agreement in the hope it would  promote and make common contributions to Asia Pacific trade  investment and economic development  ",2015-10-06,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/historic-pacific-trade-deal-faces-skeptics-in-u.s.-congress-364627,364627
220605,442121,PFE,Lilly pill trumps Humira in arthritis study,news," Reuters    Eli Lilly and Co s experimental pill for rheumatoid arthritis proved superior to Abbvie Inc s leading injectable Humira treatment in a large study  which analysts said could prod them to raise sales forecasts for the medicine 
Lilly said on Wednesday it was the first study to show that a once daily oral treatment was superior to  13 billion a year Humira  the world s best selling drug  in improving signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis 
It was the fourth successful late stage trial for Lilly s medicine  called baricitinib  which it is developing in partnership with Incyte Corp 
 What is disclosed is quite impressive   about as good an outcome as Lilly could hope for   Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said in a research note 
Baricitinib works through a similar mechanism as  Pfizer  Inc  N PFE  s approved twice daily Xeljanz pill for rheumatoid arthritis  by blocking proteins called Janus kinases that cause inflammation  Xeljanz  with annual sales of  500 million  has not yet become the blockbuster product Wall Street had hoped  when it was approved in 2012 
If approved  baricitinib could achieve annual sales of  831 million by 2020  Anderson said  adding he may raise his forecast as more data is made public  Incyte would collect a royalty of about 20 percent on sales  he added 
Baricitinib met its primary goal in the latest study by proving superior to placebo after 12 weeks  as judged by its ability to produce at least a 20 percent improvement in disease severity 
In another arm of the trial  baricitinib at 12 weeks was superior to Humira on key secondary objectives related to the number of patients achieving at least 20 percent improvement  as well as in improvement based upon another standard arthritis measure called a DAS28 hsCRP score 
Moreover  after 24 weeks of treatment  baricitinib was shown to be better than placebo at preventing further structural joint damage  Lilly said 
Treatment benefits on all measures continued through a full year of therapy  Lilly said  Lilly plans to release full data at a November scientific meeting 
Analysts said more data is needed  including how many patients achieved 50 percent or 70 percent reductions in disease severity 
The number of serious side effects seen with baricitinib were similar to placebo  while those taking Humira had fewer side effects than placebo  Serious infection rates were similar in all patient groups  Lilly said 
Shares of Lilly were down 0 3 percent in morning trading  while those of Incyte rose 5 percent ",2015-10-14,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/general-news/lilly-pill-trumps-humira-in-arthritis-study-366125,366125

220665,442181,PFE,Pfizer s  11 billion buyback plan deflates AstraZeneca bid hopes,news,"LONDON NEW YORK  Reuters    U S  drugmaker Pfizer is to continue buying back stock  with the board authorizing a new  11 billion share repurchase plan  deflating expectations that it will make a new bid for AstraZeneca 
Shares in AstraZeneca fell 1 2 percent by 0800 GMT on Friday following the news 
The largest American pharmaceuticals company  whose shares gained more than 1 percent after the announcement late on Thursday  said the move was in addition to the  1 3 billion remaining on its current share buyback program 
Pfizer  which has a market valuation of about  180 billion  earlier this year failed in its  118 billion bid to buy British rival AstraZeneca  It has an opportunity to make a fresh run at its target from late November under British takeover rules 
Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read has said the company is continuing to look at deals but investor hopes for a new bid have dwindled recently because of the introduction of new U S  tax rules 
The U S  government s tax proposals are designed to make it harder for American firms to shift their tax bases out of the country and into lower cost jurisdictions in Europe  as Pfizer would do by buying AstraZeneca 
The likelihood of Pfizer resuming its pursuit has also been diminished following the collapse of U S  drugmaker AbbVie s  55 billion plan to buy Dublin based Shire  as a result of the new U S  tax regulations 

But while investors may well view the big new share buyback as another blow to the idea of a Pfizer bid  ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum cautioned against reading too much into it   We cannot and should not necessarily make that read across   he said in a note

220680,442196,PFE,Here s What To Look For From Axovant Sciences  Alzheimer s Study,opinion,"Axovant Sciences  NYSE AXON  just   and alongside the numbers  gave markets and update as to the progress of its development pipeline  The star of said pipeline is a drug called Intepirdine  which the company is attempting to bring to market as a potential treatment for Alzheimer s disease  As part of the latest release  management reiterated a previously stated target timeframe for the release of data from a phase 3 study of Intepirdine  when used in combination with an already approved  and well established  drug called donepezil 
This is a bit of a controversial asset  with the asset class to which it belongs having had a rocky development history to date  However  there is some suggestion that Axovant can buck this trend and successfully prove efficacy where others have failed to do so  If this proves to be the case  there is a high probability of an immediate upside revaluation for the company 
Right now  the company trades for just shy of  22 a share at a market capitalization of  2 4 billion  If the data in question comes out as indicative of clinical benefit  and just as importantly  as we will get to shortly  does so with a clean safety profile  we are probably looking at  1 billion added to its market capitalization overnight 
Of course  the same can be said for failure  but in the other direction 
With this in mind  here is a look at the drug  and what we are looking out for from the data as underlying a bullish thesis 
So  as mentioned  it s called Intepirdine  and it s a selective 5 HT6 receptor antagonist  The 5 HT6 receptor is a subtype of the 5 HT receptor that plays a key role in the transmission of things like serotonin and other neurotransmitters in the brain  On its own  it s generally regarded as what s called an excitatory receptor  that is  it stimulates and promotes activity  However  a large portion of these receptors are co localized  or in other words  located near to  what are called GABA neurotransmitters  These basically block neuroactivity  so the co localization leads to the 5 HT6 receptor stimulating the blocking of neuroactivity 
The idea behind a 5 HT6 receptor antagonist like this  then  is that it stops the 5 HT6 receptor from stimulating this blocking of activity and   in turn   should promote brain function 
It is a pretty roundabout way of going about things  but studies to date have shown that   in concept  at least   it works  In a phase II trial conducted by GlaxoSmithKline plc  ADR   NYSE GSK   the addition of Intepirdine to donepezil  in a statistically significant improvement in two of the gold standard test scales in Alzheimer s   the ADAS cog scale and ADCS ADL scale   when compared to patients that just took donepezil alone 
The phase III that Axovant is conducting is attempting to build on this study in a larger population  the FDA generally requires at least 1000 patients in an Alzheimer s study to underpin a New Drug Application  or NDA  and replicate the results 
There are some doubts  however 
Other companies have tried to prove efficacy and safety in these sorts of drugs  and have had a tough time doing it  Most notably  Lundbeck  OTC HLUYY  tried to combine a 5 HT6 receptor antagonist with Pfizer s  NYSE PFE  PF 05212377  and midway through a phase II trial  found that patients were reporting elevated liver enzymes  In a trial environment  this isn t too much of a problem  as it can be treated relatively easily  If the drug was approved  however  and was taken as a general population therapeutic  there is good chance that this elevated liver enzyme level would not be spotted early enough and could lead to permanent liver damage or  worse  failure altogether  Lundbeck played about with the dosing to try and address the issue  but the trial eventually ended up failing 
What this one comes down to  then  is whether investors feel that it was the altered protocol  as necessitated by the tolerability problems  that caused the failure of the Lundbeck and Pfizer trial  as opposed to any inherent problems with the drug from a clinical benefit perspective  i e  the drug works  but not in this trial due to various protocol errors  
If that s the case  an Axovant position ahead of the company s releasing of its phase III data could well be justified 
So what are we looking for from the data when it hits 
The primary endpoint is set up to mimic that which determines the outcome of the above described phase 2 trial  the one that GSK carried out    improvement from baseline  statistically significant when compared to placebo  in the ADAS cog scale and ADCS ADL scale  There are also a few key secondary endpoints that  if hit  would shore up the success of the primary 
Of course  and just as importantly  we need to see a clean safety profile  Specifically  we don t want the drug to go down the same pathway as did Lundbeck s asset and induce elevated liver enzyme levels in patients

220684,442200,PFE,U S  judge won t toss insider trading conviction of SAC s Martoma,news,"By Joseph Ax NEW YORK  Reuters    A federal judge on Thursday refused to throw out the insider trading conviction of former SAC Capital portfolio manager Mathew Martoma  saying the trial evidence  overwhelmingly demonstrated Martoma s guilt  
The decision from U S  District Judge Paul Gardephe  who oversaw the trial earlier this year  was in response to a request from Martoma and came ahead of his sentencing on Monday on conspiracy and securities fraud convictions 
A jury found Martoma  40  guilty in February of engaging in what prosecutors claimed was the most lucrative insider trading scheme in history  enabling SAC to make profits and avoid losses of  275 million in trades in Elan Corp and Wyeth 
Elan was acquired last year by Perrigo Company Plc  N PRGO   while Wyeth is now a unit of Pfizer Inc  N PFE  
SAC itself pleaded guilty last year to insider trading and agreed to pay  1 8 billion to settle criminal and civil charges 
Martoma was convicted of trading on confidential tips from two doctors about a clinical trial for an Alzheimer s drug that was eventually deemed ineffective 
In addition to refusing to toss Martoma s conviction  Gardephe denied his request for a new trial  The judge rejected his contention that the key government witness   Sidney Gilman  a doctor who testified as part of a cooperation deal that he had given Martoma the clinical results   was unreliable 
 To the contrary  Dr  Gilman s account was   as to the key issues   supported by strong circumstantial evidence   Gardephe wrote 
Martoma also claimed the jury was tainted by widespread media reports regarding his expulsion from Harvard for doctoring a transcript 
But Gardephe said there was no evidence any juror had been exposed to that information 
Martoma s defense lawyer  Richard Strassberg  did not immediately respond to a request for comment 
Manhattan U S  Attorney Preet Bharara has recommended a  substantial  prison term beyond the eight years recommended by probation officers  according to court filings 
An eight year term would be among the stiffest insider trading penalties handed down in recent years  Lawyer Matthew Kluger received the longest U S  insider trading sentence at 12 years after pleading guilty in 2011 to participating in a  37 million scheme 
Martoma is one of eight SAC employees to be convicted of insider trading  SAC s founder  Steven A  Cohen  has not been criminally charged 
The firm has changed its name to Point72 Asset Management and no longer manages outside money  instead focusing on Cohen s family fortune

220685,442201,PFE,SAC s Martoma gets nine years prison for insider trading,news,"By Nate Raymond NEW YORK  Reuters    Mathew Martoma  a former portfolio manager at billionaire Steven A  Cohen s SAC Capital Advisors LP hedge fund  was sentenced on Monday to nine years in prison for engaging in what authorities called the most lucrative insider trading scheme in U S  history 
U S  District Judge Paul Gardephe in New York said he had to account for the  enormous   275 million gain SAC obtained as a result of illegal trades in pharmaceutical stocks  Prosecutors said the trades were based on tips Martoma received about a clinical trial for an Alzheimer s drug 
 I cannot and will not ignore that the gain is hundreds of millions of dollars more than ever seen in an insider trading prosecution   Gardephe said 
The sentence came despite appeals for leniency by Richard Strassberg  Martoma s lawyer  who cited  fragile family circumstances   Gardephe also ordered Martoma to forfeit  9 3 million  including his Boca Raton  Florida  home 
While Martoma  40  faced up to 19 1 2 years in prison under federal sentencing guidelines  Gardephe said such punishment should be reserved for repeat offenders or criminal enterprise leaders 
But the judge said a severe sentence was nonetheless necessary  saying  there was nothing accidental about Mr  Martoma s conduct or the gain realized  
Martoma  whom a jury convicted in February of securities fraud and conspiracy  made no comment as he left the court holding his wife s hand 
The ex trader and his family were  devastated by the outcome   said Lou Colasuonno  a spokesman for Martoma  saying an appeal is planned 
The nine year sentence is among the longer prison terms in U S  insider trading cases  reflecting a trend of increasingly lengthy sentences in recent years 
In 2012  corporate lawyer Matthew Kluger was sentenced in New Jersey to 12 years for trading on information from law firms about mergers  A year earlier  Galleon Group hedge fund founder Raj Rajaratnam was sentenced in New York to 11 years 
Manhattan U S  Attorney Preet Bharara  whose office is engaged in a broad crackdown on insider trading  called the nine year sentence  well suited to the audacity of the illegal trading in this case  
The case against Martoma  who worked in SAC s CR Intrinsic Investors unit  stemmed from a long running insider trading investigation of the hedge fund 
Eight employees have been convicted  and SAC last year agreed to pay  1 8 billion in criminal and civil settlements and plead guilty to fraud charges 
SAC recently changed its name to Point72 Asset Management  and the Stamford  Connecticut firm was transformed into a family office managing Cohen s fortune 
Prosecutors said Martoma sought confidential information from doctors involved in a clinical trial of an Alzheimer s drug being developed by Elan Corp  since acquired by Perrigo Co  N PRGO   and Wyeth  now a unit of Pfizer Inc  N PFE  
Based on a tip Martoma received from Sidney Gilman  a former University of Michigan professor who chaired the drug s safety monitoring committee  SAC Capital in July 2008 began selling its  700 million position in Elan and Wyeth  prosecutors said 
They said most of the trading occurred in accounts controlled by Cohen  who had a 20 minute phone call with Martoma after receiving information about the negative results of the study 
Cohen has not been criminally charged 
He faces a U S  Securities and Exchange Commission civil action seeking to bar him from the financial services industry for failing to supervise Martoma and Michael Steinberg  an SAC portfolio manager convicted of insider trading in a separate trial in December 
Cohen denies wrongdoing  A spokesman declined to comment

220695,442211,PFE,Roche Announces Data On Perjeta  Alecensa And Tecentriq ,opinion,"Roche Holdings AG   OTC RHHBY   announced data from the phase III study  APHINITY  on breast cancer drug Perjeta  The data from the study showed that the combination of Perjeta  Herceptin and chemotherapy  the Perjeta based regimen  significantly reduced the risk of breast cancer recurrence or death  invasive disease free survival  iDFS  by 19  in patients suffering from HER2 positive early breast cancer  eBC  compared with Herceptin and chemotherapy alone  
94 1  of people treated with the Perjeta based regimen did not experience the recurrence of cancer compared with 93 2  treated with Herceptin and chemotherapy at the end of three years  The results will be presented in an oral session today at the 53rd Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology  ASCO  
We remind investors that Roche has a strong presence in the oncology market  The company dominates the breast cancer space with strong demand for HER2 franchise drugs like Herceptin  Perjeta and Kadcyla 
However  competition is becoming stiff in the breast cancer market with companies like Novartis   NYSE NVS   getting a boost with approval of new drugs like Kisqali 
Pfizer Inc    NYSE PFE   also announced data from its phase II study  ABRAZO  which is evaluating talazoparib in advanced breast cancer patients with germline BRCA 1 2 positive  gBRCA   mutations  showing anti tumor activity at the ASCO 

Roche s share price shows that the company has outperformed the Zacks classified industry year to date  The stock is up 14 6  compared with the  industry s gain of 10 8  
Coming back to the ASCO meet  Roche also announced positive data from the phase III study  ALEX  on lung cancer drug Alecensa  The data from the study showed that Alecensa significantly reduced the risk of disease worsening or death  progression free survival  PFS  by more than half  53   compared with crizotinib when given as initial  first line  treatment for people with anaplastic lymphoma kinase  ALK  positive advanced non small cell lung cancer  NSCLC   The primary endpoint of the study was not reached 
Alecensa lowered the risk of tumour spread or growth in the brain or central nervous system  We note that Alecensa is approved as a monotherapy for patients suffering from ALK positive NSCLC who have progressed on or are intolerant to crizotinib in Europe and the U S 
Alecensa was granted conditional marketing authorisation in Feb 2017 in the EU as a monotherapy for patients suffering from ALK positive advanced NSCLC previously treated with crizotinib  Hence  Roche is submitting the data from the ALEX study as the specific obligation to obtain full approval of Alecensa as an initial treatment for ALK positive advanced NSCLC 
New drug launches  such as Tecentriq  Cotellic and Alecensa boosted sales and are expected to continue to do so in the upcoming quarters 
Earlier  Roche also presented new encouraging data on immunotherapy drug Tecentriq along with updates from its cancer immunotherapy development program at ASCO 2017 
Data from a study on Tecentriq plus Avastin in metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma  mRCC  highlight the combination s potential to increase infiltration  trafficking  of T cells into tumors and other immune modulatory properties 
Alongside  two phase Ib studies in melanoma combining Tecentriq plus Cotelic and Tecentriq plus Cotellic plus Zelboraf showed that the addition of Zelboraf and or Cotellic may alter the tumor micro environment  enhancing the anti tumor activity of Tecentriq 
Immuno oncology is a key focus area for Roche  with the company currently having multiple candidates under development  The FDA granted accelerated approval to immuno oncology drug  Tecentriq in May 2016 for the treatment of patients suffering from locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma  Initial uptake of the drug has been encouraging

220698,442214,PFE,Lawsuits Against Pfizer s Lipitor Spike In Past 5 Months,news,"By    New York based pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc  NYSE PFE saw a steep hike in the number of lawsuits filed against it by American women claiming that the company knew about the side effects of its blockbuster cholesterol drug Lipitor but did not issue an official warning 
The number of federal court filings against the company has reportedly increased from 56 to 1 000 in the last five months  where plaintiffs claim that the use of Lipitor for lowering cholesterol levels  gave them type 2 diabetes  The recent spike in lawsuits against the company follows an order from a federal judicial panel to bring all the cases filed across the U S  against Pfizer into a single courtroom  Pfizer  which plans to contest the claims  has reportedly declined to follow the order claiming it will trigger copycat lawsuits 
 We will ask a jury to decide what it s worth to take five years of someone s life   H  Blair Hahn  of Mount Pleasant  South Carolina  and the plaintiffs  lead lawyer said  according to Reuters  Hahn also said that the 1 000 cases filed so far represent nearly 4 000 women  and estimated that the number of cases could rise ten fold to 10 000 
Lipitor belongs to a class of drugs called statins  which work in the liver to reduce the production of cholesterol  while diabetes takes away the body s ability to produce insulin  which helps convert food to energy 
In 2012  the U S  Food and Drug Administration  or FDA  reportedly issued a warning that the use of statin drugs like Lipitor could increase the risk of diabetes and memory loss  In January  the FDA warning was updated to provide a detailed list of side effects  including muscle damage and liver injury in extreme cases 

 Clearly we think that the heart benefit of statins outweighs this small increased risk   Amy G  Egan  deputy director for safety in FDA s Division of Metabolism and Endocrinology Products  said in the FDA statement  adding that the patients might have to be tested for their blood sugar levels regularly  after they begin treatment with statins

220706,442222,PFE,Universal Display  Hewlett Packard  Regeneron Pharmaceuticals  Sangamo Therapeutics And Puma Biotechnology Highlighted As Zacks Bull And Bear Of The Day,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL   June 02  2017   highlights Universal Display Corporation  NASDAQ          as the Bull of the Day Hewlett Packard Enterprise  NYSE         as the Bear of the Day  In addition  Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Regeneron Pharmaceuticals  Inc   NASDAQ           Sangamo Therapeutics  Inc   NASDAQ          and Puma Biotechnology  Inc   NASDAQ          

	Here is a synopsis of all five stocks 

   

	One of the best purchases for my somewhat new place was an OLED TV  If you aren t familiar with the technology  OLED  or Organic Light Emitting Diode     and does not require backlighting 

	This allows displays made with this technology to be thin and flexible  and it gives a huge contrast ratio including blacker blacks and whiter whites  relative to many other types of displays  The TV looks great 

	But from an investment perspective  this technology is sweeping not only across TVs  but various other devices in the tech world such as phones and computer screens  And the company behind much of this technology  Universal Display Corporation  NASDAQ           is looking like an especially intriguing investment these days 

OLED Stock in Focus

	In the company s most recent earnings report  the company easily beat expectations  and actually posted a pretty incredible beat  The stock was expected to see earnings of one cent per share and actually posted 22 cents per share instead  The firm also said there was building    for products using OLED displays  so guidance is looking pretty promising as well 

	Thanks to this strength  analysts have been raising their estimates for OLED stock  pretty much across the board  In fact  we haven t seen any estimate cuts in the past sixty days to the current quarter  current year  or next year consensus  We have actually seen a surging consensus for the full year as analysts clearly believe in the momentum too  The company s consensus has moved higher by about 27  in the past month  while we are seeing a seven percent increase for the following year 

	There is a lot to like about the story in the OLED market these days  and that is further backed up by the impressive industry and sector rank for the stock  Shares have a top 40  rank for both the industry and the sector  while Universal Display Corporation has a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  rating itself 

	Bear 

	One of the big stories so far this year has been the incredible performance of the tech sector at large  Many of the big caps in this space have dominated the market  and have put up double digit percentage gains in the process too 

	But  it hasn t been that way for every name in the space  Take Hewlett Packard Enterprise  NYSE         for example  Sure  the company had a spin off so the chart for this year might look incredibly bad  but the recent earnings report and price performance signal that HPE investors might want to get used to seeing red in their positions 

Recent Earnings Report

	Hewlett Packard Enterprise just released earnings  and the numbers left much to be desired from the company  Revenues plunged 12 5  for the continuing operations part of the business  and was led by a double digit percentage slump in revenues for servers  storage  and a 30  slump for networking  Earnings were also pretty weak  as they easily missed estimates on the bottom line too 

	And worst of all  things don t appear as though they are going to be turning around anytime soon  Guidance was also sluggish  and it isn t like the competitive pressures are going to diminish in the coming quarters either 

	Analysts have already taken note of these trends and we saw several cuts to HPE s consensus estimate heading into the report  And now  with the weak outlook and tough position against peers  it isn t unreasonable to think that this trend will continue in the weeks ahead too  No wonder HPE currently has an  F  growth score  and why we have a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  on the company too 

Other Choices

	Though things aren t looking great for HPE in the near term  there are plenty of other choices out there for investors  Sure  the computer integrated systems industry has a rank in the bottom 25   but the tech sector has a rank in the top 40   So  investors just have to look outside of HPE s industry for some better options in the tech space

3 Hot Biotech Stocks to Buy in June

	The biotech sector  which started the year on a strong note  has been witnessing a decline especially from March    year to date  YTD   the Zacks categorized  industry is down 1 1  while the overall market is up 8 2   A key concern for the sector remains the drug pricing issue which remains an overhang  Given the intense political and media focus on this issue  investors remain jittery about putting their money in this corner of the market 
	With the industry currently ranked among the bottom 40  of the 256 Zacks ranked industries  should one avoid stocks in this segment of the market  Not really    while we admit that the sector is facing challenges like declining sales of legacy products  biosimilar competition  mixed earnings results  high profile pipeline setbacks and slower than expected new product launches  there are some factors that provide upside potential 
	The industry will continue to witness demand for its products given an aging population and the increasing prevalence of a wide variety of diseases  Strong late stage pipelines  innovative treatments  impressive results  and increased health care spending should support growth  According to a report issued by the QuintilesIMS Institute  medicine spending through 2021 is expected to grow in mid single digits  Trump s pro business stand is also expected to benefit the sector  A faster drug approval process and the proposed removal of outdated regulations that drive up costs and slow down innovation should also work in favor of the sector 
	While drug pricing will remain a headline risk until some plan is announced by the administration  here are a few biotech stocks that have performed well YTD and look well positioned 
	First on our list is Tarrytown  NY basedRegeneron Pharmaceuticals  Inc   NASDAQ           While eye drug  Eylea  the company s key growth driver continues to perform well  Regeneron has been working on diversifying its portfolio and gained FDA approval for two drugs this year    Dupixent  moderate to severe atopic dermatitis  and Kevzara  moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis   Both drugs have blockbuster potential with Dupixent already off to a strong start  The company also has a strong pipeline comprising 16 candidates including for cancer  Regeneron  a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  stock  has outperformed the Zacks categorized Medical Biomedical Genetics industry with shares gaining 25  YTD  Estimated earnings growth for the current year is 27 4

	Another Zacks Rank  2 biotech stock that has had a strong run so far this year is Puma Biotechnology  Inc   NASDAQ          Puma s shares are up 149 4  YTD with the company receiving a huge boost with an FDA advisory panel voting in favor of its experimental breast cancer treatment  neratinib  The FDA s Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee voted 12   4 in favor of approving neratinib for the extended adjuvant treatment of HER2 positive early stage breast cancer based on a favorable risk benefit profile  Given the favorable vote  chances of gaining approval look pretty high  FDA approval would be a major boost for Puma which currently has no marketed products in its portfolio 
	While all three stocks mentioned above are Zacks Rank  2 stocks  you can see  Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars 
	Here s another stock idea to consider  Much like petroleum 150 years ago  lithium power may soon shake the world  creating millionaires and reshaping geo politics  Soon electric vehicles  EVs  may be cheaper than gas guzzlers  Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge 
	With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply  one company stands out as the  1 stock to buy according to Zacks research 
	It s not the one you think

220710,442226,PFE,Shire  AbbVie to announce  53 billion merger by Friday  sources,news,"By Olivia Oran and Soyoung Kim  Reuters    Shire Plc and U S  drugmaker Abbvie Inc plan to announce a  53 billion merger as soon as Friday morning  two people said on Thursday 
Dublin based Shire  which sells drugs for rare diseases  said earlier this week it was ready to recommend a deal to shareholders after AbbVie increased its offer 
AbbVie  which is based in Chicago and makes top selling arthritis drug Humira  boosted its bid for Shire to 53 20 pounds per share on Sunday  Shire has rejected four previous bids 
The people cautioned the deal could still take longer to complete and the deadline for an offer could be extended 
Under British takeover rules AbbVie has until July 18 to announce a firm offer for Shire  extend the deadline for an offer  or walk away 
AbbVie is eager to buy Shire both to reduce its U S  tax bill by moving its tax base to Britain   a tactic known as inversion   and to diversify its drug portfolio  AbbVie currently generates nearly 60 percent of its revenue from Humira  the world s top selling medicine  which loses U S  patent protection in late 2016 

AbbVie s move is the second attempt by a U S  drugmaker to buy a London listed rival after Pfizer Inc s  118 billion pursuit of AstraZeneca Plc failed in May over price 
Reuters reported on Saturday that Shire had asked AbbVie to sweeten its offer to near 53 pounds per share so it could recommend the deal  Shire confirmed the news on Monday 
Representatives for Shire and AbbVie declined to comment 
 This version of the story corrects paragraph 7 to show failed bid for AstraZeneca happened in May not June

220711,442227,PFE,Pfizer s need for deal looms larger with earnings report,news,"By Ransdell Pierson NEW YORK  Reuters    Pfizer Inc s vulnerability to cheaper generics and its weak roster of experimental medicines will be on display Tuesday when the company reports quarterly earnings  reviving interest in its pursuit of AstraZeneca Plc or other deals to fortify its pipeline 
The largest U S  drugmaker  whose laboratories have not come up with any big selling new medicines for a decade  is expected to report significantly lower second quarter revenue 
While many industry watchers expect Pfizer to re engage with Britain s AstraZeneca in coming months  some say the U S  drugmaker should consider targets more focused on biotechnology  a strategy that has paid off for Merck   Co and Bristol Myers Squibb Co 
Although Pfizer is conducting trials of promising products   including breast cancer drug palbociclib and vaccines against meningitis and staph aureus   it needs far more drugs to generate meaningful sales growth  said Ori Hershkovitz  analyst with the Tel Aviv based Sphera Fund  which holds Pfizer shares 
     Pfizer is in a very desperate spot  having seen most of its pipeline disappoint and facing multiple patent expirations   he said   It needs growth  it needs to buy a pipeline  
Pfizer on May 26 officially abandoned its six month quest for AstraZeneca after its final  118 billion offer was spurned  Investors still see a rationale for the deal  which would allow Pfizer to enjoy lower corporate tax rates as a UK based company and a promising pipeline of new cancer treatments 
Under British takeover law  AstraZeneca could reach out to Pfizer in August and Pfizer could make renewed overtures to its smaller rival in November 
 I definitely think Pfizer will come back for Astra at a somewhat higher bid   Hershkovitz said  But he recommended Pfizer consider smaller targets whose treatments might broaden its existing research priorities  such as Belgium s UCB SA and Switzerland s Actelion Ltd 
UCB  which makes treatments for epilepsy  rheumatoid arthritis and Parkinson s disease  has annual sales of  5 billion  and a market value of  17 billion  Actelion sells lucrative drugs for orphan diseases  rare and often life threatening conditions that command high prices  It has annual sales of  2 billion and a market capitalization of  15 billion 
Leerink Swann analyst Jason Gerberry has said it might make sense for Pfizer to buy Dublin based generic drugmaker Actavis  which itself just bought U S  specialty drugmaker Forest Laboratories for  25 billion 
Disappointment with Pfizer is reflected in its stock price  which has fallen 1 4 percent this year  against a 11 percent gain for the ARCA Pharmaceutical Index of large U S  and European drugmakers  Over the past two years  its shares have risen 27 percent  versus a 44 percent jump for the drug sector 
A fresh wave of patent expirations on Pfizer s top drugs is approaching  Its Celebrex painkiller faces generics in the United States late this year  while impotence treatment Viagra goes generic in 2017  The company s biggest product  Lyrica for nerve pain  loses U S  patent protection by 2018  The three drugs have combined annual sales of almost  9 billion  and account for almost 20 percent of Pfizer s total revenue 
    Biotechs with drugs already on the market and which also have exciting technologies should be on Pfizer s wish list  said Navid Malik  analyst with London based Cenkos Securities  He cited companies such as Celgene Inc and Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc 
Roger Pomerantz  who headed business development at Merck from 2010 until last summer  said the potential of Merck s immuno oncology drugs   medicines which train the immune system to recognize cancer cells   was not recognized even within the company for several years after it acquired them 

 It s who you have on the inside helping you understand the science  that counts  he said

The first inhaled insulin offering to win FDA marketing approval did not have a happy history  Pfizer Inc s  NYSE PFE  Exubera was available in the U S  between September 2006 and October 2007  but the major drug manufacturer pulled the plug when it failed in the marketplace  where competing products historically have been administered by injection 
Alfred E  Mann  MannKind s founder  chairman and CEO  seems unlikely to follow in Pfizer s footsteps should Afrezza s sales falter in its first year or so on the market  Announcing its FDA approval on Friday  Mann said in a statement   We are excited for patients  as we believe that Afrezza s distinct profile and noninjectable administration will address many of their unmet needs for mealtime insulin therapy  and has the potential to change the way that diabetes is treated  
Afrezza is a rapid acting inhaled insulin that is administered either at the beginning of each meal or within 20 minutes of starting it 
About 29 1 million Americans  or 9 3 percent of the U S  population  are believed to have diabetes  according to the  National Diabetes Statistics Report  2014  prepared by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  Accordingly  Afrezza s addressable market is massive 
Equity investors and trader appeared to be focusing on the size of this addressable market after the close of trading on Friday  when MNKD s share price advanced in the postmarket session to  11 00 from  10 00  a gain of  1 00  or 10 percent  following the FDA announcement of Afrezza s approval 

Animal spirits in the stock market may have been restrained    a little or a lot    by the FDA s noting that Afrezza has a Boxed Warning advising that acute bronchospasm has been observed in patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  COPD   As a result  the agency pointed out Afrezza should not be used in patients with chronic lung disease  such as asthma or COPD 
Based in Valencia  Calif   MannKind is also being required to conduct four postmarketing studies for Afrezza  According to the FDA  the drug s efficacy and safety were evaluated in a total of 3 017 clinical trial participants    1 026 with type 1 diabetes and 1 991 with type 2 diabetes ",2014-06-29,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/fda-approval-of-mannkind's-inhaled-insulin-a-breath-of-fresh-air-291983,291983

220738,442254,PFE,AstraZeneca Leaves Door Ajar To Pfizer  Despite Hurdles,news,"By    Astrazeneca s  LONDON AZN  boss said on Wednesday he would engage with Pfizer Inc  NYSE PFE  if the price was right and the risks posed from forcing the British drugmaker s operations into the U S  company s new three unit model were addressed 
Chief Executive Pascal Soriot stressed his company had a bright future as a stand alone firm but acknowledged that shareholders would expect AstraZeneca s board to negotiate if terms were sufficiently attractive in a sweetened offer 
 Every shareholder says at the right level with the right offer you should consider it    that is very clear  But there is nobody who has told us a specific price at which we should engage   he told Reuters in an interview 
 If the offer was reflecting the value of the company but also addressing some of the integration aspects  the operating model and execution risks we are concerned about  then we certainly should engage   there s no doubt  
Soriot and his team have held talks with the group s leading investors during a round of meetings in London  Sweden and the United States over the past week 
Pfizer made a cash and stock takeover approach on May 2 worth 50 pounds a share to create the world s largest drugs company  valuing AstraZeneca at  106 billion  The bid was promptly dismissed by the British group s board   a decision that Soriot said had the firm backing of investors 
 There is no single shareholder who has told me or our CFO  chief financial officer  or our chairman that we should have accepted the offer   he said 
Buoyed by progress with its new drug pipeline   including a lung cancer medicine called AZD9291 for which data was released late on Wednesday   Soriot believes AstraZeneca can enjoy a strong independent future  but he has left the door ajar to a compelling offer 
In addition to price and the share of cash in any increased offer  Soriot said AstraZeneca would also need assurances about the risks faced by Pfizer in implementing a complex merger and integrating operations across two sprawling organizations 
In particular  he highlighted the problems posed by the fact
that Pfizer is now separating its operations into three business units   a structure that would clash with AstraZeneca  where the MedImmune biotech unit  for example  serves all parts the group 
Pfizer provided detailed financial results for its three business units for the first time last week  when it reported first quarter results  as a prelude to possibly divesting one or more of them in 2017 
Soriot is also worried about diluting the focus on science in the new group and the risk to reputation in Pfizer s controversial plan to re domicile in Britain in order to minimize its tax payments 
 All those issues will need to be discussed  but step one is to get to an offer that reflects the value of the company   Soriot said 
He was speaking after being questioned for two days by British politicians who are concerned about the impact of a Pfizer takeover on British science jobs 
CANCER DRUG HOPES
Soriot stressed there was  no inevitability  to a deal with Pfizer  since AstraZeneca s improving pipeline of new drugs was transforming its prospects  following a lean period in its research labs and a wave of patent expiries 
AstraZeneca predicted last week that its sales would increase by 75 percent to more than  45 billion a year by 2023 
Much of the hope for the pipeline hinges on the company s suite of experimental cancer drugs  further details of which are due at the annual American Society of Clinical Oncology  ASCO  conference on May 30 June 3 
One of those drugs  lung cancer treatment AZD9291  has produced promising results in an early stage clinical trial  details of which were released ahead of the ASCO meeting  The drug  which shrank tumors in more than half of patients  is a potential replacement for established lung cancer pills Tarceva and Iressa 
Soriot also highlighted the potential of MEDI4736  a medicine designed to boost the immune system  and a promising combination of two other cancer drugs  olaparib and cediranib 
 We think we can succeed because we have innovative products  not because we have a large commercial offering   Soriot said 
 At ASCO  we will show Phase I  clinical trial  results but also share some information about our development plans  which will show people where we think we can be first and where we think we can potentially come up with treatment algorithms that will totally change the way some types of cancer are treated  ",2014-05-14,International Business Times,"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/astrazeneca-leaves-door-ajar-to-pfizer,-despite-hurdles-284359",284359
220739,442255,PFE,Pfizer Raises Bid For AstraZeneca To  117B,news,"By    LONDON   U S  drugmaker Pfizer  NYSE PFE  said on Sunday it had raised its offer for British rival Astrazeneca  LONDON AZN  to 69 3 billion pounds   116 6 billion   or 55 pounds a share  and would walk away if AstraZeneca did not accept it               
Pfizer wants to create the world s largest drugs company  with a headquarters in New York but a tax base in Britain  where corporate tax rates are lower than in the United States  It has met entrenched opposition from AstraZeneca  as well as many politicians and scientists who fear cuts to jobs and research               
The U S  group said its new offer was final and could not be increased  It said it would not make a hostile offer directly to AstraZeneca shareholders and would only proceed with an offer with the recommendation of the AstraZeneca board               
Pfizer also increased the cash element in its offer to 45 percent  with AstraZeneca shareholders set to receive 1 747 shares in the enlarged company for each of their AstraZeneca shares and 24 76 pounds in cash 
The new offer represents a 15 percent premium over the current value of a cash and share approach made on May 2   worth 50 pounds a share at the time   which was swiftly rejected by AstraZeneca 
Nonetheless  two analysts   Raghuram Selvaraju of Aegis Capital and ISI Group s Mark Schoenebaum   said they believed the sweetened offer would boost Pfizer s earnings quickly  with Schoenebaum predicting an uplift from 2015               
Pfizer also revealed it had written to AstraZeneca s chairman on May 16 offering 53 50 pounds a share   40 percent in cash   but had been told that this still substantially undervalued the company  prompting it to make the latest last ditch offer               
 We believe our proposal is compelling for AstraZeneca s shareholders and that a Pfizer AstraZeneca combination is in the best interests of all stakeholders   Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read said in a statement 
He expressed frustration at AstraZeneca s refusal to engage in talks and urged the British company s shareholders to pressure its board to start discussions               
 Following a conversation with AstraZeneca earlier today  we do not believe that the AstraZeneca board is currently prepared to recommend a deal at a reasonable price   Read said   We remain ready to engage in a meaningful dialogue but time for constructive engagement is running out                
Two banking sources earlier described 55 pounds a share as the  magic number  at which a deal could get done and Selvaraju of Aegis said Pfizer s declaration that its offer was  final  would concentrate minds at AstraZeneca 
 The main thing that will be likely to get AstraZeneca to engage is that Ian Read  who is a tough guy  has basically said this is our final offer   he said 
In the absence of further discussions or an extension of the deadline for making a firm offer under British takeover rules  Pfizer s proposal will expire at 5 p m  London time on May 26               
An AstraZeneca spokeswoman said she had no immediate comment on Pfizer s latest proposal  which would see Pfizer shareholders owning 74 percent of the combined company  with AstraZeneca shareholders holding 26 percent 
The increased offer had been widely expected  Pfizer said last week it would consider a higher offer as it urged AstraZeneca s board to enter talks               
DRUG PIPELINE HOPES              
The British firm has laid out details of its pipeline of new drugs and argues there is no inevitability about a Pfizer deal  although its management also acknowledges the board would have to consider a compelling bid  Investors have backed AstraZeneca in rejecting 50 pounds a share  but many have said they would want it to engage in discussions if Pfizer came back with an improved offer  They fear AstraZeneca shares will tumble if Pfizer walks away               
There has been a mounting political backlash against the proposed deal in Britain  the United States and Sweden  where AstraZeneca has half its roots 
The Swedish government launched a concerted effort on Friday against a merger it fears will lead to cuts in science jobs and research  echoing concerns aired by British lawmakers at two parliamentary hearings last week and fears for U S  jobs in states where AstraZeneca has a large presence               
Pfizer s bid would be the largest foreign takeover of a British firm and is opposed by many scientists and politicians who fear it will undermine Britain s science base               
British Prime Minister David Cameron has said he wants more assurances from Pfizer  and science minister David Willetts said last week he would like to see longer guarantees on investment than the five years currently promised by Pfizer               
The UK government has held exploratory discussions with Brussels about strengthening its ability to force Pfizer to honor commitments on jobs and research under European Union rules               
But Cameron  head of the free market Conservative Party  has also said Britain does not want to be seen to be pulling up the drawbridge to foreign companies 
Although Pfizer has given a five year commitment to complete AstraZeneca s new research centre in Cambridge  retain a factory in northern England and put a fifth of its research staff in Britain  it has said this could be adjusted if circumstances change  significantly                
Pfizer s Read said on Sunday   We stand by our unprecedented commitments to the UK government                
The tax aspects of the deal  meanwhile  have sparked anger in the United States  where lawmakers are now considering legislation to prevent so called corporate inversions  under which U S  companies re incorporate overseas to avoid U S  taxes               
Inversions have helped fuel a wave of deals in the pharmaceuticals sector in recent months  but buying AstraZeneca would allow Pfizer to carry out the largest such deal yet ",2014-05-18,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/pfizer-raises-bid-for-astrazeneca-to-$117b-284920,284920

Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to the stock s next earnings release  or is it due for a pullback  Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late  let s take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers Pfizer Fourth Quarter Earnings Lag  Sales Top  2017 Sales View SoftPfizer s fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of  0 47 missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  0 50 by 6  Earnings also declined 11  year over year due to lower revenues and higher costs and taxes than year ago quarter Foreign exchange negatively impacted fourth quarter adjusted earnings by approximately  0 04 per share Pfizer posted revenues of  13 63 billion  slightly higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  13 55 billion  However  revenues declined 3  from the year ago period  Fewer selling days compared to the year ago quarter hurt sales in the fourth quarter Sales in DetailWhile currency movement impacted Pfizer s fourth quarter revenues by 2    228 million   operational declined 1    191 million  Pfizer s standalone business  excluding the impact of foreign exchange  and the legacy Hospira and Medivation operations  recorded revenues of  12 32 billion  down 2  year over year on an operational basis  Hospira contributed  1 17 billion to sales Lower sales of the Prevnar Prevenar 13 vaccines franchise and loss of exclusivity for some products  offset strong performance of key products like Ibrance  breast cancer   Lyrica  neuropathic pain  and Xeljanz  rheumatoid arthritis

reorganized its reporting segments to Pfizer Innovative Health  IH  and Pfizer Essential Health  EH  Pfizer IH sales grew 1   up 2  operationally  from the year ago period to  7 73 billion Pfizer IH revenues were driven by persistently strong momentum of Ibrance in the U S   robust operational growth of Eliquis globally  and growth of Lyrica and Xeljanz primarily in the U S  Also  revenues from the blockbuster prostate cancer drug Xtandi  added to Pfizer s portfolio following the Sep 2016 Medivation acquisition  also propelled U S  revenues  This was partially offset by continued decline in revenues from Prevnar 13 for adults in the U S  and lower revenues of Enbrel  down 22   in key European markets due to biosimilar competition  The 2015 expiration of the collaboration agreement to co promote Rebif in the U S  also hurt revenues Prevnar revenues tanked 33  in the U S  due to  high initial capture rate  of the eligible adult patient population following Prevnar 13 s successful 2014 launch  which resulted in a smaller remaining  catch up  opportunity in the fourth quarter compared to the year ago quarter  Meanwhile  the unfavorable timing of government purchases for the pediatric indication also hurt Prevnar sales  In 2017  the company expects global Prevnar 13 revenues to remain flat to slightly down with sales declining in the U S While Consumer Healthcare revenues rose 2  to  950 million  Global Oncology revenues surged 46  to  1 36 billion driven by Xalkori and Ibrance  Ibrance received EU approval in Nov 2016 and will begin to launch across Europe in 2017  This

220749,442265,PFE,Pfizer Falls On Department Of Justice Subpoena,opinion,"Pfizer  NYSE PFE  didn t have the best of times in the market last week  and for good reason  The company was served subpoenas on Wednesday  leading to investor fears  Today  we ll talk about the subpoena s  why investors pushed the stock down as a result  and what traders should be watching for ahead  So  let s get right to it 
Pfizer Served Subpoenas In US Antitrust CaseAs mentioned above  Pfizer had a rough week in the market last week  and a good portion of the declines can be attributed to subpoenas the company was served by the United States Department of Justice  The subpoenas are part of a widespread antitrust investigation surrounding saline fluids during the flu season about 3 years ago 
You see  during this season  saline fluids are in high demand as more and more consumers find themselves ill and dehydrated  As the law of supply and demand tells us  when supplies are low and demand is high  the price of the product must rise  Well  rise it did  However  there s a strong argument that the price of saline fluids went far above natural supply and demand growth  In fact  those prices went up by around 200  and 300  at Hospira  a company that Pfizer acquired and is now dealing with the backlash surrounding 
While normal supply and demand based growth in price is completely legal  the Department of Justice is investigating to see if the gains in the price were legal or an illegal activity known as price gouging  Of course  if price gouging did take place with regard to a product as important as saline fluid  chances are that there will be quite a bit of legal recourse as a result 
Why This Is Leading To Fear Among InvestorsAt the end of the day  the reason that Pfizer is down is a big deal  You see  Pfizer is one of the many companies that has centered its business around saving lives and improving the quality of life among the ill  While price gouging alone is a bad thing  price gouging with regard to products that are needed in the medical community is a major concern 
As a result  investors are expecting that Pfizer will have quite a bit of money coming out of its pockets in relation to this issue  After all  even if the company didn t do anything wrong  these investigations usually lead to legal expenses that can reach into the millions  On the other hand  if Hospira  previously acquired by Pfizer  did price gouge on such an important product  well  the cost to Pfizer could prove to be a major one 
What Traders Should Be Watching For AheadMoving forward  traders should be keeping a close eye on Pfizer as the stock is likely to present several opportunities ahead  However  if you d like to take advantage of these opportunities  it s important that you pay very close attention to the news  In particular  keep a close eye on the antitrust case that Pfizer is facing at the moment  As mentioned above  if this thing goes the wrong way  it could prove to be an incredibly large cost to the company  and ultimately lead to declines  However  that s not the only story to watch  Continue to watch the company s work with regard to its pipeline  sales  and other key business metrics as any news with regard to these will likely cause movement as well ",2017-04-24,anyoption,https://www.investing.com/analysis/pfizer-falls-on-department-of-justice-subpoena-200184533,200184533
220751,442267,PFE,Pfizer Presses AstraZeneca Case As CEO Faces UK Grilling,news,"By    U S  drugmaker Pfizer Inc  NYSE PFE  pressed the scientific case for its controversial plan to acquire Astrazeneca  LONDON AZN  on Monday as its chief executive prepared for a grilling from British lawmakers 
In the latest phase of Pfizer s campaign to counter critics of its proposed  106 billion deal  research head Mikael Dolsten said he had been through five different mergers and acquisitions and denied such big transactions disrupted drug research 
 If you keep your sense of curiosity and an open mind  you can learn tremendously   he said in a video posted on the company s website 
 We must stay laser focused on our important projects  And that s  of course  true for Pfizer scientists and AZ scientists and will be true also if we can make a potential combination come together  
British lawmakers are due to quiz Dolsten s boss  Scottish born Chief Executive Ian Read  on May 13 about his plans to acquire Britain s second biggest pharmaceuticals business   a deal driven in large part by Pfizer s wish to cut its tax bill  
They will also interrogate AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot and business minister Vince Cable 
A second parliamentary committee on May 14 will question both CEOs again about the science aspects of the deal  along with Pfizer s Dolsten and science minister David Willetts 

Buying AstraZeneca would be the largest foreign takeover of a British firm  Pfizer s approach has been rejected by AstraZeneca and the idea of a merger is opposed by many scientists and some politicians who fear it would damage the country s science base 
Dolsten said there was  a really great fit  with the products that AstraZeneca had in its portfolio  with potential for combining drugs in areas such as lung cancer to offer much more effective treatments 
Pfizer has given a five year commitment to complete AstraZeneca s new research center in Cambridge  retain a factory in the northwestern English town of Macclesfield and put a fifth of its research staff in Britain if the deal goes ahead 
But the U S  firm has also said it could adjust those promises if circumstances change  significantly   prompting demands for more watertight pledges 
Prime Minister David Cameron said on Sunday he had made  very good progress  in securing guarantees from Pfizer  However  Dolsten s remarks contained no new pledges on preserving British science jobs 
SWEETENED OFFER 
Pfizer is widely expected to come back with a sweetened offer for AstraZeneca this week  though people familiar with the matter said it was likely to wait until after the parliamentary select committee hearings 
The British group rejected a May 2 cash and stock offer worth 50 pounds a share from its larger American rival  and CEO Soriot has been on a roadshow to meet leading investors and lay out his strategy for a prosperous independent future 
Soriot has secured the backing of several high profile shareholders  but others have told Reuters they would like him to engage with Pfizer if the U S  group makes an improved offer 
In addition to wanting a higher price   many analysts think Pfizer will have to offer around 55 pounds a share   investors are also keen to increase the proportion of cash in any deal from 32 percent at present 
Pfizer is limited in the amount of cash it can offer since in order to keep the tax advantages of re domiciling to Britain it must ensure at least 20 percent of the enlarged group is British owned 
Under British takeover rules  Pfizer has until May 26 to make a firm bid for AstraZeneca or walk away 
A slide in Pfizer s share price following its first quarter results last week has reduced the current value of its May 2 offer to just under 48 pounds  AstraZeneca shares traded barely changed at 46 pounds early on Monday 
Political concerns about the proposed takeover have been fuelled by Pfizer s record of making big job cuts after past acquisitions  It also has a tarnished reputation in Britain after shutting down most of its drug research in Sandwich  southern England  where Viagra was invented  with the loss of some 1 700 jobs 
Pfizer s Read also laid out the case for a merger in videos posted by the U S  group on Saturday  when he said strong British research was a key reason for the deal ",2014-05-12,International Business Times,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/pfizer-presses-astrazeneca-case-as-ceo-faces-uk-grilling-283466,283466
220757,442273,PFE,Roche Launches Antibody Test To Diagnose Prostate Cancer,opinion,"Roche Holding  SIX ROG  AG   OTC RHHBY   announced that it has launched the anti p504s  SP116  Rabbit Monoclonal Primary Antibody for prostate cancer diagnosis on a world wise basis 
Roche s share price shows that the company has outperformed the Zacks classified industry year to date  The stock rallied 12 9  compared with the  industry s gain of 5 9  

 
The antibody is designed in a way that it can be used in a dual stain with the VENTANA Basal Cell Cocktail  34 E12 p63   This enables it to differentiate morphologically difficult cases as benign  a typical or cancerous on a single slide  In fact  elevated expression of p504s has become a useful biomarker in the diagnosis of prostate adenocarcinoma  It helps in reducing the need for multiple slides to make a diagnosis  Also  it aids the clinicians in making a more accurate diagnosis with a smaller tissue sample 
Roche is expanding its presence in the diagnostics market  The division added nine key instruments and tests to its portfolio in 2016  In 2016  revenues at the Diagnostics division climbed 7  on the back of solid performance of the Centralised and Point of Care Solutions  9   unit 
In addition  the company also launched four new medicines  Cotellic  advanced melanoma   Alecensa  lung cancer   Venclexta  chronic lymphocytic leukemia  jointly commercialised with AbbVie  and Tecentriq  bladder and lung cancer   In addition  five FDA breakthrough therapy designations were granted for Roche medicines in 2016 
We note that the company has a strong presence in the oncology market  It dominates in the breast cancer space with strong demand for HER2 franchise drugs like Herceptin  Perjeta and Kadcyla  We are also impressed by the company s efforts to develop its portfolio immunology  Evidently  new drug launches such as Tecentriq  Cotellic and Alecensa boosted sales and are expected to continue to do so in the upcoming quarters as well 
Recently  Roche presented encouraging results from the phase III study  ALUR  evaluating its lung cancer drug Alecensa  The study met its primary endpoint as Alecensa significantly improved progression free survival  PFS  in patients In fact  patients suffering from anaplastic lymphoma kinase  ALK  positive advanced  metastatic  non small cell lung cancer  NSCLC  and had progressed following treatment with one prior line of both platinum based chemotherapy and Pfizer s   NYSE PFE   Xalkori  compared with chemotherapy are likely to benefit from the same 
Notably  Alecensa received conditional marketing authorization from the European Commission for patients suffering from ALK positive NSCLC  who were treated with Xalkori in Feb 2017  Also  it is approved as a monotherapy for patients suffering from ALK positive NSCLC  who have shown progress or are intolerant to Xalkori Roche Holding AG Price

220770,442286,PFE,Pfizer Chasing AstraZeneca In Potential  100B Deal,news,"By     Reuters    U S  drugmaker Pfizer Inc  NYSE PFE  is working on its next move in a potential  100 billion bid battle for Britain s Astrazeneca Plc  AZN LONDON  after having two bids rejected  as deal making grips the healthcare industry 
Pfizer said on Monday it made a 58 8 billion pounds   98 9 billion  bid approach to AstraZeneca in January and had contacted its British rival again on April 26 seeking further discussions about a takeover 
AstraZeneca shares jumped 15 percent in early trade 
The cash and shares takeover  if it happens  would be the biggest ever foreign takeover of a British company and one of the largest ever pharmaceuticals deals 
The renewed approach comes amid a wave of mergers and acquisitions in the sector  as the industry restructures in the face of healthcare spending cuts and cheap generic competition 
In a statement to the London stock market  Pfizer said AstraZeneca had declined to engage in discussions on both occasions and the U S  group said it was now considering its options 
Pfizer s original proposal  made to the board of AstraZeneca on January 5  included a combination of cash and shares and would have valued AstraZeneca shares at 46 61 pounds each   a premium of around 30 percent at the time 
Pfizer said it was now considering a possible transaction in which AstraZeneca shareholders would again receive a significant premium above the value of their shares on April 17  before takeover rumors started 

Citi analyst Andrew Baum said he believed there was now a 90 percent chance that Pfizer would acquire AstraZeneca for at least around 49 pounds a share 
Shares in the British group shot up to 46 54 pounds by 0805 GMT  4 05 a m  EDT  on Monday  after touching an all time high of 47 14 
Given that Pfizer is likely to have to offer more this time  due to a run up in AstraZeneca shares since January  the final value of any deal could be above  100 billion 
An AstraZeneca spokeswoman said the company had no immediate comment on the Pfizer statement  adding the company would be considering its response 
Under British takeover rules  Pfizer has until May 26 to announce a firm intention to make an offer for AstraZeneca or back away 
CANCER DRUG DRAW
Buying AstraZeneca would give Pfizer a number of promising   though still risky   experimental cancer medicines known as immunotherapies that boost the body s immune system to fight tumors  It could also generate significant cost savings for the U S  group 
Acquiring a foreign company also makes sense for Pfizer because it has tens of billions of dollars accumulated through foreign subsidiaries  which if repatriated to the United States would be heavily taxed 
Pfizer has a long track record of making major acquisitions  with the  68 billion purchase of Wyeth in 2009 its last major deal  after earlier acquisitions of Pharmacia and Warner Lambert 
The drugmaker has more recently been divesting certain operations  while mega mergers had fallen out of fashion in the pharmaceuticals industry following skepticism about how well some of them have worked 
But Chief Executive Ian Read said he was ready to consider large deals that made sense  adding that buying AstraZeneca would  maintain the flexibility for the potential future separation of our businesses  
The transaction would complement both Pfizer s innovative drug businesses and also its established products business   comprising older and off patent medicines   which many analysts expect to be eventually spun off 
 We believe that a transaction would further strengthen our ability to generate strong and consistent cash flow  targeted for both investment in our business and return to shareholders  while at the same time offering an efficient operating structure and the anticipated realization of attractive synergies   Read said 
The suggested deal  which first surfaced a week ago in the Sunday Times  has triggered worries about jobs in Britain s pharmaceuticals sector  which is viewed as a key industry by the government 
AstraZeneca has already laid off thousands of scientists and other staff as it shrinks its cost base to cope with a fall in sales due to patent losses on blockbuster medicines  while Pfizer has shuttered a large research site in Sandwich  southern England 
However  Britain s finance minister George Osborne has indicated a hands off approach to any deal  which he described on Friday as  a commercial matter between the companies  
Pfizer said the transaction  if completed  was expected to result in the combination of the two companies under a new UK incorporated holding company  although the head office would remain in New York

220774,442290,PFE,Pfizer Chases AstraZeneca For Potential  100 Billion Deal,news,"By     Reuters    U S  drugmaker Pfizer Inc approached Britain s AstraZeneca Plc two days ago to reignite a potential  100 billion takeover and was rebuffed  raising investor expectations it will have to increase its offer to close the deal 
Pfizer said on Monday it proposed a takeover to AstraZeneca in January worth 58 8 billion pounds   98 9 billion   or nearly 47 pounds per share  It had contacted its British rival again on Saturday  seeking to discuss further a takeover 
The chase was welcomed by investors in both companies  as deal making grips the healthcare industry  Astrazeneca Plc  AZN  shares were up 11 7 percent at  76 69 in New York on news of the latest offer  which would be the biggest foreign acquisition of a British company and one of the largest pharmaceutical deals  Pfizer Inc  NYSE PFE  shares were up 3 8 percent at  31 92 on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday afternoon 
AstraZeneca said Pfizer s suggested offer undervalued the company  very significantly   adding that Pfizer wanted to pay 70 percent in shares and only 30 percent in cash  AstraZeneca urged its shareholders to take no action and said it remained confident of its independent strategy 
 I feel pretty confident of a higher bid coming   said Neil Veitch  global and UK investment director at SVM Asset Management  which owns AstraZeneca shares   I think it s more likely than not that we ll see an agreed deal somewhere in that 52 to 53 pound range  
Buying AstraZeneca would boost Pfizer s pipeline of cancer drugs and create significant cost and tax savings  Under British takeover rules  Pfizer has until May 26 to announce a firm intention to make an offer or back away 
The renewed approach comes amid a wave of mergers and acquisitions in the sector  pushing the value of deals to  153 billion so far this year  as the industry restructures amid healthcare spending cuts and competition from cheap generics 
 Society wants products faster  they want more products and they want value   Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read told reporters   Industry is responding to society s request for increased efficiencies and productivity  
Read said AstraZeneca had declined to engage in talks and the U S  group was now considering how to proceed  but he remained convinced that combining the two companies made strategic sense and would benefit AstraZeneca investors 
NEW DRUG PIPELINES
Pfizer s original proposal  made to the board of AstraZeneca on January 5  would have valued AstraZeneca shares at 46 61 pounds each   a premium of around 30 percent at the time 
AstraZeneca said the proposal comprised 13 98 pounds in cash and 1 758 Pfizer shares for each AstraZeneca share 
 My guess is it will go for somewhere between 50 and 55  pounds a share    said Dan Mahony  a fund manager at Polar Capital  who raised his stake in AstraZeneca in February last year   I doubt Pfizer will want to go completely hostile  
Most of Pfizer s past deals have been conducted on a friendly basis  including its 2009 purchase of Wyeth for  68 billion  But it has been willing to play hardball if needed  as it did in 2000 with its  90 billion purchase of U S  rival Warner Lambert  with which it won full ownership of cholesterol fighter Lipitor  the best selling drug of all time 

Read told U S  analysts that since the initial approach to AstraZeneca  both companies had seen experimental drugs fare well in trials  At the same time  Pfizer concluded it was too difficult to pursue big deals domestically while being on the hook for higher U S  tax rates 
 We re coming from a position of strength  on our near term pipeline  of experimental drugs  Read said 
Recent favorable data includes results for Pfizer s experimental breast cancer medicine palbociclib 
INDEPENDENT FUTURE
Pfizer s declaration turns up the heat under AstraZeneca Chief Executive Pascal Soriot  who has been in the job since October 2012 and who made clear last week he saw an independent future for the group  flagging spin offs of two noncore units as one option to create more value 
Soriot has been credited with reviving AstraZeneca s previously thin pipeline of new drugs  badly needed to offset a wave of patent expiries on older drugs  and shares in the group have now risen more than 60 percent under his tenure 
However  his overhaul   including an ambitious plan to move the company s research and corporate headquarters to Cambridge  England   is still a work in progress and he has also come under fire from some shareholders over executive pay 
Read said it was premature to say who would lead a combined company 
Buying AstraZeneca would give Pfizer a number of promising   though still risky   experimental cancer medicines known as immunotherapies that boost the body s immune system to fight tumors  It could also generate significant cost savings for the U S  group 
Acquiring a foreign company also makes sense for Pfizer as it has tens of billions of dollars accumulated through foreign subsidiaries  which  if repatriated  would be heavily taxed 
The drugmaker has more recently been divesting certain operations  while mega mergers had fallen out of fashion in the pharmaceuticals industry following skepticism about how well some of them have worked 
HEFTY RETURN
But CEO Read said large deals could also make good sense and buying AstraZeneca would  maintain the flexibility for the potential future separation of our businesses  
The transaction would complement both Pfizer s innovative drug businesses and also its established products business   comprising older and off patent medicines   which many analysts expect to be eventually spun off 
In addition to using offshore cash  buying AstraZeneca would be tax efficient since Pfizer could redomicile to Britain and enjoy lower tax rates  thanks to attractive incentives to companies that manufacture and hold patents in the country 
Pfizer envisages combining the two drugmakers under a new UK incorporated holding company  although the head office and stock market listing would remain in New York  But the suggested deal has triggered worries about jobs in Britain s drug sector  viewed as a key industry by the government 
AstraZeneca has already laid off thousands of staff as it shrinks its cost base to cope with a fall in sales due to patent losses on blockbuster medicines  while Pfizer has shuttered a research site in Sandwich  southern England 
Read said Pfizer had contacted the British government about its plans on Monday  after Finance Minister George Osborne said on Friday that any deal was  a commercial matter between the companies  
A spokesman for Prime Minister David Cameron told reporters on Monday that any Pfizer takeover bid would be assessed by  independent procedures and frameworks

220782,442298,PFE,Why Actinium Pharmaceutics Stock May Be Even Better Than Celator,opinion,"Actinium Pharmaceuticals Inc  NYSE ATNM  
If you think that I wrote a presumptuous Actinium Pharmaceuticals headline to simply grab your attention  you are mistaken  After extensive analysis of the company  I hold a firm belief that ATNM has the potential to mimic the dramatic rise of Celator  which saw its market cap increase from roughly  50 million dollars in 2016 to  1 5 BILLION dollars  the price at which Jazz Pharmaceuticals paid to acquire the company  For Celator shareholders  this windfall came after the company provided clinical trial results that proved an increase in the survival rates of patients with AML by approximately three months  Celator stock went from around  1 60 in March of 2016 to over  30 00 by the end of May 
Celator did a great job extending patient survival  and additional survival time offers the potential to find a cure and ultimately create higher overall survival rates  Thus  the spike for Celator was merited  At the time  Celator focused on building upon the technology for combination therapy  utilizing older chemotherapy drugs in new directions  via liposomal nanoparticles that were intended to more efficiently target the delivery of the chemotherapeutic agents to the tumors 
While ATNM is not tracking the same scientific pathway as Celator  the results being demonstrated by the ATNM medical team may be equally impressive in many respects  To that end  Actinium Pharmaceuticals deserves a closer look by investors  as the potential for a Celator type spike is not out of the question  At the very least  the Celator deal defined the enormous value being given to leaders in the AML space  a market of which the company sits at the very core 
ATNM may very well be a victim of the decoupling that can occur between share price and a realistic and encompassing valuation  Most vulnerable are the companies like Actinium Pharmaceuticals  who have built an extraordinary clinical data set  but are unfortunately annihilated by investors that are nagged by the constant fear of a continued plan of stock dilution and convertible debt funding 
If current and potential ATNM investors are being spooked by either of those two specters  its time to exorcise those demons and come to the realization that the company is both financially and clinically sound  The  10 million cash raise in October and the lack of convertible debt provisions on the balance sheet should extinguish those investor concerns 
Actinium s Clinical AdvantageBefore getting to the Actinium Pharmaceuticals company fundamentals  the main interest of many short term investors  there needs to be a greater focus in vetting the company s clinical and strategic progress  as well as evaluating the overall strategy and current clinical programs at the company  From that vantage point  ATNM investors should clearly be able to sight the overall leadership position in at least two advanced clinical stage programs that hold enormous potential in treating AML  in addition to a host of other targeted indications 
As a quick overview  ATNM currently has two clinical stage trials  Iomab B  CD45  and Actimab A  CD33   and in addition to this  the company is also strategically positioned to capitalize on its Proprietary Alpha Particle Immunotherapy  APIT  platform  The APIT platform is generating reliable data that is demonstrating its potential to deliver multiple cancer drugs and treatments  several that may have blockbuster potential  In addition to APIT  the company has also staked out a leadership position in linking alpha particles to antibody drug conjugates that are intended to generate new therapies for both liquid and solid tumors 
To accentuate the potential of the two clinical trials  Iomab B is demonstrating the strength to position the company as a leading franchise in the field of bone marrow transplants  BMT   having the advantage of an expert team of professionals that possess both the vision and knowledge to advance the studies with the intent of creating innovative new therapies and enhancing shareholder value 
For its part  Actimab A has the potential to become a best in class solution in CD33 applications  CD33 is a transmembrane receptor expressed on cells of myeloid lineage  a key component within ATNM trial design  with an emerging data set that may bring forward both partnership and strategic opportunities for the company 
While the previous and quick introduction includes a host of scientific acronyms and jargon that even savvy biotech investors may find difficult to follow  the following spelled out explanation of what these ATNM compounds and trials are doing should be much easier to comprehend 
Iomab BCD45 is a molecule that is expressed on leukemia cells  bone marrow cells  and stem cells  and is active in targeting CD45  Iomab B works to deliver a powerful radiation shock to the DNA of these CD45 cells  eradicating the leukemic cell and enabling a patient to proceed with a bone marrow transplant  In simplest terms  Iomab B is the starting point intended to increase survival rates  but there is much scientific research that has built up the therapy 
The significant and driving force behind Iomab B is that is used as an induction and conditioning agent to enable patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia to receive a bone marrow transplant  Iomab B has become a possible life saving therapy  bringing potential for a BMT where one did not exist before 
Iomab B is not a new therapy option  The drug was first developed at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center  a recognized and Nobel prize winning leader in the field of bone marrow transplants  Iomab B has been studied in roughly 300 patients in several phase I and phase II clinical trials in cancer centers throughout the United States  targeting various forms of leukemia and lymphoma in physician sponsored trials  These trials are on going and have demonstrated meaningful and impressive data in the fight against different forms of leukemia 
When targeted to CD45 expressing cells  Iomab B has resulted in effective induction and conditioning of the cell in preparation for a BMT  while being well tolerated and showing minimal patient reported side effects  In comparison to chemotherapy and or radiation  the option may become a clear choice for patients  with potential to become a first line standard of care based on Iomab B s safety and tolerability profile compared to existing methods of BMT preparation 
Iomab B Is A Pathway Toward HealthThe best way to look at Iomab B  from layman s terms  is that it is the most efficient and well tolerated therapy to prepare a patient for a potential life saving BMT procedure  By targeting the  bad  CD45 cells in the bone marrow  its radioisotope payload works to deliver a knockout blow to the cells in the marrow  essentially eradicating all of the cells in the bone marrow and clearing a space for the newly transplanted cells 
Current methods of treatment that include repetitive rounds of chemotherapy come with a host of complications  as well as costs  The conditioning regimen in the chemotherapy process can take as long as 42 days to prepare a patient for transplant  at a cost approaching one million dollars  Unfortunately  due to the severe toxicity  complications  and side effects  not all patients will survive the regimen  and despite the arduous regimen  many of the patients will not have responded well enough to the treatment to prepare them to accept a BMT transplant 
In contrast  Iomab B is showing tremendous efficacy results  with 100  of patients responding to the therapy  Additionally  100  of the patients responded to cell engraftment by the 28th day of treatment  This important and differentiating factor is further demonstrated by the overall survival rate of patients  with only a 10  overall rate of survival for chemo patients compared to upwards of 30  survival in data taken from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center for Iomab B phase I II trials 
The supporting data from both FHCRC and the internally generated company trial data have allowed ATNM to progress to its Pivotal Phase III SIERRA Trial 
ATNM SIERRA TrialThe SIERRA trial is a study of Iomab B in elderly relapsed refractory AML  As mutually agreed with the FDA  the trial design is a single pivotal study  with dependence on trial results to indicate direction  and is enrolling patients 55 years of age or older with relapsed or refractory AML  The study will have a control arm of the physicians choice  using conventional standards of care with curative intent  The primary endpoint is a durable and complete response after six months  180 days  
The trial is designed to efficiently provide distinguishable data sets  with 150 patients being randomly assigned into either the Iomab B arm or the control arm of the trial  Between day 28 42 of the trial  there may be a crossover  whereby patients that have not enjoyed a complete response in the control arm may be subsequently treated with Iomab B  All patients  irrespective of group  will be followed through to the 180 day evaluation period for final efficacy data and response measurement 
Because the control arm is being addressed with curative intent  the comparative analysis will be useful in determining the distinguishing affects of Iomab B over current forms of treatment  The evaluation period will also extend 180 days from the start date  and evaluate safety  tolerability  efficacy  and other modalities and observations 
Taking Iomab B Commercial
Assuming the data is convincing  ATNM then has to define its market  By all indications  the commercial market for Iomab B is compelling  With a highly concentrated BMT market  whereby the top 30 centers perform over 50  of the AML BMT procedures in the United States  Actinium can position themselves to benefit from the current Prospective Payment System  whose exempt cancer centers perform over 20  of all AML BMT procedures  These PPS centers could be reimbursed immediately if Iomab B is approved  increasing the likelihood of its use 
Furthermore  with the reimbursement issue affably addressed  ATNM will also be in a position to benefit commercially from marketing Iomab B independently and will retain full economic rights  enabling ATNM to entertain other strategic opportunities 
The potential financial benefit to Actinium Pharmaceuticals for an approved Iomab B could be extremely lucrative  Transplant activity in the U S  alone is estimated to exceed  4 billion by the year 2020  and with Iomab B being studied in several phase II III trials  inclusive of the SIERRA trial  the opportunities are broad  especially when additional therapeutic focus can be made toward MDS  ALL  NHL HL and MM  different forms of leukemia that Iomab B may be able to effectively treat 
Iomab B has shown every indication of being a winner in treating and conditioning patients for a BMT  The market is craving an alternative to current standards of care  and the early data certainly supports the likelihood for a continued profile that exhibits strong safety and efficacy data  Investors can also anticipate an update from several near term data and value drivers expected from clinical programs and strategic initiatives  These drivers include Phase III trial investigator meeting updates  EU Orphan Designation updates  the completion of patient enrollment by the end of 2017  periodic data publication  and  importantly to investors  interim trial updates throughout 2017 and full top line data expected in the first half of 2018 Identifying the potential in Iomab B  inherent with its clinical successes and near term catalysts  offers less than half the story to be told by ATNM  And  therein lay the safety net for lofty investor prognostications 
Actimab A  ATNM s second clinical trial  holds just as much promise  and similar to Iomab B  does not appear to be even remotely reflected in the share price 
Actimab A And CD33
Actimab A is a treatment for elderly patients that have been newly diagnosed with AML  and is a second and equally compelling reason behind the probable near and long term success for ATNM  Developed at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center  Actimab A is a second generation therapy from Actinium Pharmaceuticals  HuM195 alpha program that has been studied in almost 90 patients in four clinical trials 
Actimab A targets CD33  a molecule that is expressed on 90  of AML cells  Actinium 225  the radioisotope used in Actimab A has strong cytotoxicity  which has been pointed out by somepundits as a point of vulnerability in its use  However  ATNM has been keen to demonstrate in explicit terms that even though there is cytotoxins present  they travel only a very small distance  and has demonstrated the toxicity profile to be benign 
This second generation therapy was born through Bismab A  a therapy that showed a clear anti leukemic effect  and was able to clearly demonstrate increased survival rates among patients  However  the isotope bismuth 213 was not a commercially viable product due to various reasons  But  the reason that the term  practicing medicine  is used to describe the profession is that the facilitators of both procedure and science are always in practice  receptive to learning the answers to questions that constantly present themselves 
Therefore  when Bismab A proved itself to not be a commercially viable option  the evolution of the therapy developed into Actimab A by utilizing the commercially viable isotope 225  which has not only shown a clear anti leukemic effect  but also supports an excellent safety and tolerability profile  As for CD33  it has become a validated target in treating AML  and has earned strong interest from major pharmaceutical companies  This interest places ATNM in an enviable position to capitalize on their own clinical studies  as Actimab A is one of the most advanced programs addressing CD33  and has the potential to be best in class in terms of therapeutic value 
While being best in class is a milestone  in and of itself  ATNM made a strategic addition to the management team by hiring Dr  Mark Berger as Chief Medical Officer  and plans to leverage upon his expertise to enhance the clinical development capabilities at the company  Dr  Berger brings to Actinium Pharmaceuticals over 20 years of drug development experience  highlighted by the FDA approvals of Mylotarg for AML  the only drug approved in AML in almost forty years  and Tykerb for breast cancer 
Dr  Berger s skill and experience are a tremendous asset for the company  as they now have a key team member in place that can build a robust clinical development program to execute on the clinical progress of Iomab B  Actimab A  and future clinical programs 
CD33 Interest Invigorated
There is typically little argument when presented with the fact that ATNM is among the leaders in targeting CD33  While Pfizer  NYSE PFE  at one time had a drug on the market  Mylotarg  it was so plagued with debilitating issues that it was withdrawn from the market in 2010  Although Pfizer pulled the drug due to issues unrelated to CD33 targeting  the issues that arose that demonstrated a link to cytotoxic agents  response rates of less than 30  in patients over the age of 60 years old  and serious side effects and tolerability issues reported by patients 
Actimab A  on the other hand  is also a CD33 targeting radiomuunotherapy  addressing ADC  alpha emitters  The product is labeled with alpha emitting Actinium 225  offers a higher dose of energy and a focused range of therapeutic value  Unlike Pfizer s failed product  Actinium s next generation Actimab A has shown significantly less toxicity and a far less degree of adverse side effect in patients  ATNM commenced its phase II trial in September of 2016 
Actimab A  in its own right  is far more deserving of investor respect and value than it is currently realizing  especially when compared to other pharmaceutical companies in the CD33 target space  ATNM has a valuation that is dwarfed by its competitors  irregardless of the fact that ATNM is equal to the task of advancing through its phase II and III trials in relative short order 
Immunogen  for instance  has a market cap of roughly  206 million dollars  significantly higher than the current valuation of  75 million dollars for ATNM  While not necessarily an apples to apples comparison  the stark difference in valuation is questionable  as Actinium Pharmaceuticals is further ahead in clinical trials than IMGN  is targeting New AML  and is utilizing the same ADC alpha emitters  But  markets are rarely efficient when it comes to valuing small and emerging companies  While this is a detriment to ATNM now  it may play in favor of early adopting investors who can clearly see the value drivers behind the company s platforms 
Actimab A Phase II
The current phase II trial for Actimab A has treated 18 patients to date  with patient age being 60 years or older  Where the phase I trial treated patients with relapsed refractory conditions  the phase II trial is targeting newly diagnosed patients  The phase II trial is a dose escalating trial  using a fractionated dosing regimen  compared to the single dose treatment used in the phase I trial 
Safety and tolerability showed compelling and positive results  with no severe or unexpected reports of unfavorable effects  In addition to having a favorable safety and tolerability profile  much was learned from the phase I trial  which has led to a refined and more responsive approach in the phase II data 
The phase II data is showing that the fractionalized dosing of patients led to the hypothesis that peripheral blast burden can have a material impact on patient response  The data showed that fractionalized dosing led to corrections in peripheral blasts  which have led to higher patient response rates  Additionally  these response rates appear to be independent of patient population or severity of disease 
While the preliminary data from the phase II trial is encouraging  there is still work to be done  The phase II trial  which was initiated in September of 2016  will enroll a total of 53 patients  The FDA has agreed to allow the removal of LDAC  low dose cytrabine   which is expected to generate a more straight forward trial protocol  Additionally  ATNM will incorporate PB burden thresholds as part of the inclusion criteria  with a stipulation that hydroxyurea control of PB is allowed  To facilitate the trail in an expeditious and efficient manner  ATNM has planned on doubling the number of trial centers  and to expand the clinical development team  If the trials prove efficacious  there is potential to move into a pivotal trial based on reporting positive data to the FDA  Of further and welcome interest for investors  the open label trail design will allow for one or more interim data analyses and updates 
Drivers For 2017
While the science is often difficult to understand  the main questions that investors typically sift down to are related to the near term value drivers for a company  For ATNM investors  quite a few can be expected 
On the Iomab B front  investors can expect updates and analyses from the phase III SIERRA trial  as well as information generated from the phase III SIERRA trial investigator meeting  Orphan Designation from the EMA was announced in 2016   to compliment the already announced Orphan Designation from the FDA  and the company should be providing regular updates related to continuing enrollment and reports from the Data Monitoring Committee  Investors can expect top line data to be released in the second half of 2018  which will highlight data from the expected 150 patients enrolled in the trial 
Information from the Actimab A trial is also expected to provide some key insight as to progress of that study  Investors can expect interim data in mid 2017 from the recently announced phase II trial  as well as to be informed of the developmental pathway for Actimab A after the meeting with the FDA 
ATNM has a host of opportunities to leverage from  which is expected to lead to additional therapeutic indications and may also target additional clinical programs in 2017 and 2018  with ambitious plans to host four simultaneous clinical programs  Based on the position of the current trials  ATNM may be in a strong position to attract both partnership and licensing opportunities  as well as collaborative and strategic opportunities 
As of October 2016  ATNM had roughly 55 7 million shares outstanding  and approximately  25 million in cash  Liabilities totaled to roughly  3 million dollars  with some of that liability related to derivative liabilities Actinium In 2017
Investors that have been watching ATNM stock during the prior year may have not liked what they have seen from a valuation standpoint  But  from a clinical perspective  they should be excited for the future  In an investment world driven by short term motive and quick gains  investors too often get caught up in a current headline and forget the value in maintaining a disciplined and thought out investment strategy 
A company like ATNM deserves time to develop  as does any company that is working on developing best in class therapeutic treatments  Companies like ATNM are setting the bar for others to follow  and while it may take slightly longer than expected  once that bar is set it will be tough for competitors to clear  ATNM is well funded for the near and intermediate term and is well into the later stages of its clinical trials  With the stock trading at a paltry  75 million market cap  it is unjustly undervalued in relation to its peers 
Just several months ago  ATNM traded almost three times higher in price with data that was less compelling than what is being demonstrated today  While markets remain inefficient  they do ultimately correct  and it is likely that the share price may soon catch up with the fundamentals at ATNM 
With a full plate of data expected to be released in 2017 and 2018  exclusive of the anticipated additional trials planned by ATNM  the current share price may offer a compelling case for investors to take an early position and hold confidence that management will execute on its strategic mission  While no stock goes straight up  there does come a point when valuations for companies that are demonstrating proof of concept  coupled with a strong balance sheet  border on becoming ridiculously mispriced  Based on all of the action at ATNM  supported by strong data and concurrent phase II and phase III trials  calling the current pps  ridiculously low  is an understatement 
Finally  while it may be premature to call ATNM a potential  30 bagger   as was the case for Celator  it is not unreasonable to project the potential for ATNM to enjoy a transformational rise in share price as they begin to release more robust data in the next several months  In the meantime  it may be fair to also infer that just about no value has been given to either Iomab B or Actimab A  two clinical trials that clearly deserve far more respect and consideration than they are getting

Michigan sentiment dipped to 95 7 on the preliminary estimate  down a bit from last month s 98 5 and missing expectations  This month s report has a special feature that we need to know   divided perceptions based upon politics  From the  

When asked to describe any recent news that they had heard about the economy  30  spontaneously mentioned some favorable aspect of Trump s policies  and 29  unfavorably referred to Trump s economic policies  Thus a total of nearly six in ten consumers made a positive or negative mention of government policies  In the long history of the surveys  this total had never reached even half that amount  except for five surveys in 2013 and 2014 that were solely dominated by negative references to the debt and fiscal cliff crises  Moreover  never before have these spontaneous references to economic policies had such a large impact on the Sentiment Index  a difference of 37 Index points between those that referred to favorable and unfavorable policies  These differences are troublesome  the Democrat s Expectations Index is close to its historic low  indicating recession  and the Republican s Expectations Index is near its historic high  indicating expansion   While currently distorted by partisanship  the best bet is that the gap will narrow to match a more moderate pace of growth  Nonetheless  it has been long known that negative rather than positive expectations are more influential in determining spending  so forecasts of consumer expenditures must take into account a higher likelihood of asymmetric downside risks

The Week Ahead
We would all like to know the direction of the market in advance  Good luck with that  Second best is planning what to look for and how to react  That is the purpose of considering possible themes for the week ahead  You can make your own predictions in the comments 
The Calendar
We have a normal week for economic data 
The  A  List
Housing starts and building permits  Th   Little change expected in these important leading indicators 
Leading indicators  F   Popular economic gauge expected to remain strong 
Retail sales  W   Little is expected from the January data 
Initial jobless claims  Th   How long can the amazing strength continue 
The  B  List
Industrial production  W   A small gain is expected in the volatile series 
Philly Fed  Th   Popular report is the first look at February data 
PPI  T   Starting to run a bit hotter  That will attract more attention if it continues 
CPI  W   See PPI above 
Business inventories  W   December data affecting Q4 GDP  Favorite spin target  Voluntary or involuntary build up 
Crude inventories  Th   Recently showing even more impact on oil prices  Rightly or wrongly  that spills over to stocks 
Chair Yellen gives her semi annual Congressional testimony on Tuesday  Senate  and Wednesday  House   The presentations are the same and the order alternates  If you don t know why  then you missed that class in Congressional Government  There are also appearances by a host of other Fed Governors and Presidents  Questions will probe the state of the economy  the new political environment  and the likely pace of rate hikes 
Earnings reports will remain important  Early actions from the Trump Administration have captured the spotlight and will continue to do so 
Next Week s Theme
During the campaign  Candidate Trump had plenty of criticism for the Fed and for Chair Yellen  Since the election  he has had much less to say  With Fed Gov  Daniel Tarullo s resignation  the President will now have three openings to fill  out of seven   Next year he can replace Yellen as Chair  Although technically her term continues  most resign when replaced as Chair  He has the power to change the style  background of members  and policies 
Yellen is testifying before Congress this week on Tuesday and Wednesday  While the topic is the state of the economy  we should expect some aggressive questioning  Will her testimony or answers draw a Presidential tweet  which we are calling a T Wop   The punditry will find this combination irresistible  I expect plenty of media coverage for a clash that will probably be repeated  We can think of it as 
Trump v  Yellen  Round One
The basic possibilities are interesting  but mostly speculative so far  Here is what Trump might do 
Trump will support some of the various moves to  audit  the Fed and reduce its power 
Trump will T Wop Yellen this week  and remove her at the first opportunity 
Trump will resume the Fed criticism  and start his process for filling the vacancies 
Trump will moderate criticism while Yellen is still at the reins 
Trump will seek candidates that have some traditional credentials 
Trump will decide to keep Yellen as Chair 
Here is what Yellen might do 
Make an aggressive statement criticizing some Trump policies 
Avoid  Trump  issues in the statement  but provide some frankly critical answers to questions 
Announce that she plans to stay on the Fed if replaced as Chair 
Suggest that the Fed policy is changing in a way that Trump sought 
Make conciliatory remarks about the direction of Trump policy  especially economic stimulus 
What fun  Expect the pundits and their guests to go wild 
What does this mean for investors  As usual  I ll have a few ideas of my own in today s  Final Thought

Final Thoughts
Before turning to the Fed  I want to comment on a major news theme from last week  in line with what we expected  Is the Trump Rally running out of steam  Some might find this ironic when results remain strong  Here is the three part problem 
Pundits and investors  seeking a simple post election explanation for the stock rally  attributed it to Trump policies 
Now that some of these policies seem delayed  they expect markets to get softer 
But what if the rally was a return to earnings fundamentals and the elimination of pre election uncertainty  as I suggested last week  with some support from Dr  Ed  
What about the Fed 
Once in office  Presidents always like low interest rates  Trump will probably replace Yellen  but with whom  If the cabinet provides any precedent  we can expect some non Ivy League  non economists  I have frequently argued that most intelligent people with a reasonable background would be part of a Fed consensus after their appointment 
The importance of the issues  the venue  and the evidence presented by staff all nudge in this direction  I once had the chance to suggest this idea to former Dallas Fed President Bob McTeer  and he agreed   It is easy to draw out a confirming answer in such conversations  but we talked at some length and I really wanted to know  
Parsing through the possibilities described above  I expect to see little change in Fed policy  The new President will wind up appointing people with traditional credentials  but perhaps with different policy viewpoints  He will not reappoint Yellen  although people forget that the Fed Chair is often appointed by Presidents of both parties   Greenspan and Bernanke are the most recent examples   He will not aggressively push for a change in policy  In fact  some are already claiming that the modest Fed rate increases are anti Trump  Yellen will probably not remain after her term as chair  unless the new appointees are jarringly different in methods or policy preferences 
The Fed news has dramatically different significance for traders and investors 
For traders  this week will be especially difficult to game  Since that community has over emphasized the Fed for the entire rally  unable to explain the gains any other way  there might be some big fluctuations  Since there is little precedent for this  we cannot even guess what the content based algorithms will do 
For investors  it is another opportunity  Since the events have little real impact on expected earnings and the economic cycle  we can have shopping lists ready  My portfolio rebalancing has raised my cash levels  It is not fear of a correction  but a natural process ",2017-02-12,Jeff Miller,https://www.investing.com/analysis/weighing-the-week-ahead:-trump-v.-yellen-round-one-200175379,200175379

	Chances for an interest rate hike of 25 basis points are roughly 70  for next month  when the Fed meets again in mid December  With strong domestic employment and the global economy gaining traction of late  it would seem an optimum time for the first raise since a year ago December 

	Biggest movers in the early market this morning  Gannett  has announced it is no longer pursuing the acquisition of TRONC   the media business formerly part of The Tribune Company  It is unclear whether some agreement will be made to combine services of the two firms  but a straight takeover is now off the table  GCI shares  which had tumbled 50  over the past 6 months  are up 8  on this news  TRNC  on the other hand  is down 30  in the pre market 

	Q3 earnings season continues  Pfizer  NYSE PFE   missed slightly on both top and bottom lines    13 05 billion insoles and 61 cents per share were a touch lower than the  13 1 billion and 62 cents expected  Archer Daniels Midland  beat bottom line estimates easily   59 cents per share topped the 47 cents expected   on  15 83 billion in the quarter  which was down from the Zacks consensus estimate of  16 05 billion  Kellogg  also posted a big beat on earnings   96 cents zoomed past the 87 cents estimated   but revenues of  3 25 billion was short the  3 29 billion expected 

	However  with the omnipresent General Election looming  little else matters to investors at this point  A surprise move by the Fed is the only thing that could shock the market near term  Although chances of a Hillary Clinton victory are roughly 3 to 1 right now  market participants remain wary of the spectre of a Donald Trump upset  which would infuse a big dose of uncertainty into the stock market

220860,442376,PFE,3 Sector ETFs With Revenue Growth Potential,opinion,"In the ongoing third quarter reporting cycle  earnings have the same old moderate flavor of the last few quarters  but are on the verge of a turnaround  Revenues are displaying better trends after having entered into the growth territory in Q2  As per the report issued on October 12  2016  earnings for the S P 500 are expected to be down 2 9  in Q3 while revenues are likely to rise 1 2  
Investors should note that while earnings normally draw maximum attention  we would like to emphasize that sales are equally important  This is because sales are harder to be influenced in an income statement than earnings  A company can land up on decent earnings numbers by adopting cost cutting or some other measures that do not speak for its core strength  But it is harder for a company to mold its revenue figure 
Both factors make it necessary to look at sectors that are expected to exhibit strong revenue growth this reporting cycle  no matters what their earnings growth picture look likes  read    
Consumer Discretionary
The consumer discretionary sector is projected to register the highest revenue growth of 11 8  in Q3  With the job market strengthening  wages rising and energy prices still at lower levels  consumers are likely to splurge on leisure and entertainment activities and products 
The reading for U S  consumer confidence was 104 1 in September  higher than the market expectation of 99 0 and August s reading of 101 8  The latest level was the highest   Plus  according to   the seasonal strength for this sector stretches from October 17 to April 12  This trend opens up the opportunity for Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR ETF   read    
Medical
The medical or health care sector appears the best positioned with a 7 4  revenue growth estimate  the third best in the universe of 16 S P sectors categorized by Zacks  The rise in mergers and acquisitions  higher chances of Clinton winning the presidential election and supporting the Affordable Care Act  an aging global population and the sector s non cyclical nature amid uncertainty can go in favor of the sector  read    
However  investors should note that the going has become tough for the sector recently on the price gouging issue  Investors can take a look at SPDR S P Health Care Services ETF   see  here  
Retail Wholesale
U S  retail sales turned around in Septemberafter a soft August  The sentiment was strong in several pockets of the economy in September  helping many to feel better about the economic situation  Retail Wholesale is projected to register 5 3  revenue growth in Q3 
However  the upcoming presidential election and rising rate worries may weigh on the apparently optimistic retail outlook for the coming month  Thus it will be wiser to pick a quality and trendy product like Amplify Online Retail ETF   which may score ahead irrespective of where the sector is heading  The reason for this is that there has been a gradual but steady shift toward online retailing lately which gives it a clear edge over brick and mortar retailing

 NEW YORK  June 20  Reuters    U S  stocks were little
changed on Monday as investors were hesitant to buy riskier
assets after a decision was delayed on emergency loans to
Greece and Moody s said it may downgrade Italy s credit
rating 
 The market seesawed between modest gains and losses  Wall
Street started lower  but erased losses as the S P dipped
toward 1 259  its 200 day moving average  encouraging buyers  A
drop below that level would be the first since September 2010

is where the market gains support   said Jason Ware  senior

 Euro zone finance ministers delayed a decision on extending

saying Athens would first have to introduce austerity

 The ministers expect the money  the next tranche in a 110
billion euro bailout by the European Union and the
International Monetary Fund  to be paid by mid July  Greece
needs the loans by then to avoid a debt default  For details

  It blows the confidence out of the market  especially when
the expectation was that there will be some kind of support or
help to solve the situation 
 Adding to concerns  Moody s threatened to cut Italy s

crisis may drive interest rates higher and derail Italy s

With the FDA granting priority review  a response should be out by Mar 29  2017 
Per company sources  AD affects about 7 8 million adults in the U S  and 1 3  of adults across the world  Further  there are roughly 1 6 million patients in the U S  diagnosed with moderate to severe AD  that are still living with inadequately controlled disease  in spite of being treated 
REGENERON PHARM Price   Considering the lack of approved systemic treatments in the U S  for moderate to severe AD  there exists significant unmet need for drugs addressing this serious  chronic inflammatory skin disease  Approval would be a huge boost  and dupilumab could bring in blockbuster sales  given the immense commercial potential in the target market 
SANOFI AVENTIS Price   Apart from AD  dupilumab is being evaluated for additional inflammatory indications including asthma  phase III   nasal polyposis  phase II  and eosinophilic oesophagitis  phase II   A phase III study on dupilumab for nasal polyposis is anticipated to start in the first quarter of 2017 
We note that Pfizer Inc    NYSE PFE   is also looking to get its AD treatment  crisaborole topical ointment 2   approved for the treatment of patients with mild to moderate AD  It is currently under FDA review with a response expected by Jan 7  2017 
Meanwhile  Regeneron and Sanofi have an importantly regulatory event coming up late next month  Oct 30  with the FDA expected to decide on the approval of sarilumab  Sarilumab is currently under review in the U S  for the treatment of patients with active  moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis  It is also under review in the EU

220882,442398,PFE,Pfizer investors on alert for more shrinkage clues,news,"  Q1 profit seen falling slightly  hurt by generics	
   Investors eager for news of asset sales	
   Recent share gain tied to hopes of weathering Lipitor hit	
 
 By Ransdell Pierson	
 NEW YORK  May 3  Reuters    Pfizer Inc is expected
to report slightly lower quarterly earnings on Tuesday  but
investors will be more focused on any signs the world s biggest
drugmaker will further shrink itself to weather looming
competition from generic drugs for its Lipitor cholesterol
fighter 	
  We will be listening for commentary around potential
divestitures as well as any color around potential larger
moves   such as breaking up its pharmaceuticals business  JP
Morgan analyst Chris Schott said on Monday 	
 Many investors fear Pfizer  which has bought three of the
largest U S  drugmakers over the past decade  will be far too
big to deliver strong profit growth once its  10 7
billion a year Lipitor faces cheaper generics in November and
more than a half dozen other Pfizer drugs lose U S  patent
protection in the next few years 	
 Wall Street expects Pfizer s new chief executive  Ian Read 
to eventually sell parts of the company or cut Pfizer to a size
commensurate with its expected narrowing revenue base 	
 In addition to its core pharmaceuticals business  Pfizer has
an animal health business  nutritional products business and
consumer products that could wind up on the auction block 	
 Three months ago Read delighted investors by vowing to slash
the company s research budget by up to  2 billion  to between
 6 5 billion and  7 billion  eliminating thousands of research
positions 	
 The move allowed Pfizer  which turned over the reins to Read
in December after the abrupt departure of Jeffrey Kindler  to
stick to its earlier 2012 profit forecast of  2 25 to  2 35 per
share  That would reflect some actual growth over earnings of
 2 23 per share last year and  2 24 per share expected this year
by Wall Street 	
 Pfizer further endeared itself to investors in early April
by announcing plans to sell its Capsugel unit  the world s
largest maker of hard capsules  to private equity firm KKR   Co
 for  2 38 billion  The deal will enable Pfizer to make
additional share repurchases this year beyond its previous plans
for  5 billion in buybacks for 2011 	
 Its shares have risen 12 percent since Feb  1  when Read
pointed his axe at the company s R D budget 	
 Schott said Pfizer  even more than other drugmakers that
have already reported first quarter results  should get an
earnings boost from the weaker dollar 	
 Even so  Schott and other Wall Street analysts expect Pfizer
earnings to be slightly below the year ago period  hurt by
tumbling sales of drugs already facing competition from
generics  They include the antidepressant Effexor acquired
through Pfizer s purchase in 2009 of rival U S  drugmaker Wyeth

 Sales of Pfizer s core business of prescription drugs fell
2 percent to  14 2 billion  Cholesterol fighter Lipitor  the
company s biggest product  led the downturn  as its revenue
tumbled 13 percent to  2 39 billion due to generic competition
in overseas markets 
 The world s largest drugmaker  whose shares fell 1 3
percent in premarket trading  said it earned  2 22 billion  or
28 cents per share  in the first quarter  That compared with
 2 03 billion  or 25 cents per share  in the year earlier
period  when Pfizer took charges related to its late 2009
purchase of rival U S  drugmaker Wyeth 
 Excluding special items  including its Capsugel business
that is being sold and is now considered to be a discontinued
operation  Pfizer earned 60 cents per share  Analysts on
average expected 59 cents per share  according to Thomson
Reuters I B E S 
 Global company revenue of  16 5 billion was a bit lower
than the year earlier quarter and slightly trailed Wall Street
expectations of  16 63 billion 
 Revenue would have fallen 2 percentage points if not for
the weaker dollar  which boosts the value of overseas sales 
and for new products obtained in Pfizer s recent purchase of
specialty drugmaker King Pharmaceuticals 
 Many investors fear Pfizer  which has bought three of the
largest U S  drugmakers over the past decade  will be far too
big to deliver strong profit growth once Lipitor faces cheaper
U S  generics in November  and more than a half dozen other
Pfizer drugs lose U S  patent protection in the next few
years 
 Wall Street expects Pfizer s new chief executive  Ian Read 
will eventually sell off one or more of its non pharmaceutical
businesses  or perhaps even its generic drugs operation 
 By divesting such products  which have far lower profit
margins than branded prescriptions drugs  the hope is that
newly approved medicines will have a better chance to bolster
overall earnings of the smaller company 
 Pfizer on Tuesday said it aims in the second half of the
year to complete its ongoing assessment of what businesses it
may sell 
 Animal health sales jumped 16 percent to  982 million in
the quarter  while sales of consumer healthcare products rose
12 percent to  745 million  Nutritional product sales rose 3
percent to  470 million

Price
   However  Spectrum s Qapzola did not fare so well with the FDA s Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee  ODAC  voting that Qapzola did not show substantial evidence of a treatment effect over placebo  Shares were down 8 2  on the news 
Price
   What Next While the FDA is not required to do so  it usually follows the advice of its advisory panels  So  in Chantix s case  the agency is likely to decide to remove the boxed warning from the label which should have a positive impact on scrips and product sales  Chantix brought in total sales of  671 million last year and  434 million in the first six months of 2016  Chantix s  EU trade name  Champix  EU label has already been updated to include the EAGLES data  The black triangle symbol  which indicated that additional safety monitoring was required for Champix in the EU  was removed as well Meanwhile  as far as Spectrum is concerned  the vote did not really come as a surprise considering Qapzola failed to meet the primary endpoint in two phase III studies  A final decision from the FDA is expected on Dec 11  2016  but right now it looks like chances for gaining approval are low  With Spectrum currently conducting a phase III study on Qapzola under the FDA s Special Protocol Assessment  SPA  program  we think the agency will ask the company for additional data before granting final approval Both Pfizer and Spectrum are Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stocks  You can see  Confidential  Zacks  Best Investment Ideas  Would you like to see a hand picked  all star  selection of investment ideas from the man who heads up Zacks  trading and investing services  Steve Reitmeister knows when key trades are about to be triggered and which of our experts has the hottest hand ",2016-09-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/fda-adcom-votes-on-pfizer-and-spectrum-drugs---what-next-200153754,200153754

 NEW YORK LONDON  April 4  Reuters    Merger and acquisition
activity helped lift global equities on Monday  though Wall
Street struggled to maintain gains in early trade
 Crude oil prices hit 2 1 2 year highs as the unrest in
Libya continued to unnerve investors 
 Expectations that the European Central Bank will raise euro
zone interest rates at its meeting on Thursday drove the euro
briefly to an 11 month high against the Japanese yen  but later
slipped because expectations of higher rates have already been
priced in 
 World stocks as measured by MSCI  were up

 RATES DRIVE EURO
 Reflecting expectations of differing rate paths  the euro
hit 11 month highs against the yen and touched a five month
peak against the dollar  The single currency later slipped back
with expectations of an increase in rates already priced in by
investors 
 In contrast to the ECB  the Bank of Japan is likely to
downgrade its economic assessment at its meeting Wednesday and
may consider finding more ways to help the economy recover from
last month s massive earthquake and devastating tsunami

supplies as economic growth bolstered demand for fuel 
  The focus remains on headlines out of the Middle East

fundamental backdrop

at  108 14 a barrel by 1345 GMT  after touching  108 78 earlier
in the session  its highest since September 2008 
 Analysts say the loss of oil from Libya has been more or
less offset by Saudi Arabia  while the Japanese crisis should
also reduce oil import demand  suggesting  there likely is a
statistical surplus in the system right now   Meir said

ARIAD is seeking accelerated approval for brigatinib from the FDA and has requested a priority review of the application  which could shorten the review period from the standard 12 months to just 8 months 
We note that brigatinib enjoys Breakthrough Therapy status in the U S  for the treatment of patients with ALK  NSCLC whose tumors are resistant to Xalkori  Brigatinib also has Orphan Drug status in the U S  for the treatment of ALK  NSCLC 
The regulatory application included data from its phase I II and pivotal phase II ALTA studies on brigatinib  With a median follow up of 8 3 months  data demonstrated that 54  of patients  when treated with a 180 mg regimen with a seven day lead in at 90 mg  witnessed an investigator assessed confirmed objective response   the primary endpoint of the study  In addition  median progression free survival exceeded one year  12 9 months  in this arm 
ARIAD plans to submit a marketing authorization application for brigatinib to the European Medicines Agency in early 2017 ARIAD PHARMA Price
    Meanwhile  the company has initiated a first line phase III study  ALTA1L  comparing the efficacy and safety of brigatinib to Xalkori in patients with locally advanced or metastatic ALK  NSCLC who have not previously been treated with an ALK inhibitor 
We are encouraged by the company s progress with brigatinib  Currently  ARIAD has only one marketed product in its kitty   leukemia drug Iclusig  If brigatinib is finally approved  it could become a two product commercial company by early 2017

Fed policy focus and accompanying volatility is likely to begin to ramp back up this week  with the U S  economic calendar yielding key data on the housing sector in the form of tomorrow s new home sales  with economists expecting a 2 0  month over month decline during July to an annual rate of 580 000 units  as well as Wednesday s release of existing home sales 
As well  some manufacturing data may also likely garner some attention  with Thursday s durable goods orders report in focus  as well as two reports tomorrow Markit s Manufacturing PMI Index  forecasted to tick lower to 52 7 during July from the 52 9 posted in June  with a reading above 50 denoting expansion in activity  as well as the Richmond Fed Manufacturing Index

A period of peace has reigned in the market over the past month  but the lull in volatility likely won t last  However  we do believe the secular bull market has further to run  The third quarter is shaping up to improve on lackluster first half U S  economic results  but weak corporate confidence remains an impediment to stronger growth  Fed uncertainty is likely to heat up heading toward the September Federal Open Market Committee  FOMC  meeting 
Europe and Asia mixed on commodity weakness and Fed focus
European equities finished mixed  with basic materials and oil   gas issues seeing pressure as commodity prices fell  led by crude oil prices amid lingering supply speculation  The U S  dollar gained modest ground as Fed rate hike expectations continued to resurface following comments over the weekend from Fed Vice Chair Stanley Fischer that the Central Bank was close to reaching its targets for full employment and 2 0  inflation 
The euro dipped compared to the greenback  while bond yields in the region moved to the downside  However  the British pound was higher versus the dollar  continuing its recent rebound from a sell off that followed the Bank of England s  BoE  decision earlier this month to cut its benchmark interest rate further and boost its asset purchases 
The BoE s decision was aimed at bolstering the economy on the heels the late June vote by the U K  to leave the European Union  known as Brexit  The pound has also found support from last week s July economic data that showed retail sales easily topped forecasts  jobless claims unexpectedly declined and consumer price inflation surprisingly rose 
Stocks in Asia finished mixed  with the global markets continuing to focus on the divergent monetary policy landscape following comments over the weekend by U S  Fed Vice Chair Fischer and ahead of this week s annual Fed policy gathering 
Also  Bank of Japan  BoJ  Governor Kuroda hinted at further stimulus measures  while uncertainty regarding more policy action in China persisted  The yen weakened versus the U S  dollar  though crude oil prices gave back some of a recent run 
Japanese equities  as well as those traded in Hong Kong  advanced  while mainland Chinese fell  Meanwhile  securities traded in Australia  South Korea and India all saw declines for the session

	Actually  many analysts now think an incremental interest rate hike of 0 25 0 50  won t happen until December or sometime in early 2017  If there is any drama to wring out of this  it may be in noting how tricky the balancing act toward raising rates essentially is  if they raise rates too quickly  they run the risk of quashing the slow but steady economic policy  Wait too long to raise and the FOMC fails to keep enough dry powder to counteract any macroeconomic downturn that may occur

220921,442437,PFE,Fed Jackson Hole Meeting  What Will Friday Bring ,opinion,"Fed Chair Janet Yellen is set to speak at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas annual Economic Policy Symposium in Jackson Hole on Friday and there have been ripples of uncertainty in the market  There had been very light trading on the S P500 and DJ30 earlier this week on the run in to the speech  But with the NASDAQ100 and S P500 closing near record highs yesterday due to a housing boost and  14 billion buyout of Biotech by Pfizer  NYSE PFE  on Monday  the markets are gripped and waiting for what s to come 
With Fed Vice Chair Stanley Fischer speaking last weekend and suggesting the idea that the Fed is close to raising rates  along with New York Fed President William Dudley saying the Fed could hike in September  these main members of the Fed could be trying to take the sting out of the market if Yellen does mention a hike 
Does it seem likely to be mentioned on Friday 
With Job growth on the rise but monetary policy not being as effective as hoped  it seems unlikely that rate hikes would do anything but hinder the growth already achieved and possibly be a step in the wrong direction 
The Fed chair discussions at this symposium in other years have provided key signals in terms of interest rates  but with 2016 being a very significant year in American politics  does Yellen really want the Fed to get dragged into the  scare mongering  tactics of what is surely going to be a vicious presidential race  one week before the first debate  Probably not  With consensus being that the Fed will get a rate hike done this year  it would make December a far better candidate

Mergers and acquisitions  M A  are taking headlines in this sleepy market period a couple weeks prior to the Labor Day holiday  and we re seeing big gains among smaller companies ready to be purchased by much bigger fish

220927,442443,PFE,Bernie Sanders Just Called Out Pfizer And Medivation On Twitter,opinion,"After much speculation  Pfizer Inc    NYSE PFE   announced today that it will acquire Medivation  Inc    NASDAQ MDVN   in a deal worth about  14 billion  The acquisition is slated to close in the third or fourth quarter  and early predictions suggest that it could boost Pfizer s earnings by up to five cents in the first full year after finalization

Deals like this make a lot of people happy  Pfizer investors will be pleased that the company has boosted its cancer treatment portfolio and added earnings potential  while Medivation investors will be pleased with their big payday 
Nevertheless  big blockbuster mergers aren t loved by everyone  One of the biggest critics to emerge shortly after Pfizer and Medivation announced the deal was none other than former Democratic presidential candidate and current U S  Senator from Vermont  Bernie Sanders 
The official Bernie Sanders Twitter account used the announcement as an opportunity to remind its followers about the current state of the pharmaceutical market 
 Today Pfizer announced they are buying Xtandi  a prostate cancer drug that costs Americans  129 000   4 times more than in other countries   Bernie Sanders   SenSanders  A life saving drug does no good if the people who need it cannot afford that drug   Bernie Sanders   SenSanders  My message to Pfizer and the entire pharmaceutical industry is clear  The era of charging unconscionable prices must end   Bernie Sanders   SenSanders  Sanders specifically calls out Medivation s Xtandi drug  a prostate cancer treatment that is the clear prize for Pfizer in this deal  Xtandi generated global sales of about  2 2 billion in the last four quarters  and the drug is currently being evaluated in several studies to further expand its treatment possibilities 
Sanders  tweets remind us of the difficult debate that surrounds business ethics  especially in the medical sector  As investors  it s easy to forget that smart business moves can oftentimes make necessary treatments that much more difficult for sick patients to afford 
While Sanders is not necessarily criticizing today s merger  he is using the news as an opportunity to further advocate for reform in the pharmaceutical industry  Xtandi will now be in the hands of Pfizer  and Pfizer alone will be responsible for its pricing and availability 
If anything  Sanders is trying to show us the human element of a deal like this  As we look towards profits  revenues  and share prices  Sanders reminds us of the importance that these drugs have for the patients who depend on them 
If any reform is to come  it s in the best interest of everyone to ensure a pharmaceutical industry that can create value for its investors while continuing to provide the best care for its patients ",2016-08-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bernie-sanders-just-called-out-pfizer-and-medivation-on-twitter-200149404,200149404

220929,442445,PFE,Pfizer Medivation Close To Signing  14B Acquisition Deal   revised ,opinion,"According to a Financial Times article  Pfizer Inc   NYSE PFE     and Medivation  Inc     are close to signing a deal under which Pfizer will acquire Medivation for more than  80 per share  approximately  14 billion  
Medivation has been a part of acquisition talks for quite a while with the company first receiving an offer from French drugmaker Sanofi  PA SASY      Sanofi had initially approached Medivation with an offer of  52 50 in cash which was rejected by the company 
Last month  Medivation announced that it is open to acquisition talks and entered into confidentiality agreements with several firms that had expressed an interest in exploring a potential transaction  The company also confirmed that it had rejected a sweetened bid from Sanofi under which Sanofi offered  58 00 per share in cash plus a Contingent Value Right  CVR  for talazoparib sales representing a potential payment in 2022 of up to  3 00 per share 
Pfizer s rumored offer of more than  80 per share represents a huge premium compared to Sanofi s last offer  Medivation s shares are up 42 3  so far in 2016 
Why Medivation 
Medivation is a biopharma company that is focused on cancer treatments  The company currently has one marketed product  prostate cancer treatment  Xtandi  Xtandi  a blockbuster drug  has the potential to be approved for several additional indications as well as patient populations 
Moreover  pipeline candidate talazoparib  an orally available PARP inhibitor  represents significant upside potential  PARP inhibitors are currently being considered to be the next major class of therapeutics in oncology  Interest in this area has increased considerably following the announcement of impressive late stage data on another company s PARP inhibitor  niraparib  in Jun 2016  Top line results from Medivation s first talazoparib registrational study  EMBRACA  in germline BRCA mutated breast cancer are expected in the first half of 2017 
According to Medivation  the addressable patient population for talazoparib in the U S  and Europe is about 760k including 10k for the EMBRACA population  while the addressable market opportunity is more than  30 billion 
The Medivation acquisition  if it goes through  will strengthen Pfizer s cancer franchise which currently consists of products like Ibrance and Sutent  Pfizer is also working on strengthening its immune oncology pipeline and the Medivation acquisition would be a good strategic fit for the company 
Pfizer is a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stock while Medivation is a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  stock  Actelion Ltd     is a better ranked stock in the health care sector with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   We are reissuing this article to correct a mistake  The original article  issued earlier today  August 22  2016  should no longer be relied upon  ",2016-08-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/pfizer-medivation-close-to-signing-$14b-acquisition-deal-(revised)-200149400,200149400
220930,442446,PFE,Pfizer  PFE  Bought Medivation  MDVN   But Is It A Good Deal ,opinion,"Today  Pfizer   NYSE PFE   that it will be acquiring Medivation Inc    NASDAQ MDVN   in an all cash offer for  81 50 per share   This comes out to a transaction value of approximately  14 billion   Shares were trading for about  67 per share before the deal was announced  and since then  MDVN stock has shot up by about 20  
Pfizer doesn t expect the transaction to impact its fiscal 2016 guidance   Pfizer CEO Ian Read is especially bullish on the purchase  saying that  The proposed acquisition of Medivation is expected to immediately accelerate revenue growth and drive overall earnings growth potential for Pfizer    Pfizer expects to achieve high long term growth from its oncology pipeline  and by adding Medivation  PFE hopes to boost this portfolio of drugs which treats tumors 
Medivation wouldn t be fetching a high price tag if it weren t for its drug called XTANDI  enzalutamide    XTANDI is an androgen receptor inhibitor that blocks steps in the androgen receptor signaling pathway inside tumor cells   The hormone therapy has an avid following in the US  and over the past four quarters  the drug has generated  2 2 billion in worldwide sales 
The drug was approved by the FDA in 2012  and it was made for the purpose of treating advanced metastatic prostate cancer   XTANDI has treated 64 000 men in America  and the product stands to see immense sales growth if it gains FDA approval for treating other types of cancer   Medivation and Astellas Pharma Inc    OTC ALPMY   entered an agreement in 2009 to jointly develop and commercialize XTANDI  and the companies are conducting two phase 3 studies in non metastatic prostate cancer as well as a phase 3 study in hormone sensitive prostate cancer   Additionally  there are phase 2 studies being conducted for treating advanced breast cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma 
Pfizer believes that the addition of XTANDI will give it a well rounded oncology portfolio   Pfizer s drug IBRANCE treats metastatic breast cancer  so Medivation s product should fit in well and help Pfizer to have products that effectively treat two of the top cancers in annual incidence  in the US  after lung cancer   The cancers impact millions of people  and there are 300 000 and 180 000 new cases expected this year  and respectively   According to   XTANDI has a 51  share in the novel hormone therapy market  and it is on track to becoming the fourth largest oncology drug by 2021  
There is more to Medivation than XTANDI though   The company also has a promising drug candidate known as Talazoparib   The product is in phase 3 studies for treating BRCA mutated breast cancer  and it has the potential to be a highly potent PARP inhibitor that could be effective for treating several other types of tumors as well  
Bottom Line
It should be noted that Sanofi   NYSE SNY   offered to buy Medivation for  52 50 per share in April   Pfizer s offer is about 55  higher than the bid Sanofi put up  so it is clear that the company has strong faith in the value of XTANDI to be used for treating multiple types of cancer   So far  the trials for treating other types of cancer  such as breast cancer  pre and post metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer  and hepatocellular carcinoma  have progressed into mid and later stage trials  so there is strong potential for XTANDI to become an effective form of treatment for various types of tumors  
The high price tag is a gamble  but if XTANDI gets FDA approval for treating other forms of cancer  it will gain increased traction in the oncology market   This will mean a lot for Pfizer  and it could result in the company becoming one of the premier leaders in oncology   Right now  PFE stock is a Zacks Rank  3  Hold

220931,442447,PFE,Market Update   22 08 2016,opinion,"This promises to be an interesting week again with some key data coming out  mainly later in the week  We will start on Tuesday and Wednesday with important German data to start off with  but the main action will be on Friday  with GDP data out of the UK and the US as well as a speech by FED Chair Yellen  We can expect a lot of positioning ahead of this  especially on the backdrop of recent comments from several FED members 

Currencies
EUR USD   is moving down due to the bullish comments coming out of the US from different members of the FED who are saying that they could  and possibly should   raise the interest rate sooner rather than later  Some are saying that the rate could rise at least once more this year  We will also be looking at the German data this week  which as always is important as the German economy is the growth engine of the Eurozone 
USD JPY   is moving up after comments from BOJ Governor Kuroda that the BOJ might expand stimulus at its meeting next month  and perhaps even cut the interest rate further  This is in addition to the general correction we are currently seeing in the USD  after having seen some severe weakening last week  
GBP USD    even though the data out of the UK was better than expected last week  we see the GBP almost unchanged now  as we are heading down once move  This comes due to the strengthening of the USD  but also due to reports that the UK might enact article 50 early next year which will start the process for the UK to leave the EU 
USD CAD   moved up on Friday  not because oil dropped  but rather because of some weak data out of Canada  We see that this is currently continuing as the USD is gaining in strength and also oil is dropping a bit 

Indices
Dollar Index   as always  when gauging the state of the USD  the best way to do this is to look at the Dollar Index  We can clearly see that the USD is strengthening again and is trading more or less back at the levels pre FOMC meeting minutes  We can expect more moves in the USD  as we get GDP data at the end of the week and the anticipated speech by Yellen at the Jackson Hole Symposium 
S P 500   the stronger USD and also the prospects of a rate cut are causing the S P to move down  We shouldn t forget that we have seen an impressive rally over the last few weeks  starting at the end of June  so there is bound to be some profit taking as well  as we are still trading near record highs 

Commodities
Gold   has dropped in recent days as we keep getting more comments that the FED could raise the interest rate already next month  something again stated over the weekend as the job and inflation targets are close to being reached  We are trading at the lowest level in nearly 2 weeks around the support of the 1332 level 
Oil is moving down after having risen over  4 50 last week  While there are not many people who believe that anything will come out of the discussion next month on a production freeze  one can still see how much influence pure expectation can have on the market  Even if an agreement will be reached  at which levels  As Saudi Arabia and also other countries are producing at  near  record levels  the actual effect on curbing the oversupply will be limited  We saw on Friday that the number of active rigs keeps on increasing  something that also signals that production in the US will be increasing further as well  The stronger USD is also helping oil to move lower this morning

 LUCRATIVE OPPORTUNITY
 The core of Lehman Brothers has allowed Barclays to go from
a respected debt shop to a comprehensive investment bank  adding
stock underwriting and M A advisory to the business in a swoop 
 Lehman s U S  equities business was key to that deal    U S 
distribution channels are the largest and critical for anyone
selling and underwriting stocks 
 It has proved a lucrative opportunity  helping to double
pre tax profit from Barclays investment banking business in the
first six months 
  With Lehman you had a ship that had been sailing along very
well and one particular thing torpedoed it   said analyst Mike
Trippitt at Oriel Securities   The rest of the business in the
U S  was still buzzing    what Barclays got was a business in
which 80 percent was pretty vibrant  
 Challenges for Barclays include the huge technological
weight of rolling out a single equities platform across the
globe  and the task of climbing up the ranks of investment
banking league tables as more banks fight over fewer deals 
 Since the deal Barclays has taken the number 2 spot in debt
capital markets tables  up one place  but it is still below
Lehman s old positions in both global M A and equity capital
markets  according to Thomson Reuters data 
 
 CULTURE CLASH
 Success has been more measured for Nomura  While areas such
as its Japanese franchise  M A advisory and convertible bonds
have shown strength  the bank suffered early on from costs
associated with the Lehman deal 
  Looking back at Nomura s financial results for the first
quarter  they only managed to show  some  fruit out of Lehman
acquisition   Credit Suisse analyst Azuma Ohno said   To me it
seems they showed they were able to get a fairly good numbers in
a good financial environment  but it was not extremely good  
 Asia s stock market soared in the first months of the year 
with shares in China alone ahead more than 80 percent in early
August 
 The Japanese bank quickly ran into a challenge that had
little to do with speed or execution  Taking on a risk loving
American brokerage proved a tall task 
 While steps such as Western style contracts have been taken
to improve the cultural differences  issues still pop up  
 The U S  press has relished stories of traders singing
company songs or of lessons on serving tea in the Japanese
tradition  while rumours of Lehman only parties have done the
rounds in Nomura Asia 
  There are still internal divisions that just won t go away 
It s an us vs  them mentality and it s a shame   according to a
legacy Nomura banker who did not want to be identified because
he was not authorised to speak to the media about the deal 
 Sharing client networks is an ongoing problem  he said 
 
 PEOPLE POWER
 To keep Lehman bankers through the upheaval  Nomura offered
many of them one  and two year guarantees  based on their 2007
compensation  The full payout of last year s bonus was due on
Sept  1  prompting speculation that another round of Lehman
departures is soon to follow 
 Nomura has defended the timing of its purchase and has shown
it is still willing to hire  even before the markets recovered 
 Nomura  which jumped to 4 400 employees in Europe from 1 500
after the acquisition of Lehman s businesses  has hired 521
people in Europe since January  including eight number
one ranked research teams 
  The fascinating thing is that 18 months ago  no one from
Goldman or Merrill wanted to work at Nomura   an ex Lehman
executive said  referring to the old school Japanese image   Now
they see the opportunity to build something   
 Still  Lehman bankers have felt under represented at the top
of Nomura s management structure  a feeling that intensified
when Lehman s former Asia Pacific CEO Jesse Bhattal said this
summer he would step down from his chairman role at year end 
 Progress is emerging though  Nomura s first quarter this
year    the three months to the end of June    reversed a
year and a half of decline  and teams have cooperated 
  The capital markets team and sales division have worked
well with convertibles in terms of distribution  That s actually
been an astonishing success   said the legacy Nomura banker 
  In a number of parts we re well positioned  We seem to be
missing the boat with some of our businesses  I d say overall 
it s still a work in progress  
 Even if the deal for Barclays was a more rounded success  
it too still has work to do    not least to grow in Asia and
Europe and realise its ambition of taking a top spot in equities
and M A league tables 
 Its role as adviser to Pfizer on its  68 billion takeover of
Wyeth has helped  but Barclays is number 11 in the global M A
tables  below Lehman s old number 9 spot 
  We are still not up and running in Europe and Asia  and
especially in Europe that will have an impact on global league
tables   del Missier said   I am confident you will start to see
the results come through pretty quickly

220935,442451,PFE,UPDATE 1 EXCLUSIVE Sanofi sees sales boost from H1N1 vaccine,news,"  CEO sees H1N1 vaccine boosting sales this year and next
   expects to file H1N1 vaccine for EMEA clearance end Oct
   needs to grow U S  research but nothing big in the works
   looking to appoint over the counter drugs head
   share down 1 47 percent

  adds details and quotes 
 By Caroline Jacobs
 PARIS  Sept 24  Reuters    Sanofi Aventis  expects
its H1N1 vaccine that targets the swine flu virus to boost to
its revenues this year and next  the head of the French
drugmaker told Reuters in an interview 
  There s going to be a significant revenue opportunity  both
this year and next year   Chris Viehbacher said on Thursday 
 It s a nice short term boost for sales and cash flow  
 Sanofi Pasteur  the vaccine division of Sanofi Aventis 
earlier this month won an additional order from the U S  health
department for its H1N1 vaccines  taking the total to 75 3
million doses 
 Sanofi Aventis expects to submit its H1N1 vaccine with the
European Medicines Agency  EMEA  by the end of October and
Viehbacher expected approval to take up to six weeks 
 Viehbacher  who took the helm in December 2008  said the
company had no plans to alter it strategy of making acquisitions
of up to 15 billion euros   22 09 billion  in market value while
preferring to avoid big takeveovers 
  I m not going to change a strategy that has been
successful   he said 
  I still remain skeptical about big mergers   he added 
 Sanofi has several blockbuster drugs such as blood thinner
Plavix and cancer treatment Taxotere 
 Sanofi has a market capitalisation of some  100 billion 
which makes it sixth in the world after Johnson   Johnson
  Roche   Novartis   Pfizer  and
GlaxoSmithKline     the former employer of Viehbacher 
 
 AIDS VACCINE
 Viehbacher was speaking ahead of an expert presentation on a
the clinical results of an experimental AIDS vaccine  made from
two older versions  which showed made major progress in finding
an effective way to combat the illness   ID nLO53122 
 Sanofi s pipeline of drugs in development has become leaner
following a rejig that left it with only the most promising
candidates after Viehbacher put a halt to others 
 Partnerships should help expand the pipeline again with a
focus on the United States  the world s biggest drugmarket 
  I think we are underrepresented in research in the U S  
Viehbacher said   Today you want to be able to capture the best
science everywhere  I d certainly like to strengthen our
presence there   he said  adding  nothing major is cooking  
 Sanofi earlier this year bought U S  biotech company BiPar
whose candidate drug BSI 201 which seeks to treat cancers
including breast and ovarian  is seen as a potential
blockbuster 
 Rather than cost savings  Sanofi s takeover strategy focuses
on boosting its revenues as the company is facing a number of
patent expiries on several of its top selling drugs  making it
vulnerable to cheaper copies made by generic drugmakers 
 
 NO MEGA MERGER
 Instead of mega mergers and a focus solely on finding the
next multi billion euro blockbuster drug  Sanofi seeks to grow
its business by expanding its existing platforms  like vaccines 
generics and over the counter drugs  which can be bought without
a prescription 
 It is aiming to turn its OTC business  which includes
Sanofi s best selling drug in France Doliprane paracetamol  into
a division with a head of its own who should be able to double
sales in next five years from 1 3 billion euros in 2008 
  We are in the process of trying to nominate someone  
Viehbacher said 
 In a first move to expand its widespread OTC business 
Sanofi last year bought Australia s Symbion  which also makes
vitamin supplements 
 Sanofi shares were down 1 47 percent at 50 11 euros at 1430
GMT  after a 12 percent rise sofar this year

220940,442456,PFE,ANALYSIS India s ailing drugmakers may seek foreign cure,news,"  More tie ups likely between global  Indian pharma firms
   Pfizer  Merck  Sanofi may be on lookout for deals
   India s Cipla  Aurobindo seen as potential targets
   Global firms seen benefitting from low costs in India
   Indian firms to gain expertise  avoid legal battles
 By Pratish Narayanan
 MUMBAI  Aug 6  Reuters    For Indian generic drugmakers
struggling with cut throat competition  regulatory hurdles and
expensive legal battles  a tie up with a global pharmaceutical
giant may be just what the doctor ordered 
 The world s biggest drugmakers have been on an acquisition
spree over the past year and are eyeing Indian firms to gain
access to emerging markets and cheap production  as well as to
retake some of the business they ve lost to inexpensive copycat
versions of their blockbuster drugs 
 Global heavyweight Pfizer is seen as the most likely suitor
of Indian rivals as it looks to replace revenue lost from the
lapse of key patents  while Merck and Sanofi Aventis may also
seek to shake hands with Indian producers  analysts said 
 Indian drug companies  for their part  are grappling with
regulatory crackdowns that have made it harder to sell their
products in the key U S  market  making a deal with a bigger
and better funded global rival look increasingly attractive 
 Indian generic drug makers including Ranbaxy  Dr Reddy s and
Matrix Laboratories have all linked up with global players over
the past year  More deals are expected 
  The foreign companies can limit research expenses as the
cost of developing a product in India is lower than probably
anywhere else in the world   said R K  Gupta  managing director
of Taurus Mutual Fund in New Delhi 
  While the Indian firm will get access to world class
facilities and need not handle legal issues once the drug is
developed  
 Analysts say India s Cipla  with its vast range of
products  including anti cancer and anti diabetic drugs  and a
market value of  4 5 billion  is attractive to foreign buyers 
 They add that smaller firms Aurobindo Pharma  Orchid
Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals and Dishman Pharmaceuticals could
also be eyed by overseas firms 
  When foreign companies look at India  they consider two
things  the low cost of development and the chance to expand in
emerging markets   said Sarabjit Kour Nangra  a healthcare
analyst at Angel Broking in Mumbai 
  Cipla s valuations are expensive  but the company has a
strong asset base  
 The company s shares trade at more than 20 times forward
earnings  compared with a 17 5 multiple for India s benchmark
BSE index 
 Rivals Sun Pharma  and Aurobindo Pharma trade at 17 9 times
and 7 3 times expected earnings  respectively  Ranbaxy and Sun 
the two biggest Indian drug makers by sales and market cap 
respectively  are the two worst performers in India s roaring
main index this year  with gains of less than 10 percent 
 India currently represents  6 billion of the  550 billion
global pharmaceutical industry and its share is increasing at
10 percent a year  according to consultancy KPMG 
 It is forecast that Indian companies will likely take
around 30 percent of the global generics market from around 22
percent now  KPMG said 
 EMERGING MARKET FOCUS
 Drug sales in emerging markets are expected to grow by
mid teens percentage rates through 2013  against low
single digits for mature markets  according to IMS Health  the
leading tracker of prescription drug data 
 Pfizer may pursue further links in India as it faces sales
declines in coming years from patent expirations  including for
blockbuster cholesterol treatment Lipitor 
 The company wants to add  3 billion in annual sales from
developing markets by 2012  and recently signed a deal with
India s Aurobindo Pharma under which Pfizer will gain rights to
about 60 products in more than 70 emerging markets 
 Other global firms such as Merck and Sanofi Aventis may
also seek deals with Indian firms as efforts to control health
care costs in countries including the United States push global
drugmakers to find cheaper alternatives to branded drugs 
 In June  Dr  Reddy s signed a licensing deal with the UK s
GlaxoSmithKline  and No  3 generics maker Mylan Inc announced a
partnership with India s Biocon 
 FDA TROUBLE
 Developing nations account for just 6 percent of worldwide
trade in medicines  the World Health Organization estimates  By
offering generic drugs that are a cheaper alternative to
branded drugs from big global firms  Indian companies have an
oppportunity to increase their share of this trade  say
analysts 
 But the U S  Food and Drug Administration has recently been
finding fault with Indian firms  manufacturing procedures  A
tie up with one of the bigger players would help them acquire
the know how to better maintain quality standards 
  The FDA has been going no  no  no  no to so many drugs
from Indian firms   said Alex Mathew  head of research at
Geojit BNP Paribas Financial Services 
  A tie up with foreign players will not only give financial
stability  but access to technological upgradation that can
prevent more disapproval  
 In late June  U S  authorities seized drugs made by the
U S  unit of India s Sun Pharma for manufacturing standards
violations  Last year  the FDA found 15 deficiencies at Indian
firm Lupin s manufacturing plant in central India 
 Japanese drugmaker Daiichi Sankyo s  4 2 billion takeover
in 2008 of Ranbaxy  India s top drugmaker by sales 
demonstrates the possibilities but also the potential pitfalls
that global players face when linking up with Indian rivals 
 Ranbaxy shares plummeted late last year after a U S  ban on
some of its products  The FDA in February said Ranbaxy had sold
misbranded or adulterated drugs in the United States  its
largest market  further hurting the company s market value 
 But analysts say Ranbaxy has been helped since being taken
over by Daiichi  which replaced Ranbaxy head Malvinder Singh
with its own executive in a bid to resolve problems

 By Quentin Webb
 LONDON  Aug 10  Reuters    Forest Laboratories Inc  the U S 
specialty drugmaker whose biggest drug Lexapro is soon to lose
patent protection  paid  100 million upfront for U S  rights to
Nycomed s promising  smoker s lung  drug Daxas 
 Nycomed will also receive up to  500 million in further
payments based on regulatory approvals and commercialisation
milestones  Chief Executive Hakan Bjorklund told Reuters in a
telephone interview on Monday 
 The privately owned Swiss drug company  which is working
towards a multi billion dollar flotation  also stands to receive
royalties that will be  standard  for a product of this size and
development stage  he added 
 Forest will have exclusive rights to develop  make and
commercialise Daxas in the United States  utilising its
2 700 strong sales force 
 Forest is expected to lose patent protection on Lexapro  the
blockbuster antidepressant that is its top selling drug  in
early 2012  It sells Lexapro in conjunction with Danish
drugmaker Lundbeck 
 Nycomed has recently submitted Daxas to European and U S 
regulators for approval  and Bjorklund said it hopes for
registration in both jurisdictions next year 
 Daxas is the first tablet based treatment for chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease  COPD     the world s
fifth biggest cause of death in 2002  according to the World
Health Organisation  WHO  
 
 BLOCKBUSTER POTENTIAL
 The drug could compete with GlaxoSmithKline s Advair and
Spiriva  marketed by Pfizer and Boehringer Ingelheim  in the
multibillion dollar worldwide COPD market 
 Bjorklund said Daxas had  blockbuster potential     meaning
it could ultimately top  1 billion in annual sales 
 He said Nycomed picked Forest from a handful of partnership
candidates  based partly on its big sales force and its track
record of partnering to develop drugs 
 Nycomed  whose biggest owners are private equity firms
Nordic Capital and Credit Suisse s DLJ unit  aims to use junk
bonds and fresh equity from its owners to fund a planned buyout
of Solvay s drugs unit  people familiar with the matter told
Reuters recently 
 Bjorklund declined to comment on Solvay  He said the Daxas
agreement did not immediately affect Nycomed s plans for an
initial public offering  IPO  
  I don t think it has any immediate bearing on when and how
we would do a public listing   he said   But of course it s a
step in the right direction  it strengthens the company  and
it s proof that not only we but other people see a lot of value
in Daxas  
 He added that sales of pantoprazole  the heartburn treatment
that is Nycomed s best selling drug  were holding up  somewhat

220950,442466,PFE,UPDATE 3 Irish strike halts construction projects  brewing,news,"  10 500 striking electricians to call for all out picket

   Production hit at Diageo s Guinness brewery in Dublin
   Pickets at power plants  output unaffected
 
 Adds fresh comments on impact 
 By Ashley Beston
 DUBLIN  July 6  Reuters    A union representing thousands of
striking electricians in Ireland said on Monday it would call
for an all out picket of over 200 construction sites  escalating
a dispute that also hit the output of Ireland s favourite beer 
  Our members have sent a very clear signal to the employers
by their actions this morning that they will not be rolling over
and meekly accepting cutbacks to bail out developers and
speculators   said Eamon Devoy  general secretary designate of
the Technical Engineering and Electrical Union  TEEU  
  We will now be seeking to consolidate the support we are
already receiving from other workers through an application for
an all out picket   he said in a statement 
 About 10 500 contractors are taking part in the indefinite
strike  the first major industrial action since Ireland went
into recession last year  Pickets have been set up at building
sites at Dublin Airport and at companies such as Intel  Pfizer
and Microsoft 
 A court granted an injunction against TEEU to stop picketing
the St  James s Gate brewery owned by Diageo  one of the world s
biggest alcoholic drinks groups  where a strike by third party
contractors severely affected Guinness production 
 Because of the delicate yeast based brewing process  even a
relatively short stoppage could potentially affect output of
Ireland s favourite stout for weeks  the company said 
 SIPTU  one of Ireland s biggest unions with 200 000 members 
has said it would support an all out strike and if umbrella
group ICTU  which represents most unions in Ireland  agrees to
the electricians  request that could close most of the affected
construction projects 
 ICTU will need to ballot its members before making a final
decision  which could take at least until next week 
 Employers  group IBEC said the strike could force
manufacturers to lay off workers  with some already put on
protective notice in anticipation of further disruption 
 The dispute centres around wage increases of about 11
percent the electricians say they are owed for a number of
years  A contractor currently earns 21 49 euros   30  per hour 
 Employers have said they cannot afford to give them more
money and instead are looking for a wage cut of 10 percent 
  No one could survive on what they are offering us   said
Pat Mooney as he picketed outside Dublin s Lansdowne Road
Stadium  which is being redeveloped 
  Our members are determined to see this through  otherwise
we might as well throw our tool boxes in the  river  Liffey  
 There were pickets at power stations but electricity
generation was not affected by the strike 
 
 NOT A GOOD TIME
 From factory floors to corporate suites  wages and salaries
have been falling in Ireland as businesses adjust to plummeting
demand and try to claw back competitiveness lost during the boom
years of the  Celtic Tiger  economy 
  I d love to know who s advising the guys that it s a good
time to look for an 11 percent pay increase   said Joe Byrne  a
Dublin shopkeeper   I m not denying or debating that they re
entitled to it but it s not a good time 
 Employers have been able to push through wages cuts of 10
percent or more in Ireland as unemployment balloons 
 The government has put the country on a five year austerity
diet after a debt fuelled property boom turned Ireland from
economic star to one of the industrialised world s worst
performers 
 Prime Minister Brian Cowen has vowed to get the budget
deficit under an EU limit of three percent of gross domestic
product by 2013 from a targeted 10 75 percent this year 
 He is under pressure from the International Monetary Fund
and others to cut public sector pay in the budget in December 
 Cowen  a former finance minister  has said he was committed
to taking tough action  
 But his junior coalition partner  the Green Party  and
members of his own party may baulk at further pain after
cutbacks  tax hikes and the imposition of a pension levy
prompted 100 000 people to take to the streets in February

220951,442467,PFE,EU actively pursuing some drugmakers  official says,news,"  EU actively pursuing a number of individual cases
   No conclusions at this stage 
   Kroes report to step up scrutiny of generics deals
 
 By Foo Yun Chee
 BRUSSELS  July 7  Reuters    EU regulators are probing some
drug firms over suspected anti competitive practices that
include deals with makers of cheap generics to delay medicines 
market entry  a European Commission official said on Tuesday 
 European Union Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes will
say in a report on the pharmaceutical industry on Wednesday that
 we are actively pursuing a number of individual cases   the
official  who has seen the 600 page document  said 
  The report will say that there are no final conclusions at
this stage to those cases being pursued   the official said 
adding that the document did not identify any companies 
 Kroes  tasked with ensuring fair play across the 27 country
European Union  will present the final report of her
investigation at 0930 GMT 
 In its preliminary report last November  the EU s executive
arm estimated that delays in getting generics on the market had
cost healthcare providers 3 billion euros   4 2 billion   based
on a sample of medicines that lost patent protection in 17 EU
states between 2000 and 2007 
 The European Commission s final report will pave the way for
increased regulatory scrutiny of settlement agreements in which
brand name companies pay generics makers for not competing with
them or set restrictions on competition  the official said 
  It will look at this on a case by case basis to see if
there is enough evidence that merits further scrutiny   the
official said 
 Kroes kicked off her investigation in January 2008 with a
series of raids on makers of brand name drugs  including
AstraZeneca  GlaxoSmithKline  Pfizer  Merck and Sanofi Aventis 
 There were also raids on generic drugmakers suspected of
colluding to delay the entry of their products  sometimes in
exchange for payments from originator companies 
 Such settlement agreements have also come under fire in the
United States  where the Federal Trade Commission estimated last
month that they were costing consumers  3 5 billion a year 
 Legislation pending in the U S  Congress would ban such
deals 
 Drugmakers blame most of the delays on regulatory and other
bureaucratic issues  rather than deliberate action by companies

220952,442468,PFE,Irish unions ask members to back all out picket,news,"  Unions to urge members to join all out picket
   Talks to be held on Wednesday to resolve dispute
 
 DUBLIN  July 7  Reuters    The union representing striking
Irish electricians said on Tuesday that other affiliates of the
Irish Congress of Trade Unions had agreed to hold ballots and
ask their members to support them with an all out picket 
 Employers hope talks with unions on Wednesday will help end
the strike they fear could cripple industries already weakened
by one of the deepest recessions across the developed world 
 But the union representing the 10 500 contractors taking
part in the indefinite strike over wages    the first major
industrial action since Ireland went into recession last year   
remained defiant 
  Our pickets have already made an enormous impact on the
electrical contracting and construction sectors and this will be
multiplied many times over once the all out pickets are put in
place   the Technical Engineering and Electrical Union  TEEU 
said 
 The dispute centres around wage increases of about 11
percent the electricians say they are owed for a number of
years 
 Employers have said they cannot afford to give them more
money and instead are looking for a wage cut of 10 percent 
 At a time when Ireland is struggling to repair damage to its
investor image from twin banking and fiscal crises  the strike
has hit hundreds of construction sites and hurt production at
Irish units of companies such as Intel  Pfizer  Microsoft and
Cadbury 
 Output has been curtailed in many places as workers not
directly involved in the pay dispute did not cross the
electricians  picket lines 
 A court is expected to decide on Wednesday whether to extend
a temporary injunction against TEEU to stop picketing Dublin s
St  James s Gate brewery where Diageo makes Ireland s trademark
Guinness stout for the Irish and British markets 
 SIPTU  one of Ireland s largest unions with 200 000 members 
said it would complete its ballot by the end of next week 
  As by far the largest union in construction our involvement
in the dispute will see a serious escalation   it said

   Sees improving performance continuing in second half
   Says has swine flu vaccine contracts for 195 mln doses
   Shares reverse losses  now flat
 
  Adds details  background  comment  updated shares 
 By Ben Deighton
 LONDON  July 22  Reuters    GlaxoSmithKline  the world s
second biggest drugmaker  beat expectations with its
second quarter earnings on Wednesday and said momentum in the
second half would pick up on the back of flu vaccine sales 
 Glaxo said growing sales of new products and its portfolio
of flu products should help drive its improving performance into
the second half of the year as the heavy impact of generic
competition to its formerly patented drugs begins to abate 
 Shares in Glaxo  which had been down 1 percent ahead of the
earnings statement  recovered to stand flat by 1156 GMT  The DJ
Stoxx European health care index was up 0 5 percent 
 WestLB analyst Simon Mather said that at first glance the
results were broadly in line with what he expected  but he
pointed out that there were lower than expected restructuring
costs and there was more of a boost from currency effects than
he had first thought 
 Healthcare companies have proven relatively resilient to the
recession as it is typically one of the last areas where
consumers cut spending 
 Glaxo s figures follow upbeat results from U S  rivals Merck
  Co  Schering Plough and Eli Lilly  The world s biggest
drugmaker Pfizer s earnings also just beat forecasts 
 But pharmaceuticals shares have begun to underperform as
cyclical sectors benefit from the first signs of a possible
recovery 
 Roche  Bristol Myers Squibb and Wyeth are all due to report
on Thursday 
 
 WEAKER POUND
 Glaxo has gained substantially from the pound s decline
because it sells the vast majority of its products abroad 
 However  it still faces heavy generic competition for key
drugs  having lost patent protection on a raft of central
nervous system medicines including Lamictal  Imitrex  Wellbutrin
XL and Paxil CR 
 Pretax  pre restructuring profit in the second quarter was
2 25 billion pounds   3 7 billion   equivalent to earnings per
share before major restructuring charges of 31 pence  up 14
percent  on sales up 15 percent at 6 747 billion 
 Analysts had forecast Glaxo EPS of 29 8 pence and sales of
just under 6 7 billion pounds  according to a Reuters poll 
 The company said it had received H1N1 vaccine contracts for
195 million doses and that it was in talks with over 50
governments of both developing and developed countries in
relation to swine flu vaccine  It said some of the talks were at
a  very advanced  stage 
  I therefore expect further significant orders   Chief
Executive Andrew Witty said in a statement   Shipments are
expected in the second half of 2009 and early 2010

Wave V could already be seen as a complete impulsive wave  In addition  the MACD indicator is showing the typical bearish divergence between waves 3  5 of  3  and  5   It definitely does not look good for Pfizer stock right now  So if the recent bullish breakout make you feel optimistic and willing to buy it  our opinion is you should be very careful  because now might be the worst possible moment to join the bulls  Buying Pfizer  No  thank you ",2016-07-24,EWM Interactive,https://www.investing.com/analysis/pfizer-a-buy-it-was-over-four-months-ago-200143695,200143695
220962,442478,PFE,Drug industry expects final EU probe report July 8,news,"  Preliminary report blasted firms for blocking generics
   Industry hopes for some softening in final version
 By Ben Hirschler
 LONDON  June 17  Reuters    The European Commission looks
set to deliver its final verdict on competition  or lack of it 
in the pharmaceutical sector on July 8  the industry s trade
organisation said on Wednesday 
 Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes blasted drugmakers
last November when preliminary results of her inquiry concluded
they were delaying or blocking the entry of cheaper generic
medicines 
 Thomas Cueni  who heads a European Federation of
Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations taskforce on the
issue  told Reuters he hoped for a reassessment in the latest
version but acknowledged a radical re write was unlikely 
  The preliminary report was 420 odd pages     it might be up
to 600 pages now  I would be surprised if it was totally
rewritten   he said 
 The Commission  the European Union s executive arm  said
last year that delays in getting generics to market had cost
healthcare providers about 3 billion euros   4 2 billion 
between 2000 and 2007 
 But drugmakers argue most of the delays were down to
regulatory and other bureaucratic issues  rather than deliberate
action by companies    and Cueni is hoping there will be greater
recognition of this in the final version of the report 
 There could also be a couple of positive recommendations  he
added  such as backing for a common European patent  applicable
in all EU countries  and the introduction of a specialised
patent litigation system 
 Kroes kicked off her sector investigation in January 2008
with a series of raids on makers of brand name drugs  including
AstraZeneca  GlaxoSmithKline  Pfizer  Merck and Sanofi Aventis 
 There were also raids on generic drugmakers suspected of
colluding to limit the entry of generics  sometimes in exchange
for payments from originator companies 
 The Commission s findings could open the door to action
against individual companies  with the potential for large fines
down the road

 PARIS  June 18  Reuters    Shares in NicOx slumped on
Thursday after the French biotech firm said talks to seal a
partnership to bring anti inflammatory drug naproxcinod to
market may not reach a conclusion until the first half of 2010 
 Shares in NicOx closed down 7 4 percent at 8 88 euros 
compared to a 1 percent rise in France s CAC 40 index 
 Some of NicOx s potential partners prefer to wait until they
see the drug s guidelines  which are being negotiated with
health authorities  before signing a commercial partnership with
NicOx  a spokesman said 
 The main question is whether the U S  Food and Drug
Administration will let NicOx state on the label that the drug
is less likely to increase arterial pressure than other
competing medicines  the spokesman said 
 Negotiations over the medicine s guidelines will take place
during the first half of 2010  he added 
 He confirmed that NicOx is likely to clinch two or three
partnerships depending on the geographical zone  adding that
partners will include global  regional and specialised
pharmaceutical firms 
 The submission for marketing approval will still be sent to
the FDA this summer as expected  the spokesman said  adding that
a proposal will be sent to European health authorities two to
three months after the United States 
 NicOx has high hopes for naproxcinod  which took 10 years to
develop at a cost of around 100 million euros   139 6 million  
It would be its first marketed drug and the only branded rival
to Pfizer s Celebrex  which made  2 5 billion in sales last

220964,442480,PFE,INTERVIEW Rigel s oral arthritis drug as good as Pfizer s  COO,news,"  Says rheumatoid arthritis drug comparable to Pfizer s
   Sees multi billion dollar potential for drug
   Sees partnering on drug by second half of 2010
   Has enough cash until then
   Says will not pursue psoriasis drug without partner By
Vidya L Nathan BANGALORE  June 25  Reuters    Rigel
Pharmaceuticals Inc s experimental oral treatment for
rheumatoid arthritis would hold its own against a rival drug in
development at Pfizer and has the potential to be a
multi billion dollar business  a top company official said 
 The efficacy between the two products is about the same  We
have a little bit more efficacy in some areas than they do but
it is basically very similar  The two products are comparable  
Chief Operating Officer Raul Rodriguez told Reuters in a
telephone interview 
 Rigel s drug  R788  is currently being studied in mid stage
trials  the results of which are expected mid July  Pfizer
Inc s comparable drug is in late stage studies 
 Rigel s Rodriguez sees the oral compounds being developed
by the two as having an edge over competitors  injections  as
 people generally prefer having an oral pill than having to
undergo injections  
 Existing injectable treatments for the condition include
Abbott Laboratories s Humira  Johnson   Johnson and
Schering Plough s Remicade  and Amgen and Wyeth s Enbrel 
  If we are able to come in before the injectable drugs
during treatment  that gives us a very big market and even if
we share it with Pfizer it still means that R788 has
multi billion dollar potential   Rodriguez said 
 However  R788 future also rests upon the clinical stage
development company finding a licensing partner to fund the
large late stage trials required for the drug 
 Rigel s compound works by blocking white blood cells in
tissues from signaling the body defenses into attacking the
disease area and causing swelling and inflammation 
 Rodriguez said Rigel is also looking to find a partner who is
also interested in the compound s potential benefits in cancer 
for which it is currently being studied in mid stage studies
with funding from the National Institutes of Health 
 In February  Rigel had halted partnership talks on the drug
until after results of the mid stage studies were out  so as to
get a better deal 
 CASH NO BAR
 The South San Francisco  California based company  which
has about  134 5 million cash  had also let go of about 20
percent of its employees and cut some of its pipeline products
in oncology and virology  to conserve resources 
 Rodriguez said Rigel now has enough cash to last through
the first half of 2010  by which time it expects to have found
a partner for R788 
  Our burn would drop dramatically going forward because we
do not have any clinical trials ongoing in the third quarter 
fourth quarter  or early next year  
 Rodriguez also said the company would not be pursue any
further trials of its early stage experimental psoriasis drug
as it was no longer interested in the dermatological
indication  but added that it was open to partnering on it 
 Clinical trials of the remaining compounds in the company s
pipeline    an inhaled asthma product and a cancer drug    are
being funded by existing partners 
  And so that  current  cash number is sufficient to take us
through the middle of next year   the COO said

  Adds background 
 BRUSSELS  June 30  Reuters    U S  drugmaker Pfizer has
offered remedies aimed at tackling concerns that its  68 billion
planned takeover of rival Wyeth may be anti competitive  the
European Commission said on Tuesday 
 The Commission  which polices competition in the 27 country
European Union  said in a daily list of planned mergers under

deal to July 20 from July 6  
 It gave no further details 
 Parties in mergers often offer to divest some sectors or
activities to address concerns that their transaction could
infringe EU competition rules 
 A Pfizer executive was quoted in March as saying that the
company may have to shed some of its animal health business so
that it can gain antitrust clearance 
 Pfizer said in April that it had received a request for
additional information from the U S  Federal Trade Commission
regarding the proposed acquisition of Wyeth 
 The company said it still expected to close the deal by the
end of the third quarter or during the fourth quarter of this
year

agreed to pay  1 billion for an 18 4 percent stake in Irish
drugmaker Elan Corp   and will acquire a major stake in
Elan s portfolio of experimental drugs to treat Alzheimer s
disease 
 The transaction  announced on Thursday  will  among other
things  give J J a 25 percent interest in a closely watched
Alzheimer s drug called bapineuzumab  which Elan is developing
in a 50 50 partnership with Wyeth  Wyeth is being acquired by
Pfizer Inc  
 The agreement caps a lengthy battle between Elan and some
of its largest shareholders  who had called on Elan to shake up
its board  streamline operations and tighten what they
considered lax corporate governance 
 Last month  the company agreed to nominate two dissidents
to its board  including Jack Schuler  a shareholder who
publicly called for the resignation of Elan s chief executive 
Kelly Martin 
 As a potential board member  Schuler declined to discuss
the J J transaction  but another of Elan s previous critics
welcomed it 
  We are encouraged by this deal   said Matt Strobeck 
partner at Westfield Capital Management Co  which holds 18 8
million Elan shares   Now not only is the balance sheet
strengthened but we believe the board has been dramatically
improved  
 Elan said it plans to use the new funds to cut its debt by
70 percent to about  400 million  Moody s Investors Service
said it has placed Elan s ratings under review for a possible
upgrade 
  The transaction is expected to have a very favorable
impact on Elan s capital structure and liquidity profile   said
Moody s Senior Vice President Michael Levesque 
 On the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday  Elan 
closed up 8 6 percent at  7 60 and J J fell 1 9 percent to
 55 98 
 For New Brunswick  New Jersey based J J  the deal
represents a leap into a therapeutic area in which it has only
a limited presence 
 J J sells Reminyl  which is in the same class of medicines
as Pfizer Inc s best selling Aricept treatment for Alzheimer s
disease  But the drugs  which block an enzyme called
acetylcholinesterase  only slightly improve cognition and for a
very brief period 
 Combined U S  sales of all Alzheimer s drugs rose to  3 4
billion last year  according to market research firm IMS
Health  but analysts believe revenue could explode if new
medicines can appreciably slow damage to the brain and memory 
  J J has a much better chance to make bapineuzumab
successful than Elan because it has the resources to conduct
trials and distribute it   said David Katz of asset manager
Matrix Asset Advisors   And from a patient perspective  to have
J J involved is a good thing  
 But the bet on bapineuzumab is risky 
 Some analysts have all but written the drug off after a
mid stage trial showed that while it helped some patients with
a certain genetic profile  it raised the risk of potentially
serious side effects in the brain 
 For J J  which sells an array of products ranging from
Band Aids to arthritis drug Remicade  the potential warrants
the risk 
  The fact that this drug may have potential to delay
disease progression  we believe is significant   said company
spokesman Srikant Ramaswami 
 Elan and Wyeth remain committed to the drug  which is
Elan s most advanced product  But under the transaction with
J J  Elan will receive 25 percent of any profit instead of the
50 percent it would have received previously 
 That is because J J and Elan plan to form a new company 
which will be 50 1 percent owned by J J and 49 9 percent owned
by Elan  J J will contribute an initial  500 million to the
venture  Elan will contribute its Alzheimer s immunotherapy
program 
  Elan loses control of one of its babies but they have a
stake in it once it gets to market so they will get their due
returns for the work they have put in   said Ian Hunter  an
analyst with Dublin based Goodbody Stockbrokers 
 Elan said the new entity will be governed by a seven person
board  Five members will come from J J 
 As many as 5 million Americans are believed to have
Alzheimer s disease  a progressive neurological condition
associated with aging 
 The deal adds to Elan s complicated series of partnerships 
Its main product is the multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri  which
it markets together with U S  biotechnology company Biogen Idec
Inc  
 Elan said it has no intention of selling any part of
Tysabri  Naomi Aoki  a spokeswoman for Biogen  said J J s entry
will make no difference to its partnership with Elan 
 J J said the transaction would dilute its adjusted earnings
in 2009 by between 2 and 3 cents a share 
 Elan said it will update its financial guidance on its next
earnings call  but it expects to be profitable on a pretax
basis by the end of 2010

The Federal Reserve released the minutes of the June FOMC meeting  When the central bank met in mid June  an abysmal May jobs report  just 38 000 new jobs in May  had just startled markets  and the upcoming British referendum on European Union membership loomed large   an event that certainly had the Fed worried 
But beyond that  what was the Fed thinking  Were they confident of a recovery and chomping at the bit to hike rates  or were they more concerned that the economy was still too fragile for higher rates 
Turns out  the Fed was mixed  Some of the policymakers thought the weak jobs report was an aberration  others thought  the lower rate of payroll gains could instead be indicative of a broader slowdown in growth of economic activity   Even though retail sales were strong in April and May   a few participants expressed caution  
Some officials thought business investment could pick up  particularly given the  greater optimism  businesses had expressed  including in the Fed s Beige Book  Yet  some participants mentioned that the sluggishness in business investment could portend a broader economic slowdown  
There were similar mixed interpretations on inflation  In the end  the doves prevailed  The decision to leave rates unchanged was unanimous  The June minutes contained no reference to the timing of any future rate rises  Dovish indeed 
Stronger demand for imports boosted the U S  trade deficit by 10  in May  but the rebound in consumer spending suggests the economy regained momentum after a slow start to the year 
The nation s trade gap climbed  41 1 billion   a three month high   from a revised  37 4 billion in April  Imports increased 1 6  in May to a seasonally adjusted  223 5 billion  Exports  meanwhile  slipped 0 2  to  182 4 billion 
Exports have been weak because of a strong dollar that makes American products more expensive as well as slower growth around the world  The U S  exported fewer autos  airplanes and computer accessories in May 
The Institute for Supply Management s service sector index jumped to 56 5  in June  a much stronger reading than expected  The forward looking new orders component jumped 5 7 points to 59 9   and the production index rose to 59 5  Employment increased 3 0 points to 52 7   signaling expansion  The ISM says the report shows a  strong rebound  in economic activity 
The pound sterling dropped to a fresh 31 year trough overnight  sliding as far as  1 2796 to record a more than 14  loss in value since last month s referendum  The 10 year US Treasury note yield hit a new record low of 1 32  in overnight trade  not so much an indication of US strength but of global weakness 
The Stoxx Europe 600 dropped 1 7   with all but the defensive utilities sector losing ground  Among banks  Switzerland s Credit Suisse Group  SIX CSGN  and German lenders Deutsche Bank  DE DBKGn  and Commerzbank  DE CBKG  posted their lowest share price closes on record 
Henderson Global Investors  Columbia Threadneedle Investments and Canada Life suspended trading in at least  7 4 billion of property funds  taking the number of U K  firms curbing redemption to six in the wake of Britain s shock decision to leave the European Union 
Investors pulled money from real estate funds in the lead up to the vote  depleting cash levels  as industry commentators warned that London office values could fall by as much as 20 percent within three years of the country leaving the EU 
Standard Life Investments  LON SL  was the first money manager to halt withdrawals on Monday  followed by Aviva Investors  LON AV  and M G Investments  These are open end funds  It is kind of like a run on a bank  but it is a mutual fund  and it is not as liquid as many investors had hoped 
Deutsche Boerse  DE DB1Gn  has signaled the company to be created from its planned merger with the London Stock Exchange  LON LSE  may be headquartered outside of the U K  following Britain s EU vote  A referendum committee  involving representatives of both partners  will assess all regulatory and commercial goals aimed at getting the transaction approved 
Paris is sending letters to British executives  German politicians have paid for billboards in London to promote Berlin  Dublin is planning an advertising campaign  and Milan wants to be home to Europe s bank regulator  Not 2 weeks after the Brexit vote and cities across the Eurozone are trying to steal away British jobs and lay claim as the new financial hub 
In London s financial district on Tuesday a truck was spotted carrying a billboard with the words  Dear start ups  Keep calm and move to Berlin   French and German politicians have sparred over whether Frankfurt or Paris should take over London s euro clearing business 
And once again they miss the point  instead of trying to poach the UK s financial interests  they should try to think about how they can build a union that is better than what they have and so good that people will want more of it

Barcelona s Argentine soccer star Lionel Messi was sentenced on Wednesday to 21 months in prison and fined  2 2 million after being found guilty of three counts of tax fraud  although it is unlikely he will serve time  Another penalty he will miss  Spanish law is such that any sentence under two years for a non violent crime rarely requires a defendant without previous convictions to serve jail time

The PBGC  which guarantees a minimum benefit to pensioners  expects to spend the better part of  15 billion assisting Central States in the next decade  But the projected rate of assistance to Central States and other ailing pension plans will wipe out the government s multi employer assistance funds by 2024  Should Central States fail and the PBGC emergency fund run dry  all of Central States  407 000 participants could see their payments cut almost to nothing 
The scramble to solve the problem has not been as urgent as the pressure to stop the cuts Central States proposed under the Multi employer Pension Reform Act of 2014  MPRA   That fight involved rallies by angry pensioners  some of whom faced benefit cuts of 40 to 70 percent  The Government Accountability Office said it would investigate investment decisions made by Wall Street firms hired by Central States Pension Fund trustees ",2016-07-07,Marvin Clark,https://www.investing.com/analysis/dovish-indeed-200140436,200140436

220976,442492,PFE,INTERVIEW UPDATE 1 O Shaughnessy AM close to U S  sales deal,news,"  Former Bear Stearns manager to seek sales tie up in Europe
   Plans to launch new global market neutral hedge fund in H1
   Weighing prospect of three year hedge fund lock ups
  Adds details 
 By Claire Milhench
 LONDON  Dec 5  Reuters    United States based quantitative
investment firm O Shaughnessy Asset Management  OSAM  said it is
close to a deal with a  very large  mutual fund distributor in
the U S  as part of a global push to build its sales platform 
 Jim O Shaughnessy  chairman and CEO of OSAM  told Reuters
the agreement will be announced in January  after which he will
spend more time in Europe looking for a similar partner 
 O Shaughnessy is also seeking a sales partner in Australia 
and possibly Asia   If it ends up being just Australia then we
would try to find a strong Japanese or Chinese bank for Asia  
 OSAM already has an deal with Royal Bank of Canada  which
owns 11 percent of OSAM  to sub advise  a suite of mutual funds 
 O Shaughnessy said the top priority was institutional
investors  but he also wanted to reach retail investors in a way
that was not prohibitively expensive   That means partnering
with distributors who are looking for talent on the alpha
generation side   he said 
 The firm  which managed  7 5 billion as of September 30
across a range of strategies  was formed when O Shaughnessy and
his team left Bear Stearns Asset Management in 2007  OSAM  uses
quantitative analysis to pick stocks and seeks to generate
 alpha  returns above the average market return 
 
 HEDGE FUND PLANS
 The firm is also planning to launch a second hedge fund in
the first or second quarter next year  he told Reuters at the
CFA Institute s European conference this week  The first  the
O Shaughnessy Pari Passu fund  launched on September 26 this
year and invests across asset classes  with a net long strategy 
 Acknowledging that it hadn t been the easiest time to
launch  O Shaughnessy said he was exploring the option of three
year lock ups   What we have seen this year is that investors 
however sophisticated  are their own worst enemy  We want
rational partners who truly understand our process  
 The 2009 launch will be a global market neutral fund
investing almost exclusively in equities  he added   We are
trying to develop a robust package of businesses so our hedge
funds won t use more than two or three times leverage  which may
put us with the lower volatility crowd  But that might be of
interest after what s happened   he said 
 Quant investing has attracted heavy criticism in the last 12
months  after performing poorly through the August and November
2007 sell offs  and again in January 2008  But O Shaughnessy
argued that this confused leverage with quant strategies  
  The quants were using too much leverage over too short a
time span   the optimisers they employed moved all the quants to
the same names  and then levered those names   he said   We
don t use optimisers  
 He conceded that this has been an  awful year  for OSAM  but
insisted he would be sticking to his strategy   Times like this
can rattle us as people  but they do nothing to our stock
selection methodology   he said  
 OSAM s Value Opportunities Fund is down 27 42 percent in the
10 months to end October  The Russell 3000 Value benchmark is
down 32 25 percent in the same period 
 O Shaughnessy s model is currently pushing him to overweight
healthcare stocks such as Pfizer and hold certain consumer
discretionary stocks   That may sound surprising  but we are
talking about the deep discount retailers like Costco and
Wal Mart  
 He remains underweight on energy and IT in most portfolios 
saying that these are either too richly valued  don t have
enough momentum  or don t pay a high enough dividend yield ",2008-12-05,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/forex-news/interview-update-1-o'shaughnessy-am-close-to-u.s.-sales-deal-11493,11493
220977,442493,PFE,Pfizer eyes deals to raise emerging mkts presence,news,"By John Irish
 DUBAI  June 14  Reuters    Pfizer Inc  the world s largest
drugmaker  is looking to conclude deals in emerging markets over
coming months to raise its share of a market worth an estimated
 80 billion  an executive said on Sunday 
 Pharmaceutical companies are increasingly turning their
attention to developing nations as they face tougher conditions
in more mature markets 
 The drugmaker struck a  68 billion deal in January to
acquire U S  rival Wyeth to help shore up profits and in May
signed licensing agreements with two Indian based companies 
including Aurobindo Pharma Ltd  as it seeks new growth
opportunities in generics and emerging markets 
  We will have other elements in the next few months  
Pfizer s emerging market business unit president Jean Michel
Halfon told Reuters when asked if the firm was eyeing new
acquisitions 
  We see opportunities coming from the financial crisis    
opportunities to build partnerships in emerging markets  
 Halfon declined to give further details 
 Pfizer is seeking to add  3 billion in annual sales by 2012
in developing markets and is targeting China  Brazil  Mexico 
Russia  Turkey  India and to a lesser extent the Middle East to
help lift its 4 percent market share  Halfon said 
  We start in position number three in emerging markets and
we want to be number one  
 The emerging markets pie could increase to  120 billion by
2012 with China providing the greatest growth prospects  Halfon
said 
 The group saw 28 percent growth in sales in the world s most
populous nation in the first quarter  he said 
 Pfizer  which posted  48 billion in revenue last year  faces
severe sales declines in the coming years from patent
expirations to its own products  including its blockbuster
Lipitor cholesterol treatment 
 It has responded with the purchase of Wyeth  which Halfon
said the firm was looking to complete  somewhere in the fourth
quarter   and the restructuring of its operating model around
separate units including generic drugs and emerging markets 
  We are in a very competitive environment and need to make
decisions very fast in this area  so an example of what we re
doing is managing the acquisition of Wyeth     It will add
significant revenues to our organisation in emerging markets by
adding footprint in vaccines  biological medicine     
 Halfon said he expected growth in the Middle East of about
10 12 percent over the next five years as opportunities arise
from sustained economic activity in the world s largest oil
exporting region

   Collaboration covers beta secretase inhibitors 
 
 LONDON  June 15  Reuters    Germany s Boehringer Ingelheim
has signed a deal worth up to  242 million with U S  biotech
company Vitae Pharmaceuticals to research and develop new
Alzheimer s drugs  the companies said on Monday 
 Vitae will get  42 million upfront    consisting of cash  an
equity investment and near term research funding    and will
also be eligible for  200 million in pre commercial milestone
payments  depending on the progress of products in development 
 Vitae may receive additional commercial performance payments
and royalties from Boehringer on potential future sales 
 The partners  both of which are unlisted  will be working to
develop drugs that inhibit beta secretase  an enzyme responsible
for the build up of sticky deposits  or plaques  in the brain 
 The formation of these plaques is thought to play a key role
in the development of Alzheimer s disease and several companies
are working on beta secretase inhibitors to tackle the
degenerative disorder 
 Alzheimer s is a hot area for pharmaceutical research  since
the incidence of the brain disease is rising rapidly as people
live longer  But developing effective treatments has proved
notoriously difficult 
 Existing drugs  such as Aricept from Pfizer and Eisai  can
ease symptoms but do not stop the disease

Last June  Sanofi Genzyme had announced the initiation of a phase I II study in pediatric patients with ASMD  specifically NPD B

We remind investors that olipudase alfa has been granted Breakthrough Therapy status by the FDA  The regulatory agency usually grants Breakthrough Therapy status to expedite the development and review of a candidate that is believed to have the potential to treat serious or life threatening conditions

221026,442542,PFE,Bull Of The Day  Pfizer  PFE ,opinion,"In the current uncertain market environment big pharma stocks like Pfizer  NYSE PFE     are worth a look due to their defensive nature  attractive dividend yields and solid growth opportunities  The company reported excellent results  sending estimates higher and the stock to a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  About the Company
New York based Pfizer  Inc   PFE  is a leading pharmaceutical company in the world  They have a large portfolio of products and medicines that support wellness and prevention  as well as treatment and cures for diseases across a broad range of therapeutic areas  They also have an impressive pipeline of promising new products  Pfizer had two business segments   Innovative Products and Established Products  Strong Q1 Results   Upgraded Guidance
Pfizer  PFE  reported much better than expected results for Q1  They beat both on top and bottom lines and also raised their guidance for the current year   Earnings of  0 67 per share handily beat the Zacks Consensuses Estimate of  0 55 per share  The company has an excellent history of beating estimates  having missed only once in last five years 
Revenues of  13 billion were also ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  11 9 billion  This was the six consecutive quarter of revenue growth for the company  While some of the newer products did much better than expected  results also benefitted from the easing of currency headwinds 
They now expect EPS in the range of  2 38 to  2 48  above the street consensus of  2 30  Revenue guidance of  51 billion to  53 billion was also better than analysts  estimate of  51 24 billion Betting on Growth
Pfizer had to cancel its proposed deal with Allergan  NYSE AGN pa  that would have created the biggest drug company in the world and significantly lowered the tax rate for the merged entity  in the wake of new rules to restrict US companies merging with overseas firms in order to move their headquarters to low tax countries  They now say they re not planning to pursue another tax inversion merger due to new rules 
But the company continues to look for ways to grow  Last month  they announced plans to acquire Anacor Pharmaceuticals for  5 2 billion  With this acquisition  scheduled to close next quarter  Pfizer will add experimental eczema treatment  crisaborole  to its pipeline 
Last year s acquisition of Hospira has given Pfizer a strong position in the areas of sterile injectable drugs and biosimilars 

The company has also committed a lot of resources towards the development of treatments in the fields of oncology  cardiology  metabolic disorders  neuroscience  immunology  inflammation and vaccines  They believe they can be in leading positions in these areas  
Returning Capital to Shareholders
They continue to reward shareholders through share buybacks and dividends  The current dividend yield is 3 6   The company returned about  13 1 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks in 2015  They executed a new  5 billion accelerated share buyback in March this year 
The Bottom Line 
Pfizer share are currently trading at 14 4 times forward earnings which I think is quite reasonable given their growth potential  In addition to valuation  solid dividend yield and strong growth potential make this stock an excellent pick for long term income focused investors ",2016-06-12,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bull-of-the-day:-pfizer-(pfe)-200135690,200135690

221064,442580,PFE,Anacor Pharmaceuticals Stock Shares Skyrocket On Pfizer Buyout,opinion,"Anacor Pharmaceuticals Inc  NASDAQ ANAC 
Anacor Pharmaceuticals News   Technicals

On Monday morning before the market opened  shares of Anacor Pharmaceutical  ANAC  blasted off on news that they will be acquired by Pfizer Inc   NYSE PFE  in a  5 2 billion cash deal  This equates to an ANAC share value of  92 25 after closing Friday at  64 03  a 44  jump in value  This should add great value to Pfizer s bottom line in the long run and is estimated it will start adding to earnings by 2018 with the deal closing in the third quarter of this year  ANAC is known for their eczema treatment  Crisaborole  which has performed favorably in clinical studies so far with the Food and Drug Administration  Before the buyout news  analysts had an average price target of  38 43 
Looking at the chart you will see that shares have been beaten down over the past year after peaking in the summer of 2015 at  156 93  Shares have since trended lower as shorts were able to reclaim the 200 day moving average in January with share price continuing lower before finding a base at the  60 level  a 61  tumble value  Shares are looking to pop back up around their 200 day moving average that is currently sitting at  97 36 and should stay around that price range as the buy out terms are already being priced in  There probably won t be much opportunity to trade this stock as buyouts tend to hover around the prices determined in the deal but if you re looking for a long term value play then you may want to look at Pfizer as this should help boost their bottom line in the long run which will increase the share price 
Comments Regarding Buyout

 Anacor will be a strong fit with Pfizer s innovative business  further supporting our strategic focus on Inflammation and Immunology  and is expected to enhance near term revenue growth for the innovative business   said Albert Bourla  president of Pfizer s global innovative pharma and vaccines  oncology and consumer healthcare businesses

221065,442581,PFE,Anacor Pharmaceuticals Stock Climbs After Acquisition Announcement,opinion,"Anacor Pharmaceuticals Inc  NASDAQ ANAC    Pfizer Inc   NYSE PFE  
Anacor Pharmaceuticals is having an absolutely incredible start to the trading day today  and for good reason  Early this morning  the company announced that it would be acquired by Pfizer  Today  we ll talk about the details of the acquisition  how the market reacted to the news  and what we can expect to see from ANAC moving forward  So  let s get right to it 
ANAC To Be Acquired By PFE
As mentioned above  it was announced early this morning that Anacor Pharmaceuticals will be acquired by Pfizer under a definitive merger agreement that was entered recently  Under the terms of the agreement  the deal will take place as a 100  cash transaction  PFE will be purchasing all outstanding shares of ANAC at a value of  99 25 per share  This brings the total acquisition value to about  5 2 billion  This is great news for both companies  For ANAC  the company will be receiving a heavy premium and on the PFE side  they will gain access to crisaborole  the flagship product at Anacor Pharmaceuticals  In a statement  Albert Bourla  Group President of Pfizer s Global Innovative Pharma and Global Vaccines  Oncology and Consumer Healthcare Businesses had the following to offer   

 We believe the acquisition of Anacor represents an attractive opportunity to address a significant unmet medical need for a large patient population with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis  which currently has few safe topical treatments available    Crisaborole is a differentiated asset with compelling clinical data that  if approved  has the potential to be an important first line treatment option for these patients and the physicians who treat them    Anacor will be a strong fit with Pfizer s innovative business  further supporting our strategic focus on inflammation and immunology  and is expected to enhance near term revenue growth for the innovative business  Our dedicated inflammation and immunology group has strong existing in market franchises with Enbrel and Xeljanz  as well as a robust mid stage pipeline  and this acquisition has the potential to add a near term U S  product launch  We believe we are well positioned to maximize crisaborole s commercial potential through our strong relationships with pediatricians and primary care physicians  

How The Market Reacted To The News
As investors  we know that the news moves the market  Any time there is positive news released with regard to a publicly traded company  we can expect to see gains in the value of the stock associated with the news  Not to mention  few things get investors excited quite as much as mergers and acquisitions  All in all  the news released with regard to ANAC was overwhelmingly positive  As a result  the stock is gaining big in the market today  Currently  10 05   the stock is trading at  98 95 per share after a gain of  34 92 per share or 54 54  thus far today 
What We Can Expect To See Moving Forward
Moving forward  I am expecting to see bullish activity out of both ANAC and PFE  The reality is that the acquisition is overwhelmingly positive for both  Soon  ANAC will be purchased at a rate of  99 25 per share  giving the company s stock a big boost  On the PFE side of the equation  the company will gain access to a treatment that will likely prove to be overwhelmingly profitable  All in all  this is a win win for both parties involved

Key Takeaways
The Estimize consensus is calling for earnings per share of  0 56 on  11 99 billion in revenue  1 cent higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and right in line on top
The biggest news from Pfizer this quarter has been the scrapped deal with Allergan  NYSE AGN pa  
Pfizer faces meaningful short term threats from mass genericization of key products and ongoing currency headwinds
What are you expecting for PFE  
Just weeks after the collapse of the largest deal in American history  Pfizer  PFE  is scheduled to report first quarter earnings  The deal between Pfizer and Allergan was recently scratched after new tax reforms made the takeover no longer beneficial  The fallout of the merger should have no bearing on earnings this quarter but disturbs future guidance and the psyche of investors 
For Q1  the Estimize consensus is calling for earnings per share of  0 56 on  11 99 billion in revenue  1 cent higher than Wall Street on the bottom line and right in line on top  Compared to a year earlier  profits are predicted to increase 9  while sales could rise 11   Expected growth this quarter is largely consistent with the past few quarters in which Pfizer topped expectations in 4 consecutive quarters 
Unfortunately the stock has only recently begun to trend positively  Shares are now up 8  over the last 3 months and nearly 9  in the last 30 days  During earnings season however  the stock tends to remain relatively flat 

Clearly the biggest news from Pfizer this quarter has been the scrapped deal with Allergan  The deal which was valued at over  150 billion was intended to give Pfizer a home in tax friendly Ireland but also expand its already extensive pipeline of branded products  Despite the flopped deal  Pfizer should be just fine moving forward  The company has aggressively cut costs  expanded its pipeline and signed new licensing deals to meet or beat expectations 
Within its current product suite  Lyrica has seen the most robust growth with no signs of waning  Meanwhile  Pfizer has a deep pipeline of products pending FDA approval or on the verge of hitting the market  Last quarter  the company reported 30 phase III projects to meet the needs of various conditions 
Due to the nature of pharmaceuticals  Pfizer is constantly facing threats from all sides  Genericization and currency headwinds continue to pose a risk to top line growth  Pfizer expects both of these issues to impact revenue by nearly  5 billion in fiscal 2016  Genericization has lost the company exclusive rights to key products including Liptor and Zoloft  Any pipeline setbacks would be a huge blow moving forward  That said  the most important thing to watch this Tuesday will be future guidance  and any mention of the impact of the failed Allergan deal

221091,442607,PFE,XOMA  Here s Why We re Seeing Gains,opinion,"XOMA Corporation  NASDAQ XOMA  is having an incredibly strong day in the market after reporting exceptional earnings after the closing bell yesterday  Here s what we saw from the report   
Earnings Per Share   In terms of earnings per share  XOMA produced well ahead of expectations  In the fourth quarter analysts expected that the company would produce earnings in the amount of  0 15 per share  However  they actually reported revenue in the amount of  0 21 per share  well ahead of analyst expectations 
Revenue   While earnings was overwhelmingly positive  XOMA posted one of the strongest revenue beats I ve seen ever  According to The Street  the company was expected to produce revenue in the amount of  4 01 million  However  in the quarter  the company actually produced revenue in the amount of  48 18 million  more than 12 times expectations 
As you can see from the data above  the earnings release was overwhelmingly positive  In a statement  the company had the following to say with regard to the incredible results from the quarter 

The increase in full year and fourth quarter 2015 revenues was due primarily to our licensing activity in the fourth quarter  including a  37 million upfront payment from Novartis  a  5 million upfront payment from Novo Nordisk  CO NOVOb  and a  3 8 million payment from Pfizer  NYSE PFE  

The CEO of XOMA  John Varian followed up with the statement below 

The transformation we initiated in the third quarter of last year   and now have completed in less than six months   was considerable in its scale and complexity  but essential to position XOMA to deliver our promising portfolio of endocrine assets   

How The Market Reacted To The News
As investors  we know that the news moves the market  So  it s no surprise that news of an overwhelmingly positive earnings report from XOMA would move the needle for the stock in a big way  Currently  11 12   the stock is trading at  0 93 per share after a gain of  0 04 per share or 5 06  thus far today 
What We Can Expect To See Moving Forward
Overall  I have a relatively bullish opinion of what we can expect to see from XOMA moving forward  First and foremost  I m incredibly impressed with the partners the company has been able to bring on board over the past few months  Bringing in some of the largest players on the biotechnology field will likely lead to incredible improvements in XOMA s business as a whole  On top of that  I like what I m seeing with regard to the pipeline the company currently has  At the moment  they have 3 preclinical candidates as well as one candidate in the end of Phase 1 and one candidate in the midst of Phase 2 testing  While I am a bit concerned about the company s cash flow  I believe that the positive aspects of the stock largely outweigh anything negative there is to say ",2016-03-10,Joshua Rodriguez,https://www.investing.com/analysis/xoma-corp-(xoma)-stock:-here’s-why-we’re-seeing-gains!-200121160,200121160
221092,442608,PFE,Chinese Data Lifts Europe Oil Rebounds While FOMC Under Focus Pfizer,opinion,"European markets are higher today despite the fact that Greece is dragged back in the headlines by the IMF  Investors are optimistic this morning and willing to move on after a heavy sell off  which took place last night over on Wall Street  Thanks to the Chinese Caxin services PMI number  it has assured the markets that there is hope that the Chinese economy will bounce back  The number came in ahead of expectations with a reading of 52 2 compared to a forecast of 51 4  Although  over in Japan  the expectations are building up that the Bank of Japan is not going to sit tight and let the strength of the Japanese currency undo all of their easing efforts  It is expected that the bank will intervene if we do fall below the 110 mark for the USD JPY pair 
Warnings have started to creep in about global economic growth with Christine Laggard  IMF chief  warning yesterday that she is not pleased with the reform work carried out by various countries  Reforms have been the cornerstone of her agenda and she has echoed this message over and over  However  it is the most arduous strategy to adopt for politicians  seeing that it cuts into their own flesh with respect to their political party s popularity 
The economic data out of Europe clearly highlights how meagre the performance has been in relation to reforms  especially in countries such as France and Italy  The services PMI fell back into contraction territory in France  and the adverse factory order data for Germany occupied attitudes yesterday  Expectations are not sky high today for Germany when its industrial production will hit the wire  The forecast number of  1 8  is well below the previous reading of 3 3   It may get ugly if the actual number falls below the forecast and it could deflate the euro s rally even further 
After another negative day  oil prices are looking a little firmer today as traders are willing to believe somewhat the comments coming from Kuwait  The country issued a statement which wasn t popular initially  but in bad times any good news is appreciated  Kuwait anticipates that a production freeze could take place when OPEC members meet and this is helping oil prices today  Although  oil buyers will not want to rely on such comments if purchasing over the coming days  The biggest producer within the OPEC cartel  Saudi Arabia  has clearly stated their position with respect to a production freeze  The Saudis are not willing to freeze oil production unless Iran follows suit and adopts a similar strategy 
Back in the US  it is all about the FOMC  with everyone eagerly awaiting for what they have to say  The FOMC members need to put on a united front with a clear message that confirms that they are on the same page  It is bizarre for the FOMC members not to parade their solidarity  Showing a distorted front and issuing their own agenda will only make for a muddy message 
Traders will benchmark the statement with respect to when the next rate hike could be and if the tone amid Fed members is still dovish  Certainly the Fed chair  Janet Yellen  is in no rush to make any hasty decree now  for that could result in her paying the price later  But some members on her committee do not agree with her state of mind 
In terms of stock news  Pfizer  NYSE PFE  is calling it a day with respect to their merger with Allergan  NYSE AGN pa   Allergan shareholders must be very bitter today when they were being offered the price which was substantially higher than their current market price  Nonetheless  for Pfizer the benefits audibly outweigh costs under the new law 
In terms of stock news  Pfizer is calling it a day with respect to their merger with Allergan  Allergan shareholders must be very bitter today when they were being offered the price which was substantially higher than their current market price  Nonetheless  for Pfizer the benefits audibly outweigh costs under the new law 
This is another victory for the Obama administration to stop the firms use the Smart Gates for tax avoidance  The fail merger is also a wake up call for new firms who were envisaging of using the similar strategy to fly to the tax heaven country  The new rules created by the Treasury are also going to make an impact on the banks which used to secure large sums of fees under these merger strategies  Shares for both firms have another day of volatile session ahead of them as investors will digest this news

221093,442609,PFE,Yen Bull Eyes  105,opinion,"Wednesday April 6  Five things the markets are talking about
Yesterday  global equities came under renewed pressure with investors having a plethora of reasons why to choose from  ranging from an overbought stock market  suspect earnings reports  weakening oil prices  U S  treasury department stunning the Street with new inversion rules  weaker German factory orders  a strengthening yen and an IMF Chief insisting that more government action is required to combat global  sluggishness  
Nevertheless  today the market will want to be taking its cue from the Federal Open Market Committee  FOMC  minutes  The fixed income market will be hoping to get a better idea on the timing of the next Fed rate hike  While the rest of us want a clearer understanding of what prompted the Fed to reduce the number of forecasted  dot plot  rate hikes this year from 4 to 2 in a matter of months 
1  Japanese officials clash over state of economy
With a matter weeks to go to the expected decision on second round of consumption tax hike  Japan s government continue to debate just how bad domestic current conditions are to justify postponing the increase 
Last week PM Abe indicated that his government would raise the tax rate  unless there is a Lehman type event   Overnight  opposition speakers suggest that current consumption is at its  worst level since the Lehman crisis  
The rest of the market continues to focus on the strength of the yen  outright  trading atop its November 2014 highs  110 34  and wondering how aggressive the BoJ is expected to be 
The market has been record short yen futures  and the latest dollar move has many speculating some form of intervention by the Government or BoJ  Technical analysts have eyed  110 as that breaking point 
However  according to Mr   Yen   former Minister of Finance Eisuke Sakakibara  was in charge of currency intervention   he remains more bullish on his own currency  seeing it rallying to  105 in H2 as the outlook for the world economy worsens  He said that  a climb to  105 only then is likely to prompt Japanese officials to intervene verbally to try and talk it down  while gains past  100 could see physical intervention to weaken it  

2  Global yields plummet as flight to quality dominates
Rising demand for haven assets yesterday again pushed down government debt yields 
German Bund fell to their lowest yield level in a year  trading atop of zero interest   0 09    U S  10 s reached their weakest return in two months at  1 72   while U K gilt benchmark 10 years yielded  1 34  
Downbeat German factory orders coupled with U K s Brexit referendum concerns has investors seeking sanctuary in the  big  dollar and like minded stateside assets  Other safe haven instruments  particularly gold   1 226  and yen   110 34   have also found favour with investors who are trying to preserve capital 
Government bond yields have naturally fallen sharply this year as investors continue to struggle with a world of low growth  subdued inflation  falling productivity and a high level of debt globally  The ECB and BoJ have already generated a growing pool of negative yield government bonds  intensifying investors  struggle to obtain income  JGB s continue to trade below zero   Even the Fed s cautious stance towards rate normalization has reduced the risk of U S  bond yields backing up aggressively any time soon 

3  Inversion rules stun Wall Street
The U S Treasury implemented tough new rules in Q4 to curb inversion deals   a U S company  reincorporates  overseas following the purchase of a foreign company in an attempt to benefit from lower overseas tax rates 
This week  the U S Treasury has released another set of regulations aimed at  tax inversions  that look to prevent foreign companies from acquiring multiple U S companies over a short period of time  The new rules suggest there now will be a three year limit on foreign companies acquiring U S assets to avoid ownership requirements for a later inversions deal 
Yesterday s announcement has managed to scuttle the world s largest ever health care acquisition   U S pharma giant Pfizer  NYSE PFE   160b agreement to acquire  59  of Irish firm Allergan  NYSE AGN pa  in an inversion deal  The deal would have given the New York based company a foreign address and a lower tax rate 
The break up of the deal will cost Pfizer a supposed cool   400m 

4  Equities suspend slide on oil inventory surprise
A rebound in world crude prices overnight  WTI  37 03  Brent  38 79  is helping to slow down this months global equity slide  Energy markets remain cautious after yesterday s API inventories recorded the first draw down   4 3m vs   2 6m prior  in nearly two months  Also aiding oil prices is Ecuador s President indicating that Latin America oil producers will meet on Apr 8th to discuss an oil output freeze 
To date  crude bulls have been focusing most of their attention on the April 17 Doha production meeting  Kuwait continues to express their confidence that global producers may agree to limit crude output and this despite tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia 
Data on U S  oil stocks will be closely watched this morning   Official EIA data is due at 10 30 EDT 

5  Federal Open Market Committee  FOMC  minutes
The release of the March FOMC minutes at 02 00pm EDT today could renew pressure on the  mighty  dollar  The market is hoping to get a better idea on U S rate normalization timing   last week investors were sideswiped by Fed Chair s Yellen s overtly  dovish  comments

221094,442610,PFE,iFOREX Daily Analysis   April 07  2016,opinion,"The dollar fell against most major currencies on Wednesday  pressured by minutes of the U S  Federal Reserve s meeting last month that urged for caution about future interest rate hikes  Minutes from the Fed s March policy meeting suggested that the central bank appears unlikely to raise interest rates before June due to concerns over the limited ability to tackle a global economic slowdown  The minutes showed debate over whether they might increase rates in April with  a number  of policymakers arguing that headwinds to growth would probably persist  and many urging caution about raising rates  At the meeting  the FOMC voted 9 1 to hold its benchmark Federal Funds Rate at a targeted range between 0 25 and 0 50   In contrast with the Fed  Bank of Japan policymakers will likely debate the possibility of easing further at their April 27 28 meeting  as recently downbeat economic data has failed to reinforce their expectations that a moderate economic recovery would lift inflation towards their 2 percent target  Today  The U K  is to release data on house price inflation  the European Central Bank is to publish the minutes of its latest meeting and the U S  is to publish the weekly report on initial jobless claims

221095,442611,PFE,Oil Gains  FTSE Oscillates 6200,opinion,"The FOMC minutes revealed some hawkish opposition among the members  but the majority preferred to sit on the safe  dovish side of the bench  This was not the case for Bullard  who insisted that the FOMC has reserved rights to move at any meeting  On the flip side  the majority of officials wanted to avoid sending wrong messages to the market  The dominant force in the Fed s policy making is volatility and global risks against the domestic risks of inflation and employment  In this context  the market gives nearly no probability for an April action from the Fed and thus the market now looks to sell the greenback for now 
Other drivers abound in the FX space  the pound is vulnerable to rising Brexit shenanigans but remains for now above the  1 40 level  Against the euro  it looks even more shaky with the 0 81 level already breached 
Bloomberg reported that if Britain decides to leave the European Union   a corner of the credit market may depart with it and European banks could be left having to replace as much as 108 billion euros   123 billion  of securities   JP Morgan CEO Dimon warned against the pending risks  saying that even in the best case scenario  years of uncertainty could be ahead of us 
The focus later this afternoon will be trained on Mario Draghi  Monetary policy has driven yields on government to record lows but inflation remains an issue  Likewise the recent volatility in equity markets has unnerved investors and the expected spill over effects of QE has not benefited European indices all that much 
A divided Fed for sure but investors seem to have taken the minutes as positive for risk assets  The big 4 5m barrel draws in oil inventory data from both the API and EIA yesterday was the real precursor to upside action though  As stated many times this year  equities are at the mercy of oil prices so any positive sign that the supply glut is diminishing is taken as a beacon of light  We still have the April meeting in Doha to contend with so we can still expect a degree of choppiness in the oil market in the run up that will no doubt make its mark on risk sentiment

Analysis   commentary  The decline in Energy estimates continues to be nothing short of tragic  I was having lunch with a client last week  who works at a large bank  and the regulators came through the bank and told the institution to write their energy loans down  whether they were performing or not  Shades of 2008 i e   you will take this equity whether you want it or not  
For full year 2016  HealthCare and Consumer Discretionary  still show the best growth  but the Financial sector for the next 11 months looks far better than the rapid drop for Q4  16 
There are places to hide in this market and it may be last year s losers 
I still think the US dollar weakening will help take some immediate pressure off the SP 500  Today  the US dollar index dropped again  Technology and Industrial s should be the immediate beneficiaries of a weaker dollar

221103,442619,PFE,Pfizer Obeys The Elliott Wave Rules,opinion,"Do you remember  Black Monday   It was August 24th  2015  when most stocks  including Pfizer Inc   N PFE   saw their worst sell off in four years  And while the majority of traders and investors were caught completely off guard by this swift and sharp decline  to Elliott Wave analysts there was nothing surprising about it  as  proves  However  the purpose of this article  published on October 4th  2015  was not only to demonstrate the Elliott Wave Principle s ability to warn you about an upcoming market crash  but also to make another prediction about Pfizer Inc  s stock prices  See it on the chart below 
According to the theory  markets moves in repetitive patterns  called  waves   Five waves in the direction of the larger trend are followed by three waves against it  The five wave sequence forms a larger pattern  knows as an  impulse   while the three wave move is a correction  usually marked with A B C  As the chart above shows  Pfizer s impulse was over at  36 43  That is the starting point of the corrective phase of the 5 3 cycle  So  through the perspective of the Wave Principle  the so called  Black Monday  was nothing more than a natural wave A  part of a larger A B C corrective pull back  In other words  waves B up and C down were still left  so more weakness could have been expected in Pfizer  The next chart shows how the stock looks like today 

The deceptive wave B has probably caused a lot of optimism within the lines of the bulls  It almost reached the top of wave V of the impulse  climbing as high as  36 04  Despite wave B s false strength  wave C was still supposed to take prices below the bottom of wave A  Which it did on February 8th  2016  when the stock fell to as low as  28 23  24 cents per share lower than the bottom of wave A at  28 47  The only thing we could not predict was the time factor  We did not expect Pfizer s A B C correction to develop that fast  But in technical analysis  where  prices are headed is far more important than  when  are they going to get there 
From now on  it appears wave C still has some room to evolve  It may force Pfizer below the  28 mark  but the support of wave IV is supposed to put the bears  ambitions to rest  Once wave C is over  the requirement for a pull back of minimum three legs would be fulfilled and a new recovery could be anticipated ",2016-03-01,EWM Interactive,https://www.investing.com/analysis/pfizer-obeys-the-elliott-wave-rules-200119967,200119967
221113,442629,PFE,The Closing Of The Global Economy,opinion,"I don t often write about global geopolitics because I think  in general  investors spend too much time worrying about things they can t control or aren t going to happen or wouldn t matter much if they did  The best example is the Middle East which has been a mess my entire life and long before it for that matter  Changing your investments based on the latest threat in or from the Levant is a recipe for constant chaos  The only accurate prediction about the Middle East will always be that the various factions that have been fighting for centuries will continue to fight  And that no matter who is in charge they will have to sell oil to make ends meet  And make no mistake oil is the only economic reason we care about the region 
The recent Paris attacks  though  have me thinking more about how global geopolitics is affecting the global economy  The terrorist attacks Europe has experienced in Madrid  London  Paris and other locales are raising old barriers across the continent  Borders where goods  people and capital have crossed freely for the last few decades are now manned and monitored again  Capital largely continues to flow freely but people and goods are starting to be restricted  you can t restrict the flow of people without also obstructing the flow of goods  For now  the people and goods continue to flow  just more slowly  One can t help but think though that if the borders become literal barriers again it won t be long before the metaphoric ones   protectionist policies   return as well 
If one also considers the antipathy toward Germany that permeates most of Europe and the perception   and reality to some degree   that the EU and especially the EMU are much more favorable for the Teutonic members than the Latin ones  then one begins to see how the fragile union might devolve into its former squabbling  fractured self  The feared break up of Europe and the Euro has until now been based on economic considerations but physical security would seem a larger concern at this point  If the EU can t guarantee physical security and has already failed at providing economic security  it s raison d etre is  what exactly  To provide employment for feckless bureaucrats 
The desire for physical security isn t confined to Europe obviously  the Paris attacks have amped up the political debate in the US over immigration  with Syrian refugees and physical security now replacing Latin Americans and economic security as the targets  The emergence of Donald Trump as a right wing populist to challenge the near universally populist Democrats means that both parties are now pandering to the population s baser instincts of fear and greed  That isn t to say that their fears aren t real or legitimate just that the solutions offered by populist politicians are simplistic and unlikely to achieve the intended results  Indeed  history says that walling ourselves off from the world is more likely to create less security  physical and economic  rather than more 
The demonization of foreigners  this emerging isolationist consensus   a natural response in many ways to the jingoism of the last decade s Western governments   is not confined to the debate over national defense or immigration  It is also a part of the economic debate  Politicians exploit our economic insecurities  laying blame on foreigners   the Chinese are the most often cited bogeymen   for problems created by our own policies  Donald Trump says he will be a tougher negotiator and get better trade deals but doing so will require threatening consequences   trade restrictions   that would please Smoot and Hawley and potentially repeat the mistakes that led to the Great Depression  Jack Lew decries corporate inversions and announces new rules designed to prevent US companies from doing what our corporate tax code incentivizes them to do  Meanwhile  Pfizer Inc  N PFE  and Allergan  N AGN pa  look to structure a deal that has Allergan   an Irish corporation with a low tax rate and the smaller of the two companies   playing the role of acquirer to avoid the new rules  Will the current administration or future ones regularly reject takeovers of US corporations unless they are carried out by other US corporations  Will other countries follow suit 
The inequality debate is rooted too in the discussion over trade policy  globalization and outsourcing  The decline of the American middle class  the rise of the so called creative class and the consequences of the financialization of the US economy are all part of the same populist  isolationist rhetoric  Foreigners are demonized as stealing American manufacturing jobs  polarizing the US between the haves  largely in the coastal cities  who benefit from free trade and the have nots  largely in the interior of the country  who don t  It mostly isn t true   productivity has reduced manufacturing employment much more than free trade   but it has enough of a whiff of truth that it works as a political strategy even if it would fail miserably as an economic one  Monetary policy has attempted to assuage the middle class angst with expanded credit but that has exacerbated the divide as financial engineers have been rewarded at the expense of real ones 
We see this nationalistic impulse in the so called currency wars  the devaluations intended to steal some of what is left of global growth for one s own country  Rather than pursue domestic policies that would improve growth  politicians are happy to leave it to central banks to try and gain a trade advantage by weakening the national currency  seeking to enrich through impoverishment  a policy doomed to failure  The unintended consequences are reflected in money markets where conditions once thought impossible or at least illogical have become commonplace  In the process of trying to recover from the last crisis we are creating the conditions for the next 
Meanwhile  global trade is contracting  down for three years in a row and a major reason for the weak recovery from the last recession  The growth and falling inflation of the 90s was  in a lot of ways  driven by the expansion of trade  the liberalization of the global economy as former communist nations adopted more liberal  free market economic policies and joined the world trade order  That expansion appears to now be reversing in a cacophony of nativist rhetoric  a global phenomenon that encompasses  unites and animates the far left and the far right  As I said in my 

The political left is happy to see people cross borders but would gladly restrict the flow of capital and goods  The political right is happy to see capital and goods cross borders but would gladly build a fence to restrict the flow of people  I m afraid that the compromise might be to restrict people  capital and goods 

This political pandering has consequences for our society and economy that are hard to predict  The recent college campus protests would appear to be another manifestation of this growing desire for security over all else  Students want to create  safe spaces  where they are free to extend their childhood  protected from harm both real and imagined  With the random violence and economic upheaval that has marked their lives  from 9 11 to Madrid to London to Paris to the dot com bust to the Great Recession  is it any wonder that our young adults seek to be protected from the real world  The intolerance practiced by our leaders is reflected in the intolerance of the students who shout down anyone who doesn t toe the politically correct line  a feat that becomes harder by the day  We have lost the ability to take a joke  to distinguish between satire and seriousness  In the process  we divide rather than unite  for fear of offending and being subjected to the modern day pillory of social media 
As I said at the beginning  I don t generally spend a lot of time thinking about geopolitics as it relates to investing because it isn t generally profitable  This closing of the global economy  this emerging trend toward protectionism in the form of currency devaluation and populist politics is already impacting the global economy but in the short term probably shouldn t impact our investment approach  We don t know yet how far this will be taken  if the rhetoric will turn into actual economy damaging policies  For now  the most obvious impact has been the rising dollar and falling inflation expectations with  so far  little impact on real growth expectations here in the US  But the direction is disturbing especially with the US coming into an election year when the rhetoric may have more impact on market outcomes 
As investors we have more immediate concerns  Growth remains stuck at the secular stagnation  new normal pace of 2 to 2 5  growth  The economic data continues to point to weakness even as the Fed prepares to enter a tightening cycle  Inventories are building as sales and investment stagnate  The energy industry  responsible for an historically large proportion of investment since the crisis  is in deep trouble as the dollar rises and oil prices sink  Earnings are falling and margins appear to have peaked  Stock market valuations are extreme and market technicals are unhealthy with a small number of stocks leading the averages higher even as most stocks head south  Investors have plenty to worry about that is real and now without delving into what is speculative and possibly far in the future 
The closing of the global economy  the reversal to some unknown degree of the globalization process  has negative consequences for the lives to which we ve become accustomed  Much of the disinflation since the early 90s is a direct result of increased trade and reversing the process will in time mean less choice and higher prices for Americans  And no  it won t  despite what the protectionist populists would have you believe  bring back high wage manufacturing jobs  The giant sucking sound Ross Perot warned about isn t coming from Mexico but rather from Silicon Valley and we should be thankful for it not ruing it  We should be preparing our young adults for the real world and the jobs of this century rather than coddling them and trying to bring back the jobs of the last one  The closing of the global economy is not a fait accompli  But we will have to resist with all our might the siren song of the politicians who tell us what we want rather than need to hear and push back against the monetary policies that are a poor substitute for better fiscal and regulatory policies ",2015-11-23,"Alhambra Investment Partners, LLC",https://www.investing.com/analysis/the-closing-of-the-global-economy-272171,272171

221116,442632,PFE,Of Rotten Apples And Rotten Systems,opinion,"Martin Shkreli  the former hedge fund manager turned pharmaceutical CEO who was arrested last week  has been described as a sociopath and worse 
In reality  he s a brasher and larger version of what others in finance and corporate suites do all the time 
Federal prosecutors are charging him with conning wealthy investors 
Lying to investors is illegal  of course  but it s perfectly normal to use hype to lure rich investors into hedge funds  And the line between the two isn t always distinct 
Hedge funds are lightly regulated on the assumption that investors are sophisticated and can take care of themselves 
 prosecutors went after Shkreli because they couldn t nail him for his escapades as a pharmaceutical executive  which were completely legal   although vile 
Shkreli took over a company with the rights to a 62 year old drug used to treat toxoplasmosis  a devastating parasitic infection that can cause brain damage in babies and people with AIDS  He then promptly raised its price from  13 50 to  750 a pill 
When the media and politicians went after him  Shkreli was defiant  saying  our shareholders expect us to make as much as money as possible   He said he wished he had raised the price even higher 
That was too much even for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America  Big Pharma s trade group  which complained indignantly that Shkreli s company was just an investment vehicle  masquerading  as a pharmaceutical company 
Maybe Big Pharma doesn t want to admit most pharmaceutical companies have become investment vehicles  If they didn t deliver for their investors they d be taken over by  activist  investors and private equity partners who would 
The hypocrisy is stunning  Just three years ago  Forbes Magazine Shkreli as one of its  30 under 30 in Finance  who was  battling billionaires and entrenched drug industry executives  
Last month  Shkreli got control of a company with rights to a cheap drug used for decades to treat  in Latin America  His aim was to get the drug approved in the United States and charge tens of thousands of dollars for a course of treatment 
Investors who backed Shkreli in this venture did well  The company s share price initially shot up from under  2 to more than  40 
While other pharmaceutical companies don t raise their drug prices fiftyfold in one fell swoop  as did Shkreli  they would if they thought it would lead to fat profits 
Most have been increasing their prices more than 10 percent a year   still far faster than inflation   on drugs used on common diseases like cancer  high cholesterol  and diabetes 
This has imposed a far bigger burden on health spending than Shkreli s escapades  making it much harder for Americans to pay for drugs they need  Even if they re insured  most people are paying out big sums in co payments and deductibles 
Not to mention the impact on private insurers  Medicare  state Medicaid  prisons and the Veterans Health Administration 
And the prices of new drugs are sky high  Pfizer s  N PFE  new one to treat advanced breast cancer costs  9 850 a month 
According to an analysis by the Wall Street Journal  that price isn t based on manufacturing or research costs 
Instead  Pfizer set the price as high as possible without pushing doctors and insurers toward alternative drugs 
But don t all profit maximizing firms set prices as high as they can without pushing customers toward alternatives 
Unlike most other countries  the United States doesn t control drug prices  It leaves pricing up to the market 
Which enables drug companies to charge as much as the market will bear 
So what  exactly  did Martin Shkreli do wrong  by the standards of today s capitalism 
He played the same game many others are playing on Wall Street and in corporate suites  He was just more audacious about it 
It s easy to go after bad guys  much harder to go after bad systems 
Hedge fund managers  for example  make big gains from trading on insider information  That robs small investors who aren t privy to the information 
But it s not illegal unless a trader knows the leaker was compensated   a looser standard than in any other advanced country 
Meanwhile  the pharmaceutical industry is making a fortune off average Americans  who are paying more for the drugs they need than the citizens of any other advanced country 
That s largely because Big Pharma has wielded its political influence to avoid cost controls  to ban Medicare from using its bargaining clout to negotiate lower prices  and to allow drug companies to pay the makers of generic drugs to delay their cheaper versions 
Shkreli may be a rotten apple  But hedge funds and the pharmaceutical industry are two rotten systems that are costing Americans a bundle ",2015-12-22,Robert B. Reich,https://www.investing.com/analysis/of-rotten-apples-and-rotten-systems-376606,376606

221128,442644,PFE,Oppenheimer Weighs In On Biotech Stocks  OPK  OVAS,opinion,"of Oppenheimer rates stocks in the biotechnology sector and is one of the top 25 analysts rated on TipRanks  Yesterday  Vanjani made two news ratings for Opko Health Inc  NYSE OPK  and Ovascience Inc  NASDAQ OVAS  
Vanjani maintained a Perform rating on Opko Health Inc though he did not provide a price target  The pharmaceutical and diagnostic company posted first quarter earnings on May 11  reporting consolidated revenue of  30 1 million  higher than Vanjani s estimate of  20 4 million  However  Opko reported a net loss of  117 1 million for the quarter compared to a net loss of  44 6 million in the same quarter of last year  The company also posted a loss of   0 26  per share  compared to   0 11  in the same quarter of last year 
Opko beat Vanjani s revenue estimate thanks to a collaboration deal with Pfizer Inc  NYSE PFE   which resulted in a  295 million upfront payment  Vanjani commented   Shares of OPKO have traded flattish in the current quarter  We believe the recent EirGen acquisition was incrementally positive and could provide a small catalyst   referring to Opko s acquisition of the specialty pharmaceutical company  The analyst continued   OPKO paid roughly  135M in cash and stock for an asset that potentially provides manufacturing capabilities for vertical integration  tax incentives  existing revenue and cash flow  as well as pipeline products  We should begin to see the benefit of EirGen in the revenue line beginning in 2Q15  
Rohit Vanjani has rated Opko health 10 times since May 2014  earning a 100  success rate recommending the stock with a  69 2  average return per OPK rating 
The analyst also provided a rating on OvaScience yesterday after the biopharmaceutical company released first quarter earnings on May 11 
Vanjani maintained an Outperform rating on the stock with a  60 price target  
The fertility company was happy to announce that the first baby had been born using the Augment treatment  Augment is OvaScience s therapy to improve the health of eggs in women undergoing in vitro fertilization 
OvaScience posted a net loss for the quarter of  17 2 million  or   0 65  per share compared to a net loss of  7 8 million and   0 41  in the same quarter a year prior  Aside from revenue  Vanjani believes it is more important to focus on the future of Augment  He explained   OvaScience maintained its guidance for 1 000 cycles in 2015  which we view as positive  
Although Vanjani usually makes cunning recommendations in the biotechnology sector  he is not always accurate rating OvaScience  Vanjani has rated OvaScience 14 times since May 2014  earning only a 20  success rate earning the stock with an average loss of  6 2  per rating  However  most analysts agree with this latest rating as the top analyst consensus for OvaScience on TipRanks is Strong Buy Overall  Vanjani has a 73  success rate recommending stocks with a  35 2  average return per rating ",2015-05-13,Sarah Roden,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/oppenheimer-weighs-in-on-biotech-stocks:-opko-health-inc.-(opk),-ovascie-251663",251663
221129,442645,PFE,Delivering Alpha Highlights  Part 2,opinion,"Surely John Paulson s discussion of merger arb with Melissa Lee counts as one of the highlights of this year s Delivering Alpha conference 
In part  it became a highlight through the luck of timing  that is  breaking news on the subject  21st Century Fox had just offered to take over Time Warner  NYSE TWX   bidding  80 billion  Time Warner has also immediately rejected the offer  but in the view of the market  the fact of such an offer puts the company in play 
A common pattern in such cases is that the offerer s equity falls in value in the wake of the offer  and the target s equity rises  That isn t what happened in this instance  exactly  Yes  on the side of the target matters played according to Hoyle  TWX spent the day Wednesday  the 15  climbing from  90 06 to  90 60  then it leaped above  91 overnight 
Meanwhile  though  FOX  TA FOX  opened Wednesday at  33 12  and  after a day of wild hour by hour swings  settled down at the same place at end of day  Thursday  though  was when it discovered what the market thought of the idea of its acquisition of Time Warner   it spent most of the day above  33 40 
At the conference  Melissa Lee began the interview by congratulating Paulson on the 20th anniversary of Paulson   Co  She observed that it  started off as an arb shop  though it has since expanded its scope 
Drivers of Activity
Paulson accepted the congratulations  and launched into a discussion of the three factors driving mergers and acquisitions activity today  low interest rates  record equity valuations  these two factors together mean that companies can use either stock swaps or borrowed cash or a combination of the two  in acquiring one another   and  finally  the degree to which acquisitions have become necessary for executives in their own self defense  the executives of a company that isn t business making deals will find that  they themselves have become a takeover target   Paulson called this the  accretive  nature of takeovers 
As to the Fox deal  Paulson didn t want to predict how matters will play out  He spoke in general terms  though  about how he and his associates analyze such a deal  especially when the initial bid is rebuffed and the prospect of a hostile takeover fight has arisen 
There are of course risks  Any piker can say  aha  This will cause a rise in the value of the target  and rush in to try to ride that  But the pikers might get in only after most of the spike has happened already  ad just in time to take the other side of the roller coaster ride  the one that gets scary when the initial bidder backs away 
Paulson alluded to the Pfizer  NYSE PFE  bid for AstraZeneca  NYSE AZN  a little more than a year ago  Speculators who bought in before Pfizer backed away lost money  On Friday  May 16  2014  AZN stock closed at  80 28  after an intraday high of  81 19   the next business day s close   70 64  That s a one day loss of 12  
In the hope of avoiding such a loss  Paulson assured Lee  he will look closely at the 21st Century Time Warner deal 
One consideration is that this bid doesn t lend itself to the prospect of a rapid fire auction  such as one can get where two very larger bidders emerge for a single company that is of strategic value to both of them but has a low capitalization before put in play  The this case  the bidder and the target are roughly the same size  so on the one hand  there s a limit to how much cash you can pay  and on the other  there s also a limit to how much stock you  21st Century  can provide before it becomes diluted   
Valeant Allergan
On the Valeant Allergan matter  Paulson   Co  has a stake in Allergan  NYSE AGN pa   which is almost inevitably identified as  the maker of Botox   It should be noted  Allergan has other products as well  some well known  such as Restasis  a treatment for dry eye syndrome  and Juv derm  an injectable anti wrinkle gel   Still  Botox is the blockbuster  Heck  the late Joan Rivers  comedy legend  titled a chapter in her memoir   Botox  Baby  
Paulson   Co  has a stake in Allergan so it has obviously not escaped John Paulson s attention that Valeant wants to buy it 
Ms  Lee observed that a traditional merger arb play aims at making the spread  then exiting the position once is deal is completed  Paulson suggested that that wasn t what he was aiming at here   In many situations today you can make far more than the spread by holding on to the acquirer s stock after the transaction is completed   Valeant Allergan is a case in point  because Valeant  is a very serious acquirer Mike Pearson  LONDON PSON  is very cost conscious  
What Paulson expects is that Valeant will acquire Allergan and reduce costs to such a point that it will be 25  accretive to Valeant s EPS  If one presumes that Valeant s stock will rise by the same amount  then Allergan  prior to an acquisition by a stock and cash offer is worth  as much as  2 20 a share  
If Paulson were aiming for the spread in this situation  he d be aiming for a gain of  1 72 a share  But since his best is on Valeant s ability to attain cost synergies  his goal is as much as  2 22 per share ",2015-07-21,AllAboutAlpha,https://www.investing.com/analysis/delivering-alpha-highlights:-part-two-258924,258924

221162,442678,PFE,Maybe Pfizer s Third Offer Won t Be Their Last ,opinion,"Last month  analysts predicted that Pfizer Inc  NYSE PFE  had to beat  100 billion if it wanted to get its hands on Britain s Astrazeneca  ST AZN   Well  its second proposal was turned down  As of April 30  the markets responded well to Pfizer  as it reigned as one of the S P 500 s best performers  At that point  AstraZeneca s U K  listed shares had jumped nearly 15  since Pfizer s interest made headlines 
Now  fast forwarding to PFE s most recent  third  proposal  On May 19  AZN rejected the  117 billion offer  as well  claiming that it still fell short of the company s value  That day  the company s shares fell as much as 15  intraday in London trading 
They say that  third time s the charm   Well  I guess in this case  Pfizer is all out of luck 

No Coming Back
What would have merged into the world s largest drugs company is now nothing more than an evaporating thought  Pfizer has officially given up on buying AZN  no last minute offers  no nothing 
Just a cooling off period  required by British rules  At the end of the day  the deal was politically charged  Pfizer was already given the courtesy of a conveniently reduced tax bill  But  you see  the numbers just didn t add up  Pfizer spent over  250 billion on takeovers  over the past 10 years   Yet  it s now worth  185 billion  So  AstraZeneca probably kept its shareholders  best long term interests in mind  according to CMC s Michael Hewson 
After this cooling off period  there s a slight  and we mean slight  possibility that  after three months  AZN could contact PFE  or vice versa  after six months   AstraZeneca s shares fell 2  as markets opened this morning  This share drop  coupled with shareholder pushback  could be enough to persuade AZN s mind over the next three months  Jeremy Batstone Carr of Charles Stanley argues that it ll be  a big issue now  I think  for AstraZeneca to convince shareholders that  55 per share was undervaluing their business  

The Bottom Line
It s apparent that Pfizer and AstraZeneca wanted different things  While PFE had its eye on many cancer medicines  AZN wanted to focus solely on growth as an independent company  Some say politicians in Britain  the United States and Sweden opposed the transaction  afraid that thousands would lose their jobs 
But in all honesty  the deal fell through because of the bottom line dollar  AstraZeneca wanted  at minimum   58 per share  And the  55 offer didn t cut it 
For now  Swiss firm  Novartis N  NYSE NVS   reigns as the world s largest drugmaker   that s only if AZN refuses to budge in the next three or six months ",2014-05-28,Louis Basenese,https://www.investing.com/analysis/maybe-pfizer’s-third-offer-won’t-be-their-last-214210,214210
221163,442679,PFE,Dollar Mostly Bid  Sterling and Kiwi Offered,opinion,"The US dollar remains firm against most of the major and active emerging market currencies  The euro and yen have thus far remained confined to yesterday s ranges  while sterling saw yesterday s losses extended  following yesterday s reversal  US 10 year Treasury yields have pushed back below 2 5   which seems to cap the dollar near JPY102  Better than expected Norwegian retail sales  0 5  vs  0 3  consensus  helped the krone resist the dollar bid 
 
The most important data  however  was the euro area money supply figures  M3 grew by less than 1  in April  0 8    which is the slowest since September 2010  The March pace was revised to 1 0  from 1 1   The consensus was for an unchanged reading  Credit to the private sector continued to contract as it has for the past two years  The pace moderated however  to  1 8  from  2 2   The report is not going to change anyone s view about the outcome of next week s ECB meeting 
 
Separately  there were three other pieces of the macroeconomic picture that the market received today  and they were all unexpected  First  German unemployment rose by 24k in May  The consensus was for a 15k decline  Second  it was reported that household consumption fell 0 3  in April  The Bloomberg consensus was for a 0 5  gain  The March data was revised a bit higher  0 6  from 0 4    but not enough to take the sting out of the disappointment  And third   
 
Third  Spain s positive data stream continued with April retail sales jumping 0 7  year over year  The market had a flat report after a  0 5  reading in March  Separately  Spain reported mortgage lending was up 16  in March year over year  a reversal from the 11 6  contraction in February and the highest reading since early 2007 
 
Taken together  the picture is fairly consistent with what investors have already come to appreciate  The German economic engine has begun moderating after a strong Q1  The French economy continues to struggle to sustain any meaningful momentum  The Spanish economy is leading the periphery 
 
Spain and Italy s bond and stock markets are performing well  extending recent gains  Over the past five sessions  Spain s 10 year yield is off 17 bp and Italy s is off 23 bp  with both pushing below the 3  threshold  Italian and Spanish shares are the strongest of the major bourses in Europe  Over the past five sessions  those bourses are up 4 6  and 2 0  respectively  Yet the euro itself is not finding much traction  as speculators appear to be moving to the sidelines ahead of the ECB meeting  where great uncertainty continues shroud next week s big event  The  1 3640 area is now resistance  Support is seen  1 3600 10  A break of that would target the  1 3520 45 band 
 
Sterling has underperformed in recent days  The Pfizer  NYSE PFE  Astrazeneca  NYSE AZN  cooling off period  GBP60 bln deal   may have weighed on sentiment  and there is some talk of euro demand against sterling related to month end  Sterling was already on its back foot when the CBI disappointed with a distributive trades  retail sales  report showing a  16 balance in May after  30 in April  The consensus had looked for improvement  The forward looking indicators also softened  With the  1 6770 level now violated  the next target is  1 6720  Euro resistance against sterling is seen near GBP0 8160 
 
 
The New Zealand dollar is the weakest of the majors  off about 0 75   sterling is second with a loss of about 0 25  near midday in London  The Kiwi initially firmed in response to the Fonterra auction  which set a payout of NZD 7 0  per kilo  for 2014 15 and cut the payout for the current period by 25 cents to NZD 8 40  New Zealand appears to be producing more milk than can be absorbed presently  and this appears to be the main reason for the 23  slide in whole milk powder prices over the 3 5 months  The market consensus is for the RBNZ to continue its tightening cycle with a hike in June  Indicative prices suggest another hike in July is largely anticipated  but there is where we think the market may be a bit ahead of itself 
 
 
There are no US economic reports of consequence today  and no Fed officials scheduled to speak  Tomorrow the US reports its second estimate of Q1 GDP  It is widely expected to be revised lower from the initial 0 1  pace  The Bloomberg consensus is for a 0 5  contraction  but risk is to the downside  It may not matter much for investors  as the news is old and the more recent news is that the US economy is recovering smartly in the current quarter   3 0    However  when the Fed updates its forecasts next month  the poor performance in Q1 will likely see officials revise down their 2014 forecasts  This is likely to be a simple accounting function rather than a less optimistic outlook ",2014-05-28,Marc Chandler,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/dollar-mostly-bid,-sterling-and-kiwi-offered-214221",214221
221164,442680,PFE,AcelRx Likley To Receive FDA Approval Shortly,opinion,"Summary
AcelRx develops Zalviso to treat acute and breakthrough pain 
We believe there is a 90  chance the company receives FDA approval on July 27 
Zalviso has several advantages over intravenous delivery methods 
Obamacare and favorable product pricing should benefit the company in the long term 
Written by Kyle Dennis  AcelRx  NASDAQ ACRX  has been one of our favorite companies over the last two years  which we have written on a few times during that period  AcelRx develops therapies for acute and breakthrough pain that help solve the problems patients have with intravenous delivery systems  The 2H of 2014 should be an inflection point for the company as its product Zalviso is expecting an approval decision from the Food and Drug Administration  FDA  July 27 
Technology  ZALVISO Sublingual Sufentanil Nanotab System
AcelRx is developing Zalviso  which is designed to address intravenous patient controlled analgesia  IV PCA  problems  which can cause harm following surgery  Zalviso uses an already approved generic FDA pain medication called sufentanil  Usually sufentanil is delivered intravenously with infusion pumps  which can cause infections  dosing errors  and irregular gaps in treatment  Zalviso uses NanoTab technology to deliver a high dosage of sufentanil underneath the tongue  This delivery method eliminates the complications of an IV  increases the drug s efficacy  and provides patients and doctors with a safer treatment  Top line data from the final pivotal trial treating pain after knee or hip surgery was  of 2013 and highlighted many benefits  Some Doctor and Patient Benefits 
Patients experienced better  longer lasting  and more complete pain relief after orthopedic surgery 
Nurses reported that it was much easier to use the Nanotab system 
Traditional IV PCA is known for its confusing administering program and Zalviso avoids this problem 
Increased mobility in the hospital 
Decreased chance of IV related infections 
Political pressure and the opioid market
The FDA has been under pressure recently because opioid abuse is becoming a growing problem   the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC  declared prescription drug abuse to be an epidemic   of this year  the FDA announced stronger warning labels for all extended released opioids  The continued social pressure has negatively affected several small cap companies  while leaving others with opportunity  Because of this pressure  the FDA has been more apt to approve drugs that tackle this issue head on  AcelRx should benefit from this because it is improving the delivery system of approved drugs Zalviso should provide a safer  more effective  and a more cost effective solution with higher quality of care  BioDelivery Sciences International  NASDAQ BDSI  is a company that recently benefitted from the recent trends  BioDelivery develops several drugs that are in late stages of clinical trials in the pain and opioid dependence marketplace  The company recently received FDA approval for Bunavail  which delivers Subxone  buprenorphine naloxone sublingual film  as a therapy for opioid dependence  Subxone was approved by the FDA in 2002 and has been very successful  generating  1 4B in sales in 2013  BioDelivery is hoping to gain a share of that market using its BEMA  BioErodible MucoAdhesive  technology  BEMA technology delivers drugs using a bio erodible film across a mucous membrane  The film adheres to an oral mucosa membrane in about five seconds and takes fifteen to thirty minutes to dissolve  The BEMA platform has been proven to work  since the company already has received approval for its other product  Onsolis  BioDelivery recently  on June 6  BioDelivery s platform has been shown to be safer and more effective which is certainly what Obamacare aims for in part  BioDelivery is similar to AcelRx in that both companies are improving the delivery method for drugs that have been approved by the FDA and have a strong safety profile  Recently  Zogenix  NASDAQ ZGNX  has been in the news regarding its FDA approved drug Zohydro  Since the drug s approval last October  Zohydro has been under scrutiny by many physicians  as some are calling Zohydro    because it is a pure hydrocodone  and not a mix of Tylenol 3 and hydrocodone  Subsequently  some physicians have been encouraging the FDA to rescind its approval  Additionally  there were bills drawn by the House and the Senate to recommending the FDA reverse its decision  However  proponents of the drug agree with the FDA and believe Zohydro serves a great purpose for a subset of pain patients who suffer from unbearable pain that the currently available opioids cannot effectively treat  We tend to agree with Zohydro proponents and feel the FDA was correct in approving Zohydro  Additionally Durect Coproration  NASDAQ DRRX  and Pain Therapeutics  NASDAQ PTIE  are two partnered companies that have also been in the news regarding its chronic pain drug  The companies are developing Remoxy  which is a sustained release oral gel cap of oxycodone  The companies are also partnered with Pfizer  NYSE PFE   who is handling most of the development  The FDA has rejected Remoxy multiple times to date  and the organization is now asking for additional studies to be conducted before the companies can resubmit the NDA  As a result  the companies are currently conducting a Phase I safety study on the potential abuse factor  The FDA did not require any additional efficacy studies  but obviously was concerned with identifying any other potential safety issues with the drug 
Catalyst  Drug Approval Decision on July 27  2014
AcelRx  in December 2013 that the FDA accepted the NDA for Zalviso and set a   PDUFA  date for July 27  2014  This date is extremely important for the company because it will be its first approved product and the first revenue generator for the company  We believe there is a high chance that Zalviso receives approval because of the strong Phase III trial results  Since AcelRx is using an already approved drug  this significantly de risks the event  Additionally  the FDA has been highly focused on approving treatments that improve patient safety  From the Phase III trial results we can see that patients experienced better safety and better efficacy profiles  We give a 90  chance for approval  with the only wild card being a CRL for manufacturing  However  given that the company has experienced management and board members  we think this chance is relatively low  The company began partnering and preparing to commercialize Zalviso worldwide over 7 months ago  Recently   to prepare for commercialization  Although there is never a guarantee for approval  these signs are very positive and show the company is well prepared to market Zalviso  unlike many developmental companies who prepare poorly by not hiring the needed personal 
Zalviso Economics and Obamacare
When it comes down to it  the most important aspect of a biotechnology company is the profits  Zalviso is poised to take a significant share of the acute pain market because it is not only safer  but also more cost effective  The company recently published a   The study concluded that it would cost between  200  240 for two days of post surgical IV PCA s  Zalviso has been projected as low as  140  Additionally  Zalviso avoids the high cost of IV infections or other complications  Since  Obamacare  is beginning to further subsidize the healthcare system  the FDA and insurance companies favor more cost effective treatments  This bodes well not only for approval  but also for its long term commercial success  Cost effectiveness and quality of care are important as Obamacare seeks to cut down on the volume of patients in hospitals  Zalviso is certainly a product that can help hospitals achieve this goal  Hospitals that comply by cutting down on patient volume and improve patient satisfaction are eligible to  under Obamacare 
Chart

Based on the chart above  we think the stock price has a good chance here to see the mid  12 range  We have marked on the top of the chart in white a cup and handle formation in the chart  that is normally a very bullish sign  Additionally  we have also marked with the bottom white line a double bottom type pattern that shows up as a  W  in the chart  also bullish  Also  when considering the risk on market condition  with markets exceeding all time highs  along with Zalviso having a strong chance at approval  we think the 52 week high of  13 64 is possible here 
Conclusion
We believe July 27 is an inflection point for the company and that Zalviso will be approved that day  Given the strong trial results and political situation  we think the chances of approval are very high  On the rare chance the FDA rejected Zalviso  the stock price would likely be cut in half  We are also bullish on AcelRx management and are confident in the company s ability to market the product  Zalviso may not be a blockbuster drug or a revolutionary treatment  but it is a drug that should help provide significant revenue to grow this small cap company  We believe AcelRx can reach 52 week highs in the near term  and could see its valuation much higher in the longer term considering the advantages a product like Zalviso can enjoy under the new healthcare changes that Obamacare implements       This article is intended for informational and entertainment use only  and should not be construed as professional investment advice  They are my opinions only  Trading stocks is risky   always be sure to know and understand your risk tolerance  You can incur substantial financial losses in any trade or investment  Always do your own due diligence before buying and selling any stock  and or consult with a licensed financial adviser ",2014-07-02,Scott Matusow,https://www.investing.com/analysis/acelrx-likley-to-receive-fda-approval-shortly-218126,218126

221175,442691,PFE,Euro And Sterling On The Move,opinion,"After last week s painfully tight forex trading ranges  and an historic seven year low in volatility  it seems that dealers and investors are beginning this week on the  front  foot  Both the Euro and the pound are on the move  Potential M A activity  Astrazeneca     Pfizer   seems to helping GBP on the margins   pushing it to print a fresh 4 year high above  1 6843  Regarding the 18 member single currency the EUR  there is no obvious reason for this morning s strength  There has been reasonable retail demand and combined with market chatter that Russian Banks have entered the fray has managed to push the EUR above its two week high   1 3873   The Central Bank of Russia s recent comments that they would sell their dollar holdings has also the market  front  running the Central Bank s requirement of reserve diversification into the EUR 

It may not just be  reserve diversification  talk that s supporting the EUR  Some of the blame should also be passed off to the ECB s excess liquidity managing to hit a multi year low and the EONIA  overnight interest rates  at their second highest level this year  Higher rates combined with greater Euro money market liquidity would suggest that  markets are healing and segmentation abating   This would obviously dampen the prospect for any immediate ECB action  and keep the single currency somewhat supported across the board  It will be difficult for Draghi s and his fellow cohorts at the ECB to have a lasting impact unless they provide more explicit signals to help clear market uncertainty over whether they will act in May or June  The market is leaning predominately towards June  but no one can rule out any liquidity enhancing measures being introduced next month 

The market has little fundamental data to chew on today  but there have been a few ECB speakers already on tap during the Euro session  The ECB s Constancio is worried about disorderly increases in bond yields and stated that the central bank would act if it saw the need to do so  While Noyer  speaking in Frankfurt  commented that the EUR s rise is equivalent to  unwarranted monetary policy tightening   The market is interpreting his comments as  sufficient to support the prospect of a negative deposit rate   However  with the market already expecting negative deposit rates his comments have had little impact  The ECB is required to  walk the walk  rather than repeating their  desire to act  

A squeeze in money market rates and reserve diversification is the likely EUR driver as the market heads stateside  With so little actually going on this month  this rally has more to do with a  positional  squeeze rather than a fundamental one  The EUR bear got short of the currency on expectations that Draghi and company would be dovish and on the back of some stronger US data  However  the single currency has remained resilient to both  and coupled with the major event risks this week is pressurizing most of those weaker  short  positions  The tech traders believe that the  1 3910 threshold will provide strong resistance in the first time of asking  especially ahead of German state CPI s tomorrow and the Euro zone s CPI and FOMC meeting on Wednesday  If the April figure fails to improve the ECB would come under further pressure to take incremental monetary actions 

Regarding the pound  there was a modest cable dip to  1 6837 after the AstraZeneca statement stating that they were confident in their own strategy and rejected Pfizer talks  However  there is solid support at this morning s sessions low between  1 6777 1 6787  with laddered sterling bids all the way above the psychological  1 6800 handle  Now with a new multi year high print   1 6855  it certainly exposes  1 6900 in the shorter term 
Both the FOMC and BoJ meet this week  The Fed meet finishes Wednesday and is almost certain to taper their asset buying program by another  10B  The accompanying statement  no press conference scheduled  should indicate that the Fed intends to keep rates  lower for longer   The BoJ meeting finishes the same day  and so far market consensus does not expect any immediate action from Governor Kuroda and company  However  it should not be ruled out  but the general feeling is that the BoJ will stay on hold  believing it s too soon to gage total effect of the introduction of the sales tax  April 1st   Governor Kuroda s press conference will be key   expect it to shape the timing for when the BoJ will next take action ",2014-04-28,Dean Popplewell,https://www.investing.com/analysis/euro-and-sterling-on-the-move-210938,210938

221178,442694,PFE,What to Expect From Pfizer s Earnings,opinion,"Pfizer Inc  NYSE PFE  is set to report FQ1 2014 earnings before the market opens on Monday  May 5th  Pfizer is one of the world s largest pharmaceutical companies and is currently attempting to buy British Swedish pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca for up to  106 billion  The pharmaceutical industry has a very high cost structure and right now we are seeing several potential consolidation deals to drive those costs down so the firms can benefit from a larger scale of operation  This quarter Wall Street expects Pfizer s earnings to increase marginally compared to FQ1 of last year and for sales to fall by over  1 billion  Here s what investors are expecting from Pfizer on Monday 
The information below is derived from data submitted to the Estimize com platform by a set of Buy Side and Independent analyst contributors 

The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for Pfizer to report 55c EPS and  12 016B revenue while the current Estimize com consensus from 13 Buy Side and Independent contributing analysts is 57c EPS and  12 265B in revenue  This quarter the buy side as represented by the Estimize com community is expecting Pfizer to beat EPS estimates from Wall Street by 2c per share and  249 million in revenue 
Over the past 6 quarters the consensus from Estimize com has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting Pfizer s EPS and revenue 4 and 3 times respectively  By tapping into a wider range of contributors including hedge fund analysts  asset managers  independent research shops  students  and non professional investors Estimize has created a data set that is more accurate than Wall Street up to 69 5  of the time  but more importantly it does a better job of representing the market s actual expectations  It has been confirmed by Deutsche Bank Quant  Research and an independent academic study from Rice University that stock prices tend to react with a more strongly associated degree to the expectation benchmark from Estimize than from the Wall Street consensus 
The magnitude of the difference between the Wall Street and Estimize consensus numbers often identifies opportunities to take advantage of expectations that may not have been priced into the market  In this case we are seeing a larger than usual differential between the expectations from Estimize and Wall Street 

The distribution of estimates published by analysts on the Estimize com platform range from 56c to 58c EPS and from  11 779B to  12 537B in revenues  This quarter we re seeing a narrower range of estimates on Pfizer than usual 
The size of the distribution of estimates relative to previous quarters often signals whether or not the market is confident that it has priced in the expected earnings already  A narrow distribution of EPS estimates signals more agreement in the market  which could mean less volatility post earnings 

Throughout the quarter the Wall Street EPS consensus fell from 57c to 55c while the Estimize consensus also dropped 2c from 59c to 57c  Meanwhile the Wall Street revenue consensus remained relatively flat and ended the period at  12 016B while the Estimize consensus decreased from  12 644B to  12 265B   Timeliness is correlated with accuracy and downward analyst revisions going into an earnings report are often a bearish indicator 

The analyst with the highest estimate confidence rating this quarter is bonefishr who projects 58c EPS and  12 537B in revenue  bonefishr is ranked 515th overall among over 4 400 contributing analysts  Over the past 2 years bonefishr has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting EPS and revenue 71  and 43  of the time respectively throughout 7 estimates  Estimate confidence ratings are calculated through algorithms developed by deep quantitative research which looks at correlations between analyst track records and tendencies as they relate to future accuracy  In this case bonefishr is making a bullish call and also submitted an optional analysis citing a recent study showing efficacy in the Prevenar 13 preventative pneumonia drug for the elderly 
This quarter the Estimize community expects Pfizer to come in ahead of Wall Street s expectations by a considerable amount on both the top and bottom line  However revenue is expected to fall by over  1 billion compared to last year and Pfizer is picking up the pace on its efforts to acquire AstraZeneca for over  100 billion  For more speculation about the AstraZeneca deal and to see other merger and acquisition predicts  head over to our corporate actions platform at

221187,442703,PFE,Clovis Oncology Skyrockets After ASCO Presentations,opinion,Clovis  CLVS  is an acquisition focused biopharmaceutical company that stayed under the radar after its NASDAQ IPO in November 2011  With two notable early stage oncology compounds in its pipeline  Clovis didn t really attract much interest from the market until yesterday  June 3rd  2013    when the company reported results from ongoing Phase I II trials for both CO 1686 and Rucaparib  CO 1686 was originally designed by a biotech company named Avila Therapeutics  a covalent drug focused entity that was acquired by Celgene on March 7th  2012 in a  925 M deal  The compound was introduced to the Clovis pipeline in a  209 M partnership made in 2010 between Avila and Clovis  and the IND application was accepted not long before the company held its IPO on April 3rd  2012  The molecule is a covalent drug that irreversibly inhibits epidermal growth factor receptor  EGFR   which aids cancer cells in proliferation  Clovis is specifically developing it as a non small cell lung cancer  NSCLC  treatment  since it can bypass certain obstacles in NSCLC cells that other EGFR inhibitors cannot  Lung cancers that are caused by EGFR are initially responsive to tyrosine kinase inhibitors that can inhibit their catalytic activity  although mutations in the lung cancer cells  like the T790M resistance mutation  can ultimately shut down the viability of TKI based mechanisms of action for drugs like gefitinib  Iressa  and erlotinib  Tarceva   Unlike other EGFR inhibitors  CO 1686 is designed to irreversibly inhibit mutated versions of EGFR  including T790M  while ignoring wild type  normal  EGFR  This is a particularly desirable trait  since a molecule with potent and irreversible EGFR inhibition would be highly toxic to patients  Because of this particular trait the strong safety data that Clovis reported at ASCO 2013 was particularly exciting to Wall Street  The stock moved up 104  on the Monday following the presentation  and the market capitalization of the company hovered around  2 B for the first time since Clovis  IPO in late 2011  Also important to the rally was the strong data that company presented for the drug Rucaparib  which is a potent PARP inhibitor   or a Poly ADP ribose  polymerase inhibitor being developed for breast ovarian cancer indications  This compound was originally one of Pfizer s oncology drugs and was named  PF 01367338  during its tenure as drug for solid tumors  although the development was handed over to Clovis in a deal announced in 2011 that gave Clovis full responsibility over the development and commercialization of the compound in exchange for an upfront payment and milestone payments of up to  255 M  This is an unusual move for an early stage pharmaceutical company  although Clovis was  and is  better funded than most companies in the sector  What was so exciting about the CO 1686 and Rucaparib data was that both drugs demonstrated efficacy in their respective early stage trials without reaching MTD  maximum tolerated dose   The implication is that the efficacy of these drugs may be significantly boosted in Phase II trials  which bodes well for the company s hopes for expedited approval for its oncology pipeline  CO 1686 was probably the more exciting of the two candidates after the results it demonstrated in non small cell lung cancer  although optimal dosing has not been established yet  Although the drug was extremely well tolerated  the safety profile should improve as the company switches from a capsule to a tablet formulation  a move which will triple the plasma concentration of CO 1686 per dose   This may allow the company to significantly increase the already promising efficacy  From the company s ASCO related  for CO 1686  One patient with a del19 T790M  tumor had progressed on erlotinib immediately before beginning CO 1686 therapy  The patient  enrolled in the 300 mg BID cohort  is currently in cycle 6 of CO 1686 therapy  with a confirmed PROne patient with an L858R T790M  tumor had received six previous lines of therapy  including two previous TKIs  dacomitinib and erlotinib  and had most recently progressed on a combination of erlotinib and gemcitibine immediately before beginning CO 1686 therapy  This patient has demonstrated tumor shrinkage in brain metastases  present at baseline   as well as lung and liver tumors  The patient  enrolled in the 900mg BID cohort  exhibited a PR in cycle 4 of CO 1686 therapy  treatment is ongoingOne patient with a del19 T790M  tumor had received two previous lines of therapy  This patient exhibited a PR in cycle 2 and is currently being dosed in cycle 3 at 900mg BIDOne patient with a del19 T790M  tumor had received two lines of prior cytotoxic chemotherapy and had also progressed on erlotinib treatment  This patient exhibited a PR in cycle 2 and is currently in cycle 3  receiving 900mg BIDTwo additional T790M  patients have achieved greater than 20 percent target lesion shrinkage with stable non target lesionsRucaparib  which also drew major interest  presented 89  clinical benefit rate in ovarian cancer patients across all the dosage arms  and was well tolerated with objective responses in BRCA mutant ovarian  breast  and pancreatic cancer patients as a monotherapy  This helps to build the case that this could become a popular breast ovarian cancer therapy that can be combined with a chemotherapeutic agent in a first line regimen ,2013-06-05,Myriad

221206,442722,PFE,Halozyme s Newfound Credibility  Pfizer,opinion,For the most part  2012 was not a very good year for Halozyme Therapeutics  HALO  Investors  eagerly anticipating FDA approval of Baxter s  BAX  immune globulin infusion HyQ  were met with a press release on April 16  which announced that the FDA wanted more information on HyQ  which drew immediate concern for the status of the biologic s BLA Bumps In The RoadHALO and BAX shareholders  worst fears were confirmed on August 1 when we learned that the FDA issued a complete response letter  saying there was not enough pre clinical data to support the BLA  Other specific issues were brought up  like the generation of antibodies through usage of HyQ that could potentially have adverse effects on patients in terms of reproduction  development  and fertility  Halozyme doesn t seem to believe that the antibody in question  anti rHuPH20  is associated with adverse events  even in large amounts  That is a fairly important stance to take  since Halozyme s entire Enhanze biologics platform is based on the patented rHuPH20 enzyme Due to the failure of HyQ s BLA last year  HALO lost about half its value by mid December 2012  BAX  being a much larger company with less dependency on the potential revenues of HyQ  shrugged off the damage  Things could have gotten worse for Halozyme had they not announced a partnership with Pfizer  PFE  on December 21  which sent the stock soaring about 25  higher The Pfizer EffectWhile the market is still quite skeptical about Halozyme s Enhanze platform due to the FDA s concern with the safety of rHuPH20  a good number of people changed their mind after the announced collaboration with Pfizer  Not only did this give Halozyme new opportunity in the future  but it also suggested that Pfizer s own research indicated that there was nothing wrong with rHuPH20 or the Enhanze platform at all Another great aspect of the arrangement is that EPS negative Halozyme will receive milestone payments from Pfizer  Considering that the company has just  100 million of cash  with an expected cash burn rate of  45  50 million in 2013  it s clear that the company would have had to hold a public offering or secured a private line of financing to sustain operations after 2014  Pfizer s milestone payments could turn out to be extremely useful as Halozyme as it sustains three of its own drug development programs It s hard to say how high HALO can move on the Pfizer deal alone  HALO isn t exactly cheap with a market capitalization of  780 million and a lack of a steady revenue stream  although the Pfizer deal could yield as much as  518 million in milestone payments  This is encouraging for investors who are interested in waiting for the full development of the aforementioned drugs that Halozyme is developing  Analog Insulin PH20 for diabetes  PEGPH20 for cancer  and the dermatology treatment HTI 501 are all in phase II trials and could generate substantial interest in Halozyme with their own prospects in the market  It s true that Halozyme s pipeline is also tied to rHuPH20  the diabetes drug uses it directly   which is why there is still major concern over the FDA s complete response letter in 2012  but Halozyme should be able to address all the issues well before another BLA is submitted ConclusionI think HALO is undergoing a recovery rally due to the hype about the collaboration with Pfizer  and could see  8 share or more as we head into a new year  Those who are interested in HALO for the long haul should carefully watch developments surrounding the safety profile of rHuPH20  which could make or break Halozyme s own pipeline  The market seems to think that rHuPH20 is fine  since the FDA s complete response letter seemed a bit too cautious  Also note that Pfizer s research indicated that Enhanze was a safe enough biologics development platform to partner with  HALO investors should also keep tabs on the company s financials  which are stable for the time being but could become an issue if Pfizer s milestone payments don t bring in as much income for Halozyme as we are expecting ,2013-01-15,Myriad Equity,https://www.investing.com/analysis/halozyme’s-newfound-credibility:-pfizer-150940,150940

221211,442727,PFE,Navidea  Unjustly Damaged By Misleading Article,opinion,On December 19th  2012 The GeoTeam  on Navidea Biopharmaceuticals  NAVB  that contained a number of misleading statements and outright inaccuracies that prompted this reactionary piece  Most of the truly egregious statements are listed and addressed below  Note  Each statement is taken directly out of The GeoTeam s  Statement 1   Platinum Montaur Life Sciences  LLC  a firm that provided a credit facility to Navidea  may be losing faith in the company  The group has sold approximately 3 8 million shares  or approximately 50  of its public equity ownership stake in NAVB since September 4  2012   Platinum Montaur Life Sciences  a firm that provided a credit facility to Navidea  is not losing faith in the company at all  The GeoTeam really can t seem to get the facts straight  Montaur  Navidea s largest shareholder and supporter of the company  did NOT sell 3 million shares  Instead  Montaur converted 3 million of its preferred shares into common shares in order to exercise warrants  creating a net long position for the fund  With respect to NAV5001 and Alseres Pharmaceuticals  ALSE PK   the only thing we know for sure is that the shares have been registered for resale  not that they have been sold  A 300 000 share position is not material for reporting for SEC purposes  Alseres is no longer a diagnostic company  If they were to sell shares  it would be to satisfy their capital needs and not as a vote of no confidence in the Parkinson s diagnostic agent they licensed to Navidea  In fact  the Alseres agreement is largely back end loaded  signaling that Alseres has a confident outlook for this product  with contingent milestone payments to Alseres of up to  2 900 000  and the issuance of up to an additional 1 150 000 shares of the Company s common stock  In addition  the terms of the Sublicense Agreement anticipate royalties on annual net sales of products based on the agent  Alseres would not have accepted a back end loaded structure where they get paid upon success of the product if they didn t believe in the agent or Navidea  Statement 1   Platinum Montaur Life Sciences

loaded structure where they get paid upon success of the product if they didn t believe in the agent or Navidea  Statement 2   Lymphoseek has now been in the approval process for 10 years  with at least another year before the possibility of approval   This is a completely inaccurate statement  given that Lymposeek has an PDUFA action date of April 30th  2013 for their flagship diagnostic compound Lymphoseek  It s also worth noting that the product could be approved before that date as well  Statement 3   Navidea has had chemistry  manufacturing  and controls   CMC   issues with its main product  Lymphoseek  since 2006 and is still having CMC issues today   I am perplexed as to where they got that information  The CMC issues became known when the company received a CRL  complete response letter  in September 2012  which pinpointed an issue that has now been resolved  Statement 4   Navidea has  16 million in cash and while it has a  50 million revolver  it can currently only draw down  15 million of that revolver for its cash needs  On December 11  2012  the company drew  2 million from this facility  It needs approval of Lymphoseek in order to get any more than the initial  15 million  This means NAVB could run out of cash within 18 months  if not sooner  if it is unable to secure additional financing or if it is not granted FDA approval for Lymphoseek   Navidea s liquidity issues are actually less significant than what is implied above  The company is currently eligible to draw  15 million from Montaur prior to approval and  20 million after approval  Statement 5   Management s track record over the past 16 years with other drugs has thus far been very unimpressive  All three of NAVB s drugs have not gained FDA approval  calling into question management s ability to get drugs approved   The GeoTeam criticized the management team s track record over the last 16 years  while it is widely known that many have joined the company within the last two years  We ve recently seen Navidea complete clinical studies for Lymphoseek  followed with an NDA and MAA submission for the FDA and EMA  European Medicines Agency  respectively  It s difficult to understand The GeoTeam s argument here  because the new management team is quite competent  Statement 6    Lymphoseek approval from the FDA for both breast cancer and melanoma  for a total of 300 000 cases in the United States   This statement was regarding the NEO3 06 phase III trial  which could expand the label for Lymphoseek to the  sentinel lymph node biopsy  claim which actually brings its target population to 1 3 million in the United States alone  This is over four times what The GeoTeam cited in their analysis  Statement 7   NAVB has expressed its intent to pursue the approval of treatments for melanoma and breast cancer in Europe  We feel this is highly unlikely to occur   This statement is completely wrong  Navidea filed their MAA with the EMA on December 18th  and fully intends to pursue the European market for lymphatic mapping  It s also worth noting that The GeoTeam claimed that this was a market of about 300 to 400 thousand patients  while it s closer to 2 5 million in reality  Statement 8   Navidea has two products other than Lymphoseek that we believe will not have any positive impact on the company s operations  AZD4694  a phase 2 product for which comparables from other companies have failed to be approved  and Rigscan  which has been in phase 3 since 1998   Not only is AZD4694 a phase III drug  but it is very dissimilar from the compounds that The GeoTeam wants to compare it to   specifically Lilly s solanezumab and Pfizer s bapineuzumab  Conclusion  The large number of mistakes and misleading statements that were made to build the bearish case on Navidea Pharmaceuticals in The GeoTeam s article should be enough to discredit them as a source of reliable information for NAVB  The slam piece actually made a dent in the stock after its release  which leads me to believe that there may have been an agenda associated with their publication  Hopefully  this article has established some clarity on Navidea s actual

221212,442728,PFE,Upcoming FDA Decision for AVEO s Tivozanib Builds Speculation,opinion,We ve seen a lot of choppy trading in shares of in the oncology drug developer AVEO Pharmaceuticals  AVEO   which has been struggling ever since August 2nd when it released some data from a phase III trial called  TIVO 1  that compared their flagship drug tivozanib with Onyx Pharmaceuticals   ONXX  Nexavar sorafenib in the treatment of renal cell carcinoma  RCC    In terms of raw survival after one year  it was seen that 77  of the patients treated with tivozanib survived while 81  of sorafenib treated patients survived RCC   As a result  AVEO dropped sharply from  13 30 share to  9 75 share on August 2nd and has remained troubled ever since  The question now is whether or not these preliminary phase III results actually mean that tivozanib is inferior to sorafenib  and whether this will result in a complete response letter to the NDA that AVEO recently submitted   The company thinks that the 1 year survival data could be misleading  due to their claim that a large number of the patients who were assigned Onyx s sorafenib  just over half of them  were moved onto other therapies tivozanib when their condition worsened while only 17  of tivozanib patients were given other treatments  This presents a problem when you try to evaluate the relative overall survival between both arms  since it s very possible that the sorafenib arm benefitted from tivozanib s efficacy as a second line treatment for RCC   It s also worth noting that the study s primary endpoint  progression free survival  PFS   showed statistically significant improvements in the tivozanib arm versus the sorafenib arm  The median PFS measurements were 11 9 months and 9 1 months for AVEO and Onyx s drug  respectively  The bulk of the patient population  70   were na ve for advanced RCC  and responded even better to tivozanib with media PFS of 12 7 months versus 9 1 months   So  while the FDA has  expressed concern  about the implications of the weak overall survival  OS  data for tivozanib versus sorafenib the progression free survival argument is still quite intact  It is also very well tolerated amongst patients  which significantly reduces its risk and increases its chances of approval  Judging by the movements in shares of AVEO in the last few months  I think the market might be a little too pessimistic about tivozanib s approval chances   The market that is being targeted by tivozanib is quite large  at over  2 4 billion  Onyx s sorafenib was FDA approved for RCC in 2005  and is marketed by Bayer  BAYRY  under the name Nexavar and brought the company  199 million in Q3 2011  although it s worth mentioning that Bayer Onyx have expanded its indication to other types of cancer since 2005   Sutent  one of Pfizer s  PFE  most profitable drugs  also treats RCC and brought the company  294 million in Q3 2012   AVEO also saw some major insider buying this month  The first significant purchase was made by one of AVEO s directors Raju Kucherlapati  who bought 15 000 shares  equating to  101 thousand  throughout the first week of the month  A much bigger buy was made by president and CEO Tuan Ha Ngoc throughout the following week  He accumulated 75 000 shares which cost  499 thousand  This implies that there is substantial confidence in the success of tivozanib going forward   It s worth mentioning that AVEO intends to expand the tivozanib indication to other types of cancer  including colorectal and breast cancer  following in the footsteps of their competitor sorafenib   The company also has two other compounds in its pipeline that could prove very interesting  including ficlatuzumab for non small cell lung cancer  NSCLC  and AV 203 for solid tumors  These two other compounds are in phase II and phase I trials respectively  Still  I don t think the market will pay any attention to these drugs while the speculation over tivozanib s NDA submission builds   The PDUFA action date for tivozanib s NDA is July 28  2013  There will probably be an advisory committee that will vote on the drug s chances of approval prior to the actual decision date  but AVEO shareholders have little to do but wait for more developments at this point ,2012-12-23,Myriad Equity,https://www.investing.com/analysis/upcoming-fda-decision-for-aveo’s-tivozanib-builds-speculation-148707,148707

221226,442742,PFE,Stock Indexes  ETFs Back To Resistance  Big Week Ahead,opinion,Major U S  stock indexes and ETFs climbed back to the ceiling this past week but failed to break higher    Shrugging off weak economic reports and focusing on overall strong U S earnings reports  U S  stock indexes and ETFs climbed back to and stopped at recent resistance levels    On My Wall Street Radar  In the chart of the S P 500  NYSEARCA SPY  above we can see how this major index has climbed back into serious resistance levels  Relative strength  RSI  is above 50 and climbing  which is bullish  and short term momentum as represented by MACD has recently generated a  buy  signal and all of this comes within the context of an ongoing uptrend with the S P 500  NYSEARCA SPY  above both its 50 and 200 day moving averages    However  we now find ourselves in the most frustrating of all conditions  a long  sideways channel or trading range  this one being between resistance at 1400 1420 and support at 1360  A break above 1400 1420 would indicate the end of the channel and the resumption of  the current trend upwards while a reversal below 1360 would indicate a correction could be underway    The Economic View From 35 000 Feet   For the week  the major indexes were positive with the Dow Jones Industrial Average  NYSEARCA DIA  gaining 1 5   the Nasdaq 100  NYSEARCA QQQ  adding 2 3  and the Russell 2000  NYSEARCA IWM  climbing 2 7   The gains came in the face of some rather dismal economic reports  with just a ray or two of sunshine  while earnings reports in the United States continued to support bullish optimism On the positive side of the economic ledger  we saw pending home sales for March vastly beat expectations by climbing 4 1  and new home sales improving  as well  The University of Michigan Confidence Index came in at 76 4 compared to 75 7 previously  and overseas  Spain and Italy stayed afloat with successful bond auctions On the downside  the biggest shocker was the GDP estimate on Friday which indicated that Q1 GDP expanded by a mediocre 2 2  compared to 2 7  expected and the previously reported 3 0   Final sales were dismal and durable goods orders were weak  while weekly unemployment claims clung stubbornly above 380 000 missing estimates for the week Overseas the big news came from Britain where the country entered a double dip recession  joining Spain  Italy and Netherlands whose government fell over national dissatisfaction with planned austerity programs  The French election puts another twist in eurozone politics while German and Italian consumer and business confidence fell On the upside for the week were U S  earnings reports  particularly in the tech sector  with Amazon  AMZN  and Apple  AAPL  blazing higher as U S  companies continued to find ways to make money in a slowing global environment  However  the GDP report points to some significant structural weaknesses as much of it came from inventory buildup and not from final sales  In either case  this type of action cannot continue for the long term which can only be bad news for spending and earnings somewhere down the road Finally  the FOMC says they re going to keep interest rates near zero for as far as the eye can see because they still see significant downside risks to the economy and unemployment isn t improving as rapidly as they d like  Dr  Bernanke s press conference was interesting  as always  as market participants are counting on the Fed to keep things going with more easing as Dr  Bernanke promises he s ready  willing and able to do This coming week brings earnings reports from the likes of Merck  MRK   Office Depot  ODP   Pfizer  PFE   Mastercard  MA   Clorox  CLX  and UBS  UBS  but the big news will be in economic reports which come hot and heavy all week  Monday brings income  spending and Chicago PMI  Tuesday sees the widely watched ISM report  construction spending and car sales  Wednesday finds ADP Employment and factory orders  Thursday brings the weekly jobs report and ISM non manufacturing  and Friday brings the grandaddy of all economic reports  the monthly Non Farm Payrolls and Unemployment Reports  It s going to be a big week Bottom line   Having made three tries to scale new highs  the major U S  indexes appear ready to give it another try  We remain in  bear alert  mode from April 16th  and this coming week s action will be significant as we move into the seasonally weak period of May through October Disclaimer  Wall Street Sector Selector trades a wide range of exchange traded funds and positions can change at any time ,2012-04-30,John Nyaradi,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/stock-indexes,-etfs-back-to-resistance.-big-week-ahead-121627",121627
221227,442743,PFE,Medicinova  Developmental Pharma With Massive Long Term Potential,opinion,Primary ticker  MNOV  Secondary tickers include  AZN  GSK  MRK  PFE   I previously released an article referencing MediciNova  MNOV   which engages in the acquisition and development of small molecule therapeutics for the treatment of serious diseases for the United States market  This is an up and coming company who has incredible potential as an investment because of its strong pipeline of six clinical stage compounds and tiny market capitalization  As of the end of the trading day on May 1st  this value was around  48 million  I have seen companies that look far less appealing selling in a price range that reflects a 150 200 million dollar market cap  Even if MNOV could achieve the bottom end of this range  that would put it around  9 share compared to the  2 83 price it currently sits at  Let s take a look  Although this pipeline taken directly from MNOV s website contains numerous clinical pipelined drugs  I want to focus on the most advanced clinical drug to date    The drug candidate that I feel is not giving MNOV appropriate visibility is their MN 221 drug for Acute Exacerbations of Asthma  more commonly referred to as an asthma attack  Why is this drug important  For starters  asthma affects one in twelve people or about 25 million in the United States alone    Secondly  approximately two million emergency room visits per year are due to asthma attacks  Of those  about 500 000 lead to hospital stays  MediciNova is looking to prevent these people from needing that expensive hospital stay by filling an unmet need for those not responding to the typical treatments  The reason is pretty simple for people s tendency to go to a hospital for asthma  breathing is the most critical necessity of life    MediciNova has completed 2 phase II clinical studies for MN 221  with important data from one of the studies due out before the end of this month  the other at the beginning of June  Positive results from these studies could lead to a possible pivotal trial if the trials confirm the success of the prior phase 1 studies  which should lead to a partnership with a large pharma    Patients suffering from acute exacerbations of asthma in the emergency room who were not promptly responding to standard pharmacotherapy were enrolled in the study  MediciNova is currently in the process of auditing and organizing the data and preparing to lock the database for a complete analysis    In prior double blind studies  MN 221 was given to patients from an IV  Once in the bloodstream  scientists believe MN 221 may directly enter the lungs and migrate to the irritated bronchial tubes  eventually relaxing the muscles which may result in an open airway  Most of the time when people go to the ER for an asthma attack  they are given the same types of things they take at home just in higher doses combined with medical therapy  It s clear to me that these advancements have not gone far enough to help people with a symptom as scary as not being able to breathe  MediciNova is looking to fill an unmet need whose end result is 500 000 people not responding well to common treatments    In modeling the market potential of MN 221  Chief Business Officer Michael Coffee  that if the company can demonstrate a reduction in hospital admissions  he believes that insurance payers would feel comfortable with an attractive branded price  In an earlier Phase 2a trial  the company generated data showing a 54  reduction in potential hospital admissions     Given that  we ve extrapolated to show that acute asthma and COPD exacerbations represent a combined annual worldwide sales potential in excess of  1 billion   he adds    Let s look at the current environment for treating asthma  The most commonly prescribed asthma drug is GlaxoSmithKline s  GSK  Advair  with projected sales of  7 4 billion Another popular drug is Merck   Co s  MRK  Singulair  which helps to block genetic signals that trigger airway constrictionAstraZeneca  AZN    Symbicort is an asthma drug that launched in the US in mid 2007  with 2007 sales of  1 6 billion  It belongs to the same drug family as Advair  ICS LABA   but with slightly faster action Spiriva  co marketed by Pfizer  PFE  and the privately held Boehringer Ingelheim  is already used for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and works by blocking the nerves that can tighten the muscles surrounding the airways to the lungs These drugs are not for asthma attacks but rather less severe symptoms  Again  GlaxoSmithKline sells 7 4 billion dollars  worth of their drug and it does not cover the most severe issues that asthma brings    To me  it seems like an incredible fit for one of these big players to partner with MediciNova  if not flat out buy the company    I Look at it this way  Glaxo could fire away 200 Million dollars at MNOV and it would be a tiny 2 7  of the sales it did for one asthma drug of theirs  This would then enable a company like Glaxo to treat not only the regular mild form of asthma  but also the more serious  life threatening variety  Here is where the extremely small market cap again comes into play regarding MNOV  What would this relatively tiny investment from GSK translate for MNOV shareholders  Approximately  12 share    The second most advanced product that MediciNova is working on is their MN 166  Ibudilast   This has been approved for dizziness after stroke and asthma in Japan and South Korea  and has treated more than three million patients   But it was our scientists who determined that ibudilast had a potential clinical utility in central nervous system disorders   Mr  Coffee points out    The company has conducted successful early stage testing to determine safety and tolerability of higher doses of ibudilast in three clinical areas  progressive Multiple Sclerosis  neuropathic pain  and drug addiction    In progressive MS  Mr  Coffee says the company is organizing a Phase 2b trial with MN 166 and anticipates announcing in the second half of this year the company s plans for conducting this trial    In preclinical in vivo and in vitro studies  MN 166 inhibited leukotriene activity  phosphodiesterases and nitric oxide synthase  all of which are inflammatory mechanisms known to be involved in Multiple Sclerosis  These studies also suggested that MN 166 may suppress the production of pro inflammatory cytokines  IL 1   TNF a  and enhance the production of the anti inflammatory cytokines  IL 4  IL 10   Based on the potential mechanisms of action of MN 166  its clinical safety history in Japan  the results of pilot studies conducted by Kyorin Pharmaceutical in MS patients  and the issuance of a U S  patent covering the method of using MN 166 to treat the disease  MediciNova decided to pursue development of MN 166 as a novel oral agent for the treatment of MS    MediciNova also has non core programs in asthma  interstitial cystitis  generalized anxiety disorder  thrombosis and overactive bladder that are in various stages of development  The company is seeking to monetize these non core programs through licensing partnerships    Let s take a look at the MNOV chart   A nice symmetrical continuation triangle has formed also creating a nice wedge pattern  The MACD and signal are trending upwards  The volume has begun to pick up  and this chart looks to be setting up a bullish short term pop to a price over 3 50 a share in my opinion  possibly higher    If the data from MN 221 turns out to be good  and if phase 2 follows phase 1 and confirms  expect MNOV to partner up with a large pharma  and expect the stock price to move over  4 a share  MN 221 faces a multi billion dollar market With MNOV being a very small cap coming in at around  49M  savvy investors will see the huge value in this company moving forward in my strong opinion    It is my opinion that MNOV is a strong speculative buy and worth taking a gamble on for a long term hold  As I mentioned in    I expect a run up to start within the next 2 weeks before the data on MN 221 is revealed  At  3 02 a share  no debt on the books  and a market cap under 50 million  MNOV is highly undervalued  and should be selling for near  4 a share  I would not be surprised to see a  4 a share price after the data on MN 221 is released    My price target opinion   3 50 a share short term   4 25 midterm  and an  8 one year target price    Disclosure  I am long MNOV    Disclaimer  This article is intended for informational and entertainment

range mid point of  12 for Thursday  July 19  2012  RECOMMENDATION DRTX wants to IPO at a price to book discount to CEMP and RIBX  However  we are concerned about DRTX s lack of intellectual property protection and would avoid the DRTX IPO  DRTX  S 1  filed July 9  2012 UNDERWRITERS Manager  Joint Managers  BofA Merrill Lynch  Credit Suisse Co Managers  RBC Capital Markets  Wedbush PacGrow Life Sciences SUMMARY DRTX is pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel therapeutics for patients with infectious diseases and acute illnesses  DRTX is owned 98  by venture capital firms pre IPO  and expects to IPO at 2x book  which is low for a pharmaceutical company The core business was acquired from Pfizer in 2009  It looks like DRTX is not protected very much by patents  see INTELLECUAL PROPERTY below  BUSINESS DRTX is a pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel therapeutics for patients with infectious diseases and acute illnesses  DRTX is currently enrolling and dosing patients in two global Phase 3 clinical trials with the lead product candidate  dalbavancin  for the treatment of patients with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections  or abSSSI  Dalbavancin is an intravenous antibiotic product candidate designed for once weekly dosing  which DRTX believes will facilitate the treatment of patients with abSSSI in both the in patient and out patient settings by reducing the length of a patient s hospital stay or avoiding hospital admission altogether and  ultimately  lowering the overall cost of care for these patients  DRTX is conducting each of these Phase 3 clinical trials pursuant to special protocol agreements  or SPAs  with the U S  Food and Drug Administration  or FDA  based on draft guidance issued by the FDA in 2010 for the development of drugs to treat abSSSI  DRTX also designed these trials based on scientific advice that we received from the European Medicines Agency  or EMA  in December 2010 to meet the regulatory filing requirements in the European Union  PHASE 3 DRTX expects to complete these Phase 3 clinical trials and have initial  top line data available in the beginning of 2013  If DRTX s ongoing Phase 3 clinical trials are successful  DRTX plans to submit a New Drug Application  or NDA  to the FDA in the first half of 2013 and a marketing authorization application  or MAA  to the EMA in the second half of 2013  If approved  DRTX intends to directly commercialize dalbavancin in the United States and Western Europe with a targeted hospital sales force and to utilize a variety of types of collaboration arrangements for commercialization in other markets  ACQUISITION OF VICRON FROM PFIZER In December 2009  DRTX acquired all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Vicuron from Pfizer  PFE   DRTX paid total upfront consideration of  10 million for the Vicuron shares and dalbavancin inventory that DRTX acquired pursuant to a separate inventory transfer agreement with Pfizer Overseas LLC  In March 2011  Pfizer refunded  6 million of the initial purchase price under the terms of the stock purchase agreement  based on documentation DRTX provided that supported the position that marketing approval for dalbavancin required more than one new Phase 3 clinical trial  Following the first commercial sale of dalbavancin for the treatment of abSSSI in the United States  the United Kingdom  Germany  Italy  Spain or France  DRTX is obligated to pay Pfizer an additional milestone payment of  25 million  However  DRTX s sole discretion  DRTX may elect to defer the milestone payment for a period of up to five years if DRTX delivers to Pfizer a promissory note for the full amount of such milestone payment  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY Dalbavancin is protected by four issued U S  patents consisting of two method of treatment patents  a dosage form patent and a formulation patent  patent protection is not available for composition of matter claims that only recite the active pharmaceutical ingredient for dalbavancin  Because dalbavancin lacks composition of matter protection for its active pharmaceutical ingredient  competitors will be able to offer and sell products with the same active pharmaceutical ingredient so long as these competitors do not infringe any other patents covering this drug  COMPETITION There are also a number of products in clinical development by third parties to treat abSSSI  These companies include pharmaceutical companies  biotechnology companies  and specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies of various sizes  such as  The Medicines Company  Trius Therapeutics  Inc   Cempra  Inc   Rib X Pharmaceuticals  Inc   Paratek Pharmaceuticals  Inc   Nabriva Therapeutrics AG

estimates that it will use the net proceeds from this offering  together with cash and cash equivalents  as follows   13 million to complete the clinical development of and seek marketing approval in the United States and the European Union for dalbavancin for the treatment of patients with abSSSI   20 million to fund commercial activities for dalbavancin in the United States and Western Europe  if it is approved for the treatment of patients with abSSSI   15 million to fund the scale up of the manufacturing of dalbavancin in preparation for commercial launch   10 million to pursue the

221239,442755,PFE,Antares Pharma  A Lower Risk Small Cap With Larger Cap Potential,opinion,In this article  I would like to talk about a company I own a substantial amount of shares in  The company s name is Antares Pharma    and is listed on The AMEX exchange  It s current closing price as of 4 10 12 is  2 98 a share  with a market cap of  309 01M  At first glance  Antares appears to be over valued  but in this article  I will give my opinion why I believe the stock is actually grossly undervalued  considering its strong potential moving forward  to be an eventual larger cap company    First off  if we valuate Antares on what the company earns now  the stock would certainly appear to be again  over valued  Antares will likely bring in around  25 million dollars in revenue this year  with most of this revenue as profit  These revenues will primarily come from royalty deals the company has made in the last few years with larger pharmas such as Watson Pharma     Teva     and Pfizer     Antares does not have much capital expenditures in these deals  so again  the company will see mostly profit from the  25 million number    Antares focuses on self injection pharmaceutical products and technologies  and topical gel based products  It offers injection devices  which include Zomajet 2 Vision  Zomajet Vision X  Twin Jector EZ II  and Tjet for human growth hormone  Medi Jector Vision for insulin  Vibex disposable pressure assisted auto injectors that enables a controlled pressure delivery of drugs into the body utilizing a spring power source  and disposable pen injectors  which are needle based devices designed to deliver multiple injections from multi dose drug cartridges    Antares also is in a strong position to take advantage of the eventual emergence of the  and  market  Rather than me going on about every specific detail about what Antares offers in specific detail  I encourage readers to visit its company website and download    What excites me about Antares are the recent comments the company s CEO  Paul Wotton made at a  He flatly stated that Antares will not be engaging in anymore royalty deals  He went on to state that Antares is looking for partnerships along the lines of a 50 50 split  notwithstanding that the company plans to market and commercialize most of their top line products in the future    You can find Wotton s remark concerning Antares no longer seeking royalty deals  but full partnerships at the 25 19 mark on the recording of The Roth Capital investor s conference linked above    One such product Antares plans to  go it alone  is  a self injector that will be pre filled with doctor prescribed doses of   Clicking on the VIBEX MTX link will bring you to a prior article of mine where I lay out some revenue projections for VIBEX MTX    In collaboration with a fellow Antares investor  our Vibex MTX U S  market earnings formula is as follows 2 Million patients in U S  10 15  market share   50 per injection  52 weeks  52  margin  May 2014 commercial launch  possibly earlier  Our equation produced the following high low MTX earnings projections for 2014 and 2015    2014    203M   1 70 eps   135M   1 13 eps  2015    405M   3 24 eps   270M   2 16 eps    Now  when we look at the total projected revenue for all Antares product sales in 2015  we come up with the following numbers   12 5M HgH global royalties and margin from device and component sales 8 1M EpiPen U S  royalties and margin from device sales 10M Vibex2 U S  royalties and margin from device sales 6M Pen1 royalties and margin from device sales  EU only in 2015  12 5M Pen2 U S    EU royalties and margin from device sales 9M Gelnique Anturol global royalties 1 5M Elestrin royalties 277M Vibex MTX U S  sales and EU royalties and margin from device sales 140M VIBEX QS1 U S  sales and EU royalties and margin from device salesPfizer deal unknown  Guess is  7MNestraGel  the wild card factor I will comment more on later in this article  476 6M     Total Revenues 2015   Nearly  500M in revenues is what we believe Antares will bring to the table in 2015  placing the fair value low end estimate of Antares Stock at around  20 a share  in roughly 3 years from now    All of this would not mean a lot if management does not execute  The number one factor for me to take a risk on a small cap is confidence in competent management  When Dendrean gained approval a couple of years ago for its Prostate cancer drug Provenge  the stock went from  10 all the way up to over  57 before crashing back down to under  8  This happened because management failed to inform insurance companies of the cost for the drug  This is a case of a good product  but poor management execution  In fact  most all small cap companies that fail  do so because of poor management execution  money mismanagement  and other various issues involving incompetence    I encourage those interested in Antares to do due diligence on Dr  Paul Wotton  The Antares CEO  I find him conservative  smart and very focused  without offering B S hype in conference calls  On The Antares website  you can listen to the company s conference calls and investor conference presentations    Antares expects to file an NDA for VIBEX MTX in 2012 and is seeking a licensing partner for territories outside of the U S  and Canada  Antares will go it alone without a partner for the U S  market  This product has a high profit margin rate with reasonable capital expenditures    Nestragel  The true wild card factor that deal for it this year can potentially double the Antares stock overnight  Paul Wotton can be heard commenting on Nestragel at the 23 20 mark of The Roth Capital California investor s conference    As I remarked earlier  CEO Wotton has stated Antares is not interested in royalty deals anymore  but partnerships  Nestragel is rub on Female contraception  which I project will be a massive money maker in 5 years  potentially bringing Antares up to  500M A year in revenues  if the deal involves a true partnership and not a royalty licensing deal    Wotton remarked that talks are ongoing for a partnership for Nestragel  Nestragel has been thru phase 1 and phase 2 clinical  and now is ready for Phase 3 clinical  My  I wrote for Seeking Alpha covered Nestragel s market potential and various other factors involved in the female contraception market  Being my first article for Seeking Alpha  it reads a little bit like an infomercial  so it can be a little funky to read    Many investors have been wondering why there has not been a deal yet for this product  I believe the answer for this is contained once again  in Paul Wotton s comments from Antares s last investor conference presentation  It is also my belief that Pfizer is the main suitor for Nestragel  and originally contacted Antares for it    I believe this because the undisclosed deal with Pfizer appears to be for an insignificant product that Pfizer  according to Wotton s comments in the investor conference    had this product in their inventory for some time   This indicates to me that Pfizer did not originally contact Antares for this undisclosed over the counter product that was shelved away in Pfizer s inventory  Why would Pfizer seek out Antares for a small over the counter product that has been sitting on the shelf for some time    Antares and Pfizer were talking about something else in my opinion  and I believe that something else was Nestragel  I also believe Pfizer may have interest in acquiring Antares at some point  and this undisclosed deal is a kind of  feeler  Pfizer has laid out  When I consider this along with the new hiring of Jack Howarth  I start to sniff out a possible buy out offer coming  Taking a look at Howarth s employment history shows a clear pattern to me  Oct 2007 Alphapharma hires Howarth VP of Investor RelationsNov 2008 King acquires AlphapharmaJune 2009 King hires Howarth VP of Investor RelationsOct 2010 Pfizer acquires KingFeb 2011 Antares hires Howarth VP of Investor RelationsHowarth was hired by Antares at the same time it made a deal with Pfizer for the undisclosed product I mentioned above  coincidence or something more  I do not believe the Howarth hire is a coincidence when factoring in what I mentioned above  A shorter term cup and handle formation occurred beginning in January  then a continuation of a symmetrical triangle  We can see the confirmation of this as the stock had a decent break out occur after the handle was confirmed as I crudely mark above in black  I made a mark on where I feel is a key MACD point from January in conjunction with the beginning of the last cup and handle  and make the same mark on the MACD at the end of March  I see the beginning of the same cup and handle and continuation of a symmetrical triangle forming again  The recent pull back in the pps I feel has been in conjunction with the recent overall market correction that I feel is near or finished with its correction    I strongly encourage fund managers reading this article to do hard due diligence on all of the factors I mention herein  I consider Antares to be the best long term small cap investment around because the risk is very low for a small cap  and the reward very high  Again  I want to point out  because the company carries less risk  do not expect an explosive move upwards overnight  However  a deal for Nestragel would likely double the stock price overnight  if the deal is a major one    I also wrote an article for Seeking Alpha the mentions The recent FDA directive received from The Obama Administration  I feel what I wrote about in that article is a major factor that should help Antares be in a good position to capitalize on  the article can be found    I bought Antares because I believe in the long term prospects  fundamentals  and management of this company  I believe once any savvy investor does the deeper DD on Antares  they will agree with me and buy and hold it for the long term  I have written other articles on Antares for your consideration  Article about Nestragel  Female gel contraceptive  is Article about Teva and AIS is Another article is Key points of interest Management growth plan on target   I am expecting Q1 2012 earnings to be Antares  first profitable quarter ever  I estimate 2 to 4 cents a share profit  The company has no debt  and around  32 million in cash and investment Antares has strong insider and institutional ownership   For a stock that has not been over  5 a share since 1999  40  institutional ownership is very unusual  See my article  on these two potential pps drivers Potential negatives Lack of market acceptance for VIBEX MTX Over all weak stock market means risk off trading and safer investments  namely Treasuries A buy out offer accepted that is too low per the potential market value of The Antares product line Management changes course and gets too aggressive  too quickly While I certainly do not feel any of the negatives above will occur with Antares  they are always possible to occur as we are dealing in factors that are never certain    Good things come to those who wait  or so we are told  Antares Pharma is definitely a good thing  and buying it around its current price range now will yield a huge long term reward in my strong opinion  As of 4 10 12  Antares sells for  2 98 a share  If the company is not acquired  I believe the stock price on 4 10 15 will be north of  20 00 a share   Disclosure  I am long   Additional disclosure  DISCLAIMER  This

diligence before buying and selling any stock ,2012-04-11,Scott Matusow,https://www.investing.com/analysis/antares-pharma:-a-lower-risk-small-cap-with-larger-cap-potential-119754,119754
221240,442756,PFE,Smart Investors Need to Dump This,opinion,As Warren Buffett  George Soros and so many others have said  you need to swim against the tide  finding values where others miss and shunning stocks that are loved by all    Back in the summer of 2010  agriculture firm Monsanto  NYSE    was simply loathed  Low cost Chinese competitors were eating into its Round Up herbicide franchise  farmers were up in arms over a restrictive seed usage policy  which made its way to a story on 60 Minutes   the company was headed for a 10  drop in annual sales and analysts were uniformly tepid on the stock s prospects    As I noted back then  Monsanto s  1 billion in annual research and development spending would soon make the company relevant once again  Indeed  in the subsequent fiscal year  ended August 2011   Monsanto s sales rose 13  to  11 8 billion and earnings per share  EPS  shot up a heady 49  to  2 96  Yet as you dig into just released quarterly results and start to look at where Monsanto may be headed next  you may find reasons to sell  The stock s impressive rebound has set up a clear disconnect between a fairly high valuation and slowing growth  That s what happened to major drug stocks a decade ago and may be happening to Monsanto soon    Another good quarter Monsanto just announced fiscal second quarter results that once again topped forecasts  this time with an  of  2 28  roughly 7  ahead of projections   Almost all of the upside was attributed to stronger than expected demand for corn seeds  as farmers got an early start thanks to very balmy weather this winter  Some of that strength may also extend into the current quarter as spring plantings are underway  but many analysts decided to leave their full year forecasts intact    The pull in for the planting season is expected draw demand from the summer quarter  Despite beating second quarter estimates by  0 16  analysts have boosted their fiscal  August  2012 full year estimates by just three cents to  3 54    It s the view beyond 2012 that becomes more concerning  The company is now so large  and the field so saturated  that unless Monsanto can take market share from Syngenta  NYSE     DuPont s  NYSE    Pioneer Hi Bred division or other emerging global rivals  then investors need to brace for slowing growth  The company has likely squeezed out all it can from the  ethanol play     ethanol as a fuel mandates  which led to major corn planting  are set to expire in coming years    After a good 20  growth in fiscal 2012  analysts at UBS  which rates the stock as a  neutral   recently wrote that  we expect only 13  growth in F13  then we expect less than 10  growth in F14     It s important to note that after a strong two year run  shares of Monsanto now trade for more than 20 times forward earnings  Recall that major drug companies finally stopped growing as their drug pipelines matured and new drugs failed to outpace older drugs that lost patent protection  Will that multiple compress  as UBS suggests  until Monsanto looks more like Merck  NYSE    or Pfizer  NYSE     With the exception of 2009 and 2010  when Merck completed a pair of large acquisitions  sales have not grown more than 5  at any point in the last decade  EPS in 2011 was roughly 30  lower than it was a decade ago  As a result  Merck s stock started to garner an ever lower price to earnings  P E  ratio  There s one clear connection between Monsanto and Merck  Each once spoke of a blockbuster product or two that could fuel tremendous growth  but each eventually has come to rely on a series of smaller hits to keep that ball rolling  As UBS  Andrew Cash recently noted  Monsanto s CEO is  increasingly spending more time discussing its multiple sources of future earnings  including integrated farming systems  and almost no time on new blockbuster product introductions  We believe this is code for slowing overall EPS     You can see that slowing growth by walking through updated projections provided by Merrill Lynch  After boosting EBITDA 22   to  3 05 billion  in 2011  they see EBITDA rising 19  this year  11  in fiscal 2013 and 5  in fiscal 2014    When  neutral  is a  sell  Here s the tricky thing  Nobody on Wall Street will tell you this stock is going to go down    Indeed  this is a stock that has made bullish analysts look smart in front of their clients  and they need a reason to keep getting in front of those clients if they are to secure a meeting at all  Sadly  that s what more than 10 years of working on Wall Street taught me    UBS  in laying out its concerns  only has a  neutral  rating  lest the firm s analysts end up in the doghouse with Monsanto s management  Goldman Sachs also recently lost its appetite for this stock  removing it from the firm s  Conviction List   But they still suggest the stock deserves to trade at 20 times projected fiscal 2013 EPS of  4 38  Yet as noted earlier  slowing growth more likely argues for a slowly falling multiple  Monsanto s projected rates of growth are unlikely to support an EPS  and thus  a P E ratio  that high    Risks to Consider  Monsanto still spends huge sums on R D  and those efforts may still yield another blockbuster product to bolster future sales    Action to Take     Note the phrase  slowly falling multiple   There s no reason to expect this stock to fall out of bed quickly  but it appears to have peaked after a solid two year run  A high multiple and slowing growth is never the recipe for further upside  By David

to ask the CEO of the company some questions that is part of my standard due diligence for me to make a determination whether a small cap company is worth writing about and or investing in  Later on in this article  you will find a question and answer session between me and The CEO  Dr  Paul Ashton    pSivida  PSDV  develops drug delivery products for treatment of back of the eye diseases that are administered by implantation  injection  or insertion  The company s lead product candidate includes Iluvien  licensed to Alimera Sciences  ALIM   Iluvien is an drug that is inserted into the back of the eye that delivers fluocinolone acetonide  FA  for the treatment of diabetic macular edema  DME   a cause of vision loss  Alimera received its second CRL for the drug in November 2011  so Iluvien is not approved in the US  It is uncertain whether Alimera will pursue the clinical trials that the FDA would require for resubmission  However  Iluvien has been deemed  approvable  by the seven European countries where Alimera submitted its applications  Individual approvals are expected to be received in the coming months and will enable Alimera to commence marketing of Iluvien    Alimera is also conducting Phase II clinical trials with Ilu for the treatment of wet and dry form of age related macular degeneration  and retinal vein occlusion  These trials fall under the license agreement that pSivida has with Alimera    pSivida s already FDA approved products include Retisert for the treatment of posterior uveitis  an autoimmune condition characterized by inflammation of the posterior of the eye that can cause sudden or gradual vision loss  and Vitrasert for cytomegalovirus retinitis  a blinding eye disease that occurs in individuals with advanced AIDS  Both of these are licensed to Bausch   Lomb    It is developing a Latanoprost product  an injectable  bioerodible drug delivery implant in Phase I II dose escalating study for the treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension  a Posterior Uveitis product candidate expected to start pivotal clinical trials shortly  its BioSilicon technology system  which is nano structured porous silicon designed for use as a drug delivery platform and can deliver smaller molecules  and Tethadur  which utilizes BioSilicon to deliver biologic molecules  including peptides and proteins  It has strategic collaborations with Bausch   Lomb Incorporated  Alimera Sciences   and Pfizer  PFE    PSDV s lead implant treatment is ILUVIEN  which is licensed to Alimera  The deal with Alimera in terms of outside The United States includes 20  net profits on a country by country basis and pSivida has full audit rights  If Alimera decides to partner out the European commercialization then PSDV is entitled to 33 percent of any upfront and or milestone payments and 20 percent of whatever Alimera gets in royalties    I wrote an  that covered the EU approval catalyst that was supposed to occur at the end of Q2  2012  However  Alimera has now reported a delay in this process and does not expect approval to be gained to at least until later Q3  This certainly helped to throw off my projected short term price target opinion for Alimera    It seems to me PSDV may have more to gain from the European approval  PSDV might get the bigger stock price percentage gain on the European approval news than Alimera may receive    As referenced in my Alimera article  the FDA rejected ILUVIEN on its first attempt to gain approval  and issued a complete response letter  CRL  to Alimera    After further research into PSDV  I have discovered that ILUVIEN is the not the product to be most optimistic about that PSDV is offering  Tethadur could be the company s most valuable technology according to Dr  Paul Ashton  with its potential to deliver proteins peptides and other small molecules  particularly interesting for biosimilars and biobetters  Small molecule based procedures are more cost effective thancostlier biologic methods    pSivida s Tethadur Technology is a platform drug delivery system that relies on nanostructuring to achieve optimal drug delivery  It can be used alone or in combination with pSivida s other technologies  Tethadur has  Ability to provide long term delivery of anti bodies and other proteinsHigh efficiency capacity of drug loadingControlled nanostructuring can vary nanosized pores to accommodate different molecule sizesFully bioerodible over range of time periodsUnlike most polymer based drug delivery systems  the manufacture of Tethadur does not require complex chemistry and the final product is pure silicon irrespective of the delivery characteristics imparted by the nanostructuring process    Tethadur distinguishes itself from other delivery systems by its heat and radiation stability  simplifying the manufacturing and sterilization process    pSivida is the kind of small cap bio I look for  grossly undervalued based on its technology platform and competent management    The current management team eliminated  20 million in toxic debt inherited from the Australian management predecessors  I stress this over and over  The most important factor on success and or failure of a small cap company is its management s ability to execute  Hype aside  good products mean nothing if management cannot execute correct business practices    Money management  deal making  position leverage  communication with insurance companies  and other factors can and will determine a great deal of the company s success or lack thereof  I have given the prior example of Dendreon s  DNDN  Provenge  an effective treatment for prostrate cancer  yet insurance companies were not in an effective loop to fully understand the cost of the drug  Dendreon stock went on a wild ride all over the place  from  5 a share all the way up to  57  a share  only to fall back below  8  mainly because of management s lack of proper communication  Most unfortunate  because Dendreon posesses great technology to make a real difference in the lives of many patients not only suffering from prostate cancer  but other forms of cancer as well  It does appear that Dendreon management has gotten its act together lately  but the damage was already done    Should pSivida be selling for a price of around  2 a share currently  Let s take a look at its deep pipeline of treatments and find out  With a market cap of  40 56M  pSivida is one of the most undervalued companies I have ever seen  Nothwithstanding  the Alimera partnership  and its potential partnership with Pfizer values the company at least an  80M market cap in my strong opinion  The following sums up the Pfizer agreement    In terms of the Pfizer agreement  at the moment Pfizer has no commitment to pSivida other than working with pSivida in terms of the phase I II trials using the latanaprost in the insert  At the end of the Phase II trial  Pfizer has an option to pick up the product  If Pfizer exercises that option  then they would pay pSivida  20 million and Pfizer would take the product through Phase 3  and there would be performance milestone payments and a double digit royalty rate over 10   Pfizer would then own the product  If Pfizer decides not to exercise its option  pSivida retains the right to develop and commercialize the glaucoma product on its own or with a partner  pSivida would also have royalty free use of latanaprost  Pfizer s billion dollar drug that went off patent last year  as well    Dr  Paul Ashton  CEO of pSivida  has a very solid resume of leadership as noted from his bio referenced from    Dr  Ashton was named pSivida s President and Chief Executive Officer in January 2009 and previously served as the company s Managing Director from January 2007 to January 2009 and Executive Director of Strategy from December 2005 to January 2007  From 1996 until its acquisition by pSivida in December 2005  Dr  Ashton was the President and Chief Executive Officer of Control Delivery Systems  Inc   CDS   a drug delivery company that he co founded in 1991 and that developed pSivida s Durasert technology system  Dr  Ashton previously was a joint faculty member in the Departments of Ophthalmology and Surgery at the University of Kentucky  served on the faculty of Tufts University and worked as a pharmaceutical scientist at Hoffman La Roche  Dr  Ashton s long history of leadership and strategic oversight of pSivida and CDS  his role in developing and extensive knowledge of pSivida s core technology platforms  products and product candidates  his scientific expertise including his PhD in pharmacology and strong knowledge of research and development uniquely position him to lead pSivida in the execution of its long term strategy    The following below is a question and answer session with Dr  Paul Ashton  I asked the standard questions I normally do when I am considering making an investment in a small cap growth company    Scott  Hello Dr  Ashton  thank you for taking the time to answer my questions for Seeking Alpha readers  Dr  Ashton  You are welcome Scott     1  Where do you feel the true value in your company is where Investors should focus on  2  I notice you have established a nice royalty base  do you plan to use this revenue to reinvest into the future of the company  3  What do you find is the toughest challenge for a small company like yours to overcome  4  While we know predicting the future is hard and many factors are uncertain  but where would you like to see the company in say  5 years from now  What is the mission goal of the company in that time frame  5  Do you feel your company has what it takes to eventually market your top line products on your own  is that your ultimate goal  using royalty revenue to eventually attempt to become a top line company    Dr  Ashton s answers below in sequential order    1  I think there is a lot of focus on Iluvien for Diabetic macular edema and appropriately so  however people may be overlooking the real upside  1a  Our program in posterior uveitis  3rd largest cause of blindness in the US   In uveitis we are planning to develop an injectable implant delivering the steroid Fluocinolone acetonide  This is the exact same implant already successfully reviewed by the EU regulators for DME but rejected by the FDA  Why are we so confident  This insert delivers the exact same drug as Retisert  already approved by the FDA   the new inserts are injectable while Retisert is surgically inserted and the side effect profile of the new inserts is significantly better than that of Retisert  Also we can develop this product ourselves  Also based on our discussions with the FDA we believe we can proceed directly to phase iii clinical trials with these devices  referencing all the data from the DME application  a BIG time money saver   1b  The glaucoma program hasn t received any attention  This is another low risk  high reward opportunity  We are using a bio erodible version of the Durasert technology  that underlies the Iluvien device  to deliver latanoprost  Pfizer s billion dollar glaucoma drug until the patent expired  So  it s an effective drug with a proven delivery system going after a very large market opportunity  It s in early clinical trials but as clinical data emerges I think it will get more attention    1c  It s becoming increasingly apparent  see Alcon s  ACL  recent failure of a topical drug for geographic atrophy  a form of dry AMD  Allergan s  AGN  failure of an oral for glaucoma   that a drug delivery system is needed to treat back of the eye diseases  We are the only company with a proven back of the eye delivery technology   Dr  Ashton  Sorry that s a long answer  but we have a lot going on    Scott  Understandable  I think as much detail as possible for investors to consider is a good thing    2  Yes  historically we have used our royalties and cash from license fees etc to minimize our cash burn  3  One of the biggest challenges we have is getting on the radar screen of investors  We have a couple of approved products earning royalties  a product pending marketing authorization in EU  we expect to have phase 3 ready product for uveitis very shortly and a glaucoma product already in the clinic  That seems pretty compelling to me  certainly better than many companies with a much higher market cap  I ve been told many times  if your market cap was higher you would be worth more   4  We are planning to evolve into a specialty pharma focused on ophthalmology  We plan to develop some of our own products  like for uveitis  and work with partners to develop others    Dr  Ashton  We plan to out license non ophthalmic applications of our technologies    5  We have the best technology and we are fortunate in that we are going after a new area  diseases of the back of the eye  where none of the big guys has a dominant position in the market  Also the back of the eye space can be addressed with a small sales force  there are only 1 500 retina specialists in the US  However this space now has the attention of a lot of the big players  Merck  MRK   Roche  RHHBY PK  Glaxo Smith Kline  GSK  etc  and there is a lot of consolidation  so I d imagine that we d likely be acquired before we get there  We are not planning this  but it seems to be the way things sometimes work    Scott  Thank you Dr  Ashton for taking the time to answer my questions    Dr Ashton  You are welcome Scott    We can see from the chart above  the massive move down when the FDA issued a CRL to Alimera concerning ILUVIEN  Using crude black lines  I show where the stock channel connects up  There was a catalyst run up concerning the EU approval of ILUVIEN  but that was delayed for another quarter and the stock sold off in March  Another gap up occured and has since been filled  Now it appears a tighter wedge is forming  indicating to me a move to near 2 50 is coming very soon  We see high lowers and lower highs representing the tighter wedge  The MACD has been somewhat flat  but the signal appears to be turning up  To me this seems stock holders are not willing to part with their shares at the current stock price level    Key points in my opinion why pSivida has a legit shot to become a larger cap company over time  Very low cash burn rate  about two million a Quarter  The company tries to have agreements  evaluation agreements and license agreements  basically cover their costs on their programs Nice capital structure  only about 20 million shares outstanding with an additional 5 million warrants and those are going down as groups of them expire  No debt  Cash that takes them with present programs through 2013 Opthalmology is a big area of interest as the population ages  take into account the success of Lucentis  which was developed by Genentech and is marketed in the United States by Genentech and elsewhere by Novartis  NVS   Also Regeneron s  REGN  eElea is having great success Technologies that while obviously are for opthalmology now are adaptable for other parts of the body   there is currently an evaluation agreement with the Hospital for Special Surgery in NYC for example  and their focus is orthopaedics   The uveitis program and the bioerodible version of the underlying technology of Iluvien for glaucoma with Pfizer  Pfizer is the second largest shareholder with about eight percent and have held the shares since 2007  Since Pfizer already owns around 7  of the company s stock  pSivida is an acquisition target for them in my opinion  How strong of an acquisition target I really do not know    Final opinion and price target opinions    I see a short term move to near  2 50 setting up as the overall market appears to corrected itself  and the overall macro economic condition appears to have become more stable  at least in the short term  This should translate into more of a risk on trade appearing in the market again  I also see a catalyst run up occurring as Alimera gets closer to EU approval for ILUVIEN  I am not sure when this will begin or if it has already begun  A move to  5 a share by the end of the year is not out of the question  Where the price goes from there will be dependent on many factors including what Pfizer decides to do with its arrangement with pSivida  I like the CEO here as his team wiped off all the toxic financing the prior management left for them  Dr  Ashton is straight forward and to the point  Again  having top management in a small cap company is the number   one key in determining future success of the company  It is my opinion pSivida is a strong long term buy and hold for investors who wish to be patient and wait for large long term gains    Disclosure  I have no positions in any stocks mentioned  and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours    DISCLAIMER  This article is intended for informational and entertainment use only and should

221246,442762,PFE,Cheap Is Not Always Good And Stocks As Sweaters ,opinion,Cheap Is Not Always GoodThere are many investors who hold low P E ratios as sacrosanct  To them  any stock with a high P E ratio is off limits  While some stock certainly are overvalued  like Netflix at  300  or Green Mountain at  100  many stocks with high P E ratios deserve them  Alexion Pharmaceuticals sports a P E ratio of 80  while Pfizer  the king of the pharmaceutical industry  sports a P E ratio of just under 16  Yet  over the past 5 years  Pfizer stock has not simply stagnated  it has dropped by over 22   all while Alexion rose by over 466   Investors who pounded the table saying Pfizer was cheap rode it all the way down to  20  While it is true that some stocks are simply too cheap  such as Apple or EMC  investors must always ask WHY a stock has a low P E ratio  Often  there is a reason for that  Microsoft is cheap not because it is ignored by Wall Street  but because after close scrutiny  Wall Street did not like what it saw  There is so much more to investing than P E ratios  That is merely one piece of the puzzle  And investors would do well to remember that  cheap  and  expensive  are simply matters of opinion  To truly gauge a company s suitability as an investment  one must always look beneath the surface and closely examine the company s future prospects Sentiment as a Contrarian IndicatorHistory has shown us that some of the most profitable investments are those made with a contrarian outlook  No one thought Apple would survive past 1997  but investors that ought in at that time doubled their money again and again  Buying financial stocks in March 2009 was a wonderful investment  Buffet s avoiding of dot com stocks was a great way to avoid losses  Sentiment is a great indicator of where a stock could go  but in the opposite direction  There s a rule in investing that says when retail investors pull huge sums of money out  that is the time to get in  Just as when retail investors are pouring money into the market  it is time to get out When sentiment in any one company turns extreme  we think it is time to go against the grain  A prime example of this is Netflix  For years  sentiment was extremely bullish on Netflix  and investors made huge sums of money on the stock  And if you got out in time  you made large sums of money too  But now  the sentiment surrounding Netflix is exactly the opposite  Everyone is predicting doom for the company  We see that as a contrarian buy signal  as long as you believe the company will survive  The bulls have had their success with Netflix  So have the bears  Now  we believe it is time for the bulls to be in the drivers seat once again Stocks as SweatersFor all the complexities in the stock market  sometimes simple analogies can provide us with clarification  Investors would do well to think of stocks as sweaters  You wouldn t buy a sweater if it was too expensive right  If the quality matched the price  then perhaps you would  That is the case with companies such as Chipotle  or lululemon  They may be expensive  but these  sweaters  are worth it  Then  there are sweaters you want to buy  but they re simply too expensive  Companies like Alexion or salesforce may be good  but the  sweaters  are simply not worth the price  Then there are sweaters that have gotten too cheap to ignore  Companies like Akamai  Akamai used to be overpriced  but now it is simply undervalued  pricing in a doomsday scenario  However  some  sweaters  should be avoided  no matter how far in the clearance aisle they are in  Companies like RIM and Microsoft may be cheap  but they are cheap for a reason  You don t want to be seen wearing rags do you  Just as you don t want to be seen as getting ripped off buying some overpriced sweater  But  if its a luxurious sweater  than you will be the talk of the town  The lesson is  know your price  know the most that you are willing to pay for a stock  and know when to hand that sweater off to someone else ,2011-11-23,Helix Investment Management,https://www.investing.com/analysis/cheap-is-not-always-good-and-stocks-as-sweaters-106549,106549
221247,442763,PFE,PROLOR Biotech  A Top Takeover Candidate,opinion,Billionaire Phillip Frost is an esteemed entrepreneur and philanthropist who built his fortune from pharmaceuticals  His success in the field  in my view  is unrivaled  his story  a classic  Fortunately for investors  Frost is still active in healthcare companies  He currently chairs PROLOR Biotech  an emerging biopharmaceutical firm that is trading significantly below intrinsic value with favorable risk reward  as evidenced by comparable past buyout multiples  PROLOR is engaged in the biosimilars and biobetters space  developing new forms of perviously approved biologic therapeutics  Since products are not coming from scratch  valuing a business like PROLOR is much less speculative than it is for other biotech companies  At the same time  the firm s products have relatively minimal time to commercialization  since clinical trials use short term biological parameter readouts and are not dependent on primary endpoints from outcome measures The company employs Carboxyl Terminal Peptide  CTP  technology to develop new forms of previously approved biologic therapeutics  CTP  a small peptide that is naturally found in hCG  is attached to other proteins to significantly increase longevity with minimal risk  Further limiting downside  this technology is being leveraged for diverse solutions  thus providing the kind of safety and breadth that is heavily demanded by large biopharmaceutical companies  In particular  I see Merck   Co   MRK  and Pfizer  PFE  as possible suitors  Merck  for example  has licenses for 4 fertility focused proteins while PROLOR has licenses for all other human therapeutics of natural or non natural sequence  Pfizer  on the other hand  has a weak pipeline among pharmaceuticals and buying out PROLOR would yield substantial revenues synergies by opening the target s products to sizable patient populations Perhaps one of the most important factors to consider when investing in biotechnology is market potential and diversity in the portfolio  A winner in both concerns  PROLOR has major developments in hemophilia  weight loss  multiple sclerosis  and human growth hormone  Accordingly  the firm has a very  strong buy  rating on the Street and Morgan Joseph places the price target at  16  representing a 280  premium Consider  for example  that PROLOR is developing the first FDA approved long acting hGH  hGH CTP has a market potential of  3B annually and has already indicated safety advantages and strong efficacy  Phase II clinical trials indicated that hGH CTP could produce results with much fewer injections than what is currently marketed  ie  weekly  possibly even twice monthly  versus daily   Patients in all three cohorts showed average IGF 1 levels returning to normal range on all of the days when there was an assessment  In addition  hGH CTP has indicated a very strong pharmacokinetic profile  which contributes to safety and ease in dosing  Having aggressively secured patents around everything from the composition of hGH CTP to production and manufacturing  PROLOR has the solid IP protection that will be attractive to a larger biopharmaceutical company weary about risk  The hGH CTP program is scheduled to enter Phase III trials in 2012 Now consider that Roche earlier acquired Marcadia Biotech for  287M upfront in cash and  250M more if the target s diabetes drugs meet certain milestones  PROLOR is trading at nearly a quarter of this potential value while offering a substitute   long acting oxyntomulin MOD 6030   in addition to a variety of high growth versions of therapeutic proteins  Factor VIIa CTP and Factor IX CTP  for example  have a cumulative potential market of  2B  growing 14  annually  These hemophilia solutions have already indicated superior longer acting and clotting activity in preclinical trills  The market has yet to fully rationalize such a favorable context In conclusion  I find myself in agreement with the Street that the company represents a very attractive value play  While solid IP protection and a diverse biosimilar   biobetter market provide meaningful safety  undervaluation of the parts compared to past buyouts provide significant upside  2012 is likely to be a favorable inflection point for PROLOR and opening a long position is recommended sooner rather than later Disclosure  I may open a long position in PBTH  Writing is paid  but research is independent  All views expressed herein are my own ,2011-12-06,Takeover Analyst,https://www.investing.com/analysis/prolor-biotech:-a-top-takeover-candidate-107900,107900

221249,442765,PFE,PROLOR  An Upside Story,opinion,PROLOR Biotech is one of the hottest stocks on the Street with significant upside  limited downside  and a well deserved  strong buy  rating from equity analysts  According to Raghuram Selvaraju  Ph D   of Morgan Joseph  2012 should be a transformational year for PROLOR  in our view  with one Phase 3 project  two Phase 2 candidates  and one Phase 1 candidate all moving forward simultaneously   PROLOR has solid liquidity with a current ratio of 9 5 and a net cash position of  17 6M  which represents 7 6  of market value  Add in innovative platform technologies  relatively short and safe clinical trials  a stellar pipeline  multi billion dollar market potential  and backing from the industry s most successful investor   PROLOR is simply trading well below intrinsic value  I find that  based on industry standard numbers  the hGH CTP and MOD 6030 blockbuster products alone indicate 420  upside for the emerging biotech company  Let s review hGH CTPThis product will be the first FDA approved long acting version of human growth hormone and target a  3B market that is growing 7  annually  In the Phase II study  hGH CTP demonstrated a strong pharmacokinetic profile and that it could be injected just weekly to return patients  average IGF 1 levels to normal range  This is stunning in light of the backdrop that all of the available products require daily injection  Pfizer  PFE   Eli Lilly   Co   LLY   Roche  RHHBY   Merck Serono  and Novo Nordisk  NVO  are behind in this development and  in my view  will inevitably   and aggressively   seek a partnership with PROLOR  Thankfully  the company has solid IP protection as it has secured hGH CTP with patents to everything from the product s composition to its manufacturing  2012 is likely to be an inflection point for PROLOR as Phase III begins DCF Analysis  Considering the standard average for Phase III partnership deals is around 20  in royalties and assuming 35  penetration into the  3B market  PROLOR s take is  200M for the immediate 12 months forward  This will further compound 7  annually from market growth  to say nothing about other business deals  Discounting the stream of free cash flow backwards using the capital asset pricing model and accounting for risks yields a net present value of around  1B for hGH CTP  This matches the valuation derived from assuming 5x sales   too low  if anything  considering the growth potential  Put differently  the hGH CTP product warrants PROLOR being worth at least  18 50 per share MOD 6030This diabetes type II drug is a long acting version of oxyntomodulin and similarly would be heavily demanded in a buyout  According to the American Diabetes Association  8 3  of individuals in the United States have diabetes  The World Health Organization estimates that 346M people worldwide are affected   more than 5  of the population  Having demonstrated superiority to oxyntomodulin in weight loss and reduction of food intake  MOD 6030 is yet another under appreciated asset of the rising biotech firm Analysis  One can only assume that if a drug has better efficacy and safety than its analogues  it is only fair that it be worth more  Two improvements on oxyntomodulin have had deals that indicate the undervaluation of MOD 6030  In 2010  Roche acquired Marcadia Biotech for an implied value of  537M in order to gain rights to the lead compound  preclinical GLP 1 Glucagon dual receptor agonist  Then in 2011  Zealand Pharma reached an agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim over another preclinical version of oxyntomodulin  This deal was worth  57M in payments for the first 2 years and  480M more in milestones  Thus  improved oxyntomodulin variants are priced at a minimum of  200M for preclinical versions  Accordingly  PROLOR s MOD 6030 is worth at least  3 70 per share Still more Based on just MOD 6030 and hGH CTP  the stock should be valued at  22 20   significantly above the present market price  But investors should consider PROLOR s other strengths  Factor VIIa CTP and Factor IX CTP are two hemophilia treatments that target a market of  2B   one that is compounding 14  annually  Preclinical trials have already indicated superior length and clotting activity  As hemophilia is an orphan disease  these variants will offer premium pricing and smoothly transition to the market PROLOR also employs Carboxyl Terminal Peptide technology to develop biosimilars  Merck has licenses for 4 fertility focused proteins while PROLOR has licenses for all other human therapeutics of natural or non natural sequence  CTP technology is being leveraged in diverse applications and is heavily demanded by larger biopharmaceutical companies in need of pipeline innovation  Investors should further be mindful about the limited risk that PROLOR offers  Whereas novel drugs are often a hit or a miss  biosimilars and biobetters face more certainty in terms of returns  PROLOR operates in the latter universe  which enables products to have minimal time to commercialization with clinical trials not being dependent on primary endpoints from outcome measures Finally  in light of the favorable risk reward highlighted above  it is important to stress that a lack of news flow and behavioral anomalies are the main reasons for the company s undervaluation  It is only a matter of time   in my view and those of other analysts   before the fundamentals shift the stock price skyward to its rightful place  In closing  I would like to reiterate Morgan Joseph s comment in their November 29  2011  buy  call  which still holds true  We advise investors to take advantage of recent weakness to aggressively accumulate shares   Disclosure,2012-01-02,Takeover
