149484,371000,FISV,Why Fiserv Stock Gained 57  in 2019,news,"What happened
Fiserv  NASDAQ FISV  outpaced a booming market last year as the stock jumped 57  compared to a 29  spike in the S P 500  according to data provided by S P Global Market Intelligence 
The stock had been modestly beating the market for much of the year  but those gains were supercharged following news of its acquisition of First Data Corporation 

So what
That  22 billion deal was part of a wave of consolidation in the fintech space and lifted Wall Street s hopes that Fiserv could profit materially from payments processing and the war on cash  The company s 2019 earnings results supported that bullish assessment  with revenue rising 6  through the fiscal third quarter and operating margin improving by a full percentage point to 29 1  of sales  
Now what
In early November  Fiserv lifted its 2019 outlook on both earnings and sales growth following the closing of its acquisition of First Data  Management now sees core sales rising by 6  rather than 5  and earnings jumping by between 16  and 17   as opposed to the initial target range of between 10  and 14  
These brightening trends imply further gains for the stock in 2020  but that s assuming continued robust growth and no major negative surprises as the team works to integrate the First Data unit into the wider business ",2020-01-13,The Motley Fool,https://invst.ly/phduj,2058030

Prepared Remarks 
OperatorWelcome to the Fiserv 2019 Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call   Operator Instructions At this time  I will turn the call over to Peter Poillon  Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv Peter Poillon    Senior Vice President  Investor RelationsThank you  Ivy  Good afternoon  everyone  With me today are Jeff Yabuki  our Chairman and Chief Executive  Frank Bisignano  our President and Chief Operating Officer  and Bob Hau  our Chief Financial Officer Our earnings release and supplemental presentation for the quarter and full year are available on the Investor Relations section of fiserv com  Our remarks today will include forward looking statements about  among other matters  expected operating and financial results  strategic initiatives  and expected benefits and synergies from our recent acquisition of First Data Forward looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  You should refer to our earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors  Please refer to our materials for today s call for an explanation of non GAAP financial measures discussed in this call along with a reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures  Unless stated otherwise  performance references made throughout this call are year over year comparisons and all references to internal revenue growth are on a constant currency basis Also note that non GAAP financial measures  included in our earnings release and supplemental materials  include the fourth quarter of 2018 and full year 2019 and 2018 results for First Data  which have been prepared by making certain adjustments to the sum of historical First Data and Fiserv GAAP financial information  For additional historical combined financial information  please refer to the Form 8 K which we filed on October 3rd As a reminder  we ll host an investor conference on March 25th in New York City  We expect the presentation to run from about 8 30 AM to noon and we ll also host a launch following the program  We look forward to seeing you at this important event And now I ll turn the call over to Jeff Jeffery W  Yabuki    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Jeff  and good afternoon  It s wonderful to be here today discussing the creation of new Fiserv through best in class integration  We are making great progress serving clients  enhancing our growth profile through revenue synergies and moving the needle on cost actions At the same time  as you can see from our strong 2019 results  we remain focused on profitably growing our existing business to deliver shareholder value  We were excited to start the new decade by being named as a Fortune Magazine World s Most Admired Company for the seveth year in a row  This recognition is a testament to the hard work  dedication  and commitment of our associates around the world  I m personally very proud to be part of this team As you know we set initial five year target of at least  500 million of revenue synergies and  900 million of cost benefits  The punch line remains that we are highly confident in achieving these targets and continue to identify ways in which we can overachieve in terms of both quantum and timing We continue to advance a growing list of revenue synergies designed to deliver additional client value and incremental revenue growth  These initiatives represent a solid mix of near  and long term opportunities  which should enable us to serve clients in a way that will drive enhanced growth and profitability for Fiserv over the next decade We continue to see better than expected results in our bank merchant program for Fiserv account processing clients  We signed 44 new clients in the fourth quarter  more than tripling the signings in Q3 and signed over 50 for the year  We are seeing a good balance between de novo programs and competitive takeaways which are running about one third of the signings  higher than anticipated at this stage We exited the year with more than 300 institutions in the pipeline and continue to believe we will exceed the  200 million revenue synergy target for this very important initiative  In addition to bank merchant services  there is a large opportunity to cross sell solutions around the world where one or both of the original firms has an influential relationship  Examples include CheckFree  Dovetail payment hub  DNA  credit card processing  and Output Solutions  We continue to be bullish on the revenue synergy opportunities emerging from network innovation  The combination of STAR and ACCEL as the third largest debit network in the US provides us with significant opportunity to differentiate with issuers and merchants Importantly  we are on track to deliver at least  100 million of revenue synergies in 2020 and are well on track to meet or exceed our initial  500 million revenue target  We are also making excellent progress against our cost synergy objective of at least  900 million  Our initial focus is to streamline our cost structure through enhanced efficiency  increased operational rigor  and a significant focus on our  4 billion of annual vendor spend We attained  46 million of cost synergies in 2019 and are continuing to grow a level of annualized run rate savings  We expect incremental cost synergies of more than  300 million in 2020 and given the combination of visibility and actions to date also anticipate very strong cost synergy performance in 2021  We are pleased with our performance to date and have increasing confidence in our objective to exceed the original synergy targets over the five year period  We will provide a full update of both cost and revenue synergy targets at our March investor conference Since the time of the transaction announcement  we have gotten questions on how the original Fiserv operational effectiveness program would intersect with the cost synergy program  We see a number of opportunities to operate our business more efficiently  while enhancing our client experience through innovation  such as RPA  cloud  and process reengineering  which we believe will also provide additional economic opportunity beyond the cost synergy program An important 2020 priority is to continue working collaboratively with Bank of America on the joint venture dissolution which is slated for June 2020  The discussions are progressing very well  and both parties are focused on ensuring the delivery of great service to our shared clients  We continue to believe that the financial impact of the BAMS separation will be generally accretive to our results over the next few years Overall  there is nothing more important than delivering on the promise of new Fiserv  Our unifying purpose across the enterprise is to build an extraordinary company for our clients  associates  and shareholders With that let me turn the call over to Bob to provide detail on our financial results Robert  Bob  Hau    Chief Financial Officer and TreasurerThank you  Frank  and good afternoon  Let me start off by saying that we feel great about our financial performance and have confidence in our ability to create sustained value for clients and shareholders Internal revenue growth was 5   as expected in the quarter  and 6  for the year  We were pleased to see modest contributions from our revenue synergies  which we believe will accelerate to at least  100 million in 2020  Adjusted operating income increased 7  to  1 2 billion in the quarter and was up 8  to  4 3 billion for the year  which includes an early contribution from synergies Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was up 100 basis points to 31 4   The improvement was driven by a combination of continued revenue growth  the lapping of prior year s tax reinvestment  and the early benefits from synergies  partially offset by the expected lower periodic revenue compared to the fourth quarter of last year  Adjusted operating margin for the full year was up 100 basis points to 29 7   driven by improved revenue growth  cost efficiencies  and a modest impact from early synergy realization Adjusted earnings per share was up a very strong 18  to  1 13 in the quarter and increased 16  to  4 for the year  which also marked our 34th consecutive year of double digit adjusted EPS growth  These results include a negative impact from foreign currency of  0 02 and  0 11 per share for the quarter and full year  respectively  As you know  we intend to modify our segment structure in 2020  and we ll report our future results on that basis  We expect to file an 8 K in March that will provide the new segments along with comparable financial information on a quarterly basis for 2018 and 2019 Now on to the segments  Internal revenue growth in the First Data segment continued to be strong at 6  in the quarter and 7  for the year  This performance included outstanding results in the former GBS segment  delivering 9  growth in the quarter and 10  for the full year  Internal revenue growth in GBS North America was a very solid 6  in both the quarter and year  And as we mentioned in our Q3 call  we don t intend to provide this level of subsegment detail beginning in 2020 Global merchant acquiring  both at the physical point of sale and in digital markets were important contributors to our 2018 growth with strong performance in India  Brazil  and Argentina  Additionally  we saw solid performance in our domestic business  including continuing strength in our digital commerce solutions  Our ISV partners grew by more than 25  for the year translating to almost 25 000 new ISV merchant locations  Importantly  the number of global contracted merchant locations in 2019 expanded by double digits We also continued to expand our leadership position in card issuing with worldwide accounts on file up solidly in the mid single digits for the full year  Segment adjusted operating income increased 6  to  708 million in the quarter and was up 5  to  2 7 billion for the year  Adjusted operating margin in the segment was up 50 basis points to 31 9  in the quarter and 30 7  for the year  driven primarily by strong revenue growth The original Fiserv Payments segment delivered the internal revenue growth of 4  in the quarter and 5  for the year impacted  as expected  in the quarter by lower periodic revenue  We saw strong segment growth performance in card services  output solutions  and some early network revenue synergy benefits Adjusted operating income for the segment was excellent  growing 12  to  353 million in the quarter and up 11  to  1 3 billion for the year  Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was outstanding  up a very strong 250 basis points to 39  and was up 70 basis points to 36 3  in the year  This increase was generally from growth in high quality revenue  the reduction of last year s tax funded investments  and the benefits from productivity and early synergy performance Transactional businesses performed well with debit transactions up in the high single digits for the quarter and year and Mobiliti ASP subscribers increased 11  in the quarter to more than  9 million  P2P transactions  which includes both Popmoney and Zelle  continued their rapid growth  doubling versus Q4 last year and up 18  sequentially  Zelle transactions tripled in 2019  and the number of live clients increased tenfold compared to a year ago  Zelle signings were also very strong for the year  almost doubling to more than 360  which included 112 in the fourth quarter alone Internal revenue in the Financial segment for the quarter was flat  as expected  driven by much lower periodic revenue  partially offset by gains in high quality recurring revenue  For the full year internal revenue growth was up a solid 3   led by our account and item processing businesses  Adjusted operating income in the Financial segment was flat in the quarter at  207 million and was up 1  to  805 million for the year  Adjusted operating margin was up 40 basis points in the quarter to 34 1  with the benefit of growing recurring revenue and operational effectiveness more than offsetting the impact of lower periodic revenue  Adjusted operating margin for the full year was up 20 basis points to 33   which is the highest level attained in the last several years  The adjusted corporate operating loss in the quarter was flat to the prior year at  100 million and down 11  to  414 million for the full year  primarily due to a combination of cost synergies and operational efficiency benefits in both original companies The adjusted effective tax rate came in slightly better than expected at 22 8  for the quarter and 21 4  for the year  primarily due to higher than expected benefits and stock based compensation  Due to the transaction close  we expect this benefit to be reduced in 2020 and become a bit of a tax rate headwind with the largest impact likely in Q1  Accordingly  we expect our adjusted effective tax rate for 2020 to be in the range of 22  to 23  Free cash flow of  984 million in the quarter was driven by a combination of strong operating results and some benefit from settlement timing in our merchant business  Full year free cash flow was up a very strong 16  to  3 3 billion and free cash flow conversion was 118   We expect to see continued free cash flow benefits from the utilization of the First Data tax NOL in 2020  We repurchased 2 2 million shares for  238 million in the quarter and 4 2 million shares for nearly  400 million in the year  We are pleased to have reentered a more regular cadence on share repurchase  which should carry into 2020  As of December 31st  we had 680 million shares outstanding and 22 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase Total debt outstanding  which is about 78  fixed rate  was  21 9 billion and debt to adjusted EBITDA was 3 8 times as of December 31st  We repaid nearly  600 million of debt in the quarter  and we remain committed to returning our historic leverage level within 18 to 24 months through a combination of debt repayment and strong EBITDA growth In December  we announced an agreement to sell a 60  interest in our Investment Services business to Motive Partners  Along with entering into a joint venture  we expect to receive approximately  510 million of net after tax proceeds from the sale  which will be primarily redeployed to share repurchase  Overall  the net expected dilution from our four  Phonetic  2019 divestitures should be about  0 05 in 2020 We will continue to use our portfolio management discipline to ensure we have the optimum mix of businesses to deliver sustained client and shareholder value in your company  In conjunction with the First Data merger  we recorded a non cash impairment charge in the GAAP results in the quarter associated with an international core account processing platform  Lastly  using the midpoint of our 2020 adjusted EPS guidance  we will have already achieved  approximately 25  accretion from the First Data transaction  We will remain on track to meet or exceed our commitment of more than 40  accretion over the five year synergy period With that let me turn the call over to Jeff Jeffery W  Yabuki    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThanks  Bob  As we mentioned upfront  market momentum continued in Q4 with a 15  increase in sales for the second quarter in a row and with strong performance across several areas  including bank solutions  card services  merchant solution  and biller  The Q4 results are even more noteworthy considering original Fiserv sales results in the comparable period were at a record level  On a combined basis  sales was up 10  for the year and our pipeline remained strong  We are seeing synergy opportunities grow as the market explorers the benefits of new Fiserv  which we believe will lead to incremental revenue growth in 2020 and beyond For original Fiserv  integrated sales was up 41  sequentially and up 5  for the year  During the fourth quarter  we achieved  11 million of operational effectiveness benefits and  47 million of savings in 2019  which completes our five year  250 million program one year early  As you know  we provided a preliminary view of 2020 performance in Q3 and our actual 2020 outlook is right in line with that preview We expect constant currency internal revenue growth of 6  to 8  for the year with growth rate acceleration coming from continuing strength in our global merchant business  the cumulative impact of sales and implementations  and the achievement of in year revenue synergies  We expect 2020 adjusted earnings per share growth of 23  to 27   or  4 86 to  5 02  after  Phonetic  revised 2019 result of  3 95  which reflects the net divestiture impact Bob mentioned earlier  Our outlook also contains negative FX impact of approximately  0 07 to  0 08 per share  which is incremental to the decline in 2019  We expect adjusted operating margin to expand by at least 250 basis points and that free cash flow conversion will be greater than 112  for the year For modeling purposes  we expect our Q1 results to be pressured by the comparison against last year s strongest quarter  which also had a high level of non recurring and periodic revenue  Additionally  we expect revenue growth and earnings to build sequentially throughout the year as action plans are executed and cost and revenue synergies fold into our results  Overall  we expect the quantum of these benefits and the impact to our P L to be sustainably higher in the second half of the year  which should also provide a strong jumping off point as we enter 2021 2019 was a watershed year for Fiserv  We were again named a World s Most Admired Company  achieved our 34th consecutive year of double digit earnings per share growth  and most importantly acquired First Data in a market defining transaction that significantly advanced our aspiration of moving money and information in a way that moves the world We re excited to enter a new decade of growth and opportunity  We believe we have assembled the strongest client centric solutions in the industry  the best associate team  and are focused on delivering above market returns for you  our shareholders  As we close  let me thank our more than 40 000 talented associates around the world who work relentlessly to serve clients and to deliver Fiserv at our best With that Ivy  let s open the line for questions Questions and Answers Operator Operator Instructions  Our first question in queue is Brett Huff from Stephens  Your line is open Brett Huff    Stephens  Inc     AnalystJust quick questions on  as we look and kind of enumerate  and  Frank  you talked a little bit about this  as you think about the various categories of revenue synergies  you mentioned network synergies  card issuing  things like that  Would you order the priority of those for us and now that you ve kind of been at this for six months or so  and give us a little bit more color on each of those buckets Frank J  Bisignano    President and Chief Operating OfficerWell  bank merchant and the merchant opportunity we would put at the highest level  And you see that performing and how we re signing it up  And when Jeff and I thought about this  we always thought that we would have a strategic advantage with the Clover platform  and that ll create a privileged position in core processing  account processing  and along with our deep bank relationships Second  the bringing together of the used two networks is a very  very unique opportunity that takes us    we were already  in some cases  number three when you put it together  we re a powerful number three  But we have this merchant business is that affords our clients opportunity  So you re watching the client centricity of these opportunities that are good for our shareholders and good for our clients  And then the ability to take the privileged positions both companies had with the long list of assets  Output is a very strong product  We know that we can have CheckFree and our payments of Dovetail  all those are very strong opportunities and the cross sell And as Jeff talked about  the market reaction is every time we re together with the client  we get this very deep feeling of even more we can do for them  And we look forward to Investor Day talk in more deeply about that Jeffery W  Yabuki    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Brett  I would say  I think Frank is exactly right  The only other thing I would say is as we continue to have the privilege of spending more time together  we are identifying more and more unique opportunities  We currently have more than 80 different revenue synergy opportunities in play  and that list continues to grow And so the beauty of this is not only do we see opportunities to deliver value  as we ve talked about  whether it s in the bank merchants and network and Output  kind of  some of the nearer in opportunities  But the ability to drive continuing value through the wonderful solutions and people that we have in the organization  we re increasingly bullish  and again  we ll spend more time on that in March Brett Huff    Stephens  Inc     AnalystMy quick follow up is the longer    the bigger picture  longer term idea of owning both the funding account and the merchant point of sale  That was I know one of the things on the list that intrigued you about the combination  Again  as you re six months into this  what is your view on that  Has it changed  Has it evolved at all  Gotten more concrete Jeffery W  Yabuki    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAnd I would say that it continues to evolve  We believe that there is again kind of an even more increased privileged position where you can have access to the transactional account with all of the evolution that s happening in the payment space around real time money movement  And we continue to see that as a very interesting future opportunity and that would be incremental to the kinds of opportunities that we see today  And so we continue to be very excited about that OperatorNext  David Koning with Baird  Your line is open David Koning    Robert W  Baird   Co   Inc     AnalystI guess my first question  When we think of 6  to 8  growth  I mean that s very encouraging  And is it both segments  both Fiserv and First Data  accelerating  Like is Fiserv is going to be 5  ish and First Data 7  to 9   Is that kind of what we should be thinking of Jeffery W  Yabuki    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  So  Dave  I would say that  as Bob talked about  we will be moving away from our traditional segment structure and we ll move to new segmentation  and we would expect each of those areas to continue to grow  I would say  if you went back to the old kind of the original structures  we would expect to see our payments    our payment segment have incremental growth really driven by strength in our digital and mobile capabilities in Zelle  in network  some of those areas  So around card    sorry  around card processing on balance  So we would expect that to grow As we ve talked about before  we would expect to see some level of improvement in the traditional financial segment  But as you know  that segment both produces good solid returns and margins on a stand alone basis  but also does the double duty of being a hub for us to deliver future and integrated value through other solutions  whether it be bank merchant  card  or any of the other capabilities that we have  So a longer answer  but yes  we would expect to see acceleration in each of the different traditional segments on balance David Koning    Robert W  Baird   Co   Inc     AnalystAnd just a quick follow up  Free cash flow incredibly strong  over 112  I think is what you said you re guiding to  And I know that include a little bit of NOL  Is there a way to think of what that is without the NOL maybe on a longer term basis  Is it still like 105  or something like that Jeffery W  Yabuki    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI would say    and Bob will certainly add in here  there is no reason to believe that our free cash flow performance will be below what it had been historically David Koning    Robert W  Baird   Co   Inc     AnalystOkay  Okay Jeffery W  Yabuki    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWhich is in that range Robert  Bob  Hau    Chief Financial Officer and TreasurerYeah  absolutely right way to look at it  And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks  Dave  we ve got the NOL benefit repeating  reoccurring in 2020  and have expectation of at least 112  long standing above 100  for the company going back many  many years  Expect to see that going forward Jeffery W  Yabuki    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I would say  Dave  the only other caveat to keep in mind  and it s not an annual caveat  but it s a quarterly caveat in that depending on the days that the quarter s end and everything else  you could have some merchant settlement moving up and down  So you ll have a little bit more of that between quarters  But on an annual basis  we are absolutely committed to running free cash ahead of normal earnings OperatorNext we have Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research  Your line is open Darrin Peller    Wolfe Research LLC    AnalystI just want to start off  the Q4 results  if you normalize for the periodic revenues you talked about  I guess what would you    what kind of impact that had on the quarter s internal growth of 5   And then just thinking about the outlook  the 6  to 8  range  I mean  what would go right for the top end of that  What do you expect to be    are you just being conservative for the 6  part of  Just a little bit more color would be great Jeffery W  Yabuki    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSure  So if you think about the    it s hard to talk about it in terms of the entire business because obviously a fair amount of the periodic revenue comes out of the traditional or the original Fiserv business  But in the original Fiserv business  it s kind of a little bit more than a point of revenue growth  We gave up because of the periodic revenue  And we also have had a drag most of the year in our biller solutions business where we had a large client grow over from the prior year And so those kinds of negatives are running through    certainly running through Q4 and did have an impact  Again  consistent with what we laid out in Q3  but on an absolute basis  that would have been the case  Going into 2020  we feel really good about where we sit  We had 15  sales growth in Q4  We had 15  sales growth in Q3  And one of the great things about that is we were worried what might happen when the market frees up and what we saw is very strong growth  And so that 30  growth in the last six months of the year  we ll start to see some of that roll in  And one of the levers that could move us up on the continuum is faster implementations  faster growth of those clients  As you know  almost all of our clients end up ramping up I think the other thing would be  do we see higher levels of performance outside the US than we re planning for today  I think that could move us up on the continuum  And I think the last thing would be faster realization of revenue synergies  And so as Frank talked about  whether it s bank merchant  network  output  those kinds of areas could all conspire to have higher growth  kind of move us up to the top end  But nothing has changed from where we sat at Q3  We think this range is prudent  but our perspective  this is still the same as it was in Q3 Darrin Peller    Wolfe Research LLC    AnalystJust one quick follow up  The 40  growth in Clover  I mean  that continues to be extremely strong  And is that still just the organic trend of follow through from what First Data has already built or are you starting to see some benefit from cross selling through the Fiserv banks or any other cross sell on that front Jeffery W  Yabuki    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI would say that there has been exactly no impact on the Clover GPV growth  In fact  each of the quarters for the year Clover grew above 40   really stellar performance  and annualized run rate in excess of  100 billion  So we feel quite good about that  And while we re excited about the progress that we ve made on bank merchant  there s really been no contribution yet  And really  I don t think we ll start to see any movement in contribution until the second half of next year  And even that will take time to ramp  as you ve seen it up in Clover  Historically it was the great work that Frank and the team has done  But we do believe that s going to be a meaningful tailwind to growth over the next several years OperatorNext we have David Togut from Evercore ISI  Your line is open David Togut    Evercore  Inc     AnalystAs you sit down with your bank and credit union CEOs to discuss 2020 spending priorities  first  what would you characterize as the top spending priorities for your bank and credit union clients  And how does your solution set match up against those And then number two  how would you characterize the overall demand environment for 2020 in the core Fiserv financial sector based upon your conversations with the bank and credit union CEO Jeffery W  Yabuki    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI would say that the priorities for financial institutions in the US are continuing as they were  I would say everything digital  whether it is on the consumer side  the small business side  the commercial side  that s really job one  continuing to make the institutions more efficient through straight through processing  right  digital really requires a straight through processing  We re seeing a lot of discussion around money movement  Frank made reference to the Dovetail Payments Hub as one of the interesting cross sell opportunities that we have as a result of the combination  That s really illustrative of modernizing the back office  So we continue to see that as a important priority And then third  I would say  it s all about cyber  making sure that banks are doing everything they can to solidify their position around safety and soundness  right  which is instrumental to the banking system  So I would say  those would be the top 3 priorities  We re also seeing some modernization going on behind the scenes around the infrastructure that s required to operate in a digital kind of a    think about a digital real time 24 7 world  But that is still secondary to the first three items that we talked about So that trend continues  We think we are very well positioned in what we are doing today around digital  We ve been talking about it for a while  whether it s around Mobiliti  our Architect solution  it s helping to reenergize the account processing  the core banking space  both in the bank and credit union side  We re making a lot of progress in our security solutions and some of our other solutions that are around safety and soundness  So again  good progress there  And third  payments have been a big deal for us  And so we continue to make progress overall I would say that on balance the spend environment  if you would have asked me six months ago given where interest rates were moving  I would have thought that we would see a more muted spend environment  The spend environment has actually held up  I think part of it is we re getting used to a lower spread world  and banks realize they have to continue to spend  You  of course  are seeing discretionary spending being pulled from places that may not be in the top priorities  but on balance  we remain bullish going into 2020 on the spend front with that segment of the base  including the synergy work  bank merchant  and other areas  we are bullish and optimistic going into the year OperatorRamsey El Assal from Barclays  your line is open Ramsey El Assal    Barclays Capital  Inc     AnalystI wanted to ask about the competitive takeaways specifically on the merchant services cross sell into the banks  How can you kind of characterize the sort of secret ingredient to picking off those relationships  Is it Clover  Is it more just focused sales attention  Is it bundling with other services  Like what s giving you the sort of torque in those negotiations in order to sort of pick customers Jeffery W  Yabuki    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo I would say that we have for years talked about the importance of the core processing as a hub to a strategically privileged relationship  And so I would say  at the top of the house is that relationship that we have with clients  However  it s really been complemented beautifully by the technological innovation that Clover brings to the party and offers banks an opportunity to bring Apple like innovation to their commercial clients  to their small businesses  So from that perspective  those two items have been very important Thirdly  because of the privileged position we have  we ve been driving deeper integration  integration into digital capability  integration into commercial cash management  And we re working on innovation into our Notifi alerting hub  We re working on innovation that s going to allow banks to have deeper relationships with these small businesses and commercial customers So from that perspective  I would say that combination is what s allowed us to get off to such a good start  both as Frank talked about  in the de novo space as well as in the competitive space  So on balance  good  And we re also seeing    I would have anticipated or I did anticipate that we would see smaller banks take the lead  And while they have  almost 20  of the conversions are institutions that are greater than  1 billion of assets  So from that perspective  we feel good about the place and the reaction from the market Ramsey El Assal    Barclays Capital  Inc     AnalystAnd then in light of some of the recent divestiture activity  how would you describe the collection of assets that you have now under the combined companies  Is it sort of where you want it to be  or should we expect kind of a steady stream of incremental divestitures as we move forward Jeffery W  Yabuki    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Ramsey  we re still in the process of reviewing strategic fit and really making sure that we have the bandwidth to put effort into some of these businesses  So if you take the investment services business which was obviously the large divestiture we announced in the fourth quarter  we think that s a fantastic business  We think with the right leadership and the right capital that that is a wonderful business  which is why we kept 40  of the business  But we believed it needed additional management and the opportunity cost for us was too great given everything we have that Bob and Frank and I have been talking about So from that perspective that was important  I would say that while you may see us do some trimming over time  we re not sitting here with a list of big divestitures that are coming  We re really looking and we like our portfolio a lot  I think we talked about it  We think we actually have the best solution set in the industry in terms of growth capability  but really most important around client centricity and the ability to move our clients forward with our solution OperatorJeff Cantwell from Guggenheim Securities  Your line is open Jeff Cantwell    Guggenheim Securities LLC    AnalystJeff  you just touched on this  but wanted to ask you on something about what you re seeing right now on the Fiserv side of the platform  And clearly  you seem to have made a number of moves over the past couple of years  which position Fiserv quite well to capture market share  And so I was just wondering if you could frame something for us  Where are you seeing the most significant change in client demand over time  Is it coming to you from smaller financial institutions  is it coming from mid size FIs  Maybe it s coming from larger FIs  I was just curious if you can help us figure that out because we re just trying to figure out who s capturing share in each of the buckets  Looking at it like that  So would be great if you could give us your thoughts on where you think you re taking share Jeffery W  Yabuki    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI would say that we are taking share on balance in the areas where we have market strength  and I use that descriptor because it s less about is it in the small end of the base or in the large end of the base  and when I say the base  I mean the market  sorry  And instead  it s in places where we have solution strength that delivers value for clients  So if you are a small commerce merchant or a very large e commerce merchant  and I think we indicated we signed roughly 80 new e commerce logos during the year  Some of those are smaller and some of them are very important household names that we re all familiar with and so and so what we re seeing is more consistency around that decision making is being made in the market  So really looking for quality more than any segment will accept something that isn t quality  So from that perspective  whether it be a solution like the CheckFree RXP or Dovetail or our ISV solution or e commerce solution or Clover you re seeing  you re seeing choices being made based on the quality of the solution As it relates to kind of deeper into the segments  I would say I feel right now across the enterprise that we re doing well  gaining share in the places that matter to us strategically and that we re well positioned to continue to do that  especially as we bring things together  Probably the most important trend that we re seeing is if you think about the below the top 60 or 70 banks  you re just continuing to see more move toward outsourcing  right  We have fantastic capabilities as an outsourcer that got even better through our combination with First Data  And so we re seeing more and more capability In fact  some of the more interesting opportunities that we have synergistically are in fact bringing things together with solutions that the original Fiserv had that we didn t offer on a hosted or ASP basis Jeff Cantwell    Guggenheim Securities LLC    AnalystAnd then I think you said in your prepared remarks that you re growing by 25  in integrated  if I heard that correctly  which certainly sounds strong  So could you talk to us a little bit more about that  maybe tell us what s driving that and also about the    maybe a little bit about the go forward picture for yourselves and integrated  I m just curious as to whether there s any specific verticals  for example  where you re seeing the strongest momentum and how sustainable you feel that growth is overall Jeffery W  Yabuki    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSure  So  Jeff  let me quickly give you the data and then I think Frank can add a little bit more color on that  In the ISV and integrated payment space  I think we said  we increased the number of ISV merchants by 25  and transaction growth was    sorry  revenue growth was up 60   right  So  a very strong year in that space  We continue to make it a priority  kind of taking on the way First Data that Frank and his team had done  We see lots of opportunity to grow  But let me have Frank give a little bit more color on that Frank J  Bisignano    President and Chief Operating OfficerYeah  In ISV  it s a very  as Jeff said in the earlier point  it s a very technical product  It is not a vertical attempt here  There is not a look at one single vertical  It s really across    and it s really the technology solution  So I feel very comfortable that our solution plays in all spaces and we are winning across all spaces from car washes to retailers of different sizes and shapes  So it s not a vertical specific capability OperatorBryan Keane from Deutsche Bank  Your line is open Bryan Keane    Deutsche Bank AG    AnalystI wanted to ask about the Fiserv stand alone  I know Fiserv started the year guiding to 4 5  to 5  internal revenue growth  but there s been some moving pieces with divestitures and obviously acquisitions came in  So just hoping to get a report card on how Fiserv stand alone did versus original expectations Jeffery W  Yabuki    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  Thanks  Bryan  I would say that on balance  it was probably slightly lower than we would have anticipated at the beginning of the year  The comparables are a little bit more difficult because upon the combination  we made some changes that had an impact to some of the revenue recognition and therefore some of the growth  So we had some impact there  but I would say  on balance  slightly less than we would have expected I would also say that when we closed in July  we ve made a series of decisions around allocating resources to places that we didn t have in our sights originally  And so from our perspective  we thought it was most important to make sure that we were getting the integration right  that we are focused on laying the track for synergies  both on the cost and on the revenue side  and then third  just making sure that we re continuing to invest and have these capabilities ready to drive more growth this year  which we think they will Bryan Keane    Deutsche Bank AG    AnalystGot it  got it  Helpful  And then wanted to ask on the adjusted operating margin expansion of at least 250 basis points  How much of that is from the core companies versus the synergies  Is there a way to break that out Jeffery W  Yabuki    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI will also tell you that embedded in that are investments that we are making that are required to drive revenue synergies that are kind of consuming some of the gains in margin  So that  300 million is not a net number of all of the investments we have to make up  But again  to get to your exact question  a large part of that would be coming from the synergies but we  as a normal entity  would continue to do the things that we would do to drive margin  if you think about our original Fiserv greater than 50 basis points per year Bryan Keane    Deutsche Bank AG    AnalystRight  right  And just to be clear  the  300 million in cost synergies  is that up from previous expectations Jeffery W  Yabuki    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWe have never guided in any year  We ve said we expected to do  900 million over five years  And so we did  46 million    I think we did  46 million in the first five months that we were a combined company  We ve said in our prepared remarks  we ll do at least  300 million this year  and after 17 months we ll be roughly at least  346 million OperatorJason Kupferberg  your line is open  with Bank of America Jason Kupferberg    BofA Securities  Inc     AnalystJust wanted to follow up on I think it was Darrin s question earlier  just on the outlook for the 2020 organic  I think last quarter you had said at least 7   Now we re refining it maybe around the edges a little bit and I guess 6  is in the equation here  Just any particular reason why 6  is part of the guidance  Because it kind of sounds like you re thinking at the high end  the 8   is a lot more likely than the low end at 6  but just wanted to understand the nuance there in terms of how the commentary evolved incrementally from last quarter Jeffery W  Yabuki    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI would say  and we ve tried to make this point clear in the prepared remarks that nothing has changed from our preliminary view that we gave in Q3  We continue to be confident in the numbers that we provided  we do believe it s prudent to have a range that is that encompasses kind of 2 percentage points and therefore we thought 6  to 8  made sense  The center point is not accidentally 7   And so we feel good about where we are  And 7  is a very healthy gain over where we ended this year  and we feel like we    if we execute well  and we believe we will  that we will not only increase our internal revenue growth rate this year  But we will be well positioned jumping off into 2021 given our commentary about how synergies will lay in and stronger performance in the second half of the year Jason Kupferberg    BofA Securities  Inc     AnalystOkay  No  that s very helpful  Just a quick follow up  Digital distribution initiatives for Clover  any metrics you might be able to share there in terms of the percent of new activations that are may be coming through digital channels now versus through physical bank branches  how that mix is kind of evolving  I know that was a big focus for First Data heading into the merger Jeffery W  Yabuki    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  I would say we still are very bullish on digital distribution as an opportunity for us and we actually think that opportunity grew in the combination of Fiserv and First Data because of the fact that we now have not only more digital distribution points through the cash management and retail digital capabilities of the banks and credit unions that we will sign up and the ability to be more targeted on the data that we would use So we continue to believe that all makes sense  However  I would say that as we sit here today  the results of digital are quite low  probably immeasurable relative to the successes that we have had in other parts of the business  And so we will continue to grow that  and the results at least for the next couple of years are not contingent on us dramatically increasing digital distribution  We see that to be a journey  We re early in the journey  and we ll continue to work it and knock it down OperatorAndrew Jeffrey from Suntrust  your line is open Andrew Jeffrey    Suntrust Robinson Humphrey  Inc     AnalystJeff  a lot of good stuff in terms of where you re investing in and where you think the sweet spot is and I just wondered if I could get your perspective on sort of the competitive environment  There are a few things I think that have emerged of late  Temenos launched a new solution for neobank  a SaaS based solution  We saw the Worldline Ingenico deal yesterday  We saw BigCommerce tap Barclaycard for payments  also the rest of world developments for the most part  should  may be coming us domestic  I just wonder you kind of kicked off this consolidation trend and now it seems like there are some new entrants  Can you just frame up your strengths and investment priorities against the competitive backdrop Jeffery W  Yabuki    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI m not sure we can take credit for kicking off this entire trend  but I do think we can take credit   Andrew Jeffrey    Suntrust Robinson Humphrey  Inc     AnalystYou were first  so Jeffery W  Yabuki    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWell  thank you  But I do think we can take credit for understanding between Frank and me and the rest of our team that the world was changing and that we felt like getting on the train early would be good for us  good for our clients  and obviously good for our shareholders  And so  the things that are happening right now are generally consistent with what we would have expected in terms of the overall transformation When we think about this transformation that s going on  we see some things happening around the fringes  we see people coming together to create more    in some cases  more capacity to invest  in some cases more unique partnerships  all of that recognizing the change that s going on  And it s part of why we earmarked  500 million in incremental innovation to make sure that not only could we generate a significant amount of free cash flow so that we could allocate that to acquisitions and other inorganic uses of capital  but that we would be very focused on investing  while we are restructuring and reshaping the company for the future So we actually take a fair amount of comfort in the things that are going on in the market  because they do confirm for us that the world is changing  And I think you will see us look for our inherent competitive advantages  So we think we have a treasure trove of data  And so whether it s around fraud or better authorization rates or better ability to know your customer  better ability to make decisions on the basis of transactional data  we think that s quite important  investing in and advancing our e commerce capabilities  whether it is some of the voice that we talked about today  but really leveraging the unique strengths that we have because we have the ability to take advantage of the platforms that we re operating today and making them better  So whether it is moving to the cloud or using AI and RPA as ways to get there faster  we have all of that capability  We re quite excited to do it  And I think we ll be able to share some of that in March  but I do think we re going to continue to see announcements that talk to the fact that the world is changing  and it s incumbent upon us to make sure we re staying in front of that change  but really focused on the areas where we have strong competitive positions  and that will make us stronger OperatorGeorge Mihalos from Cowen  your line is open George Mihalos    Cowen and Company LLC    AnalystJust had a follow up question as it relates to the ISV channel and all the progress you re making there  Appreciate the commentary on the revenue growth being up I think 60  you said  But can you actually size that business for us in terms of revenue dollars  I think the last time that First Data did that was back in 2018 when I think it was around  50 million or so Frank J  Bisignano    President and Chief Operating OfficerYeah  I would say  George  that compared to the  14 5 billion or so of revenue that we have  it s certainly a small    it s certainly on a relatively small base  But that relatively small base is growing quite comfortably  and we re excited about that  And we re also excited about using some of the differentiated    sorry  the competitively differentiated services that they have across other parts of the ecosystem  So it s  again  a relatively small base but growing in a very  very nice clip Jeffery W  Yabuki    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAnd as you know  the space on balance  relative to merchant acquiring globally  is still quite small George Mihalos    Cowen and Company LLC    AnalystYeah  Appreciate that  And then just a quick follow up  a housekeeping item for Bob  The nickel of dilution from the Investment Services  majority sale that is net of the  500 million being redeployed in buyback  right Robert  Bob  Hau    Chief Financial Officer and TreasurerYes  that s correct  But more importantly  that s actually an aggregation of four divestitures in total  So Investm ent Services being part of that  but yes  the capital redeployment is included in that calculation OperatorAnd Chris Shutler with William Blair  your line is open Chris Shutler    William Blair   Company  LLC    AnalystJust one quick one  Really good sales numbers again  That 10  for the year  would you confirm that that is a annual contract value  not TCV  And if so  could you give us the comparable numbers for the last couple of years  I think you previously reported it on a TCV basis Jeffery W  Yabuki    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah  You re right  Chris  We have changed our methodology to align with how First Data had talked about and reported sales  And so    but we have not talked about the quantum  We ve always only talked about percent growth  But I would say that that percent growth is obviously up 10  for the year  but importantly  up 30  over the last six months OperatorKartik Mehta from Northcoast Research  your line is open Kartik Mehta    Northcoast Research Partners LLC    AnalystJeff  I wanted to just ask a little bit about First Data SMB portfolio  especially in the US  I know  Frank  in the past you ve talked about attrition or retention rate of that portfolio  And I m just wondering where it stands today and just your opportunity to maybe improve the yield in that portfolio Frank J  Bisignano    President and Chief Operating OfficerYeah  as you probably remember the long journey that we took  But today  we re in a much different place than when we started on the journey  I think we talk about being a gainer of share and growing our portfolio here  and I think when you look at what attrition rates have done versus when we first started on it  they re practically in half  So we are a much different portfolio than when I talked to you years ago  And I think you see it in the growth in the merchant numbers that we have in total Jeffery W  Yabuki    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAnd I think  Kartik  one of the things that s interesting when you dig in and look at the data is you    not only is Clover really an attractive vehicle in the acquiring market  but the fact is that we see better retention  And the beauty there is it s a platform  right  So we have add on services that we talk about  so better retention  more services  happier clients  So it really is both sides and it s one of the things that the First Data team    the original First Data team had done quite well Kartik Mehta    Northcoast Research Partners LLC    AnalystAnd then just one last one  Jeff  Just as far as use of capital is concerned  I know you said you re going back to buying back shares  I m wondering what your thoughts are on repaying debt in 2020 or maybe if you have a goal or something in mind for the debt for the company as we end this year Jeffery W  Yabuki    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo  Kartik  I would say that we ve been very consistent since the time we announced that we were going into this transformative combination that we would repay debt and grow EBITDA at a healthy clip to get our to debt to EBITDA ratio down to our historic levels  And I think we said we would do that over an 18  to 24 month period  We ended the year at 3 8 times  Bob paid down  600 million of debt in the fourth quarter  And so we ll continue to move down that path  The good news is  is we were able to move back to our programmatic buying at the very beginning of the fourth quarter  And so we think we have the firepower to do both and certainly we ll meet our commitments to the agencies OperatorNext we have Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson  Your line is open Lisa Ellis    MoffettNathanson LLC    AnalystI think you mentioned that you ve signed 80 new direct to merchant e com wins for the year and 23 in the fourth quarter alone  This isn t a metric that First Data historically reported  So is this kind of growth a change from the historic win rates on direct to merchant e com  And if so  I assume it is  what are you doing differently and do you    are you executing against a specific strategy to diversify away from processing for payfacs and going more direct to merchant in that business Jeffery W  Yabuki    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI would say that while we have not shared that metric previously  as you know well  we think it s important that people understand that not only do we have strength through our very important joint venture partners  but that on a direct basis  we are able to win business worldwide  And we think the fact that we won 80 logos for the year and this is 80 new logos to the firm  which I think is quite important  again  24 in Q4  a range    granted a range of size of merchants  but some very important names So from that perspective  I would say it s a continuation of the strategy that Frank and his team started  but we have been putting more    and what I mean me  I mean the collective company  just putting more focus and energy  A part of it is having a stronger technology platform  part of it is more focused on innovation  part of it is more sales focus  part of it is better service through existing clients  And so  it s the entire gamut that Frank and the team started  We re continuing to make it a high priority  As you and I ve discussed  e commerce and technology based acquiring on balance is a very high priority for the company  just like SMB is and everything else  but obviously this space is important  And being a consistent share gainer is our absolute objective Lisa Ellis    MoffettNathanson LLC    AnalystAnd then maybe my quick follow up  On the issuer processing businesses  realizing there is still sort of split in the current reporting across a couple different segments  Can you just provide a little bit of color on how the combined issuer processing businesses are doing  And specifically  combined revenue growth trajectory and how you re tracking so far on these synergies that you ve been expecting across those two businesses as well  both domestically and internationally Jeffery W  Yabuki    Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo  Lisa  I would say that it probably will make more sense to cover this in depth    in a little bit more depth in March  but at a high level  we are not    we have not combined our respective original issuer processing businesses  They run different platforms  They re different value propositions  We are looking to combined capabilities and move them more ubiquitously across platforms where it makes sense  We re looking to make sure that we have the right clients on the right platforms where it makes sense  And so we like the fact that we now  both sides of the original organizations  have more tools in the tool chest to go out and serve clients and win business I would say that on the traditional  the original First Data issuer processing business  specifically on the credit side  we re seeing some really interesting opportunities in the market  It s one of the places that that you will see us invest kind of thinking about more as next gen capabilities there  So very important specifically on the credit side  And also we re seeing a better than anticipated responsiveness in the Fiserv original clients both domestically and internationally in providing those kinds of capabilities  whether they be more integrated into the core systems in the US but outside the US sold into our larger Signature or other relationships  We re seeing that to be a little bit better than we would have expected at this point And thanks everyone for joining us this afternoon  We appreciate your support  We re excited for the future  If you have additional questions  please don t hesitate to contact our Investor Relations team  Have a great evening Operator Operator Closing Remarks Duration  76 minutesCall participants Peter Poillon    Senior Vice President  Investor RelationsJeffery W  Yabuki    Chairman and

149649,371165,FISV,Fintech s Consolidation Creates Investment Opportunities,opinion,"The Fintech   digital payment segment has been saturating and consolidating in recent years  M A activity in this space peaked in 2019 with over  195 billion in deals  more than 3 times the value of the prior year  according to WSJ article 
New Fintech startups are entering this attractive space seemingly every day  and the best capitalized Fintech giants have there pick of the liter  Below I will discuss the segments biggest M A deals over the last year and which deals still have synergies to be priced in 
Fiserv  NASDAQ FISV   FISV 
Fiserv acquired First Data for  22 billion last year  closing the deal at the end of July  First Data is the largest merchant service company in the world  handling payment processing for leading enterprises such as Starbucks  NASDAQ SBUX  prepaid gift card processing 
This acquisition creates some short term risk with integration costs and added debt from the deal 
FISV controls the market for banking software and solutions with a 40  share  The acquisition of First Data should progressively create substantial cost and revenue synergies that thrust this company into strong profitability 
These shares have grown 43  over the last 52 weeks as the implications of this merger begin to be priced in  The company hopes to achieve  500 million in revenue and  900 million in cost synergies once these businesses are fully integrated 

FISV is trading at the upper end of it forward P E multiple  but the valuation is not outrageous  I think these shares are fairly valued at the moment  but this stock would not make a bad long term play for your financial portfolio allocation  
FIS  FIS 
FIS closed a  43 billion deal for Worldpay at the end of July 2019  One of the world s largest ecommmerce and payment tech companies  This combined firm will have over  12 billion in annual revenue and a  best in class  portfolio of digital payment solutions for merchants  banks  capital markets 
FIS also just took a majority stake in Virtus Partners  which provides services and technologies to alternative asset managers throughout the lifecycle of an investment 
Financial improvements are already being realized with revenue synergies of more than  30 million and cost improvements of  200 million on an annualized run rate basis 
This fast integration with quickly realized synergies makes me believe that there could be a more significant upside to these shares moving forward 
Visa  V 
Just announced its  5 3 billion acquisition of Plaid in January  Plaid helps to connect financial accounts to applications that manage your finances  such as Acorn and Venmo  75  of the internet utilizing world uses some sort of Fintech application for money transfers and management  up from 18  in 2015  according to Visa press release 
 Today  one in four people with a U S  bank account have used Plaid to connect to more than 2 600 fintech developers across more than 11 000 financial institutions   according to the press release 
Visa is the largest US card payment and processing enterprise and the second largest in the world  behind China UnionPay 
V has driven over 42  share price growth over the last 52 weeks  more than double the broader market s returns  The stock is also trading at one of its highest forward P E multiples since the company went public in 2008  22 out of 24 analysts are calling V a buy right now  but I am hesitant to pull the trigger on due to its valuation run up  I believe that these shares are fairly valued at the moment 

None the less  I am confident that Visa is well positioned to be a leader in Fintech in the future and these shares still have long term upward potential 
Banks
Banks still run the financial world  and they have been internally investing in the future of technology  Bank of America  BAC  has released a virtual financial assistant  aka AI technology  called Erica that can help manage your money  BAC hopes that  Erica  will be the  Alexa  of the financial universe 
The banking world is already being forced to partner with Fintech and digital payment companies  I expect this trend only to increase as the world progressively digitalizes  
Take Away 
The Fintech space is heating up as this maturing industry begins to consolidate  Scale and diversification will be crucial for the companies that maintain their leadership positions in the industry  The players that I discussed above will continue to grow organically and through acquisitions  I would consider all of these suitable long term investments for your portfolio s Fintech allocation

149665,371181,FISV,Fiserv  FISV  Is A Great Momentum Stock  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock s recent trend in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will be essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   With this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving that way  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic  it can be tough to define  Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy  but the Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us

Set to Beat the Market 
Let s discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for FISV that show why this financial services technology company shows promise as a solid momentum pick 
A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short term price activity  as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand  It s also helpful to compare a security to its industry  this can show investors the best companies in a particular area 
For FISV  shares are up 2 04  over the past week while the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry is up 0 81  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 4 41  compares favorably with the industry s 0 51  performance as well 
While any stock can see a spike in price  it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market  Shares of Fiserv have increased 10 2  over the past quarter  and have gained 50 51  in the last year  In comparison  the S P 500 has only moved 6 1  and 18 87   respectively 
Investors should also pay attention to FISV s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  FISV is currently averaging 2 807 162 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things  including estimate revisions and a stock s price movement  Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank  and a nice path here can be promising  We have recently been noticing this with FISV

Xoom yesterday announced the roll out of a service for customers to send money to recipients in the United States for the first time  Xoom will partner with Walmart  NYSE WMT  and Ria Money Transfer to enable customers to use its transfer services to send money fast for cash pick up typically in minutes at nearly 5 000 locations across the country   
The operations of Xoom in U S  remittance market will pressurize MoneyGram s revenues from its U S  operations  which declined 1 4  and 13  in 2017 and 2018  respectively 
This decline adversely impacted the company s overall revenues  Further  increasing compliance costs and expenses undertaken to improve operating efficiency weighed on the company s margins  MoneyGram s results reflected its weak performance  missing estimates in four out of the last eight reported quarters 
Notably  share price has fallen 76  over the past two years compared with the  s decline of 12   Other companies in the same space  such as The Western Union Company   NYSE WU    PayPal Holdings  Inc    NASDAQ PYPL   and Fiserv  Inc    NASDAQ FISV    have gained 35 6   37  and 71   respectively  during the same time frame 

 
MoneyGram  which is already reeling under weakness within its domestic money transfer business  is also facing stiff competition from digital native companies such as TransferWise  Azimo  Remitly and WorldRemit  Xoom uses its online and mobile platform for money transfer  which makes its services more cost effective and efficient  
MoneyGram has to pay a commission to brick and mortar agents that originate the transfers  Xoom  however  steers clear of the same  because of its use of digital channels  thus saving a chunk of operating cost  which enables it to enjoy operating margins 
In addition to the changes in the competitive environment  MoneyGram s global compliance requirements are becoming increasingly more complex  which has been affecting its top line growth and profit margin 
Over the past two years  MoneyGram s market capitalization has eroded by 72  
Nevertheless  the company has taken a number of steps ranging from cost savings  investment in digital platform  adherence to compliance  and building partnerships to improve its performance 
Investment in innovative products and services  such as moneygram com  mobile solutions including mobile application  integration with mobile wallets  account deposit services and kiosk based services  has led to an increase in revenues from its digital channel in the recent quarters 
Furthermore  MoneyGram has partnered with Visa  NYSE V  for its Visa Direct services  which provide consumers with additional choices on how to receive funds   The company has also collaborated with Ripple to utilize its Ripple s On Demand Liquidity blockchain product  as well as XRP  Ripple s cryptocurrency  to facilitate cross border foreign currency exchange settlement  The company expects that this partnership will reduce its working capital needs and generate additional earnings and cash flows 
Through the remainder of 2019 and into 2020  the remittance industry will continue to see a number of trends including the growth of digital transactions  aggressive pricing strategies  the importance of customer experience and geopolitical volatility  Management expects pricing pressure and competition to be continuous challenges  Currency volatility  liquidity pressure on central banks and pressure on labor markets in specific countries may also continue to impact MoneyGram s business 
MoneyGram carries a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current year earnings has been revised 44  downward over the past 30 days

149811,371327,FISV,Why Fiserv  FISV  Is Poised To Beat Earnings Estimates Again,opinion,"Looking for a stock that has been consistently beating earnings estimates and might be well positioned to keep the streak alive in its next quarterly report  Fiserv  NASDAQ FISV   which belongs to the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry  could be a great candidate to consider 
This financial services technology company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates  especially when looking at the previous two reports  The average surprise for the last two quarters was 2 47  
For the most recent quarter  Fiserv was expected to post earnings of  0 80 per share  but it reported  0 82 per share instead  representing a surprise of 2 50   For the previous quarter  the consensus estimate was  0 82 per share  while it actually produced  0 84 per share  a surprise of 2 44  
Price and EPS Surprise

For Fiserv  estimates have been trending higher  thanks in part to this earnings surprise history  And when you look at the stock s positive Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction   it s a great indicator of a future earnings beat  especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank 
Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  In other words  if you have 10 stocks with this combination  the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Fiserv currently has an Earnings ESP of  3 68   which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock s Zacks Rank  3  Hold  indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner 
With the Earnings ESP metric  it s important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power  however  a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss 
Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate  though this is not the only reason why their shares gain  Additionally  some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate 
Because of this  it s really important to check a company s Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported ",2019-10-07,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-fiserv-fisv-is-poised-to-beat-earnings-estimates-again-200471540,200471540

The joint company creates a situation where the two firms can sell their core services to each other s clients  The beefed up Fiserv is now better prepared to take on the likes of Square  NYSE SQ   SQ  and other fintech standouts such as PayPal  PYPL   Fiserv s cloud based point of sale solution  called Clover  already competes directly with Square 
Fiserv now serves  thousands of financial institutions and millions of merchants and businesses in more than 100 countries   The company also plans to invest  500 million over the next five years to ramp up and help expand in a financial environment that increasingly includes less cash and far more digital and electronic payments   
 
 
 
 
More Fundamentals 
As we mentioned at the outset  FISV stock has been on a strong run recently  Shares of FISV have soared 215  over the last five years  against its industry s 78  average climb and the S P 500 s 52  jump 
Over the last 12 months  shares of Fiserv are up 26   This compares favorably to its sub industry s  Financial Transaction Services Market which includes Western Union  WU  and Total System Services  NYSE TSS   TSS  18  climb and blows SQ s 35  downturn out of the water  Year to date  Fiserv stock is up 40  and currently rests at around  103 per share  which falls not too far short of its recent 52 week and all time highs 
Fiserv s valuation picture also hardly appears that stretched at the moment  In fact  it looks relatively impressive given its stellar run  Shares of FISV have traded as high as 28 2X forward 12 month Zacks Consensus earnings estimates over the past five years  well above its current 22 9X 
FISV s forward P E hovers right near its five year median of 22 2X  On top of that  the financial services firm is trading a discount against its industry s 26 9X average 
Furthermore  Fiserv s forward price sales ratio of 2 6 rests at its lowest point in five years  FISV has traded as high as 6 5 during this stretch  with a 4 2 median  which marks a huge discount against its industry s 8 5 
Investors should note that the company s price sales ratio came down substantially after it completed its Frist Data deal  However  this means that FISV stock could have plenty of room to run since investors were willing to pay 6 5X forward sales before the deal went through  which is now six weeks old at this point 
 
 
 
 
Q3 Outlook   Beyond 
Moving on  our Zacks Consensus Estimates call for the firm s Q3 fiscal 2019 revenue to skyrocket 168  from  1 41 billion in the year ago period to  3 79 billion  Clearly  this estimate includes the projected positive impact of First Data s inclusion  which is then expected to boost total full year revenue by 130  to  13 35 billion Peeking ahead to fiscal 2020  when roughly half of the year will include merger comparable numbers  the company s sales are projected to climb 26  above our 2019 estimate to hit  16 85 billion 
Fiserv s adjusted third quarter earnings are expected to climb 23 6  higher to hit  0 93 per share  with Q4 s EPS figure projected to come in roughly 37  above Q4 2018  Overall  FISV s fiscal 2019 earnings are projected to jump 21 4   Then  the company s 2020 earnings are expected to soar nearly 30  above our 2019 estimate 
 
 
 
 
Bottom Line
Above  investors can see just how much Fiserv s overall earnings estimates climbed following the merger  which is not always the case  Fiserv s positive earnings estimate revision activity also helps the stock hold a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  at the moment  And the joint company is more prepared and well equipped to expand and adapt in quickly changing financial tech environment

149887,371403,FISV,Are You Looking For A Top Momentum Pick  Why Fiserv  FISV  Is A Great Choice,opinion,"Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock s recent trend in either direction  In the  long  context  investors will be essentially be  buying high  but hoping to sell even higher   With this methodology  taking advantage of trends in a stock s price is key  once a stock establishes a course  it is more than likely to continue moving that way  The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path  it will lead to timely and profitable trades 
Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic  it can be tough to define  Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy  but the Zacks Momentum Style Score  part of the Zacks Style Scores  helps address this issue for us 
Below  we take a look at Fiserv  NASDAQ FISV   a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B  We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions  two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score 
It s also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank  our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance  Fiserv currently has a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy   Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and  2  Buy  and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one month period

Set to Beat the Market 
In order to see if FISV is a promising momentum pick  let s examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this financial services technology company holds up 
A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short term price activity  as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand  It is also useful to compare a security to its industry  as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area 
For FISV  shares are up 2 16  over the past week while the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry is up 1 85  over the same time period  Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too  as the monthly price change of 1 26  compares favorably with the industry s 0 75  performance as well 
While any stock can see its price increase  it takes a real winner to consistently beat the market  That is why looking at longer term price metrics    such as performance over the past three months or year    can be useful as well  Shares of Fiserv have increased 18 4  over the past quarter  and have gained 33 35  in the last year  On the other hand  the S P 500 has only moved 5 35  and 3 45   respectively 
Investors should also take note of FISV s average 20 day trading volume  Volume is a useful item in many ways  and the 20 day average establishes a good price to volume baseline  a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign  whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish  Right now  FISV is averaging 3 905 605 shares for the last 20 days 
Earnings Outlook
The Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions  in addition to price changes  Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well  A nice path here can help show promise  and we have recently been seeing that with FISV 
Over the past two months  7 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 2 lower for the full year  These revisions helped boost FISV s consensus estimate  increasing from  3 54 to  3 76 in the past 60 days  Looking at the next fiscal year  7 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 2 downward revisions in the same time period 
Bottom Line

The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on July 25  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This financial services technology company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 80 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  6 7  
Revenues are expected to be  1 51 billion  up 6 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0 12  higher over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period

Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Fiserv 
For Fiserv  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 79  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Fiserv will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Fiserv would post earnings of  0 82 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 84  delivering a surprise of  2 44  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Fiserv appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-17,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/fiserv-fisv-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200441470,200441470

Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Fiserv would post earnings of  0 84 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 84  delivering no surprise 
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Fiserv doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-22,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/fiserv-fisv-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release-200409499,200409499

The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system  The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits 
Cardtronics has a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy   while Fiserv has a Zacks Rank of  3  Hold  right now  Investors should feel comfortable knowing that CATM likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than FISV has recently  But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in 
Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels

The deal is at a premium of 29  over First Data s closing price on Tuesday  It is expected to close during the second half of 2019  Fiserv shareholders will own 57 5  of the combined company and First Data shareholders will own the rest 
First Data s shares closed 21 1  higher at  21 24 on Wednesday  while Fiserv s fell 3 3 percent

Fiserv  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise
   Fiserv and First Data are targeting the development of complementary technology capabilities and solutions to enhance client value as well as increase market differentiation  The combined company plans a  500 million incremental investment to enhance solutions over five years 
Also  the acquisition seems to be part of Fiserv s increased push to fend off growing competition from the likes of Fidelity National Information Services  Square  NYSE SQ   and Adyen NV 
The transaction is anticipated to be accretive to Fiserv s adjusted EPS by more than 20  in the first full year following the close and generate free cash flow of more than  4 billion in the third year following the close

150071,371587,FISV,Fiserv  FISV  Reports Next Week  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Fiserv  NASDAQ FISV  reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 7  2019  might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This financial services technology company is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 84 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  18 3  
Revenues are expected to be  1 55 billion  up 2 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1 78  lower over the last 30 days to the current level  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Fiserv 
For Fiserv  the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company s earnings prospects  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of  0 03  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination indicates that Fiserv will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Fiserv would post earnings of  0 77 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 75  delivering a surprise of  2 60  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Fiserv appears a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-30,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/fiserv-fisv-reports-next-week-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200381970,200381970

The company has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and an  of 0 00   a combination that makes surprise prediction difficult  This is because  per our proven model  a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3 to beat estimates  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our 
We don t recommend Sell rated stocks  Zacks Rank  4 or  5  going into the earnings announcement 
MobileIron s surprise history has been quite impressive as the company beat estimates in two of the last four quarters and matched estimates on one occasion  Year to date  the stock has outperformed the Zacks  industry  It has gained 18 7  compared with the industry s gain of 6 3  
Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement
What Happened in the Fourth Quarter 
Although MobileIron posted a loss in terms of the bottom line  the fourth quarter was the strongest ever in the company s history  Loss  including stock based compensation  of 12 cents per share for fourth quarter 2016 was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 cents 
Total revenue of  45 5 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a small margin  Revenues increased 5 6  year over year 
What We Are Watching 
MobileIron s innovation and business strategy are currently yielding better results  Its business is gaining strength both from new as well as existing customers  At the fourth quarter call  management stated that the company s customer satisfaction scores and customer engagement scores were trending up 
Given the fact that mobile threats are on the rise  MobileIron s Enterprise Mobile Management  EMM  platforms that enable a company to detect whether a device or an app is being compromised and enables them to take the required corrective action bodes well 
Also  MobileIron Access  the facilitator between the mobile app and cloud service s could see greater adoption  given the growing demand for cloud  Further  we believe that strong renewal rates in the Software Support and Services segment augur well 
MobileIron  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise
   For the first quarter  management expects first quarter 2017 revenues to remain in the range of  41 million to  43 million  Gross billings are projected in the range of  44 million to  46 million  registering growth of 16  to 21  on a year over year basis

The fund is heavy on Internet Software   Services  19 43   and Internet Retail  14 36    Apparel  Accessories   Luxury  9 32   and Residential REITs  9 12   take the next two spots  The fund is multi cap in nature  with a tilt toward larger capitalization 
Inside GENY
The passively managed fund looks to trackthe NASDAQ Global Millennial Opportunity Index   This is a NASDAQ licensed index based on principal s intellectual property  IP  
Given its millennial based investment objective  stocks in the field of   technology  healthy lifestyles and leisure get prominence in the fund  GENY charges 45 bps in fees  It holds 126 stocks in total with Nvidia Corp  2 65    Tencent Holdings Ltd  2 57   and Electronic Arts Inc  NASDAQ EA   2 49   taking the top three spots  read      
The fund invests about half of its basket in the consumer services sector followed by consumer goods  22   and technology  17 9    The index is all cap in nature  Within a few days of its launch  the fund has managed to gather about  5 1 million in assets 
Bottom Line
While MILN is likely to enjoy the first mover advantage in the longer run because of its early entry to this arena  GENY may relish the advantage of a lower expense ratio  This is because MILN charges 68 bps in fees  which is higher than GENY 
Plus  MILN is more focused on U S  stocks while GENY has some foreign exposure since it follows a   GENY bears less company concentration risks than MILN 
As far as broad based competition goes  the duo does face any as such  Still since millennials have a tendency of splurging on tech savvy products and eating out  several tech or consumer discretionary ETFs can give MILN and GENY some competition

posted non GAAP earnings  excluding discontinued operations and one time items  of  1 53 per share  which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  1 48 DST Systems  non GAAP earnings also registered a year over year increase of 15   mainly driven by higher revenues and lower share count Despite robust bottom line results  shares of DST Systems plunged nearly 13  yesterday as its revenues fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate Quarter DetailsTotal revenue in the third quarter came in at  386 7 million  up 4 1  from the year ago quarter  However  excluding out of the pocket reimbursements  consolidated operating revenues increased just 3 4  year over year to  365 5 million  lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  384 million Financial Services operating revenues  excluding out of the pocket reimbursements  increased 0 9  year over year to  270 2 million  primarily due to businesses acquired during 2015 and 2016  and incremental revenues generated due to conversion of 10 million subaccounts associated with the previously announced new client contract  These benefits were partially offset by a fall in mutual fund registered shareowner account processing revenues and unfavourable foreign currency exchange rates Healthcare Services operating revenues were up 12 9  on a year over year basis and came in at  106 1 million  primarily due to expansion in high value services for medical and pharmacy businesses  new medical claims and organic growth Cost and expenses were up 0 8  from the year ago quarter to  312 4 million  However  as a percentage of revenues  costs and expenses were down 260 basis points  bps  on a year over year basis due to better cost management Non GAAP operating income increased 20 9  year over year and came in at  78 2 million  Operating margin was also up 260 bps on a year over year basis to 18 4   The increase in operating income was primarily driven by cost cutting measures within the Financial Services segment DST reported non GAAP net income of  50 7 million compared with  48 0 million reported in the year ago quarter The company s balance sheet as of Sep 30  2016 looked very impressive as it has

150341,371857,FISV,Fiserv Inc  More Room For Growth Ahead,opinion,"Fiserv  NASDAQ FISV  expects at least 5  growth over  5 1 billion revenue it generated in 2014 
The management is looking for between 4  and 8  in annual growth of organic revenue 
Shift away from magnetic stripe cards likely to generate between  50 and  75 million in new revenue

Fiserv  Inc   FISV  styles itself a provider of financial services technology  and it enjoys a strong market position with 40  share of the market The company has a solid business model characterized by long term contracts  high recurring revenue  at about 85  to 90   and strong free cash flow 
Fiserv has realized significant benefits through discipline cost management  The acquisition of Open Source has also been a source of synergies for the company 
Fiserv s performance projections
Estimates for 2015 
The management of Fiserv predicts that 2015 organic revenue will increase by 5   coming at the lower end of the earlier estimate of growth in the range of 5  6   The reason for the estimate correction has much to do with adverse currency movements  The company generated revenue of  5 1 billion in 2014 
Operating margins are expected to rise by 50bps or higher in 2015  with free cash flow  CFC  expected to be  4 12 a share  Earnings per share are estimated to come in the range of  3 73  3 83  reflecting year over year growth of 11 14  
It is worth noting at this point that the company has posted annual EPS growth of 10  for a number of years 
Long term growth outlook 
Fiserv s management expects organic revenue to increase by 4 8   with annual margins expanding by 50bps 100bps over the next four years  EPS is predicted to grow by 11 18  and CFC per share is estimated to rise by 11  per year 
Backing the claims
As they say  talk is cheap  As such  the important question at this juncture is whether Fiserv  Inc   FISV  has anything to support its ambitious growth projections 
Growth highlights
The management anticipates between 50bps and 100bps annual growth of organic revenue over the next four years  That growth is expected to come from 4 5  year over year growth of the existing businesses  1 2  growth driven by enrichment of existing businesses and 1 2  growth courtesy of new businesses 
Operational efficiencies
While Fiserv hopes to drive revenue gain through existing businesses  value added existing solutions and brand new solutions  margin expansion is expected to come from operational efficiencies  among others 
The company expects to save  581 million through operational efficiencies by the end of 2015  An additional  250 million in cost synergies is expected from operational efficiencies between 2016 and 2020 
Some of the areas that the company has earmarked to drive efficiency include consolidation of datacenters  consolidation of offices and other real estate properties and improved productivity 
Capital allocation priority
The management of Fiserv  Inc   FISV  is committed to returning more cash to shareholders through share repurchases  In the company s capital allocation plan  shares repurchase ranks at the top of the priority list  Repurchasing shares has double benefits  First  more cash is returned to shareholders  Second  stock repurchase boosts EPS  given that it leads to a reduced number of shares outstanding 
The other areas that Fiserv has prioritized for capital allocation are acquisitions and repayment of debt  The company finished the first quarter of 2015 with  3 76 billion in long term debt 
Market share
Fiserv boasts about 40  share of the US market  International operations account for nearly 6  of the company s aggregate revenue The company anticipates that international operations could  in the next few years  account for nearly 1  of its incremental revenue 
Incremental growth catalysts
Fiserv is looking to a number of products to drive its growth over the years  Some of these products are existing solutions  expanded businesses and brand new ones  They include Mobiliti  Agiliti  NOW Network  DNA  EMV and Integrated Payments 
Mobiliti 
The Mobiliti business includes services such as P2P and check balance  among others  which financial institutions render to their clients  Fiserv expects to tap between  50 and  100 million in incremental revenue from Mobiliti solutions by 2019 

Source  Company Report
Agiliti  
Through Agiliti  a cloud based account processing platform  Fiserv  Inc   FISV  expects significant growth in the UK  where it is exposed to nearly 570 potential large clients  Incremental revenue from Agiliti is expected to be between  50 and  100 million 

Source  Company Report
DNA 
DNA is Fiserv s second highest source of revenue  About 500 clients have deployed DNA  a real time core accounts platform  The company got its hands on DNA through Open Source acquisition 
Fiserv has reported exciting win rates with DNA  In the credit union space  for example  the company has noted a 67  win rate  signing 42 credit unions  In the banking segment  the company reported a 60  win rate  signing 18 banks in competitive bids  Fiserv is expecting more DNA wins in the U S  and elsewhere 
The company expects to generate  50  75 million in incremental revenue from DNA by 2019  More cost synergies are also expected on that front 

Source  Company Report
EMV
Fiserv  Inc   FISV  expects to benefit as EMV chips replace magnetic stripes in cards because of the liability shift  The shift in ability is expected in October this year 
The company stands to benefit from the liability shift through its card processing and card production businesses  Producing EMV cards cost between  1 and  2 higher per card than magnetic stripe cards  More than 30  of transactions are expected to be EMV by 2019 
Over the next four years  Fiserv  Inc   FISV  expects incremental revenue from EMV to range from  50 to  75 million 

Source  Company Report
NOW Network 
This is a real time money remittance solution  The company expects to tap between  100 and  150 million in incremental revenue annually from the business

Integrated Payments 
This solution offers next generation payments solutions that are customer focused  The solution simplifies the payments process  thus encouraging the uptake of electric payments  Over the next four years  the company expects Integrated to drive between  50 and  100 million in incremental revenue annually 

Source  Company Report
Areas of concern
There are a few things that could impact Fiserv  Inc   FISV  s performance adversely and derail the forecasted long term growth 
Unpredictability of new businesses  The client and end user uptake of some of Fiserv s newer solutions is unpredictable  Slow adoption pace or a lack of interest could prove volatile to the company s new revenue growth strategy 
Acquisition integration risks  Fiserv uses M A to bolster its position  to either expand share of the market or supplement and complement its existing solutions  Integration of new properties comes with a fair share of risks  which could prove challenging for the company  However  it is worth noting at this juncture that Fiserv is a disciplined buyer  Additionally  the management of the company is experienced when it comes to acquisition integration 
Client consolidation  Consolidation of banks and financial institutions could put pressure on the company s revenue growth  However  it is also worth noting that even when clients consolidate  transaction accounts are hardly affected and Fiserv gains from account transactions 
Conclusion
With expanded existing solutions and brand new products  Fiserv  Inc   FISV  has more room for growth ahead  Revenue growth  continued cost controls and shares repurchase should result in significant EPS growth

150343,371859,FISV, 5 ETFs That Could Find A Home For PYPL,opinion,"Investors were treated to the news this month that PayPal Holdings Inc  NASDAQ PYPL  would be spun off from Ebay Inc  NASDAQ EBAY  to create a massive  45 billion stand alone company  The fervor surrounding the successful IPO  alongside a valuation surpassing its parent company  makes for an interesting investment case  While some may choose to own the stock directly  others may be seeking to integrate this theme in their portfolio through a diversified exchange traded fund 
As both a financial and technology leader  PayPal has revolutionized the way money flows back and forth from individual consumers and businesses  As a result  it s no surprise that this stock is a top holding in the newly released PureFunds ISE Mobile Payments ETF  IPAY  
IPAY tracks 30 companies engaged in mobile payment options in both digital and electronic formats  This index includes established credit card companies such as Visa Inc  NYSE V  alongside financial infrastructure names like Fiserv Inc  NASDAQ FISV   PYPL is a natural fit in this niche technology driven ETF and currently occupies 5 56  of the total portfolio 
The First Trust Dow Jones Internet Index Fund  NYSE FDN  is another fund designed to take advantage of top tier companies engaged in social media  search engine  and online commerce  EBAY represented a significant holding in FDN prior to the debut of PYPL  and as such  this new stock has managed to crack the top 10 holdings  PYPL makes up 3 40  of the FDN portfolio alongside momentum titans such as Amazon Inc  NASDAQ AMZN  and Facebook Inc  NASDAQ FB  

Another index that could ultimately land a large allocation to PYPL is the Guggenheim Spin Off ETF  NYSE CSD   This fund tracks a passive index of 40 U S  listed stocks  ADRs  and MLPs that have been spun off from a parent company  Paypal certainly meets the requirements to be included in this exchange traded fund and will likely be evaluated at a future rebalancing date  typically at the end of each quarter  
In addition  its worth noting that Van Eck just launched the Market Vectors Global Spin Off ETF  NYSE SPUN   which tracks a broader index of global developed stocks  This ETF would likely follow a similar path of evaluating PYPL for inclusion at its next rebalancing date 
The Ark Web X 0 ETF  ARKW  is another fund that could be a possible landing pad for PYPL as well  This actively managed ETF tracks approximately 40 50 stocks affiliated with e payments  cloud computing  big data  and other internet related businesses  Those investment parameters certainly seem to align with the core PayPal business model 
With ARKW  the manager has full discretion to add or remove any stocks within the portfolio according to their fundamental research  PYPL is not currently included in this mix  yet is likely being evaluated as a potential candidate in the future 
The Bottom Line
By choosing an exchange traded fund over a specific stock  you reap the benefits of sector or industry diversification to help mitigate specific business risks  That allows you to participate in the PayPal theme without betting on the performance of an individual company 
This stock will also likely make its way into traditional growth and broad market indices over time as their review and rebalancing schedules take effect  However  the broader the index  the less likely that a single component will have a significant impact on total return  That can be a good or bad thing depending on your views towards risk and reward

150344,371860,FISV,3 Ways To Get Into Fiserv,opinion,"Some of the best stocks seem to always prevent a good lower entry  or at least that is what many traders will tell you  Fiserv  NASDAQ FISV  is one of those stocks  This stock has been steadily moving higher for 4 and a half years  So what do you do if you want to get into this stock  Here are three ways to do it 
1  Forget about getting cute and just buy the stock  If you had bought that outrageous peak at 59 at the beginning of 2014 and suffered through a 10  drop you would be up 80  from that buy  Or the August 2015 peak over 90  you would be up 10   Or even that peak at 97 in November you would be up after suffering a better than 10  fall 
If you want to watch more closely though then lets study the price action a bit  Fiserv has been above the 20 day SMA for nearly the entire run higher  When it has broken down it has found support at the 200 day SMA and recovered quickly  This gives the other two trades 

2  Buy a 1 2 Put Spread  With the stock back at the 20 day SMA and momentum still not reversing to the upside  there may be more downside in store for Fiserv  By buying a May 100 95 Put Spread for about  1 55 you can capture a move lower  But you have laid out  1 55 in capital to do so  If it bounces then you will lose that money  So sell another lower Put  either the may 95 for about  1 10 or the June 95 for  1 55 and your cash outlay can be reduced to zero 
If the stock bounces then you use margin until the short put expires  but hey interest rates are zero right  If the stock does fall lower then you may be put the stock  With the 200 day SMA climbing it should be around 94 96 by May expiry  If that holds up as support again then you would be put the stock but with a  90 basis  Instant equity 
3  Buy the stock and add a collar  The third method is somewhere in the middle  By the stock and immediately protect it with the collar  A collar is buying a put for protection and then selling a covered call to lower the cash outlay  For Fiserv you can buy the stock for about  100 and add a May 100 Strike Put for  2 75  Selling a September 110 Covered Call for  1 75 cuts the cash outlay for the collar to  1 
If you limit your downside protect to 95  by selling the May 95 Put and making it a Put Spread collar  then you cut your cash outlay to zero  You are protected down to the 200 day SMA in may and still have about 10  upside without getting called away
